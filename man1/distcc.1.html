<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
distcc - distributed C/C++/ObjC compiler with distcc-pump
extensions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
distcc &lt;compiler&gt; [COMPILER OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc [COMPILER OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;compiler&gt; [COMPILER
OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc [DISTCC OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
distcc distributes compilation of C code across several
machines on a network. distcc should always generate the
same results as a local compile, it is simple to install and
<br>
use, and it is often much faster than a local compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version incorporates plain
distcc as well as an enhancement called pump mode or
distcc-pump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each job, distcc in plain
mode sends the complete preprocessed source code and
compiler arguments across the network from the client to a
compilation server. In pump mode, <br>
distcc sends the source code and recursively included header
files (excluding those from the default system header
directories), so that both preprocessing and compilation can
<br>
take place on the compilation servers. This speeds up the
delivery of compilations by up to an order of magnitude over
plain distcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation is driven by a
client machine, which is typically the developer&rsquo;s
workstation or laptop. The distcc client runs on this
machine, as does make, the preprocessor (if <br>
distcc&rsquo;s pump mode is not used), the linker, and other
stages of the build process. Any number of volunteer
machines act as compilation servers and help the client to
build the <br>
program, by running the distccd(1) daemon, C compiler and
assembler as required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc can run across either TCP
sockets (on port 3632 by default), or through a tunnel
command such as ssh(1). For TCP connections the volunteers
must run the distccd(1) daemon <br>
either directly or from inetd. For SSH connections distccd
must be installed but should not be listening for
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP connections should only be
used on secure networks because there is no user
authentication or protection of source or object code. SSH
connections are typically 25% slower <br>
because of processor overhead for encryption, although this
can vary greatly depending on CPUs, network and the program
being built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc is intended to be used
with GNU Make&rsquo;s -j option, which runs several compiler
processes concurrently. distcc spreads the jobs across both
local and remote CPUs. Because <br>
distcc is able to distribute most of the work across the
network, a higher concurrency level can be used than for
local builds. As a rule of thumb, the -j value should be set
to <br>
about twice the total number of available server CPUs but
subject to client limitations. This setting allows for
maximal interleaving of tasks being blocked waiting for disk
or <br>
network IO. Note that distcc can also work with other build
control tools, such as SCons, where similar concurrency
settings must be adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -j setting, especially for
large values of -j, must take into account the CPU load on
the client. Additional measures may be needed to curtail the
client load. For example, <br>
concurrent linking should be severely curtailed using
auxiliary locks. The effect of other build activity, such as
Java compilation when building mixed code, should be
consid&acirc; <br>
ered. The --localslots_cpp parameter is by default set to
16. This limits the number of concurrent processes that do
preprocessing in plain distcc (non-pump) mode. Therefore,
<br>
larger -j values than 16 may be used without overloading a
single-CPU client due to preprocessing. Such large values
may speed up parts of the build that do not involve C
compi&acirc; <br>
lations, but they may not be useful to distcc efficiency in
plain mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, using pump mode and
say 40 servers, a setting of -j80 or larger may be
appropriate even for single-CPU clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is strongly recommended that
you install the same compiler version on all machines
participating in a build. Incompatible compilers may cause
mysterious compile or link fail&acirc; <br>
ures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICKSTART <br>
1 For each machine, download distcc, unpack, and
install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 On each of the servers, run
distccd --daemon with --allow options to restrict
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Put the names of the servers
in your environment: <br>
$ export DISTCC_HOSTS=&rsquo;localhost red green
blue&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Build! <br>
$ make -j8 CC=distcc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICKSTART FOR DISTCC-PUMP MODE
<br>
Proceed as above, but in Step 3, specify that the remote
hosts are to carry the burden of preprocessing and that the
files sent over the network should be compressed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ export
DISTCC_HOSTS=&rsquo;--randomize localhost red,cpp,lzo
green,cpp,lzo blue,cpp,lzo&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --randomize option enforces
a uniform usage of compile servers. While you will get some
benefit from distcc&rsquo;s pump mode with only a few
servers, you get increasing benefit <br>
with more server CPUs (up to the hundreds!). Wrap your build
inside the pump command, here assuming 10 servers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ distcc-pump make -j20
CC=distcc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW PLAIN (NON-PUMP) DISTCC
WORKS <br>
distcc only ever runs the compiler and assembler remotely.
With plain distcc, the preprocessor must always run locally
because it needs to access various header files on the <br>
local machine which may not be present, or may not be the
same, on the volunteer. The linker similarly needs to
examine libraries and object files, and so must run
locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler and assembler take
only a single input file (the preprocessed source) and
produce a single output (the object file). distcc ships
these two files across the network <br>
and can therefore run the compiler/assembler remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, for most programs
running the preprocessor is relatively cheap, and the linker
is called relatively infrequent, so most of the work can be
distributed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc examines its command line
to determine which of these phases are being invoked, and
whether the job can be distributed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW DISTCC-PUMP MODE WORKS <br>
In pump mode, distcc runs the preprocessor remotely too. To
do so, the preprocessor must have access to all the files
that it would have accessed if had been running locally.
<br>
In pump mode, therefore, distcc gathers all of the
recursively included headers, except the ones that are
default system headers, and sends them along with the source
file to the <br>
compilation server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In distcc-pump mode, the server
unpacks the set of all source files in a temporary
directory, which contains a directory tree that mirrors the
part of the file system that is <br>
relevant to preprocessing, including symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler is then run from
the path in the temporary directory that corresponds to the
current working directory on the client. To find and
transmit the many hundreds of <br>
files that are often part of a single compilation, pump mode
uses an incremental include analysis algorithm. The include
server is a Python program that implements this algo&acirc;
<br>
rithm. The distcc-pump command starts the include server so
that throughout the build it can answer include queries by
distcc commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include server uses static
analysis of the macro language to deal with conditional
compilation and computed includes. It uses the property that
when a given header file has <br>
already been analyzed for includes, it is not necessary to
do so again if all the include options (-I&rsquo;s) are
unchanged (along with other conditions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For large builds, header files
are included, on average, hundreds of times each. With
distcc-pump mode each such file is analyzed only a few
times, perhaps just once, instead of <br>
being preprocessed hundreds of times. Also, each source or
header file is now compressed only once, because the include
server memoizes the compressed files. As a result, the <br>
time used for preparing compilations may drop by up to an
order of magnitude over the preprocessing of plain
distcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because distcc in pump mode is
able to push out files up to about ten times faster, build
speed may increase 3X or more for large builds compared to
plain distcc mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS FOR PUMP MODE <br>
Using pump mode requires both client and servers to use
release 3.0 or later of distcc and distccd
(respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The incremental include analysis
of distc-pump mode rests on the fundamental assumption that
source and header files do not change during the build
process. A few complex build <br>
systems, such as that for Linux kernel 2.6, do not quite
satisfy this requirement. To overcome such issues, and other
corner cases such as absolute filepaths in includes, see
<br>
the include_server(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another important assumption is
that the include configuration of all machines must be
identical. Thus the headers under the default system path
must be the same on all servers <br>
and all clients. If a standard GNU compiler installation is
used, then this requirement applies to all libraries whose
header files are installed under /usr/include or <br>
/usr/local/include/. Note that installing software packages
often lead to additional headers files being placed in
subdirectories of either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this assumption does not
hold, then it is possible to break builds with distcc-pump
mode, or worse, to get wrong results without warning.
Presently this condition is not ver&acirc; <br>
ified, and it is on our TODO list to address this issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An easy way to guarantee that
the include configurations are identical is to use a
cross-compiler that defines a default system search path
restricted to directories of the com&acirc; <br>
piler installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the include_server(1) manual
for more information on symptoms and causes of violations of
distcc-pump mode assumptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION SUMMARY <br>
Most options passed to distcc are interpreted as compiler
options. The following options are understood by distcc
itself. If any of these options are specified, distcc will
not <br>
invoke the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Displays summary
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Displays the distcc client version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-hosts <br>
Displays the host list that distcc would use. See the Host
Specifications section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scan-includes <br>
Displays the list of files that distcc would send to the
remote machine, as computed by the include server. This is a
conservative (over-)approximation of the files that <br>
would be read by the C compiler. This option only works in
pump mode. See the &quot;How Distcc-pump Mode Works&quot;
section for details on how this is computed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list output by distcc
--scan-includes will contain one entry per line. Each line
contains a category followed by a path. The category is one
of FILE, SYMLINK, DIREC&acirc; <br>
TORY, or SYSTEMDIR:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE indicates a source file or
header file that would be sent to the distcc server
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYMLINK indicates a symbolic
link that would be sent to the distcc server host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORY indicates a directory
that may be needed in order to compile the source file. For
example, a directory &quot;foo&quot; may be needed because
of an include of the form <br>
#include &quot;foo/../bar.h&quot;. Such directories would be
created on the distcc server host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEMDIR indicates a system
include directory, i.e. a directory which is on the
compiler&rsquo;s default include path, such as
&quot;/usr/include&quot;; such directories are assumed to
<br>
be present on the distcc server host, and so would not be
sent to the distcc server host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Displays distcc&rsquo;s
concurrency level, as calculated from the host list; it is
the maximum number of outstanding jobs issued by this client
to all servers. By default this <br>
will be four times the number of hosts in the host list,
unless the /LIMIT option was used in the host list. See the
Host Specifications section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLING DISTCC <br>
There are three different ways to call distcc, to suit
different circumstances:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc can be installed under
the name of the real compiler, to intercept calls to it and
run them remotely. This &quot;masqueraded&quot; compiler has
the widest compatibility with <br>
existing source trees, and is convenient when you want to
use distcc for all compilation. The fact that distcc is
being used is transparent to the makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc can be prepended to
compiler command lines, such as &quot;distcc cc -c
hello.c&quot; or CC=&quot;distcc gcc&quot;. This is
convenient when you want to use distcc for only some
compi&acirc; <br>
lations or to try it out, but can cause trouble with some
makefiles or versions of libtool that assume $CC does not
contain a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, distcc can be used
directly as a compiler. &quot;cc&quot; is always used as the
name of the real compiler in this &quot;implicit&quot; mode.
This can be convenient for interactive <br>
use when &quot;explicit&quot; mode does not work but is not
really recommended for new use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that you should not use
two methods for calling distcc at the same time. If you are
using a masquerade directory, don&rsquo;t change CC and/or
CXX, just put the directory <br>
early on your PATH. If you&rsquo;re not using a masquerade
directory, you&rsquo;ll need to either change CC and/or CXX,
or modify the makefile(s) to call distcc explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MASQUERADING <br>
The basic idea is to create a &quot;masquerade
directory&quot; which contains links from the name of the
real compiler to the distcc binary. This directory is
inserted early on the PATH, <br>
so that calls to the compiler are intercepted and distcc is
run instead. distcc then removes itself from the PATH to
find the real compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># mkdir /usr/lib/distcc/bin <br>
# cd /usr/lib/distcc/bin <br>
# ln -s ../../../bin/distcc gcc <br>
# ln -s ../../../bin/distcc cc <br>
# ln -s ../../../bin/distcc g++ <br>
# ln -s ../../../bin/distcc c++</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, to use distcc, a user just
needs to put the directory /usr/lib/distcc/bin early in the
PATH, and have set a host list in DISTCC_HOSTS or a file.
distcc will handle the <br>
rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this masquerade
directory must occur on the PATH earlier than the directory
that contains the actual compilers of the same names, and
that any auxiliary programs that <br>
these compilers call (such as as or ld) must also be found
on the PATH in a directory after the masquerade directory
since distcc calls out to the real compiler with a PATH
value <br>
that has all directory up to and including the masquerade
directory trimmed off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to get a
&quot;recursion error&quot; in masquerade mode, which means
that distcc is somehow finding itself again, not the real
compiler. This can indicate that you have two <br>
masquerade directories on the PATH, possibly because of
having two distcc installations in different locations. It
can also indicate that you&rsquo;re trying to mix
&quot;masqueraded&quot; and <br>
&quot;explicit&quot; operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursion errors can be avoided
by using shell scripts instead of links. For example, in
/usr/lib/distcc/bin create a file cc which contains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
distcc /usr/bin/gcc &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this way, we are not
dependent on distcc having to locate the real gcc by
investigating the PATH variable. Instead, the compiler
location is explicitly provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING DISTCC WITH CCACHE <br>
ccache is a program that speeds software builds by caching
the results of compilations. ccache is normally called
before distcc, so that results are retrieved from a normal
<br>
cache. Some experimentation may be required for
idiosyncratic makefiles to make everything work
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most reliable method is to
set</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_PREFIX=&quot;distcc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tells ccache to run distcc
as a wrapper around the real compiler. ccache still uses the
real compiler to detect compiler upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccache can then be run using
either a masquerade directory or by setting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CC=&quot;ccache gcc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of version 2.2, ccache does
not cache compilation from preprocessed source and so will
never get a cache hit if it is run from distccd or distcc.
It must be run only on the <br>
client side and before distcc to be any use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc&rsquo;s pump mode is not
compatible with ccache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST SPECIFICATIONS <br>
A &quot;host list&quot; tells distcc which machines to use
for compilation. In order, distcc looks in the $DISTCC_HOSTS
environment variable, the user&rsquo;s $DISTCC_DIR/hosts
file, and the <br>
system-wide host file. If no host list can be found, distcc
emits a warning and compiles locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host list is a simple
whitespace separated list of host specifications. The
simplest and most common form is a host names, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localhost red green blue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc prefers hosts towards the
start of the list, so machines should be listed in
descending order of speed. In particular, when only a single
compilation can be run (such as <br>
from a configure script), the first machine listed is used
(but see --randomize below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placing localhost at the right
point in the list is important to getting good performance.
Because overhead for running jobs locally is low, localhost
should normally be first. <br>
However, it is important that the client have enough cycles
free to run the local jobs and the distcc client. If the
client is slower than the volunteers, or if there are many
<br>
volunteers, then the client should be put later in the list
or not at all. As a general rule, if the aggregate CPU speed
of the client is less than one fifth of the total, then <br>
the client should be left out of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a large shared build
cluster and a single shared hosts file, the above rules
would cause the first few machines in the hosts file to be
tried first even though they <br>
are likely to be busier than machines later in the list. To
avoid this, place the keyword --randomize into the host
list. This will cause the host list to be randomized, which
<br>
should improve performance slightly for large build
clusters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two special host names
--localslots and --localslots_cpp which are useful for
adjusting load on the local machine. The --localslots host
specifies how many jobs that <br>
cannot be run remotely that can be run concurrently on the
local machine, while --localslots_cpp controls how many
preprocessors will run in parallel on the local machine.
Tun&acirc; <br>
ing these values can improve performance. Linking on large
projects can take large amounts of memory. Running parallel
linkers, which cannot be executed remotely, may force <br>
the machine to swap, which reduces performance over just
running the jobs in sequence without swapping. Getting the
number of parallel preprocessors just right allows you to
<br>
use larger parallel factors with make, since the local
machine now has some machanism for measuring local resource
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally there is the host
entry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance depends on the
details of the source and makefiles used for the project,
and the machine and network speeds. Experimenting with
different settings for the host list <br>
and -j factor may improve performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_HOSTS = HOSTSPEC ... <br>
HOSTSPEC = LOCAL_HOST | SSH_HOST | TCP_HOST |
OLDSTYLE_TCP_HOST <br>
| GLOBAL_OPTION <br>
| ZEROCONF <br>
LOCAL_HOST = localhost[/LIMIT] <br>
| --localslots=&lt;int&gt; <br>
| --localslots_cpp=&lt;int&gt; <br>
SSH_HOST = [USER]@HOSTID[/LIMIT][:COMMAND][OPTIONS] <br>
TCP_HOST = HOSTID[:PORT][/LIMIT][OPTIONS] <br>
OLDSTYLE_TCP_HOST = HOSTID[/LIMIT][:PORT][OPTIONS] <br>
HOSTID = HOSTNAME | IPV4 | IPV6 <br>
OPTIONS = ,OPTION[OPTIONS] <br>
OPTION = lzo | cpp <br>
GLOBAL_OPTION = --randomize <br>
ZEROCONF = +zeroconf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some individual
examples of the syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localhost <br>
The literal word &quot;localhost&quot; is interpreted
specially to cause compilations to be directly executed,
rather than passed to a daemon on the local machine. If you
do want <br>
to connect to a daemon on the local machine for testing,
then give the machine&rsquo;s IP address or real hostname.
(This will be slower.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPV6 A literal IPv6 address
enclosed in square brackets, such as [::1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPV4 A literal IPv4 address,
such as 10.0.0.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAME <br>
A hostname to be looked up using the resolver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:PORT Connect to a specified
decimal port number, rather than the default of 3632.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@HOSTID <br>
Connect to the host over SSH, rather than TCP. Options for
the SSH connection can be set in ~/.ssh/config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER@ Connect to the host over
SSH as a specified username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:COMMAND <br>
Connect over SSH, and use a specified path to find the
distccd server. This is normally only needed if for some
reason you can&rsquo;t install distccd into a directory on
the <br>
default PATH for SSH connections. Use this if you get errors
like &quot;distccd: command not found&quot; in SSH mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/LIMIT A decimal limit can be
added to any host specification to restrict the number of
jobs that this client will send to the machine. The limit
defaults to four per host (two <br>
for localhost), but may be further restricted by the server.
You should only need to increase this for servers with more
than two processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">,lzo Enables LZO compression for
this TCP or SSH host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">,cpp Enables distcc-pump mode
for this host. Note: the build command must be wrapped in
the distcc-pump script in order to start the include
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--randomize <br>
Randomize the order of the host list before execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+zeroconf <br>
This option is only available if distcc was compiled with
Avahi support enabled at configure time. When this special
entry is present in the hosts list, distcc will use <br>
Avahi Zeroconf DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) to locate any
available distccd servers on the local network. This avoids
the need to explicitly list the host names or IP <br>
addresses of the distcc server machines. The distccd servers
must have been started with the &quot;--zeroconf&quot;
option to distccd. An important caveat is that in the
current <br>
implementation, pump mode (&quot;,cpp&quot;) and compression
(&quot;,lzo&quot;) will never be used for hosts located via
zeroconf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example demonstrating
some possibilities:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localhost/2
@bigman/16:/opt/bin/distccd oldmachine:4200/1 <br>
# cartman is down <br>
distant/3,lzo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are allowed in host
specifications. Comments start with a hash/pound sign (#)
and run to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a host in the list is not
reachable distcc will emit a warning and ignore that host
for about one minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSION <br>
The lzo host option specifies that LZO compression should be
used for data transfer, including preprocessed source,
object code and error messages. Compression is usually
eco&acirc; <br>
nomical on networks slower than 100Mbps, but results may
vary depending on the network, processors and source
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling compression makes the
distcc client and server use more CPU time, but less network
traffic. The added CPU time is insignificant for pump mode.
The compression ratio is <br>
typically 4:1 for source and 2:1 for object code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using compression requires both
client and server to use at least release 2.9 of distcc. No
server configuration is required: the server always responds
with compressed replies <br>
to compressed requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pump mode requires the servers
to have the lzo host option on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH PATHS <br>
If the compiler name is an absolute path, it is passed
verbatim to the server and the compiler is run from that
directory. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc /usr/local/bin/gcc-3.1415
-c hello.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the compiler name is not
absolute, or not fully qualified, distccd&rsquo;s PATH is
searched. When distcc is run from a masquerade directory,
only the base name of the compiler is <br>
used. The client&rsquo;s PATH is used only to run the
preprocessor and has no effect on the server&rsquo;s
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEOUTS <br>
Both the distcc client and server impose timeouts on
transfer of data across the network. This is intended to
detect hosts which are down or unreachable, and to prevent
compiles <br>
hanging indefinitely if a server is disconnected while in
use. If a client-side timeout expires, the job will be
re-run locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timeouts are not
configurable at present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Error messages or warnings from local or remote compilers
are passed through to diagnostic output on the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc can supply extensive
debugging information when the verbose option is used. This
is controlled by the DISTCC_VERBOSE environment variable on
the client, and the --verbose <br>
option on the server. For troubleshooting, examine both the
client and server error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
The exit code of distcc is normally that of the compiler:
zero for successful compilation and non-zero otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc distinguishes between
&quot;genuine&quot; errors such as a syntax error in the
source, and &quot;accidental&quot; errors such as a
networking problem connecting to a volunteer. In the case
<br>
of accidental errors, distcc will retry the compilation
locally unless the DISTCC_FALLBACK option has been
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the compiler exits with a
signal, distcc returns an exit code of 128 plus the signal
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc internal errors cause an
exit code between 100 and 127. In particular</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100 General distcc failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">101 Bad arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">102 Bind failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">103 Connect failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">104 Compiler crashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">105 Out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">106 Bad Host SPEC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">107 I/O Error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">108 Truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">109 Protocol Error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">110 The given compiler was not
found on the remote host. Check that $CC is set
appropriately and that it&rsquo;s installed in a directory
on the search path for distccd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">111 Recursive call to
distcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">112 Failed to discard
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">113 Network access denied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">114 In use by another
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">115 No such file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">116 No hosts defined and
fallbacks disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">118 Timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If $DISTCC_HOSTS is not set, distcc reads a host list from
either $DISTCC_DIR/hosts or a system-wide configuration file
set at compile time. The file locations are shown in the
<br>
output from distcc --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc creates a number of
temporary and lock files underneath the temporary
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
distcc&rsquo;s behaviour is controlled by a number of
environment variables. For most cases nothing need be set if
the host list is stored in a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_HOSTS <br>
Space-separated list of volunteer host specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_VERBOSE <br>
If set to 1, distcc produces explanatory messages on the
standard error stream or in the log file. This can be
helpful in debugging problems. Bug reports should include
<br>
verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_LOG <br>
Log file to receive messages from distcc itself, rather than
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_FALLBACK <br>
By default distcc will compile locally if it fails to
distribute a job to the intended machine, or if no host list
can be found. If this variable is set to 0 then fall&acirc;
<br>
backs are disabled and those compilations will simply fail.
Note that this does not affect jobs which must always be
local such as linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_SAVE_TEMPS <br>
If set to 1, temporary files are not deleted after use. Good
for debugging, or if your disks are too empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_TCP_CORK <br>
If set to 0, disable use of &quot;TCP corks&quot;, even if
they&rsquo;re present on this system. Using corks normally
helps pack requests into fewer packets and aids performance.
This <br>
should normally be left enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_SSH <br>
Specifies the command used for opening SSH connections.
Defaults to &quot;ssh&quot; but may be set to a different
connection command such as &quot;lsh&quot; or
&quot;tsocks-ssh&quot; that accepts a <br>
similar command line. The command is not split into words
and is not executed through the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_DIR <br>
Per-user configuration directory to store lock files and
state files. By default ~/.distcc/ is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Directory for temporary
files such as preprocessor output. By default /tmp/ is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNCACHED_ERR_FD <br>
If set and if DISTCC_LOG is not set, distcc errors are
written to the file descriptor identified by this variable.
This variable is intended mainly for automatic use by <br>
ccache, which sets it to avoid caching transient errors such
as network problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTCC_ENABLE_DISCREPANCY_EMAIL
<br>
If set, distcc sends an email when a compilation failed
remotely, but succeeded locally. Built-in heuristics prevent
some such discrepancy email from being sent if the <br>
problem is that a local file changed between the failing
remote compilation and the succeeding local compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DCC_EMAILLOG_WHOM_TO_BLAME <br>
The email address for discrepancy email; the default is
&quot;distcc-pump-errors&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CROSS COMPILING <br>
Cross compilation means building programs to run on a
machine with a different processor, architecture, or
operating system to where they were compiled. distcc
supports cross <br>
compilation, including teams of mixed-architecture machines,
although some changes to the compilation commands may be
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compilation command passed
to distcc must be one that will execute properly on every
volunteer machine to produce an object file of the
appropriate type. If the machines <br>
have different processors, then simply using distcc cc will
probably not work, because that will normally invoke the
volunteer&rsquo;s native compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machines with the same CPU but
different operating systems may not necessarily generate
compatible .o files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several different gcc
configurations can be installed side-by-side on any machine.
If you build gcc from source, you should use the
--program-suffix configuration options to <br>
cause it to be installed with a name that encodes the gcc
version and the target platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recommended convention for
the gcc name is TARGET-gcc-VERSION such as
i686-linux-gcc-3.2 . GCC 3.3 will install itself under this
name, in addition to TARGET-gcc and, if <br>
it&rsquo;s native, gcc-VERSION and gcc .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler must be installed
under the same name on the client and on every volunteer
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you think you have found a distcc bug, please see the
file reporting-bugs.txt in the documentation directory for
information on how to report it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some makefiles have missing or
extra dependencies that cause incorrect or slow parallel
builds. Recursive make is inefficient and can leave
processors unnecessarily idle for <br>
long periods. (See Recursive Make Considered Harmful by
Peter Miller.) Makefile bugs are the most common cause of
trees failing to build under distcc. Alternatives to Make
<br>
such as SCons can give much faster builds for some
projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using different versions of gcc
can cause confusing build problems because the header files
and binary interfaces have changed over time, and some
distributors have included <br>
incompatible patches without changing the version number.
distcc does not protect against using incompatible versions.
Compiler errors about link problems or declarations in <br>
system header files are usually due to mismatched or
incorrectly installed compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc&rsquo;s -MD option can
produce output in the wrong directory if the source and
object files are in different directories and the -MF option
is not used. There is no perfect solu&acirc; <br>
tion because of incompatible changes between gcc versions.
Explicitly specifying the dependency output file with -MF
will fix the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCP mode connections should only
be used on trusted networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Including slow machines in the
list of volunteer hosts can slow the build down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When distcc or ccache is used on
NFS, the filesystem must be exported with the
no_subtree_check option to allow reliable renames between
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler can be invoked with
a command line gcc hello.c to both compile and link. distcc
doesn&rsquo;t split this into separate parts, but rather
runs the whole thing locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc-pump mode reverts to
plain distcc mode for source files that contain includes
with absolute paths (either directly or in an included
file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to limitations in gcc, gdb
may not be able to automatically find the source files for
programs built using distcc in some circumstances. The gdb
directory command can be <br>
used. For distcc&rsquo;s plain (non-pump) mode, this is
fixed in gcc 3.4 and later. For pump mode, the fix in gcc
3.4 does not suffice; we&rsquo;ve worked around the gcc
limitation by <br>
rewriting the object files that gcc produces, but this is
only done for ELF object files, but not for other object
file formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .o files produced by discc
in pump mode will be different from those produced locally:
for non-ELF files, the debug information will specify
compile directories of the <br>
server. The code itself should be identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the ELF-format, distcc
rewrites the .o files to correct compile directory path
information. While the resulting .o files are not bytewise
identical to what would have been <br>
produced by compiling on the local client (due to different
padding, etc), they should be functionally identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In distcc-pump mode, the include
server is unable to handle certain very complicated computed
includes as found in parts of the Boost library. The include
server will time out <br>
and distcc will revert to plain mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In distcc-pump mode, certain
assumptions are made that source and header files do not
change during the build. See discussion in section DISTCC
DISCREPANCY SYMPTOMS of <br>
include_server(1().</p>
