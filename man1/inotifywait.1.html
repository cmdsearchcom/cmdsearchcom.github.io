<p>inotifywait(1) General Commands Manual
inotifywait(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
inotifywait - wait for changes to files using inotify</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
inotifywait [-hcmrq] [-e &lt;event&gt; ] [-t &lt;seconds&gt;
] [--format &lt;fmt&gt; ] [--timefmt &lt;fmt&gt; ]
&lt;file&gt; [ ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
inotifywait efficiently waits for changes to files using
Linux&rsquo;s inotify(7) interface. It is suitable for
waiting for changes to files from shell scripts. It can
either exit <br>
once an event occurs, or continually execute and output
events as they occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
inotifywait will output diagnostic information on standard
error and event information on standard output. The event
output can be configured, but by default it consists of <br>
lines of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watched_filename EVENT_NAMES
event_filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watched_filename <br>
is the name of the file on which the event occurred. If the
file is a directory, a trailing slash is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENT_NAMES <br>
are the names of the inotify events which occurred,
separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">event_filename <br>
is output only when the event occurred on a directory, and
in this case the name of the file within the directory which
caused this event is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, any special
characters in filenames are not escaped in any way. This can
make the output of inotifywait difficult to parse in awk
scripts or similar. The <br>
--csv and --format options will be helpful in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Output some helpful usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@&lt;file&gt; <br>
When watching a directory tree recursively, exclude the
specified file from being watched. The file must be
specified with a relative or absolute path according to <br>
whether a relative or absolute path is given for watched
directories. If a specific path is explicitly both included
and excluded, it will always be watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If you need to watch a
directory or file whose name starts with @, give the
absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fromfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one filename
per line. If filenames begin with @ they are excluded as
described above. If &lt;file&gt; is &lsquo;-&rsquo;,
filenames are <br>
read from standard input. Use this option if you need to
watch too many files to pass in as command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --monitor <br>
Instead of exiting after receiving a single event, execute
indefinitely. The default behaviour is to exit after the
first event occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --daemon <br>
Same as --monitor, except run in the background logging
events to a file that must be specified by --outfile.
Implies --syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --outfile &lt;file&gt; <br>
Output events to &lt;file&gt; rather than stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --syslog <br>
Output errors to syslog(3) system log module rather than
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recursive <br>
Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed as
arguments. Watches will be set up recursively to an
unlimited depth. Symbolic links are not traversed. Newly
cre&acirc; <br>
ated subdirectories will also be watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If you use this option
while watching the root directory of a large tree, it may
take quite a while until all inotify watches are
established, and events will not <br>
be received in this time. Also, since one inotify watch will
be established per subdirectory, it is possible that the
maximum amount of inotify watches per user will be <br>
reached. The default maximum is 8192; it can be increased by
writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
If specified once, the program will be less verbose.
Specifically, it will not state when it has completed
establishing all inotify watches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If specified twice, the program
will output nothing at all, except in the case of fatal
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude &lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Do not process any events whose filename matches the
specified POSIX extended regular expression, case
sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--excludei &lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Do not process any events whose filename matches the
specified POSIX extended regular expression, case
insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;seconds&gt;, --timeout
&lt;seconds&gt; <br>
Exit if an appropriate event has not occurred within
&lt;seconds&gt; seconds. If &lt;seconds&gt; is zero (the
default), wait indefinitely for an event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;event&gt;, --event
&lt;event&gt; <br>
Listen for specific event(s) only. The events which can be
listened for are listed in the EVENTS section. This option
can be specified more than once. If omitted, all <br>
events are listened for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --csv <br>
Output in CSV (comma-separated values) format. This is
useful when filenames may contain spaces, since in this case
it is not safe to simply split the output at each <br>
space character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timefmt &lt;fmt&gt; <br>
Set a time format string as accepted by strftime(3) for use
with the &lsquo;%T&rsquo; conversion in the --format
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--format &lt;fmt&gt; <br>
Output in a user-specified format, using printf-like syntax.
The event strings output are limited to around 4000
characters and will be truncated to this length. The <br>
following conversions are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%w This will be replaced with
the name of the Watched file on which an event occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f When an event occurs within a
directory, this will be replaced with the name of the File
which caused the event to occur. Otherwise, this will be
replaced with an empty <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%e Replaced with the Event(s)
which occurred, comma-separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%Xe Replaced with the Event(s)
which occurred, separated by whichever character is in the
place of &lsquo;X&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T Replaced with the current
Time in the format specified by the --timefmt option, which
should be a format string suitable for passing to
strftime(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The program executed successfully, and an event occurred
which was being listened for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 An error occurred in execution
of the program, or an event occurred which was not being
listened for. The latter generally occurs if something
happens which forcibly <br>
removes the inotify watch, such as a watched file being
deleted or the filesystem containing a watched file being
unmounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 The -t option was used and an
event did not occur in the specified interval of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EVENTS <br>
The following events are valid for use with the -e
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">access A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was read from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modify A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was written to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attrib The metadata of a watched
file or a file within a watched directory was modified. This
includes timestamps, file permissions, extended attributes
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close_write <br>
A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
closed, after being opened in writeable mode. This does not
necessarily imply the file was written to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close_nowrite <br>
A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
closed, after being opened in read-only mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was closed, regardless of how it
was opened. Note that this is actually implemented simply by
listening for both <br>
close_write and close_nowrite, hence all close events
received will be output as one of these, not CLOSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open A watched file or a file
within a watched directory was opened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moved_to <br>
A file or directory was moved into a watched directory. This
event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to
the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moved_from <br>
A file or directory was moved from a watched directory. This
event occurs even if the file is simply moved from and to
the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move A file or directory was
moved from or to a watched directory. Note that this is
actually implemented simply by listening for both moved_to
and moved_from, hence all close <br>
events received will be output as one or both of these, not
MOVE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move_self <br>
A watched file or directory was moved. After this event, the
file or directory is no longer being watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create A file or directory was
created within a watched directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete A file or directory
within a watched directory was deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete_self <br>
A watched file or directory was deleted. After this event
the file or directory is no longer being watched. Note that
this event can occur even if it is not explicitly <br>
being listened for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmount <br>
The filesystem on which a watched file or directory resides
was unmounted. After this event the file or directory is no
longer being watched. Note that this event can <br>
occur even if it is not explicitly being listened to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1 <br>
Running inotifywait at the command-line to wait for any file
in the &lsquo;test&rsquo; directory to be accessed. After
running inotifywait, &lsquo;cat test/foo&rsquo; is run in a
separate console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% inotifywait test <br>
Setting up watches. <br>
Watches established. <br>
test/ ACCESS foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2 <br>
A short shell script to efficiently wait for httpd-related
log messages and do something appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
while inotifywait -e modify /var/log/messages; do <br>
if tail -n1 /var/log/messages | grep httpd; then <br>
kdialog --msgbox &quot;Apache needs love!&quot; <br>
fi <br>
done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 3 <br>
A custom output format is used to watch
&lsquo;~/test&rsquo;. Meanwhile, someone runs &lsquo;touch
~/test/badfile; touch ~/test/goodfile; rm
~/test/badfile&rsquo; in another console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% inotifywait -m -r --format
&rsquo;%:e %f&rsquo; ~/test <br>
Setting up watches. Beware: since -r was given, this may
take a while! <br>
Watches established. <br>
CREATE badfile <br>
OPEN badfile <br>
ATTRIB badfile <br>
CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE badfile <br>
CREATE goodfile <br>
OPEN goodfile <br>
ATTRIB goodfile <br>
CLOSE_WRITE:CLOSE goodfile <br>
DELETE badfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
When using inotifywait, the filename that is outputted is
not guaranteed to be up to date after a move because it is
the inode that is being monitored. Additionally, none of the
<br>
observed operations are guaranteed to have been performed on
the filename inotifywait was instructed to monitor in cases
when the file is known by several names in the
filesys&acirc; <br>
tem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are race conditions in the recursive directory
watching code which can cause events to be missed if they
occur in a directory immediately after that directory is
created. <br>
This is probably not fixable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is assumed the inotify event
queue will never overflow.</p>
