<p style="margin-top: 1em">DPHYS-CONFIG(1) General Commands
Manual DPHYS-CONFIG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dphys-config - daily auto-install/update and/or remove
config files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dphys-config [-f filter] [-cqvD]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dphys-config -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dphys-config installs/updates and/or removes config files.
It also triggers commands after an new/updated config file
is available or before an existing config file will
disap&acirc; <br>
pear. It can be run by hand, from cron and/or from
init.d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get an list of config files from
an configuration server. For each file in the list retrieve
that file from the same server, and only install it if it is
new or changed relative <br>
to what is already here. If a file is newly installed (or
changed) then run an postinstall script, which may trigger
actions which are wanted to process the new config (such as
<br>
inserting data from an config file into an database). Also
remove unwanted files. If doing so first run an preremove
script to tidy up stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is part of the D-PHYS (ETH
Zuerich, Departement of Physics) automatic system operation
and maintenance setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c configname: Use this set of config files instead of
hostname set. Useful for chroot or vhost installs, or for
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filter <br>
filter: Only process lines which match the filter spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q quiet: Don&rsquo;t produce an
running report of activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose: Give large volume
output, where sensible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Debug: Activate an debug
option. See source for how to use this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h help: Output help text, and
then abort operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG <br>
The config files /etc/dphys-config (sitewide) and
~/.dphys-config (personal) allow the admin and users to set
up the working environment for dphys-config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These config files are sh script
fragments full of assignments, which are sourced, in above
row, later config files assignments overriding earlier ones.
Standard sh syntax rules <br>
apply. Assignments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONF_TMP_DIR <br>
Sets the base directory in which all temporary files are
stored. It defaults to /var/tmp (for enough size and safe
operation). Some users may like to use /tmp for higher <br>
speed (tmpfs) or automatic deletion at boot time. Standard
sh syntax rules apply. Assignments are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONF_BASEURL <br>
Sets the base URL to which all
*/&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;filename&gt; combinations are added
when wget-ing config files. This can be an http: or ftp: or
whatever other type of URL which <br>
wget understands and can fetch an file from. Additionally it
can be an file: (this may be from an NFS server) URL, in
which case wget is bypassed and the files fetched <br>
directly using cp. It defaults to the error message
generating and aborting invalid setting of
http://not-configured-server.example.net/not/configured/directory,
as there <br>
is no sensible default possible. You must set this to where
ever your config files should be taken from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONF_CONFNAME <br>
Selects the name for which set of configuration files shall
be used for this host. Defaults to
&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONF_LINEFILTER <br>
Sets an regexp which selects which lines from the config
file list are processed. Defaults to .* (all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONF_LOG_DONE <br>
Log to syslog that dphys-config has run. Good to see if cron
and/or init.d have done their job. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config file list
dphys-config.list, which is found via above settings, and is
downloaded to /etc/dphys-config.list or
~/.dphys-config.list, then allows the admin to list what
<br>
config files are to be fetched and installed/updated or
removed, and what scripts to run for them. These can be each
given for the entire site (= all hosts) and/or group and/or
<br>
each host, or even merged from site+group+host
subsections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/dphys-config <br>
site admin config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.dphys-config <br>
users personal config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/dphys-config.list <br>
roots config file list gets stored here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.dphys-config.list <br>
users config file list gets stored here</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$CONF_BASEURL/&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;/dphys-config.list
<br>
site-global (all hosts) common (usually, or group-global or
host specific) config file list</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$CONF_BASEURL/&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;/dphys-config.list.*
<br>
facultative host-specific (usually) or group-specific
include-able subsection(s) to be added to above config file
list dphys-config.list. We often use *.group (one per <br>
group of users) and *.host (per host), sometimes also *.base
(all host types) and *.workstation (only workstation hosts)
subsections
$CONF_BASEURL/&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;/&lt;file-name&gt; <br>
actual config files referred to in config file list, common
section (usually the only section)
$CONF_BASEURL/&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;/&lt;file-name&gt;.*
facultative host-specific (usually) <br>
or group-specific include-able subsection(s) to be added to
above config file &lt;file-name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE LIST <br>
The config file list to be used for checking what files need
to be installed/updated or removed and its subsections
included by #@include lines are merged to one list file,
ana&acirc; <br>
log to cpp #include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are all fetched via wget
(or cp for file:), adding their names to the user-defined
base URL in CONF_BASEURL, and then merged. So CONF_BASEURL
can be any URL that wget <br>
understands http: or ftp: or whatever else, or file:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the resulting
concatenated file must consist of lines, one per config
file, of following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">file-name:place-on-target:command-to-trigger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the 3 fields have
following meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file-name <br>
Name of the config file to be installed/updated. Must be
only the base part of the filename on the server, without
URL and hostname before it, and without any .* <br>
subsection endings after it, as these are all auto-added
whenever they are needed. If this is set to - the line
specifies an config file to be removed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">place-on-target <br>
Full directory or full filename (directory+filename) of
where the file is to be placed on the target system. If only
an directory is given (any name that ends in <br>
/), then the above file-name (inclusive any directories in
it) will be automatically added to it. For removing this
must be the full filename (or an directory name <br>
(without an /) if an entire directory and its contents shall
disappear). An directory name ending with / is not
processed, to prevent incomplete edits (filename <br>
replaced by -, but not added to directory) from killing
entire directories (such as say all of /etc/ :-))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command-to-trigger <br>
Full command (directory+filename, with parameters) of an
command to be run, after this config file has been newly
installed or changed/updated, or before this con&acirc; <br>
fig file is removed. This can also be multiple commands
separated by ; separators. Useful for doing chown/chmod to
files that need it. If the marker {} appears in <br>
the command, this will be substituted by the filename the
config file is going to be installed as. This is analog to
find -exec filename substitution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines which begin with an # are
regarded as comments, and don&rsquo;t have any effect
anything (Lines extended with one are chopped off at that
point). The same applies for empty <br>
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPROCESSOR <br>
If the first line of the config file list, or any config
file fetched on its behalf, has the special format
#@dphys-config-preprocess [action...] then this line will be
stripped, <br>
and the rest of the file will be preprocessed. Depending on
the list of actions present and their order (repeats are
allowed) the file will be processed. Valid actions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backtick <br>
Anything inside backticks (&lsquo;&lsquo;) will be executed
as a command, and its stdout will then be substituted for
the &lsquo;&lsquo; expression. This is analog to sh backtick
substitu&acirc; <br>
tion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if For any line beginning with
#@if the stuff between the #@if and the first ; character
will be executed as command, and if it returns true,
everything after the ; <br>
will be left, else the entire line will be removed. This is
analog to shell if ... ; conditional execution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include <br>
For any line beginning with #@include the rest of the line
is regarded as an subsection name, which will be added to
the base filename, and then the resulting sub&acirc; <br>
section file fetched (also by wget or cp) and substituted
for the line. This is analog to an C preprocessor #include
oder an shell . include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following allows you to fetch all your config file lists
from an HTTP VirtualHost called www.admin.example.net under
its subdirectory dphys-config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In file /etc/dphys-config, on
every host, so it can find the config file server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># system will use
${CONF_BASEURL}/&lsquo;hostname&lsquo;/&lt;file-name&gt;*
<br>
CONF_BASEURL=http://www.admin.example.net/dphys-config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We advise using an subdirectory
here, because other /http://www.admin.example.net/*
directories may already contain other admin stuff you put on
the same VirtualHost. Such as <br>
software packages, site news, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For dphys-config to be useful
you then need to make config file lists for it. And provide
the actual config files that can be installed, driven by the
lists. This is the <br>
largest job, as it basically amounts to extracting all your
relevant config work from your site. Also known as
reengineering your site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming your VirtualHost on
www.admin.example.net has as its DocumentRoot
/vhost/www.admin, you would then begin with an pseudo-host
Directory for site-global common stuff: <br>
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your hosts are organised in
groups with group-global common configs (such as professors,
students, staff), make an pseudo-host for each group, such
as: <br>
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/PROFS/ and */STUDENTS/ and
*/STAFF/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then for host specific stuff,
assuming systems called prof1.example.com to
prof3.example.com, stud1 to stud20, staff1 to staff5,
server1 and server2, make for each its own direc&acirc; <br>
tory: /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/prof1/ (and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that we suggest using
CAPITALS for pseudo-hosts and lowercase for actual hosts.
This avoids name space collisions. You can also use loops
like for host in [a-z]* ; do ... ; <br>
done to work (say generating symlinks to an new config file
in all hosts). Well at least you can do this so long no one
goes and sets LANGUAGE= or similar junk, then bash (or <br>
libc?) will hapily screw up case sensitivity and produce
random lossage (yes, it was painfull).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this add to
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/, the actual config files
as far as they are not host specific, or at least have an
common section to all hosts. Example this <br>
would be /etc/hosts for all, an common section for
/etc/motd, common or all for sendmail.cf, common for
inetd.conf, nothing for the ssh hostkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then add, to an group, say
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/STUDENTS/, whatever is
specific to that group. Example this may be an entire
special motd for the many changing users, or <br>
just an motd.group to #@include into the common one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then for each host in its
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/prof1/ (or so) add all that is
specific to it. Such as its ssh key files. And its own
motd.host, it it needs one. Same its <br>
inetd.conf.host if it is going to offer special stuff. An
configs for services only this host has such as
httpd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then for each host add symlinks
to the SITE or group versions that it is to use for common
stuff, like on /vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/stud1/:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">.../dphys-config/stud1/dphys-config.list
-&gt; ../SITE/dphys-config.list <br>
.../dphys-config/stud1/hosts -&gt; ../SITE/hosts <br>
.../dphys-config/stud1/inetd.conf -&gt; ../SITE/inetd.conf
<br>
.../dphys-config/stud1/motd -&gt; ../SITE/motd <br>
.../dphys-config/stud1/motd.group -&gt; GROUP/motd <br>
.../dphys-config/stud1/GROUP -&gt; ../STUDENTS <br>
.../dphys-config/stud1/sendmail.cf -&gt;
../SITE/sendmail.cf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/ directory place the
site-global common dphys-config.list for all your hosts,
containing stuff like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># SITE dphys-config.list - just
example stuff, for our exemplaric site <br>
# basics <br>
hosts:/etc/ # simply works, no command <br>
motd:/etc/ # this will be assembled group specific <br>
inetd.conf:/etc/:/etc/init.d/inetd restart # needs an
command to reload <br>
sendmail.cf:/etc/mail/:/etc/init.d/sendmail restart # not in
/etc <br>
# ssh restart only after last file, and ensure file modes
for each file <br>
ssh_host_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {} <br>
ssh_host_rsa_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}
<br>
ssh_host_dsa_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {};
/etc/init.d/sshd restart <br>
# load stuff into an existing database file <br>
seed.debconf:/etc/:debconf-set-selections {} <br>
# other stuff <br>
daemon1-conf:/etc/daemon1/conf # rename so names can differ
on server <br>
daemon2-conf:/etc/daemon2/conf <br>
daemon1/conf:/etc/ # same as above, but with directories on
server <br>
daemon2/conf:/etc/ <br>
testing:/etc/ # put something in there for an test <br>
# delete some stuff <br>
-:/etc/testing # change to above test to get rid of it again
<br>
-:/etc/ # you will get a warning if you leave this <br>
#-:/etc # you would reinstall your system after the
resulting rm -rf /etc :-) <br>
# and some errors <br>
#only-an-name # you would get an error: no place on target
<br>
#only-an-name: # you would get an error: no place on target
<br>
#:only-an-place # you would get an error: no file to
install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For special services add an
dphys-config.list.host on each host that has special config
files not present on others, such as on
/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/server2/:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># server2 dphys-config.list.host
- only used on our web server <br>
httpd.conf:/etc/apache/httpd.conf:/etc/init.d/apache
restart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use dphys-config to
run arbitrary commands, whenever config files are
installed/updated or removed, to modify existing config
files, or more likely modify complex <br>
config databases which can not be provided as files, but
where one can provide edit info as files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dphys-config can even install
scripts to use as above commands (or even just to run
scripts while installing), such as into
/usr/local/sbin/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this make an
../SITE/local/sbin/ directory, place the scripts in there
(such as ../SITE/local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt;),
and symlink local to ../SITE/local on each host, <br>
and then add config lines for the scripts, with the command
to trigger them, giving something like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt;:/usr/:chmod
755 {}; {} # chmod and run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It this script processes an
config file your will want it to be run if either the script
or the config file is updated, so add the script to the
laters line as well:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt;:/etc/:if
[ -x /usr/local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt; ] ; then
/usr/local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt; ; fi # run
also here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, new hosts can then
later simply be added, by making the new hosts directory and
copying all files and symlinks from an existing host of the
same group. Such as by doing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir student21 <br>
tar -cf - -C student1 . | tar xpf - -C student21</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To then run dphys-config by hand
(say for tests), type on the host:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dphys-config</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But usually you will want to run
dphys-config automatically, every night (or if a machine
was/is switched off, at every boot), to keep your configs up
to date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For nightly updates the best
thing is to use an cron job on every host. 03:00 to 03:59 is
most likely idle time. Use an line like this one, with the
cron option to avoid an load <br>
peak on the config file server, by random delaying the run
by 0..3599 seconds, and with stdout and strerr thrown away
to avoid getting an mail from every host, as error messages
<br>
are also allways sent to syslog:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 3 * * * root dphys-config cron
&gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To catch machines switched off
over night, with no cron run on them, also run an init.d
script. Use an script like this one, also with stdout and
stderr thrown away to avoid <br>
cluttering your boot console output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
# /etc/init.d/dphys-config - boot time automatic config
updates, if no cron <br>
case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
start) <br>
dphys-config init &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
;; <br>
esac <br>
exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
If dphys-config is to be used to distribute all config
files, this will also include files which are security
relevant, such as ssh private keys (host key or (root) user
authen&acirc; <br>
tification), SSL certificates, passwd and shadow, lilo.conf,
software license keys, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As all files are most likely
fetched from an http: URL, measures must be taken to secure
the config website from other people downloading them. We
here use an restriction to only <br>
IP addresses registered as hosts in our NIS server, and
additionally run identd on all allowed hosts, and require
the wget process opening the HTTP connection to be running
by <br>
user root, and so also require dphys-config to run as
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid sniffing it is
recommended to give wget an https: URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GOTCHAS <br>
Config files are read by wget from an webserver, so they
lose their owners and modes. So the commands triggered on
their lines must be used to chown/chmod them to proper
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used together with
dphys-admin, dphys-config should run as first (earlier cron
and init.d entries). This is needed to provide configs
before new packages are installed, so <br>
dphys-admin can pretend that the packages were already once
installed (and then non-purge removed), and so prevent
questions on install, which is required for unattended <br>
installs. [Note that this pretending does not go as far as
setting debconf up. Broken packages that ignore config files
and only look at debconf will still ask questions.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As result of this, when
installing for the first time on an new system (such as
installing Debian by the dphys3 end2stage feature, which
installs first dphys-config and then <br>
dphys-admin), any scripts installed by packages by
dphys-admin, to be called on config file install/update will
still be missing, and so not runnable. Either ignore the
warnings, <br>
or better call the scripts by something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file:place:if [ -x script ];
then script; fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in this case, trying
to run dphys-config for a second time after dphys-admin has
installed packages and scripts, will not automatically mend
this, as the config files <br>
have not changed, and so dphys-config will not (re-)run
their scripts. Therefore packages containing such scripts
must also, as part of their postinst (or init.d which is
called <br>
by postinst), check for existing config files and then run
their scripts. This is the normal behaviour of quite a few
packages anyway. Of course this requires the scripts to be
<br>
idempotent, which is official Debian policy anyway.</p>
