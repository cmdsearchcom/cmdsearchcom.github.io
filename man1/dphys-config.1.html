dphys-config installs/updates and/or removes config files. It also triggers
  commands after an new/updated config file is available or before an existing
  config file will disappear. It can be run by hand, from cron and/or from
  init.d.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Get an list of config files from an configuration server. For each file in the
  list retrieve that file from the same server, and only install it if it is new
  or changed relative to what is already here. If a file is newly installed (or
  changed) then run an postinstall script, which may trigger actions which are
  wanted to process the new config (such as inserting data from an config file
  into an database). Also remove unwanted files. If doing so first run an
  preremove script to tidy up stuff.

This is part of the D-PHYS (ETH Zuerich, Departement of Physics) automatic
  system operation and maintenance setup.

The config files <i>/etc/dphys-config</i> (sitewide) and <i>~/.dphys-config</i>
  (personal) allow the admin and users to set up the working environment for
  <b>dphys-config</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These config files are sh script fragments full of assignments, which are
  sourced, in above row, later config files assignments overriding earlier ones.
  Standard sh syntax rules apply. Assignments are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>CONF_TMP_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the base directory in which all temporary files are
      stored. It defaults to <i>/var/tmp</i> (for enough size and safe
      operation). Some users may like to use <i>/tmp</i> for higher speed
      (tmpfs) or automatic deletion at boot time. Standard sh syntax rules
      apply. Assignments are:</dd>

      <i>ftp:</i> or whatever other type of URL which <b>wget</b> understands
      and can fetch an file from. Additionally it can be an <i>file:</i> (this
      may be from an NFS server) URL, in which case wget is bypassed and the
      files fetched directly using <b>cp</b>. It defaults to the error message
      generating and aborting invalid setting of

The config file list <i>dphys-config.list</i>, which is found via above
  settings, and is downloaded to <i>/etc/dphys-config.list</i> or
  <i>~/.dphys-config.list</i>, then allows the admin to list what config files
  are to be fetched and installed/updated or removed, and what scripts to run
  for them. These can be each given for the entire site (= all hosts) and/or
  group and/or each host, or even merged from site+group+host subsections.

      this must be the full filename (or an directory name (without an /) if an
      entire directory and its contents shall disappear). An directory name
      ending with / is not processed, to prevent incomplete edits (filename

If the first line of the config file list, or any config file fetched on its

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The following allows you to fetch all your config file lists from an HTTP
  VirtualHost called www.admin.example.net under its subdirectory dphys-config.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In file <i>/etc/dphys-config</i>, on every host, so it can find the config file
  server:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
# system will use ${CONF_BASEURL}/`hostname`/&lt;file-name&gt;*
CONF_BASEURL=http://www.admin.example.net/dphys-config
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We advise using an subdirectory here, because other
  <i>/http://www.admin.example.net/*</i> directories may already contain other
  admin stuff you put on the same VirtualHost. Such as software packages, site
  news, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For dphys-config to be useful you then need to make config file lists for it.
  And provide the actual config files that can be installed, driven by the
  lists. This is the largest job, as it basically amounts to extracting all your
  relevant config work from your site. Also known as reengineering your site.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Assuming your VirtualHost on <i>www.admin.example.net</i> has as its
  DocumentRoot <i>/vhost/www.admin</i>, you would then begin with an pseudo-host
  Directory for site-global common stuff:
  <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your hosts are organised in groups with group-global common configs (such as
  professors, students, staff), make an pseudo-host for each group, such as:
  <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/PROFS/</i> and <i>*/STUDENTS/</i> and
  <i>*/STAFF/</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then for host specific stuff, assuming systems called prof1.example.com to
  prof3.example.com, stud1 to stud20, staff1 to staff5, server1 and server2,
  make for each its own directory: <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/prof1/</i>
  (and so on).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that we suggest using CAPITALS for pseudo-hosts and lowercase for actual
  hosts. This avoids name space collisions. You can also use loops like
  <i>for</i> <i>host in [a-z]* ; do ... ; done</i> to work (say generating
  symlinks to an new config file in all hosts). Well at least you can do this so
  long no one goes and sets LANGUAGE= or similar junk, then bash (or libc?) will
  hapily screw up case sensitivity and produce random lossage (yes, it was
  painfull).
<div class="Pp"></div>
After this add to <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/</i>, the actual config
  files as far as they are not host specific, or at least have an common section
  to all hosts. Example this would be <b>/etc/hosts</b> for all, an common
  section for <b>/etc/motd</b>, common or all for <b>sendmail.cf</b>, common for
  <b>inetd.conf</b>, nothing for the ssh hostkeys.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then add, to an group, say <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/STUDENTS/</i>,
  whatever is specific to that group. Example this may be an entire special
  <b>motd</b> for the many changing users, or just an <b>motd.group</b> to
  #@include into the common one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then for each host in its <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/prof1/</i> (or so)
  add all that is specific to it. Such as its ssh key files. And its own
  <b>motd.host</b>, it it needs one. Same its <b>inetd.conf.host</b> if it is
  going to offer special stuff. An configs for services only this host has such
  as <b>httpd.conf</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then for each host add symlinks to the SITE or group versions that it is to use
  for common stuff, like on <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/stud1/</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 .../dphys-config/stud1/dphys-config.list -&gt; ../SITE/dphys-config.list
 .../dphys-config/stud1/hosts -&gt; ../SITE/hosts
 .../dphys-config/stud1/inetd.conf -&gt; ../SITE/inetd.conf
 .../dphys-config/stud1/motd -&gt; ../SITE/motd
 .../dphys-config/stud1/motd.group -&gt; GROUP/motd
 .../dphys-config/stud1/GROUP -&gt; ../STUDENTS
 .../dphys-config/stud1/sendmail.cf -&gt; ../SITE/sendmail.cf
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/SITE/</i> directory place the
  site-global common <b>dphys-config.list</b> for all your hosts, containing
  stuff like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
# SITE dphys-config.list - just example stuff, for our exemplaric site
# basics
hosts:/etc/                      # simply works, no command
motd:/etc/                       # this will be assembled group specific
inetd.conf:/etc/:/etc/init.d/inetd restart  # needs an command to reload
sendmail.cf:/etc/mail/:/etc/init.d/sendmail restart  # not in /etc
# ssh restart only after last file, and ensure file modes for each file
ssh_host_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}
ssh_host_rsa_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}
ssh_host_dsa_key:/etc/ssh/:chown root:root {}; chmod 600 {}; /etc/init.d/sshd restart
# load stuff into an existing database file
seed.debconf:/etc/:debconf-set-selections {}
# other stuff
daemon1-conf:/etc/daemon1/conf   # rename so names can differ on server
daemon2-conf:/etc/daemon2/conf
daemon1/conf:/etc/               # same as above, but with directories on server
daemon2/conf:/etc/
testing:/etc/                    # put something in there for an test
# delete some stuff
-:/etc/testing                   # change to above test to get rid of it again
-:/etc/                          # you will get a warning if you leave this
#-:/etc                          # you would reinstall your system after the resulting  rm -rf /etc  :-)
# and some errors
#only-an-name                    # you would get an error: no place on target
#only-an-name:                   # you would get an error: no place on target
#:only-an-place                  # you would get an error: no file to install
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For special services add an <b>dphys-config.list.host</b> on each host that has
  special config files not present on others, such as on
  <i>/vhost/www.admin/dphys-config/server2/</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
# server2 dphys-config.list.host - only used on our web server
httpd.conf:/etc/apache/httpd.conf:/etc/init.d/apache restart
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can also use dphys-config to run arbitrary commands, whenever config files
  are installed/updated or removed, to modify existing config files, or more
  likely modify complex config databases which can not be provided as files, but
  where one can provide edit info as files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
dphys-config can even install scripts to use as above commands (or even just to
  run scripts while installing), such as into <i>/usr/local/sbin/</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For this make an <i>../SITE/local/sbin/</i> directory, place the scripts in
  there (such as <i>../SITE/local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt;</i>), and
  symlink <i>local</i> to <i>../SITE/local</i> on each host, and then add config
  lines for the scripts, with the command to trigger them, giving something like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt;:/usr/:chmod 755 {}; {}  # chmod and run
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It this script processes an config file your will want it to be run if either
  the script or the config file is updated, so add the script to the laters line
  as well:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt;:/etc/:if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt; ] ; then /usr/local/sbin/dphys-config-&lt;whatever&gt; ; fi  # run also here
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, new hosts can then later simply be added, by making the new hosts
  directory and copying all files and symlinks from an existing host of the same
  group. Such as by doing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
mkdir student21
tar -cf - -C student1 . | tar xpf - -C student21
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To then run dphys-config by hand (say for tests), type on the host:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dphys-config</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But usually you will want to run dphys-config automatically, every night (or if
  a machine was/is switched off, at every boot), to keep your configs up to
  date.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For nightly updates the best thing is to use an cron job on every host. 03:00 to
  03:59 is most likely idle time. Use an line like this one, with the
  <i>cron</i> option to avoid an load peak on the config file server, by random
  delaying the run by 0..3599 seconds, and with stdout and strerr thrown away to
  avoid getting an mail from every host, as error messages are also allways sent
  to syslog:
<div class="Pp"></div>
0 3 * * *	root	dphys-config cron &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
<div class="Pp"></div>
To catch machines switched off over night, with no cron run on them, also run an
  init.d script. Use an script like this one, also with stdout and stderr thrown
  away to avoid cluttering your boot console output:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# /etc/init.d/dphys-config - boot time automatic config updates, if no cron
case &quot;$1&quot; in
  start)
    dphys-config init &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    ;;
esac
exit 0
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
If dphys-config is to be used to distribute <i>all</i> config files, this will
  also include files which are security relevant, such as ssh private keys (host
  key or (root) user authentification), SSL certificates, passwd and shadow,
  lilo.conf, software license keys, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As all files are most likely fetched from an http: URL, measures must be taken
  to secure the config website from other people downloading them. We here use
  an restriction to only IP addresses registered as hosts in our NIS server, and
  additionally run identd on all allowed hosts, and require the wget process
  opening the HTTP connection to be running by user root, and so also require
  dphys-config to run as root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To avoid sniffing it is recommended to give wget an https: URL.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GOTCHAS"><a class="selflink" href="#GOTCHAS">GOTCHAS</a></h1>
Config files are read by wget from an webserver, so they lose their owners and
  modes. So the commands triggered on their lines must be used to chown/chmod
  them to proper values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When used together with <i>dphys-admin</i>, dphys-config should run as first
  (earlier cron and init.d entries). This is needed to provide configs before
  new packages are installed, so dphys-admin can pretend that the packages were
  already once installed (and then non-purge removed), and so prevent questions
  on install, which is required for unattended installs. [Note that this
  pretending does not go as far as setting debconf up. Broken packages that
  ignore config files and only look at debconf will still ask questions.]
<div class="Pp"></div>
As result of this, when installing for the first time on an new system (such as
  installing Debian by the <i>dphys3</i> end2stage feature, which installs first
  dphys-config and then dphys-admin), any scripts installed by packages by
  dphys-admin, to be called on config file install/update will still be missing,
  and so not runnable. Either ignore the warnings, or better call the scripts by
  something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
file:place:if [ -x script ]; then script; fi
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that in this case, trying to run dphys-config for a second time after
  dphys-admin has installed packages and scripts, will <b>not</b> automatically
  mend this, as the config files have not changed, and so dphys-config will not
  (re-)run their scripts. Therefore packages containing such scripts must also,
  as part of their postinst (or init.d which is called by postinst), check for
  existing config files and then run their scripts. This is the normal behaviour
  of quite a few packages anyway. Of course this requires the scripts to be
  idempotent, which is official Debian policy anyway.
