<p>UUENVIEW(1) General Commands Manual UUENVIEW(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
uuenview - a powerful encoder for binary files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uuenview [options] file(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
uuenview encodes a binary file into ASCII text for sending
over non-8-bit electronic data channels, such as electronic
mail or the usenet. uuenview is a superset of and fully <br>
backwards compatible with the standard uuencode(1) command,
featuring more comfort and more flexibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files encoded with uuenview are
compatible with virtually all decoders, as long as the
encoding method (see below) is supported by the remote side.
If the remote side uses uude&acirc; <br>
view(1), there shouldn&rsquo;t be any problems at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If properly configured, uuenview
can directly send encoded files by email or to the usenet.
These messages are wrapped into a proper MIME envelope,
which is handy if the recipi&acirc; <br>
ent uses MIME-compliant mail or news software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ENCODING SELECTION <br>
-b Chooses the Base64 encoding method as specified by the
MIME standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Chooses the uuencoding
method, for compatibility with uuencode(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Chooses the yEncoding
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Chooses the now obsolete
xxencoding method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Sends the file(s) as plain
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Encodes the file(s) using
quoted printable encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are positional and
affect the encoding of all remaining files on the command
line until changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending, posting or
attaching files, the default is to use Base64, resulting in
MIME compliant messages. Otherwise, when encoding to
standard output or into a file, the <br>
default is to use uuencoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGETS <br>
-o Specifies that output shall be written into files. These
files will have the same base name as the source file and an
extension of .001, .002 etc, depending on the number <br>
of parts required by the -lines option. The encoded files
are written to the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-od path <br>
Same as &rsquo;-o&rsquo;, but the encoded files are written
to the given directory instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m email <br>
Mails the encoded file(s), each one probably split into
multiple parts, to the given email address. Multiple
recipients can be given as a quoted, comma-separated list.
On <br>
Unix systems, mail is usually piped to sendmail(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p newsgroup <br>
Posts the encoded file(s), each one probably split into
multiple parts, to the given newsgroup. Multiple newsgroups
can be given as a quoted, comma-separated list. The <br>
inews(1) program is invoked for posting. You may have to set
the NNTPSERVER enviroment variable to your news server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Attaches files. This feature
is expected to be used from shell scripts and the like. In
attach mode, a message is read from standard input, complete
with headers. The <br>
files given on the command line are then
&quot;attached&quot; to the message, which is converted, if
necessary, to a proper MIME multipart format. The -a option
can be combined with <br>
-m or -p in order to directly mail or post the result. Else,
the message, complete with attachments, is written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no target option is given,
the encoded data is printed to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEADERS <br>
When mailing or posting a file, it is possible to set
certain headers. Be careful to quote parameters that consist
of more than one word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s subject <br>
Set the Subject: header line. The file name and part number
are automatically appended. Without this, a default subject
header is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f from <br>
Set the From: header line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r reply <br>
Set the Reply-To: header line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER <br>
-v Verbosely prints everything the program&rsquo;s trying to
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lines Substituting lines with a
number, sets the maximum number of encoded lines per part.
The encoded data is automatically split into as many parts
as required. Line counts <br>
less than 200 are ignored. The uuencoding and xxencoding
methods encode 45k, and Base64 encodes 57k of data in 1000
lines. If this option is not specified, the default is <br>
unlimited lines per part, resulting in exactly one part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file(s) <br>
One or more filenames to be processed. To encode a file from
the standard input, use a single hyphen &rsquo;-&rsquo; and
give a filename to be used for the encoded file as the next
<br>
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may also be set in the
$UUENVIEW environment variable, which is read before
processing the options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Files read from standard input can only be used once,
meaning that at most one target option may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output written to standard
output cannot be split into multiple parts. In this case,
the -lines option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uuenview must be correctly
configured at compile time in order for mailing and posting
to work. If it doesn&rsquo;t, consult your system
administrator. The program used for posting a <br>
file can be set at runtime using the INEWS environment
variable. This setting overrides the compile-time
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Base64 is not MIME. Base64 is
the encoding specified by the MIME standard, but in order
for a message to become a proper MIME message, a number of
headers are required. uuenview <br>
produces these headers when mailing or posting, but not when
writing to a file. In this case, uuenview does not have any
control over the headers. If you include Base64 output <br>
into your messages, they are not MIME-compliant!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you rename, copy or link the
program to uuencode, it may act as a smart replacement for
the standard, accepting the same command-line syntax. This
has not been well-tested <br>
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
uuenview -m &rsquo;root,fred@somewhere.com&rsquo;
uudeview.tgz <br>
Encodes the file uudeview.tgz and mails it to both your
local system administrator and to your friend Fred at the
Somewhere company.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give more than one
filename on the command line, each file is usually handled
separately. A workaround is to send them all as attachment
to a single (or empty) mail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uuenview -m root -b -a file1
file2 &lt; /dev/null <br>
Creates an empty mail and attaches the two given files,
encoded in Base64 format, and mails the result to your
system administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The program does not detect error conditions when mailing or
posting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attaching only works reliably if
certain headers of the input message (for example
Content-Type) are not folded and shorter than 1024
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to encode
into BinHex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will quite likely
fail to handle binary data as input for plain text or
quoted-printable attachments. On plain text attachments, the
line length (must be less than <br>
998 characters according to MIME) is not enforced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to set the
&quot;charset&quot; value of plain text attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to set the
content type value of attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendmail(8) stops reading upon a
line consisting only of a single dot. uudeview does not
check plain text input files against this condition. (The
problem is worked around when <br>
using quoted-printable, and does not exist with the other
encodings.)</p>
