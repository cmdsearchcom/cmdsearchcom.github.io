<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The s_client command implements a generic SSL/TLS client
which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS. It is a very
useful diagnostic tool for SSL servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-connect host:port <br>
This specifies the host and optional port to connect to. If
not specified then an attempt is made to connect to the
local host on port 4433.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cert certname <br>
The certificate to use, if one is requested by the server.
The default is not to use a certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-certform format <br>
The certificate format to use: DER or PEM. PEM is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-key keyfile <br>
The private key to use. If not specified then the
certificate file will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keyform format <br>
The private format to use: DER or PEM. PEM is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pass arg <br>
the private key password source. For more information about
the format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in
openssl(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verify depth <br>
The verify depth to use. This specifies the maximum length
of the server certificate chain and turns on server
certificate verification. Currently the verify operation
<br>
continues after errors so all the problems with a
certificate chain can be seen. As a side effect the
connection will never fail due to a server certificate
verify failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CApath directory <br>
The directory to use for server certificate verification.
This directory must be in &quot;hash format&quot;, see
verify for more information. These are also used when
building the <br>
client certificate chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CAfile file <br>
A file containing trusted certificates to use during server
authentication and to use when attempting to build the
client certificate chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-purpose, -ignore_critical,
-issuer_checks, -crl_check, -crl_check_all, -policy_check,
-extended_crl, -x509_strict, -policy -check_ss_sig,
-trusted_first <br>
Set various certificate chain valiadition option. See the
verify manual page for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-krb5svc service <br>
the Kerberos service name to use (default &quot;host&quot;).
This means s_server will expect a ticket for the principal
service/hostname@REALM, and will need keys for that
principal in <br>
its keytab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keytab filename <br>
the Kerberos &quot;keytab&quot; (key table) file, containing
keys for the s_server service principal (Kerberos identity;
see -krb5svc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-reconnect <br>
reconnects to the same server 5 times using the same session
ID, this can be used as a test that session caching is
working.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pause <br>
pauses 1 second between each read and write call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showcerts <br>
display the whole server certificate chain: normally only
the server certificate itself is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prexit <br>
print session information when the program exits. This will
always attempt to print out information even if the
connection fails. Normally information will only be printed
<br>
out once if the connection succeeds. This option is useful
because the cipher in use may be renegotiated or the
connection may fail because a client certificate is required
<br>
or is requested only after an attempt is made to access a
certain URL. Note: the output produced by this option is not
always accurate because a connection might never have <br>
been established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-state <br>
prints out the SSL session states.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug <br>
print extensive debugging information including a hex dump
of all traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msg <br>
show all protocol messages with hex dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nbio_test <br>
tests non-blocking I/O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nbio <br>
turns on non-blocking I/O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crlf <br>
this option translated a line feed from the terminal into
CR+LF as required by some servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ign_eof <br>
inhibit shutting down the connection when end of file is
reached in the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_ign_eof <br>
shut down the connection when end of file is reached in the
input. Can be used to override the implicit -ign_eof after
-quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
inhibit printing of session and certificate information.
This implicitly turns on -ign_eof as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-psk_identity identity <br>
Use the PSK identity identity when using a PSK cipher
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-psk key <br>
Use the PSK key key when using a PSK cipher suite. The key
is given as a hexadecimal number without leading 0x, for
example -psk 1a2b3c4d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ssl2, -ssl3, -tls1, -tls1_1,
-tls1_2, -dtls1, -no_ssl2, -no_ssl3, -no_tls1, -no_tls1_1,
-no_tls1_2 <br>
these options disable the use of certain SSL or TLS
protocols. By default the initial handshake uses a method
which should be compatible with all servers and permit them
to <br>
use SSL v3, SSL v2 or TLS as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately there are a lot of
ancient and broken servers in use which cannot handle this
technique and will fail to connect. Some servers only work
if TLS is turned off <br>
with the -no_tls option others will only support SSL v2 and
may need the -ssl2 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fallback_scsv <br>
Send TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV in the ClientHello.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bugs <br>
there are several known bug in SSL and TLS implementations.
Adding this option enables various workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cipher cipherlist <br>
this allows the cipher list sent by the client to be
modified. Although the server determines which cipher suite
is used it should take the first supported cipher in the
list <br>
sent by the client. See the ciphers command for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-starttls protocol <br>
send the protocol-specific message(s) to switch to TLS for
communication. protocol is a keyword for the intended
protocol. Currently, the only supported keywords are <br>
&quot;smtp&quot;, &quot;pop3&quot;, &quot;imap&quot;, and
&quot;ftp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tlsextdebug <br>
print out a hex dump of any TLS extensions received from the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_ticket <br>
disable RFC4507bis session ticket support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sess_out filename <br>
output SSL session to filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sess_in sess.pem <br>
load SSL session from filename. The client will attempt to
resume a connection from this session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-engine id <br>
specifying an engine (by its unique id string) will cause
s_client to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the
specified engine, thus initialising it if needed. The <br>
engine will then be set as the default for all available
algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rand file(s) <br>
a file or files containing random data used to seed the
random number generator, or an EGD socket (see RAND_egd(3)).
Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS- <br>
dependent character. The separator is ; for MS-Windows, ,
for OpenVMS, and : for all others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nextprotoneg protocols <br>
enable Next Protocol Negotiation TLS extension and provide a
list of comma-separated protocol names that the client
should advertise support for. The list should contain most
<br>
wanted protocols first. Protocol names are printable ASCII
strings, for example &quot;http/1.1&quot; or
&quot;spdy/3&quot;. Empty list of protocols is treated
specially and will cause the <br>
client to advertise support for the TLS extension but
disconnect just after reciving ServerHello with a list of
server supported protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTED COMMANDS <br>
If a connection is established with an SSL server then any
data received from the server is displayed and any key
presses will be sent to the server. When used interactively
<br>
(which means neither -quiet nor -ign_eof have been given),
the session will be renegotiated if the line begins with an
R, and if the line begins with a Q or if end of file is <br>
reached, the connection will be closed down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
s_client can be used to debug SSL servers. To connect to an
SSL HTTP server the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openssl s_client -connect
servername:443</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would typically be used (https
uses port 443). If the connection succeeds then an HTTP
command can be given such as &quot;GET /&quot; to retrieve a
web page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the handshake fails then
there are several possible causes, if it is nothing obvious
like no client certificate then the -bugs, -ssl2, -ssl3,
-tls1, -no_ssl2, -no_ssl3, <br>
-no_tls1 options can be tried in case it is a buggy server.
In particular you should play with these options before
submitting a bug report to an OpenSSL mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A frequent problem when
attempting to get client certificates working is that a web
client complains it has no certificates or gives an empty
list to choose from. This is <br>
normally because the server is not sending the clients
certificate authority in its &quot;acceptable CA list&quot;
when it requests a certificate. By using s_client the CA
list can be <br>
viewed and checked. However some servers only request client
authentication after a specific URL is requested. To obtain
the list in this case it is necessary to use the -prexit
<br>
option and send an HTTP request for an appropriate page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a certificate is specified on
the command line using the -cert option it will not be used
unless the server specifically requests a client
certificate. Therefor merely <br>
including a client certificate on the command line is no
guarantee that the certificate works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are problems verifying
a server certificate then the -showcerts option can be used
to show the whole chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the SSLv23 client hello
cannot include compression methods or extensions these will
only be supported if its use is disabled, for example by
using the -no_sslv2 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Because this program has a lot of options and also because
some of the techniques used are rather old, the C source of
s_client is rather hard to read and not a model of how <br>
things should be done. A typical SSL client program would be
much simpler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -verify option should really
exit if the server verification fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -prexit option is a bit of a
hack. We should really report information whenever a session
is renegotiated.</p>
