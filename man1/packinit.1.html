<p>PACKINIT(1) General Commands Manual PACKINIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
packinit - initialize or update your .package file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
packinit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Packinit will create (or update) a .package file, so that
all the dist tools can be smart and know some basic things
about your package, such as its revision number, or the e-
<br>
mail address of its maintainer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packinit should be run from the
top level directory of your package, before using any other
dist tool. Later on, you may rerun it to update some of its
values. Packinit will <br>
create a single file and leave the remaining of your
directory undisturbed.</p>

file:</p>
