<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
blinkenlights - DNSSEC-Tools rollerd GUI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
blinkenlights &lt;rollrec-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
blinkenlights is a GUI tool for use with monitoring and
controlling the DNSSEC-Tools rollerd program. It displays
information on the current state of the zones rollerd is
<br>
managing. The user may control some aspects of
rollerd&rsquo;s execution using blinkenlights menu
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blinkenlights creates a window
in which to display information about each zone rollerd is
managing. (These zones are those in rollerd&rsquo;s current
rollrec file.) As a zone&rsquo;s <br>
rollover status changes, blinkenlights will update its
display for that zone. Skipped zones, zones listed in the
rollrec file but which are not in rollover or normal
operation, <br>
are displayed but have very little useful information to
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may also select a set
of zones to hide from the display. These zones, if in the
rolling state, will continue to roll; however, their zone
information will not be <br>
displayed. Display state for each zone will persist across
blinkenlights executions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu commands are available for
controlling rollerd. The commands which operate on a single
zone may be executed by keyboard shortcuts. The zone may be
selected either by <br>
clicking in its &quot;zone stripe&quot; or by choosing from
a dialog box. Display and execution options for
blinkenlights are also available through menu commands. More
information about <br>
the menu commands is available in the MENU COMMANDS
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blinkenlights is only intended
to be started by rollerd, not directly by a user. There are
two ways to have rollerd start blinkenlights. First, rollctl
may be given the <br>
-display option. Second, the -display option may be given on
rollerd&rsquo;s command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
blinkenlights takes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display <br>
Tells rollerd to execute blinkenlights as a child
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxzones <br>
Tells blinkenlights how many zones to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Displays the version information for blinkenlights and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays a usage message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCREEN LAYOUT <br>
The blinkenlights window is laid out as a series of
&quot;stripes&quot;. The top stripe contains status
information about rollerd, the second stripe contains column
headers, and the bulk <br>
of the window consists of zone stripes. The list below
provides more detail on the contents of each stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the WINDOW COLORS section
for a discussion of the colors used for the zone
stripes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; rollerd
information stripe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information stripe contains
five pieces of information: rollerd&rsquo;s current rollrec
file, the count of rolling zones, the count of skipped
zones, the count of zones to be <br>
displayed, and the amount of time rollerd waits between
processing its queue. Coincidentally, that last datum is
also the amount of time between blinkenlights screen <br>
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; column headers
stripe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This stripe contains the column
headers for the columns of each zone stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; zone stripes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each zone managed by rollerd
(i.e., every zone in the current rollrec file) will have a
zone stripe which describes that zone&rsquo;s current state.
The stripe is divided into <br>
three sections: zone identification, the current rollover
state, and the zone&rsquo;s DNSSEC keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zone identification section
contains the name of the zone, the name of the zone&rsquo;s
rollrec entry, and the zone&rsquo;s zonegroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rollover state section
contains the rollover phase number, a text explanation of
the phase, and the amount of time remaining in that rollover
phase. The phase <br>
explanation is &quot;normal operation&quot; when the zone
isn&rsquo;t currently in rollover.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNSSEC key section contains
two subsections, one for the zone&rsquo;s ZSK keys and
another for the zone&rsquo;s KSK keys. Each subsection
contains the names of the signing sets <br>
active for the zone. The ZSK subsection lists the Current,
Published, and New ZSK keys; the KSK subsection lists the
Current and Published.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the WINDOW COLORS section
for a discussion of the colors used for the zone
stripes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOW COLORS <br>
The default blinkenlights configuration uses window coloring
to provide visual cues and to aid in easily distinguishing
zone information. The default window coloring behavior <br>
gives each zone stripe has its own color and the rollover
state section of each zone stripe is shaded to show the
zone&rsquo;s phase. Window coloring can be turned off (and
on) with <br>
configuration options and menu commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color Usage <br>
The two window coloring behaviors are discussed more fully
below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; zone stripe
colors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each rolling zone&rsquo;s stripe
is given one of three colors: blue, red, or green. The color
is assigned on a top-down basis and the colors wrap if there
are more than three <br>
zones. So, the first zone is always blue, the second zone
red, the third zone green, the fourth zone blue, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors do not stay with a
particular zone. If a rolling zone becomes a skipped zone,
the zone stripes will be reassigned new colors to account
for that skipped zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Skipped zones are not colored
with these three colors. Stripes for skipped zones are
colored either grey or a color set in the configuration
file. If you choose to use a <br>
non-standard color for skipped zones your should ensure that
it is not one of the colors used for rolling zones&rsquo;
stripes. Modifying the skipcolor configuration field allows
<br>
the skipped-zone color to be changing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors configuration field
can be used to turn on or off the use of colors for zone
stripes. If stripe coloring is turned off, then every stripe
will be displayed using <br>
the skipcolor color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; rollover-state
shading</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only portion of a zone
stripe that changes color is the status column; the color of
the rest of the zone stripe stays constant. Before a zone
enters rollover, the status <br>
column is the same color as the rest of the stripe. When the
zone enters rollover, the status column&rsquo;s color is
changed to a very light shade of the stripe&rsquo;s normal
color. <br>
As the rollover phases progress towards rollover completion,
the status column&rsquo;s shade darkens. Once rollover
completes, the status column returns again to the same shade
as <br>
the rest of that stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shading configuration field
can be used to turn on or off the use of shading in the
rollover-state column. If shading is turned off, then the
zone stripe will be a solid <br>
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the CONFIGURATION FILE
section for information on setting the configuration
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors Used <br>
The color names are taken from the X11 rgb.txt file (X11
1.1.3 - XFree86 4.4.0 for MacOS X.) If these aren&rsquo;t
available in your rgb.txt file, similar names should be
selected. <br>
The actual red/green/blue values used are given below to
assist in finding suitable replacements. These values were
taken from the rgb.txt file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU COMMANDS <br>
A number of menu commands are available to control the
behavior of blinkenlights and to send commands to rollerd.
These commands are discusses in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Menu <br>
The commands in this menu are basic GUI commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Halt Rollerd
After Current Operations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd&rsquo;s execution is
halted after completing its current set of zone operations.
As a result, blinkenlights&rsquo; execution will also be
halted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Halt Rollerd
Now</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollerd&rsquo;s execution is
halted immediately. As a result, blinkenlights&rsquo;
execution will also be halted. If rollerd&rsquo;s command
queue already contains a set of commands, they <br>
may be processed prior to this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blinkenlights will stop
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Menu <br>
The commands in this menu control the appearance and
behavior of blinkenlights.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Row Colors
(toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item is a toggle to
turn on or off the coloring of zone stripes. If row coloring
is turned off, zone stripes will all be the same color. If
row coloring is turned <br>
on, zone stripes will be displayed in varying colors. See
the WINDOW COLORS section for a discussion of row
coloring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Status Column
Shading (toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item is a toggle to
turn on or off the shading of the zone status column. If
shading is turned off, the zone stripes will present a
solid, unchanging band of color <br>
for each zone. If shading is turned on, the color of the
zone status column will change according to the zone&rsquo;s
rollover state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Skipped Zones
Display (toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item is a toggle to
turn on or off the display of skipped zones. If display is
turned off, zone stripes for skipped zones will not be
displayed. If display is <br>
turned on, zone stripes for all zones will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Status Times
Display (toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item is a toggle to
turn on or off the display of status times. If display is
turned off, the remaining time for a rollover phase will not
be displayed in the <br>
&quot;Status&quot; column. If display is turned on, the
remaining times will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modification
Commands (toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some situations, it may be
desirable to turn off blinkenlights&rsquo; ability to send
commands to rollerd. This menu item is a toggle to turn on
or off this ability. If the <br>
commands are turned off, then the &quot;ZSK Control&quot;
and &quot;KSK Control&quot; menus and their keyboard
shortcuts are disabled. If the commands are turned on, then
the &quot;ZSK Control&quot; and <br>
&quot;KSK Control&quot; menus and their keyboard shortcuts
are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Font Size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item allows selection
of font size of text displayed in the main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, changing the font size
causes the window to grow and shrink as required. However,
on Mac OS X there seems to be a problem when the size
selected increases the <br>
window size to be greater than will fit on the screen. If
the font size is subsequently reduced, the window size does
not shrink in response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Zones to
Display</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item allows selection
of the number of zones to be displayed in the main
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Control Menu <br>

value&quot; format, where field specifies the output aspect
and value defines the value for that field. The following
are the recognized fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty lines and comments are
ignored. Comment lines are lines that start with an
octothorpe (&rsquo;#&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spaces are not allowed in the
configuration values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose your skipcolors
carefully. The only foreground color used is black, so your
background colors must work well with black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The noshow command controls
display of the various data columns. The command valid
values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rollrecs Turn off display of the
rollrec names column. <br>
This value may not be used with &quot;noshow
zonenames&quot;. <br>
zonenames Turn off display of the zonenames column. <br>
This value may not be used with &quot;noshow rollrecs&quot;.
<br>
zonegroups Turn off display of the zonegroups column. <br>
kskset Turn off display of the KSK signing set columns. <br>
zskset Turn off display of the ZSK signing set columns. <br>
keysets Turn off display of the KSK and ZSK signing set
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
blinkenlights is implemented in Perl/Tk, so both Perl and
Perl/Tk must be installed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
blinkenlights has several potential problems that must be
taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">development environment <br>
blinkenlights was developed and tested on a single-user
system running X11 using a relatively small number of zones.
While it works fine in this environment, it has not been
<br>
run on a system with many users or in a situation where the
system console hasn&rsquo;t been in use by the blinkenlights
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long-term performance issues
<br>
In early tests, the longer blinkenlights runs, the slower
the updates become. This is probably a result of the Tk
implementation or the way Tk interfaces with X11. This is
<br>
pure supposition, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This performance impact is
affected by a number of things, such as the number of zones
managed by rollerd and the length of rollerd&rsquo;s sleep
interval. Large numbers of zones <br>
or very short sleep intervals will increase the possibility
of blinkenlights&rsquo; performance degrading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This appears to have been
resolved by periodically performing a complete rebuild of
the screen. blinkenlights keeps track of the number of
screen updates it makes and <br>
rebuilds the screen when this count exceeds a threshold. The
threshold is built into blinkenlights and stored in the
$paintmax variable. This threshold may be adjusted if <br>
there are too many screen rebuilds or if
blinkenlights&rsquo; performance slows too much. Raising the
number will reduce the screen rebuilds; lowering the number
will (may) <br>
increase performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display irregularities <br>
If the user modifies the number of zones to be displayed,
then sometimes the blinkenlights window is left in an
irregular state. The requested number of zones are
displayed, <br>
but there is a large grey void above and below the zone
display. This is an occasional problem and will be fixed as
time allows.</p>
