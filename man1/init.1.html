<p>SYSTEMD(1) systemd SYSTEMD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
systemd, init - systemd system and service manager</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
systemd [OPTIONS...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">init [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating
systems. When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it
acts as init system that brings up and maintains userspace
<br>
services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with SysV, if
systemd is called as init and a PID that is not 1, it will
execute telinit and pass all command line arguments
unmodified. That means init and <br>
telinit are mostly equivalent when invoked from normal login
sessions. See telinit(8) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run as a system instance,
systemd interprets the configuration file system.conf and
the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a user
instance, systemd interprets <br>
the configuration file user.conf and the files in
user.conf.d directories. See systemd-system.conf(5) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test <br>
Determine startup sequence, dump it and exit. This is an
option useful for debugging only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-configuration-items <br>
Dump understood unit configuration items. This outputs a
terse but complete list of configuration items understood in
unit definition files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unit= <br>
Set default unit to activate on startup. If not specified,
defaults to default.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system, --user <br>
For --system, tell systemd to run a system instance, even if
the process ID is not 1, i.e. systemd is not run as init
process. --user does the opposite, running a user <br>
instance even if the process ID is 1. Normally, it should
not be necessary to pass these options, as systemd
automatically detects the mode it is started in. These
options <br>
are hence of little use except for debugging. Note that it
is not supported booting and maintaining a full system with
systemd running in --system mode, but PID not 1. In <br>
practice, passing --system explicitly is only useful in
conjunction with --test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-core <br>
Enable core dumping on crash. This switch has no effect when
running as user instance. This setting may also be enabled
during boot on the kernel command line via the <br>
systemd.dump_core= option, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--crash-vt=VT <br>
Switch to a specific virtual console (VT) on crash. Takes a
positive integer in the range 1&acirc;63, or a boolean
argument. If an integer is passed, selects which VT to
switch to. <br>
If yes, the VT kernel messages are written to is selected.
If no, no VT switch is attempted. This switch has no effect
when running as user instance. This setting may also be <br>
enabled during boot, on the kernel command line via the
systemd.crash_vt= option, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--crash-shell <br>
Run a shell on crash. This switch has no effect when running
as user instance. This setting may also be enabled during
boot, on the kernel command line via the <br>
systemd.crash_shell= option, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--crash-reboot <br>
Automatically reboot the system on crash. This switch has no
effect when running as user instance. This setting may also
be enabled during boot, on the kernel command line <br>
via the systemd.crash_reboot= option, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confirm-spawn <br>
Ask for confirmation when spawning processes. This switch
has no effect when run as user instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-status= <br>
Show terse service status information while booting. This
switch has no effect when run as user instance. Takes a
boolean argument which may be omitted which is interpreted
<br>
as true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-target= <br>
Set log target. Argument must be one of console, journal,
kmsg, journal-or-kmsg, null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-level= <br>
Set log level. As argument this accepts a numerical log
level or the well-known syslog(3) symbolic names
(lowercase): emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info,
debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-color= <br>
Highlight important log messages. Argument is a boolean
value. If the argument is omitted, it defaults to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-location= <br>
Include code location in log messages. This is mostly
relevant for debugging purposes. Argument is a boolean
value. If the argument is omitted it defaults to true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-standard-output=,
--default-standard-error= <br>
Sets the default output or error output for all services and
sockets, respectively. That is, controls the default for
StandardOutput= and StandardError= (see systemd.exec(5) <br>
for details). Takes one of inherit, null, tty, journal,
journal+console, syslog, syslog+console, kmsg, kmsg+console.
If the argument is omitted --default-standard-output= <br>
defaults to journal and --default-standard-error= to
inherit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--machine-id= <br>
Override the machine-id set on the hard drive, useful for
network booting or for containers. May not be set to all
zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print a short version string and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCEPTS <br>
systemd provides a dependency system between various
entities called &quot;units&quot; of 12 different types.
Units encapsulate various objects that are relevant for
system boot-up and <br>
maintenance. The majority of units are configured in unit
configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options
is described in systemd.unit(5), however some are created
<br>
automatically from other configuration, dynamically from
system state or programmatically at runtime. Units may be
&quot;active&quot; (meaning started, bound, plugged in, ...,
depending on <br>
the unit type, see below), or &quot;inactive&quot; (meaning
stopped, unbound, unplugged, ...), as well as in the process
of being activated or deactivated, i.e. between the two
states <br>
(these states are called &quot;activating&quot;,
&quot;deactivating&quot;). A special &quot;failed&quot;
state is available as well, which is very similar to
&quot;inactive&quot; and is entered when the service failed
<br>
in some way (process returned error code on exit, or
crashed, or an operation timed out). If this state is
entered, the cause will be logged, for later reference. Note
that the <br>
various unit types may have a number of additional
substates, which are mapped to the five generalized unit
states described here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following unit types are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Service units, which start
and control daemons and the processes they consist of. For
details, see systemd.service(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Socket units, which
encapsulate local IPC or network sockets in the system,
useful for socket-based activation. For details about socket
units, see systemd.socket(5), for <br>
details on socket-based activation and other forms of
activation, see daemon(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Target units are useful to
group units, or provide well-known synchronization points
during boot-up, see systemd.target(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Device units expose kernel
devices in systemd and may be used to implement device-based
activation. For details, see systemd.device(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Mount units control mount
points in the file system, for details see
systemd.mount(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Automount units provide
automount capabilities, for on-demand mounting of file
systems as well as parallelized boot-up. See
systemd.automount(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Timer units are useful for
triggering activation of other units based on timers. You
may find details in systemd.timer(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Swap units are very similar
to mount units and encapsulate memory swap partitions or
files of the operating system. They are described in
systemd.swap(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Path units may be used to
activate other services when file system objects change or
are modified. See systemd.path(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. Slice units may be used to
group units which manage system processes (such as service
and scope units) in a hierarchical tree for resource
management purposes. See <br>
systemd.slice(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11. Scope units are similar to
service units, but manage foreign processes instead of
starting them as well. See systemd.scope(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Units are named as their
configuration files. Some units have special semantics. A
detailed list is available in systemd.special(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd knows various kinds of
dependencies, including positive and negative requirement
dependencies (i.e. Requires= and Conflicts=) as well as
ordering dependencies (After= <br>
and Before=). NB: ordering and requirement dependencies are
orthogonal. If only a requirement dependency exists between
two units (e.g. foo.service requires bar.service), but no
<br>
ordering dependency (e.g. foo.service after bar.service) and
both are requested to start, they will be started in
parallel. It is a common pattern that both requirement and
<br>
ordering dependencies are placed between two units. Also
note that the majority of dependencies are implicitly
created and maintained by systemd. In most cases, it should
be <br>
unnecessary to declare additional dependencies manually,
however it is possible to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Application programs and units
(via dependencies) may request state changes of units. In
systemd, these requests are encapsulated as
&rsquo;jobs&rsquo; and maintained in a job queue. Jobs <br>
may succeed or can fail, their execution is ordered based on
the ordering dependencies of the units they have been
scheduled for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On boot systemd activates the
target unit default.target whose job is to activate on-boot
services and other on-boot units by pulling them in via
dependencies. Usually, the unit <br>
name is just an alias (symlink) for either graphical.target
(for fully-featured boots into the UI) or multi-user.target
(for limited console-only boots for use in embedded or <br>
server environments, or similar; a subset of
graphical.target). However, it is at the discretion of the
administrator to configure it as an alias to any other
target unit. See <br>
systemd.special(7) for details about these target units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processes systemd spawns are
placed in individual Linux control groups named after the
unit which they belong to in the private systemd hierarchy.
(see cgroups.txt[1] for more <br>
information about control groups, or short
&quot;cgroups&quot;). systemd uses this to effectively keep
track of processes. Control group information is maintained
in the kernel, and is <br>
accessible via the file system hierarchy (beneath
/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/), or in tools such as
systemd-cgls(1) or ps(1) (ps xawf -eo pid,user,cgroup,args
is particularly useful <br>
to list all processes and the systemd units they belong
to.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd is compatible with the
SysV init system to a large degree: SysV init scripts are
supported and simply read as an alternative (though limited)
configuration file format. <br>
The SysV /dev/initctl interface is provided, and
compatibility implementations of the various SysV client
tools are available. In addition to that, various
established Unix <br>
functionality such as /etc/fstab or the utmp database are
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd has a minimal
transaction system: if a unit is requested to start up or
shut down it will add it and all its dependencies to a
temporary transaction. Then, it will verify <br>
if the transaction is consistent (i.e. whether the ordering
of all units is cycle-free). If it is not, systemd will try
to fix it up, and removes non-essential jobs from the <br>
transaction that might remove the loop. Also, systemd tries
to suppress non-essential jobs in the transaction that would
stop a running service. Finally it is checked whether the
<br>
jobs of the transaction contradict jobs that have already
been queued, and optionally the transaction is aborted then.
If all worked out and the transaction is consistent and <br>
minimized in its impact it is merged with all already
outstanding jobs and added to the run queue. Effectively
this means that before executing a requested operation,
systemd <br>
will verify that it makes sense, fixing it if possible, and
only failing if it really cannot work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systemd contains native
implementations of various tasks that need to be executed as
part of the boot process. For example, it sets the hostname
or configures the loopback <br>
network device. It also sets up and mounts various API file
systems, such as /sys or /proc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
concepts and ideas behind systemd, please refer to the
Original Design Document[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some but not all
interfaces provided by systemd are covered by the Interface
Stability Promise[3].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Units may be generated
dynamically at boot and system manager reload time, for
example based on other configuration files or parameters
passed on the kernel command line. For <br>
details, see systemd.generator(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systems which invoke systemd in
a container or initrd environment should implement the
Container Interface[4] or initrd Interface[5]
specifications, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECTORIES <br>
System unit directories <br>
The systemd system manager reads unit configuration from
various directories. Packages that want to install unit
files shall place them in the directory returned by <br>
pkg-config systemd --variable=systemdsystemunitdir. Other
directories checked are /usr/local/lib/systemd/system and
/usr/lib/systemd/system. User configuration always takes
<br>
precedence. pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemdsystemconfdir returns the path of the
system configuration directory. Packages should alter the
content of these directories <br>
only with the enable and disable commands of the
systemctl(1) tool. Full list of directories is provided in
systemd.unit(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User unit directories <br>
Similar rules apply for the user unit directories. However,
here the XDG Base Directory specification[6] is followed to
find units. Applications should place their unit files <br>
in the directory returned by pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemduserunitdir. Global configuration is done
in the directory reported by pkg-config systemd <br>
--variable=systemduserconfdir. The enable and disable
commands of the systemctl(1) tool can handle both global
(i.e. for all users) and private (for one user) <br>
enabling/disabling of units. Full list of directories is
provided in systemd.unit(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SysV init scripts directory <br>
The location of the SysV init script directory varies
between distributions. If systemd cannot find a native unit
file for a requested service, it will look for a SysV init
<br>
script of the same name (with the .service suffix
removed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SysV runlevel link farm
directory <br>
The location of the SysV runlevel link farm directory varies
between distributions. systemd will take the link farm into
account when figuring out whether a service shall be <br>
enabled. Note that a service unit with a native unit
configuration file cannot be started by activating it in the
SysV runlevel link farm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
SIGTERM <br>
Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager
serializes its state, reexecutes itself and deserializes the
saved state again. This is mostly equivalent to systemctl
<br>
daemon-reexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd user managers will start
the exit.target unit when this signal is received. This is
mostly equivalent to systemctl --user start exit.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT <br>
Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager will
start the ctrl-alt-del.target unit. This is mostly
equivalent to systemctl start ctl-alt-del.target. If this
signal <br>
is received more than 7 times per 2s, an immediate reboot is
triggered. Note that pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del on the console
will trigger this signal. Hence, if a reboot is <br>
hanging, pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del more than 7 times in 2s is a
relatively safe way to trigger an immediate reboot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd user managers treat this
signal the same way as SIGTERM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGWINCH <br>
When this signal is received the systemd system manager will
start the kbrequest.target unit. This is mostly equivalent
to systemctl start kbrequest.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This signal is ignored by
systemd user managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGPWR <br>
When this signal is received the systemd manager will start
the sigpwr.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to
systemctl start sigpwr.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
When this signal is received the systemd manager will try to
reconnect to the D-Bus bus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
When this signal is received the systemd manager will log
its complete state in human-readable form. The data logged
is the same as printed by systemd-analyze dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP <br>
Reloads the complete daemon configuration. This is mostly
equivalent to systemctl daemon-reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+0 <br>
Enters default mode, starts the default.target unit. This is
mostly equivalent to systemctl start default.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+1 <br>
Enters rescue mode, starts the rescue.target unit. This is
mostly equivalent to systemctl isolate rescue.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+2 <br>
Enters emergency mode, starts the emergency.service unit.
This is mostly equivalent to systemctl isolate
emergency.service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+3 <br>
Halts the machine, starts the halt.target unit. This is
mostly equivalent to systemctl start halt.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+4 <br>
Powers off the machine, starts the poweroff.target unit.
This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
poweroff.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+5 <br>
Reboots the machine, starts the reboot.target unit. This is
mostly equivalent to systemctl start reboot.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+6 <br>
Reboots the machine via kexec, starts the kexec.target unit.
This is mostly equivalent to systemctl start
kexec.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+13 <br>
Immediately halts the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+14 <br>
Immediately powers off the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+15 <br>
Immediately reboots the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+16 <br>
Immediately reboots the machine with kexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+20 <br>
Enables display of status messages on the console, as
controlled via systemd.show_status=1 on the kernel command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+21 <br>
Disables display of status messages on the console, as
controlled via systemd.show_status=0 on the kernel command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+22, SIGRTMIN+23 <br>
Sets the log level to &quot;debug&quot; (or &quot;info&quot;
on SIGRTMIN+23), as controlled via systemd.log_level=debug
(or systemd.log_level=info on SIGRTMIN+23) on the kernel
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+24 <br>
Immediately exits the manager (only available for --user
instances).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGRTMIN+26, SIGRTMIN+27,
SIGRTMIN+28 <br>
Sets the log level to &quot;journal-or-kmsg&quot; (or
&quot;console&quot; on SIGRTMIN+27, &quot;kmsg&quot; on
SIGRTMIN+28), as controlled via
systemd.log_target=journal-or-kmsg (or <br>
systemd.log_target=console on SIGRTMIN+27 or
systemd.log_target=kmsg on SIGRTMIN+28) on the kernel
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL <br>
systemd reads the log level from this environment variable.
This can be overridden with --log-level=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET <br>
systemd reads the log target from this environment variable.
This can be overridden with --log-target=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR <br>
Controls whether systemd highlights important log messages.
This can be overridden with --log-color=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION <br>
Controls whether systemd prints the code location along with
log messages. This can be overridden with
--log-location=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME,
$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, $XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_DATA_DIRS <br>
The systemd user manager uses these variables in accordance
to the XDG Base Directory specification[6] to find its
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH <br>
Controls where systemd looks for unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_SYSVINIT_PATH <br>
Controls where systemd looks for SysV init scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_SYSVRCND_PATH <br>
Controls where systemd looks for SysV init script runlevel
link farms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$SYSTEMD_COLORS <br>
Controls whether colorized output should be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$LISTEN_PID, $LISTEN_FDS,
$LISTEN_FDNAMES <br>
Set by systemd for supervised processes during socket-based
activation. See sd_listen_fds(3) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$NOTIFY_SOCKET <br>
Set by systemd for supervised processes for status and
start-up completion notification. See sd_notify(3) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KERNEL COMMAND LINE <br>
When run as system instance systemd parses a number of
kernel command line arguments[7]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.unit=, rd.systemd.unit=
<br>
Overrides the unit to activate on boot. Defaults to
default.target. This may be used to temporarily boot into a
different boot unit, for example rescue.target or <br>
emergency.service. See systemd.special(7) for details about
these units. The option prefixed with &quot;rd.&quot; is
honored only in the initial RAM disk (initrd), while the one
that <br>
is not prefixed only in the main system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.dump_core= <br>
Takes a boolean argument. If yes, the systemd manager (PID
1) dumps core when it crashes. Otherwise, no core dump is
created. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.crash_chvt= <br>
Takes a positive integer, or a boolean argument. If a
positive integer (in the range 1&acirc;63) is specified, the
system manager (PID 1) will activate the specified virtual
<br>
terminal (VT) when it crashes. Defaults to no, meaning that
no such switch is attempted. If set to yes, the VT the
kernel messages are written to is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.crash_shell= <br>
Takes a boolean argument. If yes, the system manager (PID 1)
spawns a shell when it crashes, after a 10s delay.
Otherwise, no shell is spawned. Defaults to no, for security
<br>
reasons, as the shell is not protected by password
authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.crash_reboot= <br>
Takes a boolean argument. If yes, the system manager (PID 1)
will reboot the machine automatically when it crashes, after
a 10s delay. Otherwise, the system will hang <br>
indefinitely. Defaults to no, in order to avoid a reboot
loop. If combined with systemd.crash_shell=, the system is
rebooted after the shell exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.confirm_spawn= <br>
Takes a boolean argument. If yes, the system manager (PID 1)
asks for confirmation when spawning processes. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.show_status= <br>
Takes a boolean argument or the constant auto. If yes, the
systemd manager (PID 1) shows terse service status updates
on the console during bootup. auto behaves like false <br>
until a service fails or there is a significant delay in
boot. Defaults to yes, unless quiet is passed as kernel
command line option, in which case it defaults to auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.log_target=,
systemd.log_level=, systemd.log_color=,
systemd.log_location= <br>
Controls log output, with the same effect as the
$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET, $SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL, $SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR,
$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION environment variables described
above.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.default_standard_output=,
systemd.default_standard_error= <br>
Controls default standard output and error output for
services, with the same effect as the
--default-standard-output= and --default-standard-error=
command line arguments <br>
described above, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.setenv= <br>
Takes a string argument in the form VARIABLE=VALUE. May be
used to set default environment variables to add to forked
child processes. May be used more than once to set <br>
multiple variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd.machine_id= <br>
Takes a 32 character hex value to be used for setting the
machine-id. Intended mostly for network booting where the
same machine-id is desired for every boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet <br>
Turn off status output at boot, much like
systemd.show_status=false would. Note that this option is
also read by the kernel itself and disables kernel log
output. Passing <br>
this option hence turns off the usual output from both the
system manager and the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug <br>
Turn on debugging output. This is equivalent to
systemd.log_level=debug. Note that this option is also read
by the kernel itself and enables kernel debug output.
Passing this <br>
option hence turns on the debug output from both the system
manager and the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emergency, rd.emergency, -b <br>
Boot into emergency mode. This is equivalent to
systemd.unit=emergency.target or
rd.systemd.unit=emergency.target, respectively, and provided
for compatibility reasons and to <br>
be easier to type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rescue, rd.rescue, single, s, S,
1 <br>
Boot into rescue mode. This is equivalent to
systemd.unit=rescue.target or rd.systemd.unit=rescue.target,
respectively, and provided for compatibility reasons and to
be <br>
easier to type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2, 3, 4, 5 <br>
Boot into the specified legacy SysV runlevel. These are
equivalent to systemd.unit=runlevel2.target,
systemd.unit=runlevel3.target,
systemd.unit=runlevel4.target, and <br>
systemd.unit=runlevel5.target, respectively, and provided
for compatibility reasons and to be easier to type.</p>

Set the system locale to use. This overrides the settings in
/etc/locale.conf. For more information, see locale.conf(5)
and locale(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For other kernel command line
parameters understood by components of the core OS, please

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOCKETS AND FIFOS <br>
/run/systemd/notify <br>
Daemon status notification socket. This is an AF_UNIX
datagram socket and is used to implement the daemon
notification logic as implemented by sd_notify(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/run/systemd/private <br>
Used internally as communication channel between
systemctl(1) and the systemd process. This is an AF_UNIX
stream socket. This interface is private to systemd and
should not <br>
be used in external projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/initctl <br>
Limited compatibility support for the SysV client interface,
as implemented by the systemd-initctl.service unit. This is
a named pipe in the file system. This interface is <br>
obsolete and should not be used in new applications.</p>
