<p>pmount(1) General Commands Manual pmount(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmount - mount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmount [ options ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount [ options ] device
label</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount --lock [ options ] device
pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount --unlock [ options ]
device pid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmount (&quot;policy mount&quot;) is a wrapper around the
standard mount program which permits normal users to mount
removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount also supports encrypted
devices which use dm-crypt and have LUKS metadata. If a
LUKS-capable cryptsetup is installed, pmount will use it to
decrypt the device first and <br>
mount the mapped unencrypted device instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount is invoked like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmount device [ label ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will mount device to a
directory below /media if policy is met (see below). If
label is given, the mount point will be /media/label,
otherwise it will be /media/device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The device will be mounted with
the following flags:
async,atime,nodev,noexec,noauto,nosuid,user,rw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some applications like CD
burners modify a raw device which must not be mounted while
the burning process is in progress. To prevent automatic
mounting, pmount offers a locking <br>
mechanism: pmount --lock device pid will prevent the
pmounting of device until it is unlocked again using pmount
--unlock device pid. The process id pid assigns the lock to
a <br>
particular process; this allows to lock a device by several
processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During mount, the list of locks
is cleaned, i. e. all locks whose associated process does
not exist any more are removed. This prevents forgotten
indefinite locks from crashed <br>
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running pmount without arguments
prints the list of mounted removable devices, a bit in the
fashion of mount (1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that you can use
labels and uuids as described in fstab (5) for devices
present in /etc/fstab. In this case, the device name need to
match exactly the corresponding <br>
entry in /etc/fstab, including the LABEL= or UUID= part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY <br>
The mount will succeed if all of the following conditions
are met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is a
block device in /dev/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is not in
/etc/fstab (if it is, pmount executes mount device as the
calling user to handle this transparently). See below for
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is not
already mounted according to /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if the mount
point already exists, there is no device already mounted at
it and the directory is empty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is
removable (USB, FireWire, or MMC device, or
/sys/block/drive/removable is 1) or whitelisted in
/etc/pmount.allow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is not
locked</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-r, --read-only <br>
Force the device to be mounted read only. If neither -r nor
-w is specified, the kernel will choose an appropriate
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --read-write <br>
Force the device to be mounted read/write. If neither -r nor
-w is specified, the kernel will choose an appropriate
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sync <br>
Mount the device with the sync option, i. e. without write
caching. Default is async (write-back). With this option,
write operations are much slower and due to the mas&acirc;
<br>
sive increase of updates of inode/FAT structures, flash
devices may suffer heavily if you write large files. This
option is intended to make it safe to just rip out USB <br>
drives without proper unmounting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --noatime <br>
Mount the device with the noatime option. Default is
atime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --exec <br>
Mount the device with the exec option. Default is
noexec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t filesystem, --type filesystem
<br>
Mount as specified file system type. The file system type is
automatically determined if this option is not given. See at
the bottom for a list of currently supported <br>
filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c charset, --charset charset
<br>
Use given I/O character set (default: utf8 if called in an
UTF-8 locale, otherwise mount default). This corresponds
with the mount option iocharset (or nls for NTFS). This <br>
option is ignored for file systems that do not support
setting the character set (see mount (8) for details).
Important note: pmount will now mount VFAT filesystems with
<br>
iocharset=iso8859-1 as iocharset=utf8 currently makes the
filesystem case-sensitive (which is pretty bad...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u umask, --umask umask <br>
Use specified umask instead of the default one. For UDF, the
default is &rsquo;000&rsquo;, for VFAT and NTFS the default
is &rsquo;077&rsquo;. This value is ignored for file systems
which do not <br>
support setting an umask. Note that you can use a value of
077 to forbid anyone else to read/write the files, 027 to
allow your group to read the files and 022 to allow <br>
anyone to read the files (but only you can write).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dmask dmask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fmask fmask <br>
Some filesystems (essentially VFAT and HFS) supports
separate umasks (see the -u option just above) for
directories and files, to avoid the annoying effect of
having all <br>
files executable. For these filesystems, you can specify
separately the masks using these options. By default, fmask
is umask without all executable permissions and dmask <br>
is umask. Most of the times, these settings should just do
what you want, so there should be seldom any need for using
directly the --fmask and --dmask options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file --passphrase file <br>
If the device is encrypted (dm-crypt with LUKS metadata),
read the passphrase from specified file instead of prompting
at the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Enable verbose debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the current version number and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/pmount.allow <br>
List of devices (one device per line) which are additionally
permitted for pmounting. Globs, such as /dev/sda[123] are
permitted. See see glob (7) for a more complete syn&acirc;
<br>
tax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
pumount(1), mount(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED FILESYSTEMS <br>
For now, pmount supports the following filesystems: udf,
iso9660, vfat, ntfs, hfsplus, hfs, ext3, ext2, ext4,
reiserfs, reiser4, xfs, jfs and omfs. They are tried
sequentially <br>
in that exact order when the filesystem is not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, pmount supports
the filesystem types ntfs-fuse and ntfs-3g to mount NTFS
volumes respectively with ntfsmount (1) or ntfs-3g (1). If
the file /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g is <br>
found, then pmount will mount NTFS filestystems with type
ntfs-3g rather than plain ntfs. To disable this behavior,
just specify -t ntfs on the command-line, as this happens
<br>
only for autodetection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE ABOUT FSTAB <br>
pmount now fully resolve all symlinks both in its input and
in the /etc/fstab file, which means that if /dev/cdrom is a
symlink to /dev/hdc and you try to mount /dev/hdc <br>
directly, pmount will delegate this to mount(1). This is a
feature, and it contrasts with previous unclear behavior of
pmount about symlinks in /etc/fstab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
Though we believe pmount is pretty much free from security
problems, there are quite a few glitches that probably will
never be fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; pmount needs to
try several different times to mount to get the filesystem
right in the end; it is vital that pmount does know which
precise filesystem to mount in order to <br>
give it the right options not to cause security holes. This
is rather different from the behaviour of mount with the -t
auto options, which can have a look at the device it is <br>
trying to mount and find out what its filesystem is. pmount
will never try to open a device and look at it to find out
which filesystem it is, as it might open quite a few <br>
security holes. Moreover, the order in which the filesystems
are tried are what we could call the most commonly used
filesystems on removable media. This order is unlikely to
<br>
change as well. In particular, that means that when you
mount an ext3 filesystem using pmount, you might get a lot
of fs-related kernel error messages. Sorry !</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Starting from version
0.9.17, pmount uses the same mechanism as mount (1) to
autodetect the filesystem type, so this kind of problems
should not happen anymore.</p>
