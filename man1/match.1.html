<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
match - Match strings against glob paterns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
match [-gilrqs] [-n &lt;n&gt;] [-c cmd] [-x code] {[-p]
pattern | -f &lt;file&gt;} str1 [str2 ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
match checks strings against pattern, which should be a
shell-like glob pattern. pattern may contain the following
special characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? A &quot;?&quot; character in
pattern matches any single character in the string, except
that the &quot;/&quot; character is only matched if match
was given the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A &quot;*&quot; character in
pattern matches zero or more characters in the string. The
exception is that it will only match &quot;/&quot;
characters if match was given the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] <br>
A set of characters between square brackets matches any
character in the set. In addition, the &quot;-&quot;
character can be used to specify a range. For example
&quot;[+e0-3]&quot; would <br>
match any of the characters &quot;+&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, 0,
1, 2, or 3 in the input string. To include a hyphen
(&quot;-&quot;) in the set of characters matched, either
include the hyphen first or last, <br>
or escape it with a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[!...] <br>
A character class preceded by a &quot;!&quot; matches any
character but those specified in the class. The exception is
that the negated character class will match a &quot;/&quot;
only if match <br>
was given the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">match prints each string that
matches pattern, one per line, and exits 0 if one or more
strings matched. If no string matches, match exits with
status 67 (or whatever alternate <br>
status was specified by the -x flag). If the -n n flag was
specified, match prints only the text that matched the nth
occurrence of &quot;*&quot; in the patten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f file <br>
Specifies that the pattern should be read from file. match
will read each line of the file and consider it as pattern
to match against the argument strings. For each <br>
argument string, match stops when it hits the first matching
line of the file. If file does not exist, match exits 67, or
whatever code was specified by -x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Normally, the -n option
selects text matching particular &quot;*&quot; characters in
the patern. -g changes this behavior to use parentheses for
grouping. Thus, for instance, the <br>
text &quot;foo.c&quot; would match pattern
&quot;*(.[ch])&quot;, and the output with option -n 1 would
be &quot;.c&quot;. To include a literal &quot;(&quot; or
&quot;)&quot; in the pattern with the -g option, you must
<br>
precede the character with a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Makes the match case
insensitive. str will be considered to match if any
variation on its capitalization would match. For example,
string &quot;G&quot; would match pattern
&quot;[f-h]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l When a pattern matches the
string in more than one way, the -l flag says to assign as
much text as possible to the leftmost &quot;*&quot;s in the
pattern. For example, pattern &quot;*+*&quot; <br>
would match text &quot;a+b+c&quot;, and the first
&quot;*&quot; would match &quot;a+b&quot;. This behavior is
the default, thus -l&rsquo;s effect is only to undo a
previous -r flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n n <br>
With this flag, match prints the text that matched the nth
&quot;*&quot; in the pattern, as opposed to printing the
whole string. The leftmost &quot;*&quot; corresponds to -n
1. Specifying -n <br>
0 causes match to print the whole matching string.
Specifying -n -1 or using a value greater than the number of
&quot;*&quot;s in the pattern causes match not to print
anything, in <br>
which case you can still use the exit status to see if there
is a match. The default value for n is 0, unless -g has also
been specified, in which case the default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
When -c is specified, match runs command with the system
shell (/bin/sh), giving it as argument $0 the full string
that matched, and as arguments $1, $2, etc., the parts of
<br>
the string that matched any &quot;*&quot;s in pattern. If
the command does not exit with status 0, match will exit
immediately, before processing further matches, with
whatever status <br>
command returned. The -c and -n flags are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pattern <br>
Specifies the pattern to match against. The -p flag is
optional; you can specify pattern as the first argument
following the options. However, if you want to try matching
<br>
the same input string against multiple patterns, then you
must specify each pattern with a -p flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q This option is synonymous
with -n -1; it suppresses output when there is a match. You
can still determine whether a match occurred by the exit
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r When a pattern matches the
string in more than one way, the -r flag says to assign as
much text as possible to the rightmost &quot;*&quot;s in the
pattern. For example, with -r, <br>
pattern &quot;*+*&quot; would match text &quot;a+b+c&quot;
with the &quot;*&quot; matching &quot;a&quot;, and the
second matching &quot;b+c&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Ordinarily, &quot;*&quot;,
&quot;?&quot;, and negated character classes
(&quot;[!...]&quot;) do not match &quot;/&quot; characters.
-s changes this behavior to match slashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x code <br>
By default, when there is no match, match exits with status
67. With this option, match exits with status code,
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Suppose you have a directory with a bunch of files ending .c
and .o. If, for each file named foo.c you want to attempt to
delete the file foo.o, you can run the following <br>
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">match -p &rsquo;*.c&rsquo; -c
&rsquo;rm -f $1.o&rsquo; *.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Servers running the mailman list
manager often send mail from bounce addresses of the form
listname-bounces@host.com. If you subscribe to multiple
lists on the same server, the <br>
mailman interface makes it easier if you subscribe under the
same address. To split the mail into multiple folders based
on the bounce address in the environment variable <br>
SENDER, you might chose a mailbox with the following shell
code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name=&lsquo;match -n1
&quot;*-bounces@host.com&quot; &quot;$SENDER&quot;&lsquo;
&amp;&amp; echo
&quot;$HOME/Mail/incoming/host-$name.spool&quot;</p>
