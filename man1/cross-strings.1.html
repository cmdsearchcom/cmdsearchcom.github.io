<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
strings - print the strings of printable characters in
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

[--help] [--version] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For each file given, GNU strings prints the printable
character sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or
the number given with the options below) and are followed by
an <br>
unprintable character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending upon how the strings
program was configured it will default to either displaying
all the printable sequences that it can find in each file,
or only those sequences that <br>
are in loadable, initialized data sections. If the file type
in unrecognizable, or if strings is reading from stdin then
it will always display all of the printable sequences <br>
that it can find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backwards compatibility any
file that occurs after a command line option of just - will
also be scanned in full, regardless of the presence of any
-d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strings is mainly useful for
determining the contents of non-text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a <br>
--all <br>
- Scan the whole file, regardless of what sections it
contains or whether those sections are loaded or
initialized. Normally this is the default behaviour, but
strings can be <br>
configured so that the -d is the default instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The - option is position
dependent and forces strings to perform full scans of any
file that is mentioned after the - on the command line, even
if the -d option has been <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--data <br>
Only print strings from initialized, loaded data sections in
the file. This may reduce the amount of garbage in the
output, but it also exposes the strings program to any <br>
security flaws that may be present in the BFD library used
to scan and load sections. Strings can be configured so that
this option is the default behaviour. In such cases <br>
the -a option can be used to avoid using the BFD library and
instead just print all of the strings found in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
--print-file-name <br>
Print the name of the file before each string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a summary of the program usage on the standard output
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-min-len <br>
-n min-len <br>
--bytes=min-len <br>
Print sequences of characters that are at least min-len
characters long, instead of the default 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Like -t o. Some other
versions of strings have -o act like -t d instead. Since we
can not be compatible with both ways, we simply chose
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t radix <br>
--radix=radix <br>
Print the offset within the file before each string. The
single character argument specifies the radix of the
offset---o for octal, x for hexadecimal, or d for
decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e encoding <br>
--encoding=encoding <br>
Select the character encoding of the strings that are to be
found. Possible values for encoding are: s =
single-7-bit-byte characters (ASCII, ISO 8859, etc.,
default), S = <br>
single-8-bit-byte characters, b = 16-bit bigendian, l =
16-bit littleendian, B = 32-bit bigendian, L = 32-bit
littleendian. Useful for finding wide character strings. (l
and <br>
b apply to, for example, Unicode UTF-16/UCS-2
encodings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T bfdname <br>
--target=bfdname <br>
Specify an object code format other than your system&rsquo;s
default format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
-V <br>
--version <br>
Print the program version number on the standard output and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w <br>
--include-all-whitespace <br>
By default tab and space characters are included in the
strings that are displayed, but other whitespace characters,
such a newlines and carriage returns, are not. The -w <br>
option changes this so that all whitespace characters are
considered to be part of a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--output-separator <br>
By default, output strings are delimited by a new-line. This
option allows you to supply any string to be used as the
output record separator. Useful with <br>
--include-all-whitespace where strings may contain new-lines
internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>
