<p>PROOF(1) CAO-VLSI Reference Manual PROOF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
proof - Formal proof between two behavioural
descriptions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
proof [-a] [-d] file1 file2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Made to run on a data-flow description, proof supports the
same subset of VHDL as asimut and boom and boog (for further
informations about this subset, please call the VHDL
man&acirc; <br>
ual). proof uses a Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams
representation that permits the designer to prove easily the
functionnal equivalence between two behavioral
descrip&acirc; <br>
tions. proof is generally used in order to compare a
behavioural specification with an extracted behaviour
obtained by yagle. <br>
In default mode, a collapsing phase is done on the
description by removing all the auxiliary signals (the BDD
of the outputs, the registers and the buses are described
from the <br>
inputs or the registers). The two descriptions must contain
the same ressources (signals register with the same name).
It is possible to use the .inf file in yagle (see further
<br>
remark about YAGLE in this document) to rename the registers
in the extracted behavioural description (see man yagle).
The datas and the commands (the guarded expressions) must
<br>
match separatly. The buses corresponding to completely
specified logical functions are represented by a logical
multiplexor in both descriptions. The two descriptions must
have <br>
the same interface (VHDL entity), if they do not, the formal
proof is stopped. <br>
proof only uses two system environment variables related to
the work directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_WORK_LIB gives the path for
the behavioral descriptions. The default value is the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_CATA_LIB gives some
auxiliary pathes for the behavioral descriptions. The
default value is the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options may be given in any order before the filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a This option asks proof to
keep the common auxiliary signals. proof keeps all
intermediate signals that have the same name in both
descriptions (A common signal is considered <br>
as an input and an output of each description). This option
can be useful for descriptions containing large equations.
It may be used when proof has failed or if you want <br>
to debug in step by step mode the two different
descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d The program displays errors
when the behavioral descriptions are different. Equations
are displayed when it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
