<b>fetchmail</b> is a mail-retrieval and forwarding utility; it fetches mail
  from remote mailservers and forwards it to your local (client) machine's
  delivery system. You can then handle the retrieved mail using normal mail user
  agents such as <b>mutt</b>(1), <b>elm</b>(1) or <b>Mail</b>(1). The
  <b>fetchmail</b> utility can be run in a daemon mode to repeatedly poll one or
  more systems at a specified interval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>fetchmail</b> program can gather mail from servers supporting any of the
  common mail-retrieval protocols: POP2 (legacy, to be removed from future
  release), POP3, IMAP2bis, IMAP4, and IMAP4rev1. It can also use the ESMTP ETRN
  extension and ODMR. (The RFCs describing all these protocols are listed at the
  end of this manual page.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
While <b>fetchmail</b> is primarily intended to be used over on-demand TCP/IP
  links (such as SLIP or PPP connections), it may also be useful as a message
  transfer agent for sites which refuse for security reasons to permit
  (sender-initiated) SMTP transactions with sendmail.

If <b>fetchmail</b> is used with a POP or an IMAP server (but not with ETRN or
  ODMR), it has two fundamental modes of operation for each user account from
  which it retrieves mail: <i>singledrop</i>- and <i>multidrop</i>-mode.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">In singledrop-mode,</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>fetchmail</b> assumes that all messages in the user's
      account (mailbox) are intended for a single recipient. The identity of the
      recipient will either default to the local user currently executing
      <b>fetchmail</b>, or will need to be explicitly specified in the
      configuration file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>fetchmail</b> uses singledrop-mode when the fetchmailrc
      configuration contains at most a single local user specification for a
      given server account.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">In multidrop-mode,</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>fetchmail</b> assumes that the mail server account
      actually contains mail intended for any number of different recipients.
      Therefore, <b>fetchmail</b> must attempt to deduce the proper
      &quot;envelope recipient&quot; from the mail headers of each message. In
      this mode of operation, <b>fetchmail</b> almost resembles a mail transfer
      agent (MTA).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Note that neither the POP nor IMAP protocols were intended
      for use in this fashion, and hence envelope information is often not
      directly available. The ISP must stores the envelope information in some
      message header <b>and</b>. The ISP must also store one copy of the message
      per recipient. If either of the conditions is not fulfilled, this process
      is unreliable, because <b>fetchmail</b> must then resort to guessing the
      true envelope recipient(s) of a message. This usually fails for mailing
      list messages and Bcc:d mail, or mail for multiple recipients in your
      domain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>fetchmail</b> uses multidrop-mode when more than one
      local user and/or a wildcard is specified for a particular server account
      in the configuration file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">In ETRN and ODMR modes,</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">these considerations do not apply, as these protocols are
      based on SMTP, which provides explicit envelope recipient information.

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As each message is retrieved, <b>fetchmail</b> normally delivers it via SMTP to
  port 25 on the machine it is running on (localhost), just as though it were
  being passed in over a normal TCP/IP link. <b>fetchmail</b> provides the SMTP
  server with an envelope recipient derived in the manner described previously.
  The mail will then be delivered according to your MTA's rules (the Mail
  Transfer Agent is usually <b>sendmail</b>(8), <b>exim</b>(8), or
  <b>postfix</b>(8)). Invoking your system's MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) is the
  duty of your MTA. All the delivery-control mechanisms (such as <i>.forward</i>
  files) normally available through your system MTA and local delivery agents
  will therefore be applied as usual.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your fetchmail configuration sets a local MDA (see the --mda option), it will
  be used directly instead of talking SMTP to port 25.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the program <b>fetchmailconf</b> is available, it will assist you in setting
  up and editing a fetchmailrc configuration. It runs under the X window system
  and requires that the language Python and the Tk toolkit (with Python
  bindings) be present on your system. If you are first setting up fetchmail for
  single-user mode, it is recommended that you use Novice mode. Expert mode
  provides complete control of fetchmail configuration, including the multidrop
  features. In either case, the 'Autoprobe' button will tell you the most
  capable protocol a given mailserver supports, and warn you of potential
  problems with that server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERAL_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERAL_OPERATION">GENERAL
  OPERATION</a></h1>
The behavior of <b>fetchmail</b> is controlled by command-line options and a run
  control file, <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i>, the syntax of which we describe in a
  later section (this file is what the <b>fetchmailconf</b> program edits).
  Command-line options override <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> declarations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each server name that you specify following the options on the command line will
  be queried. If you don't specify any servers on the command line, each 'poll'
  entry in your <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file will be queried.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To facilitate the use of <b>fetchmail</b> in scripts and pipelines, it returns
  an appropriate exit code upon termination -- see EXIT CODES below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options modify the behavior of <b>fetchmail</b>. It is seldom
  necessary to specify any of these once you have a working <i>.fetchmailrc</i>
  file set up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Almost all options have a corresponding keyword which can be used to declare
  them in a <i>.fetchmailrc</i> file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some special options are not covered here, but are documented instead in
  sections on AUTHENTICATION and DAEMON MODE which follow.

All these alternatives work in basically the same way (communicating with
  standard server daemons to fetch mail already delivered to a mailbox on the
  server) except ETRN and ODMR. The ETRN mode allows you to ask a compliant
  ESMTP server (such as BSD sendmail at release 8.8.0 or higher) to immediately
  open a sender-SMTP connection to your client machine and begin forwarding any
  items addressed to your client machine in the server's queue of undelivered
  mail. The ODMR mode requires an ODMR-capable server and works similarly to
  ETRN, except that it does not require the client machine to have a static DNS.

    Force UIDL use (effective only with POP3). Force client-side tracking of
      'newness' of messages (UIDL stands for &quot;unique ID listing&quot; and
      is described in RFC1939). Use with 'keep' to use a mailbox as a baby news
      drop for a group of users. The fact that seen messages are skipped is
      logged, unless error logging is done through syslog while running in
      daemon mode. Note that fetchmail may automatically enable this option
      depending on upstream server capabilities. Note also that this option may
      be removed and forced enabled in a future fetchmail version. See also:

    Enable IDLE use (effective only with IMAP). Note that this works with only
      one folder at a given time. While the idle rcfile keyword had been
      supported for a long time, the --idle command-line option was added in
      version 6.3.3. IDLE use means that fetchmail tells the IMAP server to send

    The principal option permits you to specify a service principal for mutual

    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The timeout option allows you to set a server-nonresponse timeout in
      seconds. If a mailserver does not send a greeting message or respond to
      commands for the given number of seconds, <b>fetchmail</b> will drop the
      connection to it. Without such a timeout <b>fetchmail</b> might hang until
      the TCP connection times out, trying to fetch mail from a down host, which
      may be very long. This would be particularly annoying for a
      <b>fetchmail</b> running in the background. There is a default timeout
      which fetchmail&#x00A0;-V will report. If a given connection receives too
      many timeouts in succession, fetchmail will consider it wedged and stop
      retrying. The calling user will be notified by email if this happens.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Beginning with fetchmail 6.3.10, the SMTP client uses the
      recommended minimum timeouts from RFC-5321 while waiting for the SMTP/LMTP
      server it is talking to. You can raise the timeouts even more, but you
      cannot shorten them. This is to avoid a painful situation where fetchmail
      has been configured with a short timeout (a minute or less), ships a long
      message (many MBytes) to the local MTA, which then takes longer than
      timeout to respond &quot;OK&quot;, which it eventually will; that would
      mean the mail gets delivered properly, but fetchmail cannot notice it and
      will thus refetch this big message over and over again.</dd>

      or LDA) directly, rather than forward via SMTP or LMTP.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To avoid losing mail, use this option only with MDAs like maildrop or MTAs
      like sendmail that exit with a nonzero status on disk-full and other
      delivery errors; the nonzero status tells fetchmail that delivery failed
      and prevents the message from being deleted on the server.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If <b>fetchmail</b> is running as root, it sets its user id while delivering
      mail through an MDA as follows: First, the FETCHMAILUSER, LOGNAME, and
      USER environment variables are checked in this order. The value of the
      first variable from his list that is defined (even if it is empty!) is
      looked up in the system user database. If none of the variables is
      defined, fetchmail will use the real user id it was started with. If one
      of the variables was defined, but the user stated there isn't found,
      fetchmail continues running as root, without checking remaining variables
      on the list. Practically, this means that if you run fetchmail as root
      (not recommended), it is most useful to define the FETCHMAILUSER
      environment variable to set the user that the MDA should run as. Some MDAs
      (such as maildrop) are designed to be setuid root and setuid to the
      recipient's user id, so you don't lose functionality this way even when
      running fetchmail as unprivileged user. Check the MDA's manual for
      details.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some possible MDAs are &quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -f %F -- %T&quot; (
      <b>Note:</b> some several older or vendor sendmail versions mistake -- for
      an address, rather than an indicator to mark the end of the option
      arguments), &quot;/usr/bin/deliver&quot; and &quot;/usr/bin/maildrop -d
      %T&quot;. Local delivery addresses will be inserted into the MDA command
      wherever you place a %T; the mail message's From address will be inserted
      where you place an %F.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Do NOT enclose the %F or %T string in single quotes!</b> For both %T and
      %F, fetchmail encloses the addresses in single quotes ('), after removing
      any single quotes they may contain, before the MDA command is passed to
      the shell.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Do NOT use an MDA invocation that dispatches on the contents of</b>
      <b>To/Cc/Bcc,</b> like &quot;sendmail -i -t&quot; or
      &quot;qmail-inject&quot;, it will create mail loops and bring the just
      wrath of many postmasters down upon your head. This is one of the most
      frequent configuration errors!
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Also, do <i>not</i> try to combine multidrop mode with an MDA such as
      maildrop that can only accept one address, unless your upstream stores one
      copy of the message per recipient and transports the envelope recipient in
      a header; you will lose mail.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The well-known <b>procmail</b>(1) package is very hard to configure
      properly, it has a very nasty &quot;fall through to the next rule&quot;
      behavior on delivery errors (even temporary ones, such as out of disk
      space if another user's mail daemon copies the mailbox around to purge old
      messages), so your mail will end up in the wrong mailbox sooner or later.
      The proper procmail configuration is outside the scope of this document.
      Using <b>maildrop</b>(1) is usually much easier, and many users find the
      filter syntax used by maildrop easier to understand.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Finally, we strongly advise that you do <b>not</b> use qmail-inject. The
      command line interface is non-standard without providing benefits for
      typical use, and fetchmail makes no attempts to accommodate qmail-inject's
      deviations from the standard. Some of qmail-inject's command-line and
      environment options are actually dangerous and can cause broken threads,
      non-detected duplicate messages and forwarding loops.

    Do a binary instead of linear search for the first unseen UID. Binary search
      avoids downloading the UIDs of all mails. This saves time (especially in
      daemon mode) where downloading the same set of UIDs in each poll is a
      waste of bandwidth. The number 'n' indicates how rarely a linear search
      should be done. In daemon mode, linear search is used once followed by
      binary searches in 'n-1' polls if 'n' is greater than 1; binary search is
      always used if 'n' is 1; linear search is always used if 'n' is 0. In

    Arrange for deletions to be made final after a given number of messages.
      Under POP2 or POP3, fetchmail cannot make deletions final without sending
      QUIT and ending the session -- with this option on, fetchmail will break a
      long mail retrieval session into multiple sub-sessions, sending QUIT after
      each sub-session. This is a good defense against line drops on POP3
      servers. Under IMAP, <b>fetchmail</b> normally issues an EXPUNGE command
      after each deletion in order to force the deletion to be done immediately.
      This is safest when your connection to the server is flaky and expensive,
      as it avoids resending duplicate mail after a line hit. However, on large
      mailboxes the overhead of re-indexing after every message can slam the
      server pretty hard, so if your connection is reliable it is good to do
      expunges less frequently. Also note that some servers enforce a delay of a
      few seconds after each quit, so fetchmail may not be able to get back in
      immediately after an expunge -- you may see &quot;lock busy&quot; errors
      if this happens. If you specify this option to an integer N, it tells
      <b>fetchmail</b> to only issue expunges on every Nth delete. An argument
      of zero suppresses expunges entirely (so no expunges at all will be done
      until the end of run). This option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

    Require that a specific interface device be up and have a specific local or

      before polling. Frequently <b>fetchmail</b> is used over a transient
      point-to-point TCP/IP link established directly to a mailserver via SLIP
      or PPP. That is a relatively secure channel. But when other TCP/IP routes
      to the mailserver exist (e.g. when the link is connected to an alternate
      ISP), your username and password may be vulnerable to snooping (especially
      when daemon mode automatically polls for mail, shipping a clear password
      over the net at predictable intervals). The --interface option may be used
      to prevent this. When the specified link is not up or is not connected to
      a matching IP address, polling will be skipped. The format is:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    Daemon mode can cause transient links which are automatically taken down

      This option identifies a system TCP/IP interface to be monitored for
      activity. After each poll interval, if the link is up but no other
      activity has occurred on the link, then the poll will be skipped. However,
      when fetchmail is woken up by a signal, the monitor check is skipped and
      the poll goes through unconditionally. This option is currently only
      supported under Linux and FreeBSD. For the <b>monitor</b> and
      <b>interface</b> options to work for non root users under FreeBSD, the

      fetchmail tries first methods that don't require a password (EXTERNAL,
      GSSAPI, KERBEROS&#x00A0;IV, KERBEROS&#x00A0;5); then it looks for methods
      that mask your password (CRAM-MD5, NTLM, X-OTP - note that MSN is only
      supported for POP3, but not autoprobed); and only if the server doesn't
      support any of those will it ship your password en clair. Other values may
      be used to force various authentication methods ( <b>ssh</b> suppresses
      authentication and is thus useful for IMAP PREAUTH). ( <b>external</b>
      suppresses authentication and is thus useful for IMAP EXTERNAL). Any value
      other than <b>password</b>, <b>cram-md5</b>, <b>ntlm</b>, <b>msn</b> or

     <b>envelope [&lt;count&gt;] &lt;line&gt;</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option changes the header <b>fetchmail</b> assumes will carry a copy of
      the mail's envelope address. Normally this is 'X-Envelope-To'. Other
      typically found headers to carry envelope information are 'X-Original-To'
      and 'Delivered-To'. Now, since these headers are not standardized,
      practice varies. See the discussion of multidrop address handling below.
      As a special case, 'envelope &quot;Received&quot;' enables parsing of
      sendmail-style Received lines. This is the default, but discouraged
      because it is not fully reliable.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that fetchmail expects the Received-line to be in a specific format: It
      must contain &quot;by <i>host</i> for <i>address</i>&quot;, where
      <i>host</i> must match one of the mailserver names that fetchmail
      recognizes for the account in question.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The optional count argument (only available in the configuration file)
      determines how many header lines of this kind are skipped. A count of 1

    The string prefix assigned to this option will be removed from the user name

      either is applicable). This option is useful if you are using
      <b>fetchmail</b> to collect the mail for an entire domain and your ISP (or
      your mail redirection provider) is using qmail. One of the basic features
      of qmail is the <i>Delivered-To:</i> message header. Whenever qmail
      delivers a message to a local mailbox it puts the username and hostname of
      the envelope recipient on this line. The major reason for this is to
      prevent mail loops. To set up qmail to batch mail for a disconnected site
      the ISP-mailhost will have normally put that site in its 'Virtualhosts'
      control file so it will add a prefix to all mail addresses for this site.
      This results in mail sent to 'username@userhost.userdom.dom.com' having a
      <i>Delivered-To:</i> line of the form:</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
The ISP can make the 'mbox-userstr-' prefix anything they choose but a string
  matching the user host name is likely. By using the option 'envelope
  Delivered-To:' you can make fetchmail reliably identify the original envelope
  recipient, but you have to strip the 'mbox-userstr-' prefix to deliver to the
  correct user. This is what this option is for.

  AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION</a></h1>
All modes except ETRN require authentication of the client to the server. Normal
  user authentication in <b>fetchmail</b> is very much like the authentication
  mechanism of <b>ftp</b>(1). The correct user-id and password depend upon the
  underlying security system at the mailserver.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the mailserver is a Unix machine on which you have an ordinary user account,
  your regular login name and password are used with <b>fetchmail</b>. If you
  use the same login name on both the server and the client machines, you
  needn't worry about specifying a user-id with the <b>-u</b> option -- the
  default behavior is to use your login name on the client machine as the
  user-id on the server machine. If you use a different login name on the server
  machine, specify that login name with the <b>-u</b> option. e.g. if your login
  name is 'jsmith' on a machine named 'mailgrunt', you would start
  <b>fetchmail</b> as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">fetchmail -u jsmith mailgrunt</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default behavior of <b>fetchmail</b> is to prompt you for your mailserver
  password before the connection is established. This is the safest way to use
  <b>fetchmail</b> and ensures that your password will not be compromised. You
  may also specify your password in your <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file. This is
  convenient when using <b>fetchmail</b> in daemon mode or with scripts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_netrc_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_netrc_files">Using
  netrc files</a></h2>
If you do not specify a password, and <b>fetchmail</b> cannot extract one from
  your <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file, it will look for a <i>~/.netrc</i> file in
  your home directory before requesting one interactively; if an entry matching
  the mailserver is found in that file, the password will be used. Fetchmail
  first looks for a match on poll name; if it finds none, it checks for a match
  on via name. See the <b>ftp</b>(1) man page for details of the syntax of the
  <i>~/.netrc</i> file. To show a practical example, a .netrc might look like
  this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
machine hermes.example.org
login joe
password topsecret
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can repeat this block with different user information if you need to provide
  more than one password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This feature may allow you to avoid duplicating password information in more
  than one file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On mailservers that do not provide ordinary user accounts, your user-id and
  password are usually assigned by the server administrator when you apply for a
  mailbox on the server. Contact your server administrator if you don't know the
  correct user-id and password for your mailbox account.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POP3_VARIANTS"><a class="selflink" href="#POP3_VARIANTS">POP3
  VARIANTS</a></h1>
Early versions of POP3 (RFC1081, RFC1225) supported a crude form of independent
  authentication using the <i>.rhosts</i> file on the mailserver side. Under
  this RPOP variant, a fixed per-user ID equivalent to a password was sent in
  clear over a link to a reserved port, with the command RPOP rather than PASS
  to alert the server that it should do special checking. RPOP is supported by
  <b>fetchmail</b> (you can specify 'protocol RPOP' to have the program send
  'RPOP' rather than 'PASS') but its use is strongly discouraged, and support
  will be removed from a future fetchmail version. This facility was vulnerable
  to spoofing and was withdrawn in RFC1460.
<div class="Pp"></div>
RFC1460 introduced APOP authentication. In this variant of POP3, you register an
  APOP password on your server host (on some servers, the program to do this is
  called <b>popauth</b>(8)). You put the same password in your
  <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file. Each time <b>fetchmail</b> logs in, it sends an
  MD5 hash of your password and the server greeting time to the server, which
  can verify it by checking its authorization database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note that APOP is no longer considered resistant against</b>
  <b>man-in-the-middle attacks.</b>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RETR_or_TOP"><a class="selflink" href="#RETR_or_TOP">RETR
  or TOP</a></h2>
<b>fetchmail</b> makes some efforts to make the server believe messages had not
  been retrieved, by using the TOP command with a large number of lines when
  possible. TOP is a command that retrieves the full header and a
  <b>fetchmail</b>-specified amount of body lines. It is optional and therefore
  not implemented by all servers, and some are known to implement it improperly.
  On many servers however, the RETR command which retrieves the full message
  with header and body, sets the &quot;seen&quot; flag (for instance, in a web
  interface), whereas the TOP command does not do that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fetchmail</b> will always use the RETR command if &quot;fetchall&quot; is
  set. <b>fetchmail</b> will also use the RETR command if &quot;keep&quot; is
  set and &quot;uidl&quot; is unset. Finally, <b>fetchmail</b> will use the RETR
  command on Maillennium POP3/PROXY servers (used by Comcast) to avoid a
  deliberate TOP misinterpretation in this server that causes message
  corruption.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In all other cases, <b>fetchmail</b> will use the TOP command. This implies that
  in &quot;keep&quot; setups, &quot;uidl&quot; must be set if &quot;TOP&quot; is
  desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Note</b> that this description is true for the current version of fetchmail,
  but the behavior may change in future versions. In particular, fetchmail may
  prefer the RETR command because the TOP command causes much grief on some
  servers and is only optional.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ALTERNATE_AUTHENTICATION_FORMS"><a class="selflink" href="#ALTERNATE_AUTHENTICATION_FORMS">ALTERNATE
  AUTHENTICATION FORMS</a></h1>
If your <b>fetchmail</b> was built with Kerberos support and you specify
  Kerberos authentication (either with --auth or the <i>.fetchmailrc</i> option
  <b>authenticate kerberos_v4</b>) it will try to get a Kerberos ticket from the
  mailserver at the start of each query. Note: if either the pollname or via
  name is 'hesiod', fetchmail will try to use Hesiod to look up the mailserver.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use POP3 or IMAP with GSSAPI authentication, <b>fetchmail</b> will expect
  the server to have RFC1731- or RFC1734-conforming GSSAPI capability, and will
  use it. Currently this has only been tested over Kerberos V, so you're
  expected to already have a ticket-granting ticket. You may pass a username
  different from your principal name using the standard <b>--user</b> command or
  by the <i>.fetchmailrc</i> option <b>user</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your IMAP daemon returns the PREAUTH response in its greeting line, fetchmail
  will notice this and skip the normal authentication step. This can be useful,
  e.g. if you start imapd explicitly using ssh. In this case you can declare the
  authentication value 'ssh' on that site entry to stop <i>.fetchmail</i> from
  asking you for a password when it starts up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use client authentication with <i>TLS1</i> and your IMAP daemon returns
  the <i>AUTH=EXTERNAL</i> response, fetchmail will notice this and will use the
  authentication shortcut and will not send the passphrase. In this case you can
  declare the authentication value 'external'
<br/>
 on that site to stop <b>fetchmail</b> from asking you for a password when it
  starts up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using POP3, and the server issues a one-time-password challenge
  conforming to RFC1938, <b>fetchmail</b> will use your password as a pass
  phrase to generate the required response. This avoids sending secrets over the
  net unencrypted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Compuserve's RPA authentication is supported. If you compile in the support,
  <b>fetchmail</b> will try to perform an RPA pass-phrase authentication instead
  of sending over the password en clair if it detects
  &quot;@compuserve.com&quot; in the hostname.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using IMAP, Microsoft's NTLM authentication (used by Microsoft
  Exchange) is supported. If you compile in the support, <b>fetchmail</b> will
  try to perform an NTLM authentication (instead of sending over the password en
  clair) whenever the server returns AUTH=NTLM in its capability response.
  Specify a user option value that looks like 'user@domain': the part to the
  left of the @ will be passed as the username and the part to the right as the

  Socket Layers (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a></h2>
Note that fetchmail currently uses the OpenSSL library, which is severely
  underdocumented, so failures may occur just because the programmers are not
  aware of OpenSSL's requirement of the day. For instance, since v6.3.16,
  fetchmail calls OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms(), which is necessary to support
  certificates with SHA256 on OpenSSL 0.9.8 -- this information is deeply hidden
  in the documentation and not at all obvious. Please do not hesitate to report
  subtle SSL failures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can access SSL encrypted services by specifying the --ssl option. You can
  also do this using the &quot;ssl&quot; user option in the .fetchmailrc file.
  With SSL encryption enabled, queries are initiated over a connection after
  negotiating an SSL session, and the connection fails if SSL cannot be
  negotiated. Some services, such as POP3 and IMAP, have different well known
  ports defined for the SSL encrypted services. The encrypted ports will be
  selected automatically when SSL is enabled and no explicit port is specified.
  The --sslproto 'SSL3' option should be used to select the SSLv3 protocol
  (default if unset: v2 or v3). Also, the --sslcertck command line or sslcertck
  run control file option should be used to force strict certificate checking -
  see below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If SSL is not configured, fetchmail will usually opportunistically try to use
  STARTTLS. STARTTLS can be enforced by using --sslproto &quot;TLS1&quot;. TLS
  connections use the same port as the unencrypted version of the protocol and
  negotiate TLS via special command. The --sslcertck command line or sslcertck
  run control file option should be used to force strict certificate checking -
  see below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--sslcertck is recommended:</b> When connecting to an SSL or TLS encrypted
  server, the server presents a certificate to the client for validation. The
  certificate is checked to verify that the common name in the certificate
  matches the name of the server being contacted and that the effective and
  expiration dates in the certificate indicate that it is currently valid. If
  any of these checks fail, a warning message is printed, but the connection
  continues. The server certificate does not need to be signed by any specific
  Certifying Authority and may be a &quot;self-signed&quot; certificate. If the
  --sslcertck command line option or sslcertck run control file option is used,
  fetchmail will instead abort if any of these checks fail, because it must
  assume that there is a man-in-the-middle attack in this scenario, hence
  fetchmail must not expose cleartext passwords. Use of the sslcertck or
  --sslcertck option is therefore advised.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some SSL encrypted servers may request a client side certificate. A client side
  public SSL certificate and private SSL key may be specified. If requested by
  the server, the client certificate is sent to the server for validation. Some
  servers may require a valid client certificate and may refuse connections if a
  certificate is not provided or if the certificate is not valid. Some servers
  may require client side certificates be signed by a recognized Certifying
  Authority. The format for the key files and the certificate files is that
  required by the underlying SSL libraries (OpenSSL in the general case).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A word of care about the use of SSL: While above mentioned setup with
  self-signed server certificates retrieved over the wires can protect you from
  a passive eavesdropper, it doesn't help against an active attacker. It's
  clearly an improvement over sending the passwords in clear, but you should be
  aware that a man-in-the-middle attack is trivially possible (in particular
  with tools such as ). Use of strict certificate checking with a certification
  authority recognized by server and client, or perhaps of an SSH tunnel (see
  below for some examples) is preferable if you care seriously about the
  security of your mailbox and passwords.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ESMTP_AUTH"><a class="selflink" href="#ESMTP_AUTH">ESMTP
  AUTH</a></h2>
<b>fetchmail</b> also supports authentication to the ESMTP server on the client
  side according to RFC 2554. You can specify a name/password pair to be used
  with the keywords 'esmtpname' and 'esmtppassword'; the former defaults to the
  username of the calling user.

  MODE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Introducing_the_daemon_mode"><a class="selflink" href="#Introducing_the_daemon_mode">Introducing
  the daemon mode</a></h2>
In daemon mode, <b>fetchmail</b> puts itself into the background and runs
  forever, querying each specified host and then sleeping for a given polling
  interval.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Starting_the_daemon_mode"><a class="selflink" href="#Starting_the_daemon_mode">Starting
  the daemon mode</a></h2>
There are several ways to make fetchmail work in daemon mode. On the command
  line, <b>--daemon&#x00A0;&lt;interval&gt;</b> or
  <b>-d&#x00A0;&lt;interval&gt;</b> option runs <b>fetchmail</b> in daemon mode.
  You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling interval (time to wait
  after completing a whole poll cycle with the last server and before starting
  the next poll cycle with the first server) in seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example: simply invoking
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">fetchmail -d 900</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will, therefore, poll all the hosts described in your <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file
  (except those explicitly excluded with the 'skip' verb) a bit less often than
  once every 15 minutes (exactly: 15 minutes + time that the poll takes).
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is also possible to set a polling interval in your <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file
  by saying 'set&#x00A0;daemon&#x00A0;&lt;interval&gt;', where &lt;interval&gt;
  is an integer number of seconds. If you do this, fetchmail will always start
  in daemon mode unless you override it with the command-line option --daemon 0
  or -d0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only one daemon process is permitted per user; in daemon mode, <b>fetchmail</b>
  sets up a per-user lockfile to guarantee this. (You can however cheat and set
  the FETCHMAILHOME environment variable to overcome this setting, but in that
  case, it is your responsibility to make sure you aren't polling the same
  server with two processes at the same time.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Awakening_the_background_daemon"><a class="selflink" href="#Awakening_the_background_daemon">Awakening
  the background daemon</a></h2>
Normally, calling fetchmail with a daemon in the background sends a wake-up
  signal to the daemon and quits without output. The background daemon then
  starts its next poll cycle immediately. The wake-up signal, SIGUSR1, can also
  be sent manually. The wake-up action also clears any 'wedged' flags indicating
  that connections have wedged due to failed authentication or multiple
  timeouts.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Terminating_the_background_daemon"><a class="selflink" href="#Terminating_the_background_daemon">Terminating
  the background daemon</a></h2>
The option <b>--quit</b> will kill a running daemon process instead of waking it
  up (if there is no such process, <b>fetchmail</b> will notify you). If the
  --quit option appears last on the command line, <b>fetchmail</b> will kill the
  running daemon process and then quit. Otherwise, <b>fetchmail</b> will first
  kill a running daemon process and then continue running with the other
  options.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Useful_options_for_daemon_mode"><a class="selflink" href="#Useful_options_for_daemon_mode">Useful
  options for daemon mode</a></h2>
The <b>-L &lt;filename&gt;</b> or <b>--logfile &lt;filename&gt;</b> option
  (keyword: set logfile) is only effective when fetchmail is detached and in
  daemon mode. Note that <b>the logfile must exist</b> <b>before</b> fetchmail
  is run, you can use the <b>touch</b>(1) command with the filename as its sole
  argument to create it.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This option allows you to redirect status messages into a specified logfile
  (follow the option with the logfile name). The logfile is opened for append,
  so previous messages aren't deleted. This is primarily useful for debugging
  configurations. Note that fetchmail does not detect if the logfile is rotated,
  the logfile is only opened once when fetchmail starts. You need to restart
  fetchmail after rotating the logfile and before compressing it (if
  applicable).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>--syslog</b> option (keyword: set syslog) allows you to redirect status
  and error messages emitted to the <b>syslog</b>(3) system daemon if available.
  Messages are logged with an id of <b>fetchmail</b>, the facility
  <b>LOG_MAIL</b>, and priorities <b>LOG_ERR</b>, <b>LOG_ALERT</b> or
  <b>LOG_INFO</b>. This option is intended for logging status and error messages
  which indicate the status of the daemon and the results while fetching mail
  from the server(s). Error messages for command line options and parsing the
  <i>.fetchmailrc</i> file are still written to stderr, or to the specified log
  file. The <b>--nosyslog</b> option turns off use of <b>syslog</b>(3), assuming
  it's turned on in the <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file. This option is overridden,
  in certain situations, by <b>--logfile</b> (which see).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-N</b> or <b>--nodetach</b> option suppresses backgrounding and
  detachment of the daemon process from its control terminal. This is useful for
  debugging or when fetchmail runs as the child of a supervisor process such as
  <b>init</b>(8) or Gerrit Pape's <b>runit</b>(8). Note that this also causes
  the logfile option to be ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that while running in daemon mode polling a POP2 or IMAP2bis server,
  transient errors (such as DNS failures or sendmail delivery refusals) may
  force the fetchall option on for the duration of the next polling cycle. This
  is a robustness feature. It means that if a message is fetched (and thus
  marked seen by the mailserver) but not delivered locally due to some transient
  error, it will be re-fetched during the next poll cycle. (The IMAP logic
  doesn't delete messages until they're delivered, so this problem does not
  arise.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you touch or change the <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file while fetchmail is running
  in daemon mode, this will be detected at the beginning of the next poll cycle.
  When a changed <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> is detected, fetchmail rereads it and
  restarts from scratch (using exec(2); no state information is retained in the
  new instance). Note that if fetchmail needs to query for passwords, of that if
  you break the <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> file's syntax, the new instance will
  softly and silently vanish away on startup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ADMINISTRATIVE_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#ADMINISTRATIVE_OPTIONS">ADMINISTRATIVE
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
The <b>--postmaster &lt;name&gt;</b> option (keyword: set postmaster) specifies
  the last-resort username to which multidrop mail is to be forwarded if no
  matching local recipient can be found. It is also used as destination of
  undeliverable mail if the 'bouncemail' global option is off and additionally
  for spam-blocked mail if the 'bouncemail' global option is off and the
  'spambounce' global option is on. This option defaults to the user who invoked
  <b>fetchmail</b>. If the invoking user is root, then the default of this
  option is the user 'postmaster'. Setting postmaster to the empty string causes
  such mail as described above to be discarded - this however is usually a bad
  idea. See also the description of the 'FETCHMAILUSER' environment variable in
  the ENVIRONMENT section below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>--nobounce</b> behaves like the &quot;set no bouncemail&quot; global
  option, which see.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>--invisible</b> option (keyword: set invisible) tries to make fetchmail
  invisible. Normally, fetchmail behaves like any other MTA would -- it
  generates a Received header into each message describing its place in the
  chain of transmission, and tells the MTA it forwards to that the mail came
  from the machine fetchmail itself is running on. If the invisible option is
  on, the Received header is suppressed and fetchmail tries to spoof the MTA it
  forwards to into thinking it came directly from the mailserver host.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>--showdots</b> option (keyword: set showdots) forces fetchmail to show
  progress dots even if the output goes to a file or fetchmail is not in verbose
  mode. Fetchmail shows the dots by default when run in --verbose mode
  <i>and</i> output goes to console. This option is ignored in --silent mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By specifying the <b>--tracepolls</b> option, you can ask fetchmail to add
  information to the Received header on the form &quot;polling {label} account
  {user}&quot;, where {label} is the account label (from the specified rcfile,
  normally ~/.fetchmailrc) and {user} is the username which is used to log on to
  the mail server. This header can be used to make filtering email where no
  useful header information is available and you want mail from different
  accounts sorted into different mailboxes (this could, for example, occur if
  you have an account on the same server running a mailing list, and are
  subscribed to the list using that account). The default is not adding any such
  header. In <i>.fetchmailrc</i>, this is called 'tracepolls'.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETRIEVAL_FAILURE_MODES"><a class="selflink" href="#RETRIEVAL_FAILURE_MODES">RETRIEVAL
  FAILURE MODES</a></h1>
The protocols <b>fetchmail</b> uses to talk to mailservers are next to
  bulletproof. In normal operation forwarding to port 25, no message is ever
  deleted (or even marked for deletion) on the host until the SMTP listener on
  the client side has acknowledged to <b>fetchmail</b> that the message has been
  either accepted for delivery or rejected due to a spam block.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When forwarding to an MDA, however, there is more possibility of error. Some
  MDAs are 'safe' and reliably return a nonzero status on any delivery error,
  even one due to temporary resource limits. The <b>maildrop</b>(1) program is
  like this; so are most programs designed as mail transport agents, such as
  <b>sendmail</b>(1), including the sendmail wrapper of Postfix and
  <b>exim</b>(1). These programs give back a reliable positive acknowledgement
  and can be used with the mda option with no risk of mail loss. Unsafe MDAs,
  though, may return 0 even on delivery failure. If this happens, you will lose
  mail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The normal mode of <b>fetchmail</b> is to try to download only 'new' messages,
  leaving untouched (and undeleted) messages you have already read directly on
  the server (or fetched with a previous <i>fetchmail</i> <i>--keep</i>). But
  you may find that messages you've already read on the server are being fetched
  (and deleted) even when you don't specify --all. There are several reasons
  this can happen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One could be that you're using POP2. The POP2 protocol includes no
  representation of 'new' or 'old' state in messages, so <b>fetchmail</b> must
  treat all messages as new all the time. But POP2 is obsolete, so this is
  unlikely.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A potential POP3 problem might be servers that insert messages in the middle of
  mailboxes (some VMS implementations of mail are rumored to do this). The
  <b>fetchmail</b> code assumes that new messages are appended to the end of the
  mailbox; when this is not true it may treat some old messages as new and vice
  versa. Using UIDL whilst setting fastuidl 0 might fix this, otherwise,
  consider switching to IMAP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Yet another POP3 problem is that if they can't make tempfiles in the user's home
  directory, some POP3 servers will hand back an undocumented response that
  causes fetchmail to spuriously report &quot;No mail&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IMAP code uses the presence or absence of the server flag \Seen to decide
  whether or not a message is new. This isn't the right thing to do, fetchmail
  should check the UIDVALIDITY and use UID, but it doesn't do that yet. Under
  Unix, it counts on your IMAP server to notice the BSD-style Status flags set
  by mail user agents and set the \Seen flag from them when appropriate. All
  Unix IMAP servers we know of do this, though it's not specified by the IMAP
  RFCs. If you ever trip over a server that doesn't, the symptom will be that
  messages you have already read on your host will look new to the server. In
  this (unlikely) case, only messages you fetched with <i>fetchmail --keep</i>
  will be both undeleted and marked old.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In ETRN and ODMR modes, <b>fetchmail</b> does not actually retrieve messages;
  instead, it asks the server's SMTP listener to start a queue flush to the
  client via SMTP. Therefore it sends only undelivered messages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SPAM_FILTERING"><a class="selflink" href="#SPAM_FILTERING">SPAM
  FILTERING</a></h1>
Many SMTP listeners allow administrators to set up 'spam filters' that block
  unsolicited email from specified domains. A MAIL FROM or DATA line that
  triggers this feature will elicit an SMTP response which (unfortunately)
  varies according to the listener.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Newer versions of <b>sendmail</b> return an error code of 571.
<div class="Pp"></div>
According to RFC2821, the correct thing to return in this situation is 550
  &quot;Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable&quot; (the draft adds
  &quot;[E.g., mailbox not found, no access, or command rejected for policy
  reasons].&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Older versions of the <b>exim</b> MTA return 501 &quot;Syntax error in
  parameters or arguments&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>postfix</b> MTA runs 554 as an antispam response.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Zmailer</b> may reject code with a 500 response (followed by an enhanced
  status code that contains more information).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Return codes which <b>fetchmail</b> treats as antispam responses and discards
  the message can be set with the 'antispam' option. This is one of the
  <i>only</i> three circumstance under which fetchmail ever discards mail (the
  others are the 552 and 553 errors described below, and the suppression of
  multidropped messages with a message-ID already seen).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>fetchmail</b> is fetching from an IMAP server, the antispam response will
  be detected and the message rejected immediately after the headers have been
  fetched, without reading the message body. Thus, you won't pay for downloading
  spam message bodies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, the list of antispam responses is empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>spambounce</i> global option is on, mail that is spam-blocked triggers
  an RFC1892/RFC1894 bounce message informing the originator that we do not
  accept mail from it. See also BUGS.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SMTP/ESMTP_ERROR_HANDLING"><a class="selflink" href="#SMTP/ESMTP_ERROR_HANDLING">SMTP/ESMTP

Besides the spam-blocking described above, fetchmail takes special actions on
  the following SMTP/ESMTP error responses
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">452 (insufficient system storage)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Leave the message in the server mailbox for later

<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_RUN_CONTROL_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_RUN_CONTROL_FILE">THE
  RUN CONTROL FILE</a></h1>
The preferred way to set up fetchmail is to write a <i>.fetchmailrc</i> file in
  your home directory (you may do this directly, with a text editor, or
  indirectly via <b>fetchmailconf</b>). When there is a conflict between the
  command-line arguments and the arguments in this file, the command-line
  arguments take precedence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To protect the security of your passwords, your <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> may not
  normally have more than 0700 (u=rwx,g=,o=) permissions; <b>fetchmail</b> will
  complain and exit otherwise (this check is suppressed when --version is on).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may read the <i>.fetchmailrc</i> file as a list of commands to be executed
  when <b>fetchmail</b> is called with no arguments.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Run_Control_Syntax"><a class="selflink" href="#Run_Control_Syntax">Run
  Control Syntax</a></h2>
Comments begin with a '#' and extend through the end of the line. Otherwise the
  file consists of a series of server entries or global option statements in a
  free-format, token-oriented syntax.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are four kinds of tokens: grammar keywords, numbers (i.e. decimal digit
  sequences), unquoted strings, and quoted strings. A quoted string is bounded
  by double quotes and may contain whitespace (and quoted digits are treated as
  a string). Note that quoted strings will also contain line feed characters if
  they run across two or more lines, unless you use a backslash to join lines
  (see below). An unquoted string is any whitespace-delimited token that is
  neither numeric, string quoted nor contains the special characters ',', ';',
  ':', or '='.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any amount of whitespace separates tokens in server entries, but is otherwise
  ignored. You may use backslash escape sequences (\n for LF, \t for HT, \b for
  BS, \r for CR, \ <i>nnn</i> for decimal (where nnn cannot start with a 0), \0
  <i>ooo</i> for octal, and \x<i>hh</i> for hex) to embed non-printable
  characters or string delimiters in strings. In quoted strings, a backslash at
  the very end of a line will cause the backslash itself and the line feed (LF
  or NL, new line) character to be ignored, so that you can wrap long strings.
  Without the backslash at the line end, the line feed character would become
  part of the string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Warning:</b> while these resemble C-style escape sequences, they are not the
  same. fetchmail only supports these eight styles. C supports more escape
  sequences that consist of backslash (\) and a single character, but does not
  support decimal codes and does not require the leading 0 in octal notation.
  Example: fetchmail interprets \233 the same as \xE9 (Latin small letter e with
  acute), where C would interpret \233 as octal 0233 = \x9B (CSI, control
  sequence introducer).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each server entry consists of one of the keywords 'poll' or 'skip', followed by
  a server name, followed by server options, followed by any number of user (or
  username) descriptions, followed by user options. Note: the most common cause
  of syntax errors is mixing up user and server options or putting user options
  before the user descriptions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For backward compatibility, the word 'server' is a synonym for 'poll'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the noise keywords 'and', 'with', 'has', 'wants', and 'options'
  anywhere in an entry to make it resemble English. They're ignored, but but can
  make entries much easier to read at a glance. The punctuation characters ':',
  ';' and ',' are also ignored.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Poll_vs._Skip"><a class="selflink" href="#Poll_vs._Skip">Poll
  vs. Skip</a></h2>
The 'poll' verb tells fetchmail to query this host when it is run with no
  arguments. The 'skip' verb tells <b>fetchmail</b> not to poll this host unless
  it is explicitly named on the command line. (The 'skip' verb allows you to
  experiment with test entries safely, or easily disable entries for hosts that
  are temporarily down.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Keyword/Option_Summary"><a class="selflink" href="#Keyword/Option_Summary">Keyword/Option

Here are the legal options. Keyword suffixes enclosed in square brackets are
  optional. Those corresponding to short command-line options are followed by

  and <i>follow</i> all server descriptions and options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the .fetchmailrc file, the 'envelope' string argument may be preceded by a
  whitespace-separated number. This number, if specified, is the number of such
  headers to skip over (that is, an argument of 1 selects the second header of
  the given type). This is sometime useful for ignoring bogus envelope headers
  created by an ISP's local delivery agent or internal forwards (through mail
  inspection systems, for instance).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Keywords_Not_Corresponding_To_Option_Switches"><a class="selflink" href="#Keywords_Not_Corresponding_To_Option_Switches">Keywords
  Not Corresponding To Option Switches</a></h2>
The 'folder' and 'smtphost' options (unlike their command-line equivalents) can
  take a space- or comma-separated list of names following them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All options correspond to the obvious command-line arguments, except the
  following: 'via', 'interval', 'aka', 'is', 'to', 'dns'/'no dns',
  'checkalias'/'no checkalias', 'password', 'preconnect', 'postconnect',
  'localdomains', 'stripcr'/'no stripcr', 'forcecr'/'no forcecr',
  'pass8bits'/'no pass8bits' 'dropstatus/no dropstatus', 'dropdelivered/no
  dropdelivered', 'mimedecode/no mimedecode', 'no idle', and 'no envelope'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'via' option is for if you want to have more than one configuration pointing
  at the same site. If it is present, the string argument will be taken as the
  actual DNS name of the mailserver host to query. This will override the
  argument of poll, which can then simply be a distinct label for the
  configuration (e.g. what you would give on the command line to explicitly
  query this host).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'interval' option (which takes a numeric argument) allows you to poll a
  server less frequently than the basic poll interval. If you say 'interval N'
  the server this option is attached to will only be queried every N poll
  intervals.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Singledrop_vs._Multidrop_options"><a class="selflink" href="#Singledrop_vs._Multidrop_options">Singledrop
  vs. Multidrop options</a></h2>
Please ensure you read the section titled <b>THE USE AND ABUSE OF MULTIDROP
  MAILBOXES </b> if you intend to use multidrop mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'is' or 'to' keywords associate the following local (client) name(s) (or
  server-name to client-name mappings separated by =) with the mailserver user
  name in the entry. If an is/to list has '*' as its last name, unrecognized
  names are simply passed through. Note that until <b>fetchmail</b> version
  6.3.4 inclusively, these lists could only contain local parts of user names
  (fetchmail would only look at the part before the @ sign). <b>fetchmail</b>
  versions 6.3.5 and newer support full addresses on the left hand side of these
  mappings, and they take precedence over any 'localdomains', 'aka', 'via' or
  similar mappings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A single local name can be used to support redirecting your mail when your
  username on the client machine is different from your name on the mailserver.
  When there is only a single local name, mail is forwarded to that local
  username regardless of the message's Received, To, Cc, and Bcc headers. In
  this case, <b>fetchmail</b> never does DNS lookups.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When there is more than one local name (or name mapping), <b>fetchmail</b> looks
  at the envelope header, if configured, and otherwise at the Received, To, Cc,
  and Bcc headers of retrieved mail (this is 'multidrop mode'). It looks for
  addresses with hostname parts that match your poll name or your 'via', 'aka'
  or 'localdomains' options, and usually also for hostname parts which DNS tells
  it are aliases of the mailserver. See the discussion of 'dns', 'checkalias',
  'localdomains', and 'aka' for details on how matching addresses are handled.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>fetchmail</b> cannot match any mailserver usernames or localdomain
  addresses, the mail will be bounced. Normally it will be bounced to the
  sender, but if the 'bouncemail' global option is off, the mail will go to the
  local postmaster instead. (see the 'postmaster' global option). See also BUGS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'dns' option (normally on) controls the way addresses from multidrop
  mailboxes are checked. On, it enables logic to check each host address that
  does not match an 'aka' or 'localdomains' declaration by looking it up with
  DNS. When a mailserver username is recognized attached to a matching hostname
  part, its local mapping is added to the list of local recipients.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'checkalias' option (normally off) extends the lookups performed by the
  'dns' keyword in multidrop mode, providing a way to cope with remote MTAs that
  identify themselves using their canonical name, while they're polled using an
  alias. When such a server is polled, checks to extract the envelope address
  fail, and <b>fetchmail</b> reverts to delivery using the To/Cc/Bcc headers
  (See below 'Header vs. Envelope addresses'). Specifying this option instructs
  <b>fetchmail</b> to retrieve all the IP addresses associated with both the
  poll name and the name used by the remote MTA and to do a comparison of the IP
  addresses. This comes in handy in situations where the remote server undergoes
  frequent canonical name changes, that would otherwise require modifications to
  the rcfile. 'checkalias' has no effect if 'no dns' is specified in the rcfile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'aka' option is for use with multidrop mailboxes. It allows you to
  pre-declare a list of DNS aliases for a server. This is an optimization hack
  that allows you to trade space for speed. When <b>fetchmail</b>, while
  processing a multidrop mailbox, grovels through message headers looking for
  names of the mailserver, pre-declaring common ones can save it from having to
  do DNS lookups. Note: the names you give as arguments to 'aka' are matched as
  suffixes -- if you specify (say) 'aka netaxs.com', this will match not just a
  hostname netaxs.com, but any hostname that ends with '.netaxs.com'; such as
  (say) pop3.netaxs.com and mail.netaxs.com.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'localdomains' option allows you to declare a list of domains which
  fetchmail should consider local. When fetchmail is parsing address lines in
  multidrop modes, and a trailing segment of a host name matches a declared
  local domain, that address is passed through to the listener or MDA unaltered
  (local-name mappings are <i>not</i> applied).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using 'localdomains', you may also need to specify 'no envelope',
  which disables <b>fetchmail</b>'s normal attempt to deduce an envelope address
  from the Received line or X-Envelope-To header or whatever header has been
  previously set by 'envelope'. If you set 'no envelope' in the defaults entry
  it is possible to undo that in individual entries by using 'envelope
  &lt;string&gt;'. As a special case, 'envelope &quot;Received&quot;' restores
  the default parsing of Received lines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>password</b> option requires a string argument, which is the password to
  be used with the entry's server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'preconnect' keyword allows you to specify a shell command to be executed
  just before each time <b>fetchmail</b> establishes a mailserver connection.
  This may be useful if you are attempting to set up secure POP connections with
  the aid of <b>ssh</b>(1). If the command returns a nonzero status, the poll of
  that mailserver will be aborted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, the 'postconnect' keyword similarly allows you to specify a shell
  command to be executed just after each time a mailserver connection is taken
  down.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'forcecr' option controls whether lines terminated by LF only are given CRLF
  termination before forwarding. Strictly speaking RFC821 requires this, but few
  MTAs enforce the requirement it so this option is normally off (only one such
  MTA, qmail, is in significant use at time of writing).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'stripcr' option controls whether carriage returns are stripped out of
  retrieved mail before it is forwarded. It is normally not necessary to set
  this, because it defaults to 'on' (CR stripping enabled) when there is an MDA
  declared but 'off' (CR stripping disabled) when forwarding is via SMTP. If
  'stripcr' and 'forcecr' are both on, 'stripcr' will override.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'pass8bits' option exists to cope with Microsoft mail programs that stupidly
  slap a &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit&quot; on everything. With this
  option off (the default) and such a header present, <b>fetchmail</b> declares
  BODY=7BIT to an ESMTP-capable listener; this causes problems for messages
  actually using 8-bit ISO or KOI-8 character sets, which will be garbled by
  having the high bits of all characters stripped. If 'pass8bits' is on,
  <b>fetchmail</b> is forced to declare BODY=8BITMIME to any ESMTP-capable
  listener. If the listener is 8-bit-clean (as all the major ones now are) the
  right thing will probably result.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'dropstatus' option controls whether nonempty Status and X-Mozilla-Status
  lines are retained in fetched mail (the default) or discarded. Retaining them
  allows your MUA to see what messages (if any) were marked seen on the server.
  On the other hand, it can confuse some new-mail notifiers, which assume that
  anything with a Status line in it has been seen. (Note: the empty Status lines
  inserted by some buggy POP servers are unconditionally discarded.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'dropdelivered' option controls whether Delivered-To headers will be kept in
  fetched mail (the default) or discarded. These headers are added by Qmail and
  Postfix mailservers in order to avoid mail loops but may get in your way if
  you try to &quot;mirror&quot; a mailserver within the same domain. Use with
  caution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'mimedecode' option controls whether MIME messages using the
  quoted-printable encoding are automatically converted into pure 8-bit data. If
  you are delivering mail to an ESMTP-capable, 8-bit-clean listener (that
  includes all of the major MTAs like sendmail), then this will automatically
  convert quoted-printable message headers and data into 8-bit data, making it
  easier to understand when reading mail. If your e-mail programs know how to
  deal with MIME messages, then this option is not needed. The mimedecode option
  is off by default, because doing RFC2047 conversion on headers throws away
  character-set information and can lead to bad results if the encoding of the
  headers differs from the body encoding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'idle' option is intended to be used with IMAP servers supporting the
  RFC2177 IDLE command extension, but does not strictly require it. If it is
  enabled, and fetchmail detects that IDLE is supported, an IDLE will be issued
  at the end of each poll. This will tell the IMAP server to hold the connection
  open and notify the client when new mail is available. If IDLE is not
  supported, fetchmail will simulate it by periodically issuing NOOP. If you
  need to poll a link frequently, IDLE can save bandwidth by eliminating TCP/IP
  connects and LOGIN/LOGOUT sequences. On the other hand, an IDLE connection
  will eat almost all of your fetchmail's time, because it will never drop the
  connection and allow other polls to occur unless the server times out the
  IDLE. It also doesn't work with multiple folders; only the first folder will
  ever be polled.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'properties' option is an extension mechanism. It takes a string argument,
  which is ignored by fetchmail itself. The string argument may be used to store
  configuration information for scripts which require it. In particular, the
  output of '--configdump' option will make properties associated with a user
  entry readily available to a Python script.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Miscellaneous_Run_Control_Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Miscellaneous_Run_Control_Options">Miscellaneous
  Run Control Options</a></h2>
The words 'here' and 'there' have useful English-like significance. Normally
  'user eric is esr' would mean that mail for the remote user 'eric' is to be
  delivered to 'esr', but you can make this clearer by saying 'user eric there
  is esr here', or reverse it by saying 'user esr here is eric there'
<div class="Pp"></div>
Legal protocol identifiers for use with the 'protocol' keyword are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    auto (or AUTO) (legacy, to be removed from future release)
    pop2 (or POP2) (legacy, to be removed from future release)
    pop3 (or POP3)
    sdps (or SDPS)
    imap (or IMAP)
    apop (or APOP)
    kpop (or KPOP)
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Legal authentication types are 'any', 'password', 'kerberos', 'kerberos_v4',
  'kerberos_v5' and 'gssapi', 'cram-md5', 'otp', 'msn' (only for POP3), 'ntlm',
  'ssh', 'external' (only IMAP). The 'password' type specifies authentication by
  normal transmission of a password (the password may be plain text or subject
  to protocol-specific encryption as in CRAM-MD5); 'kerberos' tells
  <b>fetchmail</b> to try to get a Kerberos ticket at the start of each query
  instead, and send an arbitrary string as the password; and 'gssapi' tells
  fetchmail to use GSSAPI authentication. See the description of the 'auth'
  keyword for more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifying 'kpop' sets POP3 protocol over port 1109 with Kerberos V4
  authentication. These defaults may be overridden by later options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some global option statements: 'set logfile' followed by a string sets
  the same global specified by --logfile. A command-line --logfile option will
  override this. Note that --logfile is only effective if fetchmail detaches
  itself from the terminal and the logfile already exists before fetchmail is
  run, and it overrides --syslog in this case. Also, 'set daemon' sets the poll
  interval as --daemon does. This can be overridden by a command-line --daemon
  option; in particular --daemon&#x00A0;0 can be used to force foreground
  operation. The 'set postmaster' statement sets the address to which multidrop
  mail defaults if there are no local matches. Finally, 'set syslog' sends log
  messages to syslogd(8).

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fetchmail_crashing"><a class="selflink" href="#Fetchmail_crashing">Fetchmail
  crashing</a></h2>
There are various ways in that fetchmail may &quot;crash&quot;, i. e. stop
  operation suddenly and unexpectedly. A &quot;crash&quot; usually refers to an
  error condition that the software did not handle by itself. A well-known
  failure mode is the &quot;segmentation fault&quot; or &quot;signal 11&quot; or
  &quot;SIGSEGV&quot; or just &quot;segfault&quot; for short. These can be
  caused by hardware or by software problems. Software-induced segfaults can
  usually be reproduced easily and in the same place, whereas hardware-induced
  segfaults can go away if the computer is rebooted, or powered off for a few
  hours, and can happen in random locations even if you use the software the
  same way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For solving hardware-induced segfaults, find the faulty component and repair or
  replace it. may help you with details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For solving software-induced segfaults, the developers may need a &quot;stack
  backtrace&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Enabling_fetchmail_core_dumps"><a class="selflink" href="#Enabling_fetchmail_core_dumps">Enabling
  fetchmail core dumps</a></h2>
By default, fetchmail suppresses core dumps as these might contain passwords and
  other sensitive information. For debugging fetchmail crashes, obtaining a
  &quot;stack backtrace&quot; from a core dump is often the quickest way to
  solve the problem, and when posting your problem on a mailing list, the
  developers may ask you for a &quot;backtrace&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
1. To get useful backtraces, fetchmail needs to be installed without getting
  stripped of its compilation symbols. Unfortunately, most binary packages that
  are installed are stripped, and core files from symbol-stripped programs are
  worthless. So you may need to recompile fetchmail. On many systems, you can
  type
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        file `which fetchmail`
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
to find out if fetchmail was symbol-stripped or not. If yours was unstripped,
  fine, proceed, if it was stripped, you need to recompile the source code
  first. You do not usually need to install fetchmail in order to debug it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
2. The shell environment that starts fetchmail needs to enable core dumps. The
  key is the &quot;maximum core (file) size&quot; that can usually be configured
  with a tool named &quot;limit&quot; or &quot;ulimit&quot;. See the
  documentation for your shell for details. In the popular bash shell,
  &quot;ulimit -Sc unlimited&quot; will allow the core dump.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
3. You need to tell fetchmail, too, to allow core dumps. To do this, run
  fetchmail with the <b>-d0 -v</b> options. It is often easier to also add
  <b>--nosyslog -N</b> as well.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, you need to reproduce the crash. You can just start fetchmail from the
  directory where you compiled it by typing <b>./fetchmail</b>, so the complete
  command line will start with <b>./fetchmail -Nvd0</b> <b>--nosyslog</b> and
  perhaps list your other options.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After the crash, run your debugger to obtain the core dump. The debugger will
  often be GNU GDB, you can then type (adjust paths as necessary) <b>gdb
  ./fetchmail fetchmail.core</b> and then, after GDB has started up and read all
  its files, type <b>backtrace full</b>, save the output (copy &amp; paste will
  do, the backtrace will be read by a human) and then type <b>quit</b> to leave
  gdb. <b>Note:</b> on some systems, the core files have different names, they
  might contain a number instead of the program name, or number and name, but it
  will usually have &quot;core&quot; as part of their name.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERACTION_WITH_RFC_822"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERACTION_WITH_RFC_822">INTERACTION
  WITH RFC 822</a></h1>
When trying to determine the originating address of a message, fetchmail looks
  through headers in the following order:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
        Return-Path:
        Resent-Sender: (ignored if it doesn't contain an @ or !)
        Sender: (ignored if it doesn't contain an @ or !)
        Resent-From:
        From:
        Reply-To:
        Apparently-From:
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The originating address is used for logging, and to set the MAIL FROM address
  when forwarding to SMTP. This order is intended to cope gracefully with
  receiving mailing list messages in multidrop mode. The intent is that if a
  local address doesn't exist, the bounce message won't be returned blindly to
  the author or to the list itself, but rather to the list manager (which is
  less annoying).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In multidrop mode, destination headers are processed as follows: First,
  fetchmail looks for the header specified by the 'envelope' option in order to
  determine the local recipient address. If the mail is addressed to more than
  one recipient, the Received line won't contain any information regarding
  recipient addresses.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Then fetchmail looks for the Resent-To:, Resent-Cc:, and Resent-Bcc: lines. If
  they exist, they should contain the final recipients and have precedence over
  their To:/Cc:/Bcc: counterparts. If the Resent-* lines don't exist, the To:,
  Cc:, Bcc: and Apparently-To: lines are looked for. (The presence of a
  Resent-To: is taken to imply that the person referred by the To: address has
  already received the original copy of the mail.)

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_EXAMPLES">CONFIGURATION
  EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Note that although there are password declarations in a good many of the
  examples below, this is mainly for illustrative purposes. We recommend
  stashing account/password pairs in your $HOME/.netrc file, where they can be
  used not just by fetchmail but by ftp(1) and other programs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The basic format is:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">poll <i>SERVERNAME</i> protocol <i>PROTOCOL</i> username
      <i>NAME</i> password <i>PASSWORD</i>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net protocol pop3 username &quot;jsmith&quot; password &quot;secret1&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Or, using some abbreviations:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user &quot;jsmith&quot; password &quot;secret1&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple servers may be listed:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user &quot;jsmith&quot; pass &quot;secret1&quot;
poll other.provider.net proto pop2 user &quot;John.Smith&quot; pass &quot;My^Hat&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's the same version with more whitespace and some noise words:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net proto pop3
     user &quot;jsmith&quot;, with password secret1, is &quot;jsmith&quot; here;
poll other.provider.net proto pop2:
     user &quot;John.Smith&quot;, with password &quot;My^Hat&quot;, is &quot;John.Smith&quot; here;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need to include whitespace in a parameter string or start the latter with
  a number, enclose the string in double quotes. Thus:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll mail.provider.net with proto pop3:
     user &quot;jsmith&quot; there has password &quot;4u but u can't krak this&quot;
     is jws here and wants mda &quot;/bin/mail&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may have an initial server description headed by the keyword 'defaults'
  instead of 'poll' followed by a name. Such a record is interpreted as defaults
  for all queries to use. It may be overwritten by individual server
  descriptions. So, you could write:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
defaults proto pop3
     user &quot;jsmith&quot;
poll pop.provider.net
     pass &quot;secret1&quot;
poll mail.provider.net
     user &quot;jjsmith&quot; there has password &quot;secret2&quot;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's possible to specify more than one user per server. The 'user' keyword leads
  off a user description, and every user specification in a multi-user entry
  must include it. Here's an example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 port 3111
     user &quot;jsmith&quot; with pass &quot;secret1&quot; is &quot;smith&quot; here
     user jones with pass &quot;secret2&quot; is &quot;jjones&quot; here keep
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This associates the local username 'smith' with the pop.provider.net username
  'jsmith' and the local username 'jjones' with the pop.provider.net username
  'jones'. Mail for 'jones' is kept on the server after download.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's what a simple retrieval configuration for a multidrop mailbox looks like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net:
     user maildrop with pass secret1 to golux 'hurkle'='happy' snark here
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This says that the mailbox of account 'maildrop' on the server is a multidrop
  box, and that messages in it should be parsed for the server user names
  'golux', 'hurkle', and 'snark'. It further specifies that 'golux' and 'snark'
  have the same name on the client as on the server, but mail for server user
  'hurkle' should be delivered to client user 'happy'.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Note</b> that <b>fetchmail,</b> until version 6.3.4, did NOT allow full
  user@domain specifications here, these would never match. <i>Fetchmail</i>
  6.3.5 and newer support user@domain specifications on the left-hand side of a
  user mapping.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's an example of another kind of multidrop connection:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll pop.provider.net localdomains loonytoons.org toons.org
     envelope X-Envelope-To
     user maildrop with pass secret1 to * here
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This also says that the mailbox of account 'maildrop' on the server is a
  multidrop box. It tells fetchmail that any address in the loonytoons.org or
  toons.org domains (including sub-domain addresses like
  'joe@daffy.loonytoons.org') should be passed through to the local SMTP
  listener without modification. Be careful of mail loops if you do this!
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's an example configuration using ssh and the plugin option. The queries are
  made directly on the stdin and stdout of imapd via ssh. Note that in this
  setup, IMAP authentication can be skipped.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
poll mailhost.net with proto imap:
     plugin &quot;ssh %h /usr/sbin/imapd&quot; auth ssh;
     user esr is esr here
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>

  USE AND ABUSE OF MULTIDROP MAILBOXES</a></h1>
Use the multiple-local-recipients feature with caution -- it can bite. All
  multidrop features are ineffective in ETRN and ODMR modes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also, note that in multidrop mode duplicate mails are suppressed. A piece of
  mail is considered duplicate if it has the same message-ID as the message
  immediately preceding and more than one addressee. Such runs of messages may
  be generated when copies of a message addressed to multiple users are
  delivered to a multidrop box.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Header_vs._Envelope_addresses"><a class="selflink" href="#Header_vs._Envelope_addresses">Header
  vs. Envelope addresses</a></h2>
The fundamental problem is that by having your mailserver toss several peoples'
  mail in a single maildrop box, you may have thrown away potentially vital
  information about who each piece of mail was actually addressed to (the
  'envelope address', as opposed to the header addresses in the RFC822 To/Cc
  headers - the Bcc is not available at the receiving end). This 'envelope
  address' is the address you need in order to reroute mail properly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes <b>fetchmail</b> can deduce the envelope address. If the mailserver
  MTA is <b>sendmail</b> and the item of mail had just one recipient, the MTA
  will have written a 'by/for' clause that gives the envelope addressee into its
  Received header. But this doesn't work reliably for other MTAs, nor if there
  is more than one recipient. By default, <b>fetchmail</b> looks for envelope
  addresses in these lines; you can restore this default with -E
  &quot;Received&quot; or 'envelope Received'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>As a better alternative,</b> some SMTP listeners and/or mail servers insert a
  header in each message containing a copy of the envelope addresses. This
  header (when it exists) is often 'X-Original-To', 'Delivered-To' or
  'X-Envelope-To'. Fetchmail's assumption about this can be changed with the -E
  or 'envelope' option. Note that writing an envelope header of this kind
  exposes the names of recipients (including blind-copy recipients) to all
  receivers of the messages, so the upstream must store one copy of the message
  per recipient to avoid becoming a privacy problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Postfix, since version 2.0, writes an X-Original-To: header which contains a
  copy of the envelope as it was received.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Qmail and Postfix generally write a 'Delivered-To' header upon delivering the
  message to the mail spool and use it to avoid mail loops. Qmail virtual
  domains however will prefix the user name with a string that normally matches
  the user's domain. To remove this prefix you can use the -Q or 'qvirtual'
  option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes, unfortunately, neither of these methods works. That is the point when
  you should contact your ISP and ask them to provide such an envelope header,
  and you should not use multidrop in this situation. When they all fail,
  fetchmail must fall back on the contents of To/Cc headers (Bcc headers are not
  available - see below) to try to determine recipient addressees -- and these
  are unreliable. In particular, mailing-list software often ships mail with
  only the list broadcast address in the To header.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Note that a future version of </b><b>fetchmail</b><b> may remove To/Cc
  parsing!</b> <b></b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>fetchmail</b> cannot deduce a recipient address that is local, and the
  intended recipient address was anyone other than fetchmail's invoking user,
  <b>mail will get lost.</b> This is what makes the multidrop feature risky
  without proper envelope information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A related problem is that when you blind-copy a mail message, the Bcc
  information is carried <i>only</i> as envelope address (it's removed from the
  headers by the sending mail server, so fetchmail can see it only if there is
  an X-Envelope-To header). Thus, blind-copying to someone who gets mail over a
  fetchmail multidrop link will fail unless the the mailserver host routinely
  writes X-Envelope-To or an equivalent header into messages in your maildrop.

  Ways To Use Multidrop Mailboxes</a></h2>
Multiple local names can be used to administer a mailing list from the client
  side of a <b>fetchmail</b> collection. Suppose your name is 'esr', and you
  want to both pick up your own mail and maintain a mailing list called (say)
  &quot;fetchmail-friends&quot;, and you want to keep the alias list on your
  client machine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On your server, you can alias 'fetchmail-friends' to 'esr'; then, in your
  <i>.fetchmailrc</i>, declare 'to esr fetchmail-friends here'. Then, when mail
  including 'fetchmail-friends' as a local address gets fetched, the list name
  will be appended to the list of recipients your SMTP listener sees. Therefore
  it will undergo alias expansion locally. Be sure to include 'esr' in the local
  alias expansion of fetchmail-friends, or you'll never see mail sent only to
  the list. Also be sure that your listener has the &quot;me-too&quot; option
  set (sendmail's -oXm command-line option or OXm declaration) so your name
  isn't removed from alias expansions in messages you send.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This trick is not without its problems, however. You'll begin to see this when a
  message comes in that is addressed only to a mailing list you do <i>not</i>
  have declared as a local name. Each such message will feature an
  'X-Fetchmail-Warning' header which is generated because fetchmail cannot find
  a valid local name in the recipient addresses. Such messages default (as was
  described above) to being sent to the local user running <b>fetchmail</b>, but
  the program has no way to know that that's actually the right thing.

  Ways To Abuse Multidrop Mailboxes</a></h2>
Multidrop mailboxes and <b>fetchmail</b> serving multiple users in daemon mode
  do not mix. The problem, again, is mail from mailing lists, which typically
  does not have an individual recipient address on it. Unless <b>fetchmail</b>
  can deduce an envelope address, such mail will only go to the account running
  fetchmail (probably root). Also, blind-copied users are very likely never to
  see their mail at all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're tempted to use <b>fetchmail</b> to retrieve mail for multiple users
  from a single mail drop via POP or IMAP, think again (and reread the section
  on header and envelope addresses above). It would be smarter to just let the
  mail sit in the mailserver's queue and use fetchmail's ETRN or ODMR modes to
  trigger SMTP sends periodically (of course, this means you have to poll more
  frequently than the mailserver's expiry period). If you can't arrange this,
  try setting up a UUCP feed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you absolutely <i>must</i> use multidrop for this purpose, make sure your
  mailserver writes an envelope-address header that fetchmail can see. Otherwise

Normally, when multiple users are declared <b>fetchmail</b> extracts recipient
  addresses as described above and checks each host part with DNS to see if it's
  an alias of the mailserver. If so, the name mappings described in the &quot;to
  ... here&quot; declaration are done and the mail locally delivered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a convenient but also slow method. To speed it up, pre-declare
  mailserver aliases with 'aka'; these are checked before DNS lookups are done.
  If you're certain your aka list contains <b>all</b> DNS aliases of the
  mailserver (and all MX names pointing at it - note this may change in a future
  version) you can declare 'no dns' to suppress DNS lookups entirely and
  <i>only</i> match against the aka list.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SOCKS"><a class="selflink" href="#SOCKS">SOCKS</a></h1>
Support for socks4/5 is a <b>compile time</b> configuration option. Once
  compiled in, fetchmail will always use the socks libraries and configuration
  on your system, there are no run-time switches in fetchmail - but you can
  still configure SOCKS: you can specify which SOCKS configuration file is used
  in the <b>SOCKS_CONF</b> environment variable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For instance, if you wanted to bypass the SOCKS proxy altogether and have
  fetchmail connect directly, you could just pass SOCKS_CONF=/dev/null in the
  environment, for example (add your usual command line options - if any - to
  the end of this line):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

To facilitate the use of <b>fetchmail</b> in shell scripts, an
  exit&#x00A0;status code is returned to give an indication of what occurred
  during a given connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exit codes returned by <b>fetchmail</b> are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">0</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">One or more messages were successfully retrieved (or, if
      the -c option was selected, were found waiting but not retrieved).</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There was no mail awaiting retrieval. (There may have been
      old mail still on the server but not selected for retrieval.) If you do
      not want &quot;no mail&quot; to be an error condition (for instance, for

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

If a <b>fetchmail</b> daemon is running as root, SIGUSR1 wakes it up from its
  sleep phase and forces a poll of all non-skipped servers. For compatibility
  reasons, SIGHUP can also be used in 6.3.X but may not be available in future
  fetchmail versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>fetchmail</b> is running in daemon mode as non-root, use SIGUSR1 to wake
  it (this is so SIGHUP due to logout can retain the default action of killing
  it).

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS,_LIMITATIONS,_AND_KNOWN_PROBLEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS,_LIMITATIONS,_AND_KNOWN_PROBLEMS">BUGS,
  LIMITATIONS, AND KNOWN PROBLEMS</a></h1>
Please check the <b>NEWS</b> file that shipped with fetchmail for more known
  bugs than those listed here.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fetchmail cannot handle user names that contain blanks after a &quot;@&quot;
  character, for instance &quot;demonstr@ti on&quot;. These are rather uncommon
  and only hurt when using UID-based --keep setups, so the 6.3.X versions of
  fetchmail won't be fixed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fetchmail cannot handle configurations where you have multiple accounts that use
  the same server name and the same login. Any user@server combination must be
  unique.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The assumptions that the DNS and in particular the checkalias options make are
  not often sustainable. For instance, it has become uncommon for an MX server
  to be a POP3 or IMAP server at the same time. Therefore the MX lookups may go
  away in a future release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mda and plugin options interact badly. In order to collect error status from
  the MDA, fetchmail has to change its normal signal handling so that dead
  plugin processes don't get reaped until the end of the poll cycle. This can
  cause resource starvation if too many zombies accumulate. So either don't
  deliver to a MDA using plugins or risk being overrun by an army of undead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The --interface option does not support IPv6 and it is doubtful if it ever will,
  since there is no portable way to query interface IPv6 addresses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The RFC822 address parser used in multidrop mode chokes on some @-addresses that
  are technically legal but bizarre. Strange uses of quoting and embedded
  comments are likely to confuse it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a message with multiple envelope headers, only the last one processed will be
  visible to fetchmail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use of some of these protocols requires that the program send unencrypted
  passwords over the TCP/IP connection to the mailserver. This creates a risk
  that name/password pairs might be snaffled with a packet sniffer or more
  sophisticated monitoring software. Under Linux and FreeBSD, the --interface
  option can be used to restrict polling to availability of a specific interface
  device with a specific local or remote IP address, but snooping is still
  possible if (a) either host has a network device that can be opened in
  promiscuous mode, or (b) the intervening network link can be tapped. We
  recommend the use of <b>ssh</b>(1) tunnelling to not only shroud your
  passwords but encrypt the entire conversation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use of the %F or %T escapes in an mda option could open a security hole, because
  they pass text manipulable by an attacker to a shell command. Potential shell
  characters are replaced by '_' before execution. The hole is further reduced
  by the fact that fetchmail temporarily discards any suid privileges it may
  have while running the MDA. For maximum safety, however, don't use an mda
  command containing %F or %T when fetchmail is run from the root account
  itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fetchmail's method of sending bounces due to errors or spam-blocking and spam
  bounces requires that port 25 of localhost be available for sending mail via
  SMTP.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you modify <i>~/.fetchmailrc</i> while a background instance is running and
  break the syntax, the background instance will die silently. Unfortunately, it
  can't die noisily because we don't yet know whether syslog should be enabled.
  On some systems, fetchmail dies quietly even if there is no syntax error; this
  seems to have something to do with buggy terminal ioctl code in the kernel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -f&#x00A0;- option (reading a configuration from stdin) is incompatible with
  the plugin option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'principal' option only handles Kerberos IV, not V.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Interactively entered passwords are truncated after 63 characters. If you really
  need to use a longer password, you will have to use a configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A backslash as the last character of a configuration file will be flagged as a
  syntax error rather than ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The BSMTP error handling is virtually nonexistent and may leave broken messages
  behind.
