<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-source - Debian source package (.dsc) manipulation
tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpkg-source [option...] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dpkg-source packs and unpacks Debian source archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None of these commands allow
multiple options to be combined into one, and they do not
allow the value for an option to be specified in a separate
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
-x, --extract filename.dsc [output-directory] <br>
Extract a source package (--extract since dpkg 1.17.14). One
non-option argument must be supplied, the name of the Debian
source control file (.dsc). An optional second <br>
non-option argument may be supplied to specify the directory
to extract the source package to, this must not exist. If no
output directory is specified, the source package <br>
is extracted into a directory named source-version under the
current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-source will read the names
of the other file(s) making up the source package from the
control file; they are assumed to be in the same directory
as the .dsc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files in the extracted
package will have their permissions and ownerships set to
those which would have been expected if the files and
directories had simply been cre&acirc; <br>
ated - directories and executable files will be 0777 and
plain files will be 0666, both modified by the
extractors&rsquo; umask; if the parent directory is setgid
then the <br>
extracted directories will be too, and all the files and
directories will inherit its group ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source package uses a
non-standard format (currently this means all formats except
&acirc;1.0&acirc;), its name will be stored in
debian/source/format so that the following <br>
builds of the source package use the same format by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --build directory
[format-specific-parameters] <br>
Build a source package (--build since dpkg 1.17.14). The
first non-option argument is taken as the name of the
directory containing the debianized source tree (i.e. with
<br>
a debian sub-directory and maybe changes to the original
files). Depending on the source package format used to build
the package, additional parameters might be <br>
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg-source will build the
source package with the first format found in this ordered
list: the format indicated with the --format command line
option, the format indi&acirc; <br>
cated in debian/source/format, &acirc;1.0&acirc;. The
fallback to &acirc;1.0&acirc; is deprecated and will be
removed at some point in the future, you should always
document the desired source <br>
format in debian/source/format. See section SOURCE PACKAGE
FORMATS for an extensive description of the various source
package formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-format directory <br>
Print the source format that would be used to build the
source package if dpkg-source --build directory was called
(in the same conditions and with the same parameters; <br>
since dpkg 1.15.5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--before-build directory <br>
Run the corresponding hook of the source package format
(since dpkg 1.15.8). This hook is called before any build of
the package (dpkg-buildpackage calls it very early <br>
even before debian/rules clean). This command is idempotent
and can be called multiple times. Not all source formats
implement something in this hook, and those that do <br>
usually prepare the source tree for the build for example by
ensuring that the Debian patches are applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--after-build directory <br>
Run the corresponding hook of the source package format
(since dpkg 1.15.8). This hook is called after any build of
the package (dpkg-buildpackage calls it last). This <br>
command is idempotent and can be called multiple times. Not
all source formats implement something in this hook, and
those that do usually use it to undo what <br>
--before-build has done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--commit [directory] ... <br>
Record changes in the source tree unpacked in directory
(since dpkg 1.16.1). This command can take supplementary
parameters depending on the source format. It will error
<br>
out for formats where this operation doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show the usage message and exit. The format specific build
and extract options can be shown by using the --format
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Generic build options <br>
-ccontrol-file <br>
Specifies the main source control file to read information
from. The default is debian/control. If given with relative
pathname this is interpreted starting at the source <br>
tree&rsquo;s top level directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lchangelog-file <br>
Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The
default is debian/changelog. If given with relative pathname
this is interpreted starting at the source tree&rsquo;s <br>
top level directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fchangelog-format <br>
Specifies the format of the changelog. See
dpkg-parsechangelog(1) for information about alternative
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--format=value <br>
Use the given format for building the source package (since
dpkg 1.14.17). It does override any format given in
debian/source/format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vname=value <br>
Set an output substitution variable. See deb-substvars(5)
for a discussion of output substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tsubstvars-file <br>
Read substitution variables in substvars-file; the default
is to not read any file. This option can be used multiple
times to read substitution variables from multiple <br>
files (since dpkg 1.15.6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dfield=value <br>
Override or add an output control file field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ufield <br>
Remove an output control file field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Zcompression,
--compression=compression <br>
Specify the compression to use for created tarballs and diff
files (--compression since dpkg 1.15.5). Note that this
option will not cause existing tarballs to be recom&acirc;
<br>
pressed, it only affects new files. Supported values are:
gzip, bzip2, lzma and xz. The default is xz for formats 2.0
and newer, and gzip for format 1.0. xz is only sup&acirc;
<br>
ported since dpkg 1.15.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zlevel,
--compression-level=level <br>
Compression level to use (--compression-level since dpkg
1.15.5). As with -Z it only affects newly created files.
Supported values are: 1 to 9, best, and fast. The <br>
default is 9 for gzip and bzip2, 6 for xz and lzma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i[regex], --diff-ignore[=regex]
<br>
You may specify a perl regular expression to match files you
want filtered out of the list of files for the diff
(--diff-ignore since dpkg 1.15.6). (This list is
gener&acirc; <br>
ated by a find command.) (If the source package is being
built as a version 3 source package using a VCS, this can be
used to ignore uncommited changes on specific files. <br>
Using -i.* will ignore all of them.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option by itself enables
this setting with a default regex (preserving any
modification to the default regex done by a previous use of
--extend-diff-ignore) that <br>
will filter out control files and directories of the most
common revision control systems, backup and swap files and
Libtool build output directories. There can only be <br>
one active regex, of multiple -i options only the last one
will take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is very helpful in cutting
out extraneous files that get included in the diff, e.g. if
you maintain your source in a revision control system and
want to use a check&acirc; <br>
out to build a source package without including the
additional files and directories that it will usually
contain (e.g. CVS/, .cvsignore, .svn/). The default regex is
<br>
already very exhaustive, but if you need to replace it,
please note that by default it can match any part of a path,
so if you want to match the begin of a filename or <br>
only full filenames, you will need to provide the necessary
anchors (e.g. &acirc;(^|/)&acirc;, &acirc;($|/)&acirc;)
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extend-diff-ignore=regex <br>
The perl regular expression specified will extend the
default value used by --diff-ignore and its current value,
if set (since dpkg 1.15.6). It does this by concatenating
<br>
&acirc;|regex&acirc; to the existing value. This option is
convenient to use in debian/source/options to exclude some
auto-generated files from the automatic patch
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[file-pattern],
--tar-ignore[=file-pattern] <br>
If this option is specified, the pattern will be passed to
tar(1)&rsquo;s --exclude option when it is called to
generate a .orig.tar or .tar file (--tar-ignore since dpkg
<br>
1.15.6). For example, -ICVS will make tar skip over CVS
directories when generating a .tar.gz file. The option may
be repeated multiple times to list multiple patterns to <br>
exclude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I by itself adds default
--exclude options that will filter out control files and
directories of the most common revision control systems,
backup and swap files and <br>
Libtool build output directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: While they have similar
purposes, -i and -I have very different syntax and
semantics. -i can only be specified once and takes a perl
compatible regular expression which is <br>
matched against the full relative path of each file. -I can
specified multiple times and takes a filename pattern with
shell wildcards. The pattern is applied to the full
rela&acirc; <br>
tive path but also to each part of the path individually.
The exact semantic of tar&rsquo;s --exclude option is
somewhat complicated, see
https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/man&acirc; <br>
ual/tar.html#wildcards for a full documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default regex and patterns
for both options can be seen in the output of the --help
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generic extract options <br>
--no-copy <br>
Do not copy original tarballs near the extracted source
package (since dpkg 1.14.17).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-check <br>
Do not check signatures and checksums before unpacking
(since dpkg 1.14.17).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-overwrite-dir <br>
Do not overwrite the extraction directory if it already
exists (since dpkg 1.18.8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--require-valid-signature <br>
Refuse to unpack the source package if it doesn&rsquo;t
contain an OpenPGP signature that can be verified (since
dpkg 1.15.0) either with the user&rsquo;s trustedkeys.gpg
keyring, one <br>
of the vendor-specific keyrings, or one of the official
Debian keyrings (/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg and
/usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--require-strong-checksums <br>
Refuse to unpack the source package if it does not contain
any strong checksums (since dpkg 1.18.7). Currently the only
known checksum considered strong is SHA-256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-bad-version <br>
Turns the bad source package version check into a non-fatal
warning (since dpkg 1.17.7). This option should only be
necessary when extracting ancient source packages with <br>
broken versions, just for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE PACKAGE FORMATS <br>
If you don&rsquo;t know what source format to use, you
should probably pick either &acirc;3.0 (quilt)&acirc; or
&acirc;3.0 (native)&acirc;. See
https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0 for information
on <br>
the deployment of those formats within Debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 1.0 <br>
A source package in this format consists either of a
.orig.tar.gz associated to a .diff.gz or a single .tar.gz
(in that case the package is said to be native). Optionally
the <br>
original tarball might be accompanied by a detached upstream
signature .orig.tar.gz.asc, extraction supported since dpkg
1.18.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting a native package is a
simple extraction of the single tarball in the target
directory. Extracting a non-native package is done by first
unpacking the .orig.tar.gz and <br>
then applying the patch contained in the .diff.gz file. The
timestamp of all patched files is reset to the extraction
time of the source package (this avoids timestamp skews <br>
leading to problems when autogenerated files are patched).
The diff can create new files (the whole debian directory is
created that way) but can&rsquo;t remove files (empty files
will <br>
be left over).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building a native package is
just creating a single tarball with the source directory.
Building a non-native package involves extracting the
original tarball in a separate <br>
&acirc;.orig&acirc; directory and regenerating the .diff.gz
by comparing the source package directory with the .orig
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build options (with
--build):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a second non-option argument
is supplied it should be the name of the original source
directory or tarfile or the empty string if the package is a
Debian-specific one and so <br>
has no Debianisation diffs. If no second argument is
supplied then dpkg-source will look for the original source
tarfile package_upstream-version.orig.tar.gz or the original
<br>
source directory directory.orig depending on the -sX
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sa, -sp, -sk, -su and -sr will
not overwrite existing tarfiles or directories. If this is
desired then -sA, -sP, -sK, -sU and -sR should be used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sk Specifies to expect the
original source as a tarfile, by default
package_upstream-version.orig.tar.extension. It will leave
this original source in place as a tarfile, or <br>
copy it to the current directory if it isn&rsquo;t already
there. The tarball will be unpacked into directory.orig for
the generation of the diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sp Like -sk but will remove the
directory again afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-su Specifies that the original
source is expected as a directory, by default
package-upstream-version.orig and dpkg-source will create a
new original source archive from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sr Like -su but will remove
that directory after it has been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ss Specifies that the original
source is available both as a directory and as a tarfile.
dpkg-source will use the directory to create the diff, but
the tarfile to create the <br>
.dsc. This option must be used with care - if the directory
and tarfile do not match a bad source archive will be
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sn Specifies to not look for
any original source, and to not generate a diff. The second
argument, if supplied, must be the empty string. This is
used for Debian-specific <br>
packages which do not have a separate upstream source and
therefore have no debianisation diffs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sa or -sA <br>
Specifies to look for the original source archive as a
tarfile or as a directory - the second argument, if any, may
be either, or the empty string (this is equivalent to <br>
using -sn). If a tarfile is found it will unpack it to
create the diff and remove it afterwards (this is equivalent
to -sp); if a directory is found it will pack it to <br>
create the original source and remove it afterwards (this is
equivalent to -sr); if neither is found it will assume that
the package has no debianisation diffs, only a <br>
straightforward source archive (this is equivalent to -sn).
If both are found then dpkg-source will ignore the
directory, overwriting it, if -sA was specified (this is
<br>
equivalent to -sP) or raise an error if -sa was specified.
-sA is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort-on-upstream-changes <br>
The process fails if the generated diff contains changes to
files outside of the debian sub-directory (since dpkg
1.15.8). This option is not allowed in <br>
debian/source/options but can be used in
debian/source/local-options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract options (with
--extract):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases any existing
original source tree will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sp Used when extracting then
the original source (if any) will be left as a tarfile. If
it is not already located in the current directory or if an
existing but different <br>
file is there it will be copied there. (This is the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-su Unpacks the original source
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sn Ensures that the original
source is neither copied to the current directory nor
unpacked. Any original source tree that was in the current
directory is still removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the -sX options are mutually
exclusive. If you specify more than one only the last one
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-debianization <br>
Skips application of the debian diff on top of the upstream
sources (since dpkg 1.15.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 2.0 <br>
Extraction supported since dpkg 1.13.9, building supported
since dpkg 1.14.8. Also known as wig&amp;pen. This format is
not recommended for wide-spread usage, the format &acirc;3.0
<br>
(quilt)&acirc; replaces it. Wig&amp;pen was the first
specification of a new-generation source package format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour of this format is
the same as the &acirc;3.0 (quilt)&acirc; format except that
it doesn&rsquo;t use an explicit list of patches. All files
in debian/patches/ matching the perl regu&acirc; <br>
lar expression [1488</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When building a new source
package, any change to the upstream source is stored in a
patch named zz_debian-diff-auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 3.0 (native) <br>
Supported since dpkg 1.14.17. This format is an extension of
the native package format as defined in the 1.0 format. It
supports all compression methods and will ignore by <br>
default any VCS specific files and directories as well as
many temporary files (see default value associated to -I
option in the --help output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 3.0 (quilt) <br>
Supported since dpkg 1.14.17. A source package in this
format contains at least an original tarball (.orig.tar.ext
where ext can be gz, bz2, lzma and xz) and a debian tarball
<br>
(.debian.tar.ext). It can also contain additional original
tarballs (.orig-component.tar.ext). component can only
contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens
(&acirc;-&acirc;). Optionally <br>
each original tarball can be accompanied by a detached
upstream signature (.orig.tar.ext.asc and
.orig-component.tar.ext.asc), extraction supported since
dpkg 1.17.20, building <br>
supported since dpkg 1.18.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main original tarball is
extracted first, then all additional original tarballs are
extracted in subdirectories named after the component part
of their filename (any pre- <br>
existing directory is replaced). The debian tarball is
extracted on top of the source directory after prior removal
of any pre-existing debian directory. Note that the debian
<br>
tarball must contain a debian sub-directory but it can also
contain binary files outside of that directory (see
--include-binaries option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All patches listed in
debian/patches/debian.series or debian/patches/series are
then applied. If the former file is used and the latter one
doesn&rsquo;t exist (or is a symlink), then <br>
the latter is replaced with a symlink to the former. This is
meant to simplify usage of quilt to manage the set of
patches. Note however that while dpkg-source parses
correctly <br>
series files with explicit options used for patch
application (stored on each line after the patch filename
and one or more spaces), it does ignore those options and
always <br>
expect patches that can be applied with the -p1 option of
patch. It will thus emit a warning when it encounters such
options, and the build is likely to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timestamp of all patched
files is reset to the extraction time of the source package
(this avoids timestamp skews leading to problems when
autogenerated files are patched).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contrary to quilt&rsquo;s
default behaviour, patches are expected to apply without any
fuzz. When that is not the case, you should refresh such
patches with quilt, or dpkg-source will <br>
error out while trying to apply them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly to quilt&rsquo;s
default behaviour, the patches can remove files too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file .pc/applied-patches is
created if some patches have been applied during the
extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All original tarballs found in
the current directory are extracted in a temporary directory
by following the same logic as for the unpack, the debian
directory is copied over in <br>
the temporary directory, and all patches except the
automatic patch (debian-changes-version or debian-changes,
depending on --single-debian-patch) are applied. The
temporary <br>
directory is compared to the source package directory. When
the diff is non-empty, the build fails unless
--single-debian-patch or --auto-commit has been used, in
which case the <br>
diff is stored in the automatic patch. If the automatic
patch is created/deleted, it&rsquo;s added/removed from the
series file and from the quilt metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any change on a binary file is
not representable in a diff and will thus lead to a failure
unless the maintainer deliberately decided to include that
modified binary file in the <br>
debian tarball (by listing it in
debian/source/include-binaries). The build will also fail if
it finds binary files in the debian sub-directory unless
they have been whitelisted <br>
through debian/source/include-binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The updated debian directory and
the list of modified binaries is then used to generate the
debian tarball.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The automatically generated diff
doesn&rsquo;t include changes on VCS specific files as well
as many temporary files (see default value associated to -i
option in the --help output). <br>
In particular, the .pc directory used by quilt is ignored
during generation of the automatic patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: dpkg-source --before-build
(and --build) will ensure that all patches listed in the
series file are applied so that a package build always has
all patches applied. It does <br>
this by finding unapplied patches (they are listed in the
series file but not in .pc/applied-patches), and if the
first patch in that set can be applied without errors, it
will <br>
apply them all. The option --no-preparation can be used to
disable this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recording changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--commit [directory]
[patch-name] [patch-file] <br>
Generates a patch corresponding to the local changes that
are not managed by the quilt patch system and integrates it
in the patch system under the name patch-name. If the <br>
name is missing, it will be asked interactively. If
patch-file is given, it is used as the patch corresponding
to the local changes to integrate. Once integrated, an
edi&acirc; <br>
tor is launched so that you can edit the meta-information in
the patch header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing patch-file is mainly
useful after a build failure that pre-generated this file,
and on this ground the given file is removed after
integration. Note also that the <br>
changes contained in the patch file must already be applied
on the tree and that the files modified by the patch must
not have supplementary unrecorded changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the patch generation detects
modified binary files, they will be automatically added to
debian/source/include-binaries so that they end up in the
debian tarball <br>
(exactly like dpkg-source --include-binaries --build would
do).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build options</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-version-of-quilt-db=version
<br>
Allow dpkg-source to build the source package if the version
of the quilt metadata is the one specified, even if
dpkg-source doesn&rsquo;t know about it (since dpkg
1.15.5.4). <br>
Effectively this says that the given version of the quilt
metadata is compatible with the version 2 that dpkg-source
currently supports. The version of the quilt metadata <br>
is stored in .pc/.version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-removal <br>
Do not ignore removed files and include them in the
automatically generated patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-timestamp <br>
Include timestamp in the automatically generated patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-binaries <br>
Add all modified binaries in the debian tarball. Also add
them to debian/source/include-binaries: they will be added
by default in subsequent builds and this option is <br>
thus no more needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-preparation <br>
Do not try to prepare the build tree by applying patches
which are apparently unapplied (since dpkg 1.14.18).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--single-debian-patch <br>
Use debian/patches/debian-changes instead of
debian/patches/debian-changes-version for the name of the
automatic patch generated during build (since dpkg
1.15.5.4). This <br>
option is particularly useful when the package is maintained
in a VCS and a patch set can&rsquo;t reliably be generated.
Instead the current diff with upstream should be stored <br>
in a single patch. The option would be put in
debian/source/local-options and would be accompanied by a
debian/source/local-patch-header file explaining how the
Debian <br>
changes can be best reviewed, for example in the VCS that is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-empty-orig <br>
Automatically create the main original tarball as empty if
it&rsquo;s missing and if there are supplementary original
tarballs (since dpkg 1.15.6). This option is meant to be
<br>
used when the source package is just a bundle of multiple
upstream software and where there&rsquo;s no
&acirc;main&acirc; software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-unapply-patches,
--unapply-patches <br>
By default, dpkg-source will automatically unapply the
patches in the --after-build hook if it did apply them
during --before-build (--unapply-patches since dpkg 1.15.8,
<br>
--no-unapply-patches since dpkg 1.16.5). Those options allow
you to forcefully disable or enable the patch unapplication
process. Those options are only allowed in <br>
debian/source/local-options so that all generated source
packages have the same behavior by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort-on-upstream-changes <br>
The process fails if an automatic patch has been generated
(since dpkg 1.15.8). This option can be used to ensure that
all changes were properly recorded in separate <br>
quilt patches prior to the source package build. This option
is not allowed in debian/source/options but can be used in
debian/source/local-options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-commit <br>
The process doesn&rsquo;t fail if an automatic patch has
been generated, instead it&rsquo;s immediately recorded in
the quilt series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extract options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-debianization <br>
Skips extraction of the debian tarball on top of the
upstream sources (since dpkg 1.15.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-patches <br>
Do not apply patches at the end of the extraction (since
dpkg 1.14.18).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 3.0 (custom) <br>
Supported since dpkg 1.14.17. This format is special. It
doesn&rsquo;t represent a real source package format but can
be used to create source packages with arbitrary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All non-option arguments are
taken as files to integrate in the generated source package.
They must exist and are preferably in the current directory.
At least one file must be <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-format=value <br>
Required. Defines the real format of the generated source
package. The generated .dsc file will contain this value in
its Format field and not &acirc;3.0 (custom)&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 3.0 (git) <br>
Supported since dpkg 1.14.17. This format is
experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A source package in this format
consists of a single bundle of a git repository .git to hold
the source of a package. There may also be a .gitshallow
file listing revisions for <br>
a shallow git clone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bundle is cloned as a git
repository to the target directory. If there is a gitshallow
file, it is installed as .git/shallow inside the cloned git
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that by default the new
repository will have the same branch checked out that was
checked out in the original source. (Typically
&acirc;master&acirc;, but it could be anything.) Any <br>
other branches will be available under remotes/origin/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before going any further, some
checks are done to ensure that we don&rsquo;t have any
non-ignored uncommitted changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-bundle(1) is used to
generate a bundle of the git repository. By default, all
branches and tags in the repository are included in the
bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Build options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--git-ref=ref <br>
Allows specifying a git ref to include in the git bundle.
Use disables the default behavior of including all branches
and tags. May be specified multiple times. The ref <br>
can be the name of a branch or tag to include. It may also
be any parameter that can be passed to git-rev-list(1). For
example, to include only the master branch, use <br>
--git-ref=master. To include all tags and branches, except
for the private branch, use --git-ref=--all
--git-ref=^private</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--git-depth=number <br>
Creates a shallow clone with a history truncated to the
specified number of revisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format: 3.0 (bzr) <br>
Supported since dpkg 1.14.17. This format is experimental.
It generates a single tarball containing the bzr
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tarball is unpacked and then
bzr is used to checkout the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before going any further, some
checks are done to ensure that we don&rsquo;t have any
non-ignored uncommitted changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then the VCS specific part of
the source directory is copied over to a temporary
directory. Before this temporary directory is packed in a
tarball, various cleanup are done to <br>
save space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
no source format specified in debian/source/format <br>
The file debian/source/format should always exist and
indicate the desired source format. For backwards
compatibility, format &acirc;1.0&acirc; is assumed when the
file doesn&rsquo;t exist but you <br>
should not rely on this: at some point in the future
dpkg-source will be modified to fail when that file
doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rationale is that format
&acirc;1.0&acirc; is no longer the recommended format, you
should usually pick one of the newer formats (&acirc;3.0
(quilt)&acirc;, &acirc;3.0 (native)&acirc;) but dpkg-source
will not <br>
do this automatically for you. If you want to continue using
the old format, you should be explicit about it and put
&acirc;1.0&acirc; in debian/source/format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the diff modifies the following
upstream files <br>
When using source format &acirc;1.0&acirc; it is usually a
bad idea to modify upstream files directly as the changes
end up hidden and mostly undocumented in the .diff.gz file.
Instead you <br>
should store your changes as patches in the debian directory
and apply them at build-time. To avoid this complexity you
can also use the format &acirc;3.0 (quilt)&acirc; that
offers this <br>
natively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot represent change to file
<br>
Changes to upstream sources are usually stored with patch
files, but not all changes can be represented with patches:
they can only alter the content of plain text files. If you
<br>
try replacing a file with something of a different type (for
example replacing a plain file with a symlink or a
directory), you will get this error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newly created empty file file
will not be represented in diff <br>
Empty files can&rsquo;t be created with patch files. Thus
this change is not recorded in the source package and you
are warned about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">executable mode perms of file
will not be represented in diff <br>
Patch files do not record permissions of files and thus
executable permissions are not stored in the source package.
This warning reminds you of that fact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">special mode perms of file will
not be represented in diff <br>
Patch files do not record permissions of files and thus
modified permissions are not stored in the source package.
This warning reminds you of that fact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMATS <br>
debian/source/format <br>
This file contains on a single line the format that should
be used to build the source package (possible formats are
described above). No leading or trailing spaces are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/source/include-binaries
<br>
This file contains a list of binary files (one per line)
that should be included in the debian tarball. Leading and
trailing spaces are stripped. Lines starting with
&acirc;#&acirc; are <br>
comments and are skipped. Empty lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/source/options <br>
This file contains a list of long options that should be
automatically prepended to the set of command line options
of a dpkg-source --build or dpkg-source --print-format call.
<br>
Options like --compression and --compression-level are well
suited for this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each option should be put on a
separate line. Empty lines and lines starting with
&acirc;#&acirc; are ignored. The leading &acirc;--&acirc;
should be stripped and short options are not allowed. <br>
Optional spaces are allowed around the &acirc;=&acirc;
symbol and optional quotes are allowed around the value.
Here&rsquo;s an example of such a file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># let dpkg-source create a
debian.tar.bz2 with maximal compression <br>
compression = &quot;bzip2&quot; <br>
compression-level = 9 <br>
# use debian/patches/debian-changes as automatic patch <br>
single-debian-patch <br>
# ignore changes on config.{sub,guess} <br>
extend-diff-ignore =
&quot;(^|/)(config.sub|config.guess)$&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: format options are not
accepted in this file, you should use debian/source/format
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/source/local-options <br>
Exactly like debian/source/options except that the file is
not included in the generated source package. It can be
useful to store a preference tied to the maintainer or to
the <br>
VCS repository where the source package is maintained.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/source/local-patch-header
and debian/source/patch-header <br>
Free form text that is put on top of the automatic patch
generated in formats &acirc;2.0&acirc; or &acirc;3.0
(quilt)&acirc;. local-patch-header is not included in the
generated source package while <br>
patch-header is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian/patches/series <br>
This file lists all patches that have to be applied (in the
given order) on top of the upstream source package. Leading
and trailing spaces are stripped. Lines starting with
&acirc;#&acirc; <br>
are comments and are skipped. Empty lines are ignored.
Remaining lines start with a patch filename (relative to the
debian/patches/ directory) up to the first space character
<br>
or the end of line. Optional quilt options can follow up to
the end of line or the first &acirc;#&acirc; preceded by one
or more spaces (which marks the start of a comment up to the
end of <br>
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The point at which field overriding occurs compared to
certain standard output field settings is rather
confused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
deb-src-control(5), deb-changelog(5), dsc(5).</p>
