<p>PLOTCHANGELOG(1) General Commands Manual
PLOTCHANGELOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
plotchangelog - graph Debian changelogs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
plotchangelog [options] changelog ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
plotchangelog is a tool to aid in visualizing a Debian
changelog. The changelogs are graphed with gnuplot(1) , with
the X axis of the graph denoting time of release and the Y
<br>
axis denoting the Debian version number of the package. Each
individual release of the package is represented by a point,
and the points are color coded to indicate who released <br>
that version of the package. The upstream version number of
the package can also be labeled on the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the Y axis can be
configured to display the size of the changelog entry for
each new version. Or it can be configured to display
approximately how many bugs were <br>
fixed for each new version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if the package is a
Debian-specific package, the entire package version will be
used for the Y axis. This does not always work
perfectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READING THE GRAPH <br>
The general outline of a package&rsquo;s graph is typically
a series of peaks, starting at 1, going up to n, and then
returning abruptly to 1. The higher the peaks, the more
releases <br>
the maintainer made between new upstream versions of the
package. If a package is Debian-only, it&rsquo;s graph will
just grow upwards without ever falling (although a bug in
this pro&acirc; <br>
gram may cause it to fall sometimes, if the version number
goes from say, 0.9 to say, 0.10 - this is interpreted
wrong...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the graph dips below 1,
someone made a NMU of the package and upgraded it to a new
upstream version, thus setting the Debian version to 0.
NMU&rsquo;s in general appear as frac&acirc; <br>
tional points like 1.1, 2.1, etc. A NMU can also be easily
detected by looking at the points that represent which
maintainer uploaded the package -- a solitary point of a
differ&acirc; <br>
ent type than the points before and after it is typically a
NMU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also easy to tell by
looking at the points when a package changes
maintainers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l, --linecount <br>
Instead of using the Debian version number as the Y axis,
use the number of lines in the changelog entry for each
version. Cannot be used together with --bugcount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --bugcount <br>
Instead of using the Debian version number as the Y axis,
use the number of bugs that were closed by each changelog
entry. Note that this number is obtained by searching <br>
for &quot;#dddd&quot; in the changelog, and so it may be
inaccurate. Cannot be used together with --linecount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cumulative <br>
When used together with either --bugcount or --linecount,
graphs the cumulative count rather than the count in each
individual changelog entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --no-version <br>
Do not show upstream version labels. Useful if the graph
gets too crowded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --no-maint <br>
Do not differentiate between different maintainers of the
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s file, --save=file <br>
Save the graph to file in PostScript format instead of
immediately displaying it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --urgency <br>
Use larger points when displaying higher-urgency package
uploads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Output the gnuplot script that is fed into gnuplot (for
debugging purposes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gcommands, --gnuplot=commands
<br>
This allows you to insert gnuplot(1) commands into the
gnuplot script that is used to generate the graph. The
commands are placed after all initialization but before the
<br>
final plot command. This can be used to override the default
look provided by this program in arbitrary ways. You can
also use things like &quot;set terminal png color&quot; to
<br>
change the output file type, which is useful in conjunction
with the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show a usage summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version, author and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noconf, --no-conf <br>
Do not read any configuration files (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changelog ... <br>
The changelog files to graph. If multiple files are
specified they will all be displayed on the same graph. The
files may be compressed with gzip. Any text in them that is
<br>
not in Debian changelog format will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced by a shell in that order to set
configuration variables. The --no-conf option can be used to
pre&acirc; <br>
vent reading these files. Environment variable settings are
ignored when these configuration files are read. The
currently recognised variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLOTCHANGELOG_OPTIONS <br>
This is a space-separated list of options to always use, for
example -l -b. Do not include -g or --gnuplot among this
list as it may be ignored; see the next variable <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLOTCHANGELOG_GNUPLOT <br>
These are gnuplot commands which will be prepended to any
such commands given on the command line.</p>
