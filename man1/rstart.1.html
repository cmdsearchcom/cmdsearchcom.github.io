<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSTART(1) General Commands
Manual RSTART(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rstart - a sample implementation of a Remote Start
client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rstart [-c context] [-g] [-l username] [-v] hostname command
args ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rstart is a simple implementation of a Remote Start client
as defined in &quot;A Flexible Remote Execution Protocol
Based on rsh&quot;. It uses rsh as its underlying remote
execution <br>
mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c context <br>
This option specifies the context in which the command is to
be run. A context specifies a general environment the
program is to be run in. The details of this environ&acirc;
<br>
ment are host-specific; the intent is that the client need
not know how the environment must be configured. If omitted,
the context defaults to X. This should be suit&acirc; <br>
able for running X programs from the host&rsquo;s
&quot;usual&quot; X installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Interprets command as a
generic command, as discussed in the protocol document. This
is intended to allow common applications to be invoked
without knowing what they are <br>
called on the remote system. Currently, the only generic
commands defined are Terminal, LoadMonitor, ListContexts,
and ListGenericCommands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l username <br>
This option is passed to the underlying rsh; it requests
that the command be run as the specified user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option requests that
rstart be verbose in its operation. Without this option,
rstart discards output from the remote&rsquo;s rstart
helper, and directs the rstart helper <br>
to detach the program from the rsh connection used to start
it. With this option, responses from the helper are
displayed and the resulting program is not detached from
<br>
the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This is a trivial implementation. Far more sophisticated
implementations are possible and should be developed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error handling is nonexistent.
Without -v, error reports from the remote are discarded
silently. With -v, error reports are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The $DISPLAY environment
variable is passed. If it starts with a colon, the local
hostname is prepended. The local domain name should be
appended to unqualified host names, but <br>
isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The $SESSION_MANAGER environment
variable should be passed, but isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X11 authority information is
passed for the current display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICE authority information should
be passed, but isn&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t completely clear
how rstart should select what ICE authority information to
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even without -v, the sample
rstart helper will leave a shell waiting for the program to
complete. This causes no real harm and consumes relatively
few resources, but if it is <br>
undesirable it can be avoided by explicitly specifying the
&quot;exec&quot; command to the shell, eg <br>
rstart somehost exec xterm <br>
This is obviously dependent on the command interpreter being
used on the remote system; the example given will work for
the Bourne and C shells.</p>
