<p>GIT-PACK-REFS(1) Git Manual GIT-PACK-REFS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-pack-refs - Pack heads and tags for efficient repository
access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git pack-refs [--all] [--no-prune]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known
as refs) were stored one file per ref in a (sub)directory
under $GIT_DIR/refs directory. While many branch tips tend
<br>
to be updated often, most tags and some branch tips are
never updated. When a repository has hundreds or thousands
of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage
and <br>
hurts performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is used to solve
the storage and performance problem by storing the refs in a
single file, $GIT_DIR/packed-refs. When a ref is missing
from the traditional <br>
$GIT_DIR/refs directory hierarchy, it is looked up in this
file and used if found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subsequent updates to branches
always create new files under $GIT_DIR/refs directory
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A recommended practice to deal
with a repository with too many refs is to pack its refs
with --all --prune once, and occasionally run git pack-refs
--prune. Tags are by <br>
definition stationary and are not expected to change. Branch
heads will be packed with the initial pack-refs --all, but
only the currently active branch heads will become <br>
unpacked, and the next pack-refs (without --all) will leave
them unpacked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--all <br>
The command by default packs all tags and refs that are
already packed, and leaves other refs alone. This is because
branches are expected to be actively developed and <br>
packing their tips does not help performance. This option
causes branch tips to be packed as well. Useful for a
repository with many branches of historical interests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-prune <br>
The command usually removes loose refs under $GIT_DIR/refs
hierarchy after packing them. This option tells it not
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Older documentation written before the packed-refs mechanism
was introduced may still say things like
&quot;.git/refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt; file exists&quot; when
it means &quot;branch &lt;branch&gt; <br>
exists&quot;.</p>
