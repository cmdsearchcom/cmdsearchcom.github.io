<p>xsetwacom(1) General Commands Manual xsetwacom(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xsetwacom - commandline utility to query and modify wacom
driver settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xsetwacom [options] [command [arguments]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program queries or changes properties on the devices
loaded by the wacom driver. The modification of properties
happens at runtime and is not persistent through X server
<br>
restarts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-d, --display display_name <br>
Connect to the X server specified in display_name; see
X(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints a short help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Enable verbose output, useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Allowed commands are list, get, and set. The command may be
specified with or without one or two preceding dashes, i.e.
--list is equivalent to -list and list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST COMMANDS <br>
list devices <br>
List known devices. Only input devices managed by the wacom
driver are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list parameters <br>
List known parameters. List all parameters suitable for the
get or the set command. Note that not all parameters are
available on all device types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list modifiers <br>
List the aliases for modifiers and other keys that can be
used when setting button action mappings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GET COMMANDS <br>
get device_name parameter <br>
Get the current settings for the parameter on the given
device. Note that not all parameters are available on all
device types. The special parameter name &quot;all&quot; may
be <br>
provided to display all current settings on the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, options are printed
on the commandline in the respective format. <br>
The output format may be altered with one of the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --shell <br>
Display the output in shell format, i.e. as shell commands
to xsetwacom to reproduce the same parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --xconf <br>
Display the output in xorg.conf format, i.e. as option lines
that may be added to the InputDevice section in the
xorg.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SET COMMANDS <br>
set device_name parameter [value] <br>
Set the parameter value on the given device to the value
provided. Note that not all parameters are writable, some
are read-only and result in an error when trying to be <br>
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
Not all parameters are available on all tools. Use the get
command with the parameter or &quot;all&quot; parameter for
specific input tool applicable parameters and current
settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Area x1 y1 x2 y2 <br>
Set the tablet input area in device coordinates in the form
top left x/y and bottom right x/y. Top left and bottom right
are defined in the device&rsquo;s native orientation, <br>
regardless of the actual rotation currently applied. Input
outside of these coordinates will be clipped to the edges of
the area defined. Default: 0 0 x2 y2; with x2 and <br>
y2 tablet specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button button-number [mapping]
<br>
Set a mapping for the specified button-number. Mappings take
the form of either a single numeric button or an
&rsquo;action&rsquo; to be performed. If no mapping is
provided, the <br>
default mapping is restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric button mappings indicate
what X11 button number the given button-number should
correspond to. For example, a mapping of &quot;3&quot; means
a press of the given button-num&acirc; <br>
ber will produce a press of X11 button 3 (i.e. right
click).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action mappings allow button
presses to perform many events. They take the form of a
string of keywords and arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;key&quot; keyword is
following by a list of key names. These can optionally be
preceded by &quot;+&quot; for press and &quot;-&quot; for
release. If +/- is not given, press-and-release is <br>
assumed, except for modifier keys which are left pressed.
Key names can be X11 KeySyms or some aliases such as
&rsquo;shift&rsquo; or &rsquo;f1&rsquo; (the full list can
be seen with the list <br>
modifiers command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, &quot;key +a +shift
b -shift -a&quot; converts the button into a series of
keystrokes, in this example &quot;press a, press shift,
press and release b, release shift, <br>
release a&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;button&quot; keyword
is similar except that its arguments are X11 button
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;modetoggle&quot;
keyword is also recognized; it takes no arguments, and
toggles the device mode between relative and absolute
pointer tracking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The events in the action mapping
are sent when the physical button is pressed. If the action
mapping leaves any buttons or keys pressed (such as a
modifier key), they <br>
will be released when the physical button is released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple keywords may be present
in one action if desired: for example &quot;key +ctrl button
5 key -ctrl&quot;. Each keyword takes all arguments until
the next keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A maximum of 256 presses and/or
releases can be specified in an action mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The driver can only simulate
physical key events but not keysyms and xsetwacom translates
the mapping sequence into such events. Thus, symbols on the
same physical key <br>
will generate the same event. For example, &rsquo;1&rsquo;
and &rsquo;!&rsquo; are on the same key on a US keyboard and
thus have the same keycode). For access to keys on a higher
shift level, <br>
the sequence should be entered as it would be typed on a
physical keyboard. For example, a exclamation mark is
entered by the sequence of &quot;key +shift 1
-shift&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BindToSerial [serial|0] <br>
Bind the device to the tool with the specified serial
number. Once bound, the device will ignore events from other
tools. A serial of 0 means the device is unbound and <br>
will react to any tool of the matching type. Default: 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MapToOutput [output] <br>
Map the tablet&rsquo;s input area to a given output (e.g.
&quot;VGA1&quot;). Output names may either be the name of a
head available through the XRandR extension, or an X11
geometry <br>
string of the form WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y. To switch to the next
available output, the &quot;next&quot; keyword is also
supported. This will cycle between the individual monitors
con&acirc; <br>
nected to the system, and then the entire desktop. The
mapping may be reset to the entire desktop at any time with
the output name &quot;desktop&quot;. Users of the NVIDIA
binary <br>
driver should use the output names &quot;HEAD-0&quot; and
&quot;HEAD-1&quot; until the driver supports XRandR 1.2 or
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output mapping configuration
is a onetime setting and does not track output
reconfigurations; the command needs to be re-run whenever
the output configuration changes. <br>
When used with tablet rotation, the tablet must be rotated
before it is mapped to the new screen. This parameter is
write-only and cannot be queried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode Absolute|Relative <br>
Set the device mode as either Relative or Absolute. Relative
means pointer tracking for the device will function like a
mouse, whereas Absolute means the pointer corre&acirc; <br>
sponds to the device&rsquo;s actual position on the tablet
or tablet PC screen. Default: Absolute for stylus, eraser
and tablet PC touch; Relative for cursor and tablet
touch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PressureCurve x1 y1 x2 y2 <br>
A Bezier curve of third order, composed of two anchor points
(0,0 and 100,100) and two user modifiable control points
that define the curve&rsquo;s shape. Raise the curve <br>
(x1&lt;y1 x2&lt;y2) to &quot;soften&quot; the feel and lower
the curve (x1&gt;y1 x2&gt;y2) for a &quot;firmer&quot; feel.
Sigmoid shaped curves are permitted (x1&gt;y1 x2&lt;y2 or
x1&lt;y1 x2&gt;y2). Default: 0 0 <br>
100 100, a linear curve; range of 0 to 100 for all four
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RawSample level <br>
Set the sample window size (a sliding average sampling
window) for incoming input tool raw data points. Default: 4,
range of 1 to 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotate none|half|cw|ccw <br>
Set the tablet to the given rotation: <br>
none: the tablet is not rotated and uses its natural
rotation <br>
half: the tablet is rotated by 180 degrees (upside-down)
<br>
cw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees clockwise <br>
ccw: the tablet is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotation is a tablet-wide
option: rotation of one tool affects all other tools
associated with the same tablet. When the tablet is
physically rotated, rotate any tool to <br>
the corresponding orientation. Default: none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress level <br>
Set the delta (difference) cutoff level for further
processing of incoming input tool coordinate values. For
example a X or Y coordinate event will be sent only if the
<br>
change between the current X or Y coordinate and the
previous one is greater than the Suppress value. The same
applies to pressure level (Z coordinate) and Tilt rotation
<br>
values. With a current absolute wheel (AbsWheel) or Tilt
value the delta between it and the previous value must be
equal to or greater than the Suppress value in order to <br>
be sent on. Suppress is a tablet wide parameter. A specified
delta level for one input tool is applied to all input tool
coordinates. To disable suppression use a level <br>
of 0. Default: 2, range of 0 to 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TabletDebugLevel level <br>
Set the debug level for this tablet to the given level. This
only affects code paths that are shared between several
tools on the same physical tablet. A higher level <br>
means more fine-grained debug messages, a level of 0 turns
debugging off for this tool. Requires the driver to be built
with debugging enabled. See also ToolDebugLevel. <br>
Default: 0, range of 0 to 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TabletPCButton on|off <br>
If on, the stylus must be in contact with the screen for a
stylus side button to work. If off, stylus buttons will work
once the stylus is in proximity of the tablet <br>
(regardless of whether it is touching the screen). Default:
on for Tablet PCs; off for all other models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ToolSerialPrevious <br>
Get the serial number of the tool that was last in proximity
last. This serial number is updated whenever the tool goes
out of proximity. If the current tool went out of <br>
proximity once, this serial number is the one of the current
tool. This is a read-only parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Touch on|off <br>
If on, touch events are reported to userland, i.e., system
cursor moves when user touches the tablet. If off, touch
events are ignored. Default: on for devices that sup&acirc;
<br>
port touch; off for all other models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HWTouchSwitchState on|off <br>
If on, it means touch switch is turned off. That is, touch
events are reported to userland. If off, touch switch is
turned on, i.e., touch events are ignored. This is a <br>
read-only parameter. Initial touch switch state is retrieved
from the kernel when X driver starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorProximity distance <br>
sets the max distance from tablet to stop reporting movement
for cursor in relative mode. Default for Intuos series is
10, for Graphire series (including Volitos) is 42. <br>
Only available for the cursor/puck device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold level <br>
Set the minimum pressure necessary to generate a Button
event for the stylus tip, eraser, or touch. The pressure
levels of all tablets are normalized to 2048 levels
irre&acirc; <br>
gardless of the actual hardware supported levels. This
parameter is independent of the PressureCurve parameter.
Default: 27, range of 0 to 2047.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ToolDebugLevel level <br>
Set the debug level for this tool to the given level. This
only affects code paths that are specific to a given tool. A
higher level means more fine-grained debug mes&acirc; <br>
sages, a level of 0 turns debugging off for this tool.
Requires the driver to be built with debugging enabled. See
also TabletDebugLevel. Default: 0, range of 0 to 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PressureRecalibration on|off
<br>
If the initial pressure of a device is != 0 the driver
recalibrates the pressure range. This is to account for worn
out devices. The downside is that when the user hits <br>
the tablet very hard the initial pressure reading may be
unequal to zero even for a perfectly good pen. If the
consecutive pressure readings are not higher than the
ini&acirc; <br>
tial pressure by a threshold no button event will be
generated. This option allows to disable the recalibration.
Default: on</p>
