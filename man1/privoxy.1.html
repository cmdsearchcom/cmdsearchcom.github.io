<p>PRIVOXY(1) PRIVOXY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
privoxy - Privacy Enhancing Proxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
privoxy [--chroot ] [--config-test ] [--help ] [--no-daemon
] [--pidfile pidfile ] [--pre-chroot-nslookup hostname ]
[--user user[.group] ] [--version ] [configfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Privoxy may be invoked with the following command line
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chroot <br>
Before changing to the user ID given in the --user option,
chroot to that user&rsquo;s home directory, i.e. make the
kernel pretend to the Privoxy process that the directory
<br>
tree starts there. If set up carefully, this can limit the
impact of possible vulnerabilities in Privoxy to the files
contained in that hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-test <br>
Exit after loading the configuration files before binding to
the listen address. The exit code signals whether or not the
configuration files have been successfully <br>
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the exit code is 1, at least
one of the configuration files is invalid, if it is 0, all
the configuration files have been successfully loaded (but
may still contain <br>
errors that can currently only be detected at run time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option doesn&rsquo;t affect
the log setting, combination with &quot;--no-daemon&quot; is
recommended if a configured log file shouldn&rsquo;t be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print brief usage info
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-daemon <br>
Don&rsquo;t become a daemon, i.e. don&rsquo;t fork and
become process group leader, don&rsquo;t detach from
controlling tty, and do all logging there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile pidfile <br>
On startup, write the process ID to pidfile. Delete the
pidfile on exit. Failure to create or delete the pidfile is
non-fatal. If no --pidfile option is given, no PID <br>
file will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pre-chroot-nslookup hostname
<br>
Initialize the resolver library using hostname before
chroot&rsquo;ing. On some systems this reduces the number of
files that must be copied into the chroot tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user user[.group] <br>
After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID
of user and the GID of group, or, if the optional group was
not given, the default group of user. Exit if the <br>
privileges are not sufficient to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version info and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the configfile is not
specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a file
named config in the current directory. If no configfile is
found, Privoxy will fail to <br>
start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Privoxy is a non-caching web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities for enhancing privacy, modifying web page data
and HTTP headers, controlling access, and removing ads and
<br>
other obnoxious Internet junk. Privoxy has a flexible
configuration and can be customized to suit individual needs
and tastes. It has application for both stand-alone systems
<br>
and multi-user networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Privoxy is Free Software and
licensed under the GNU GPLv2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Privoxy is an associated project
of Software in the Public Interest (SPI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION AND USAGE <br>
Browsers can either be individually configured to use
Privoxy as a HTTP proxy (recommended), or Privoxy can be
combined with a packet filter to build an intercepting proxy
(see <br>
config). The default setting is for localhost, on port 8118
(configurable in the main config file). To set the HTTP
proxy in Firefox, go through: Tools; Options; General; <br>
Connection Settings; Manual Proxy Configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Internet Explorer, go
through: Tools; Internet Properties; Connections; LAN
Settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Secure (SSL) Proxy should
also be set to the same values, otherwise https: URLs will
not be proxied. Note: Privoxy can only proxy HTTP and HTTPS
traffic. Do not try it with <br>
FTP or other protocols. HTTPS presents some limitations, and
not all features will work with HTTPS connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For other browsers, check the
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Privoxy can be configured with the various configuration
files. The default configuration files are: config,
default.filter, default.action and default.action.
user.action should <br>
be used for locally defined exceptions to the default rules
in match-all.action and default.action, and user.filter for
locally defined filters. These are well commented. On <br>
Unix and Unix-like systems, these are located in
/etc/privoxy/ by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Privoxy uses the concept of
actions in order to manipulate the data stream between the
browser and remote sites. There are various actions
available with specific functions for <br>
such things as blocking web sites, managing cookies, etc.
These actions can be invoked individually or combined, and
used against individual URLs, or groups of URLs that can be
<br>
defined using wildcards and regular expressions. The result
is that the user has greatly enhanced control and
freedom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actions list (ad blocks,
etc) can also be configured with your web browser at
http://config.privoxy.org/ (assuming the configuration
allows it). Privoxy&rsquo;s configuration <br>
parameters can also be viewed at the same page. In addition,
Privoxy can be toggled on/off. This is an internal page, and
does not require Internet access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the User Manual for a
detailed explanation of installation, general usage, all
configuration options, new features and notes on
upgrading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/sbin/privoxy <br>
/etc/privoxy/config <br>
/etc/privoxy/match-all.action <br>
/etc/privoxy/default.action <br>
/etc/privoxy/user.action <br>

/etc/privoxy/trust <br>
/etc/privoxy/templates/* <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various other files should be
included, but may vary depending on platform and build
configuration. Additional documentation should be included
in the local documentation direc&acirc; <br>
tory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Privoxy terminates on the SIGINT and SIGTERM signals. Log
rotation scripts may cause a re-opening of the logfile by
sending a SIGHUP to Privoxy. Note that unlike other daemons,
<br>
Privoxy does not need to be made aware of config file
changes by SIGHUP -- it will detect them automatically.
Signals other than the ones listed above aren&rsquo;t
explicitly handled <br>
and result in the default action defined by the operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Please see the User Manual on how to contact the developers,
for feature requests, reporting problems, and other
questions.</p>
