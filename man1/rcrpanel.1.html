<p>rcrpanel(1) General Commands Manual rcrpanel(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rcrpanel - Create a PostScript file of a panel from a
script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rcrpanel filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rcrpanel reads a script file describing a panel and produces
a PostScript image of that panel on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILE <br>
The input file contains lines describing the various
controls. Most lines are of the form Command = something
where the spaces around the equal sign are significant, and
the <br>
command itself is case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Measurements are in units of
millimeters. Angles are in degrees. Colors are given as 24
bit C style integers where each byte repesents the amount of
red, green, or blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
Reverse - <br>
This command takes no arguments. If this command appears
anywhere in the input file, the resulting PostScript will be
flipped left to right (for printing on the reverse <br>
side of transparency material).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlLarge - <br>
This is used for large diameter controls such as large pots
and the like. It takes 2 values after the equal sign
representing the position of the control on the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlPhone - <br>
This is used for 1/4&quot; phone jacks and similar controls.
The 2 values after the equal sign represent the position on
the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlLED - <br>
This command generates an outline for a 5 mm LED. Like the
other control commands, it takes 2 values, the X and Y
positions on the panel of the center of the LED.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlSmall - <br>
This command generates an outline for a 3.5 mm phone jack.
The two values are the X and Y positions of the jack on the
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ControlTiny - <br>
This command generates an outline for a 2.5 mm phone jack.
The two values are the X and Y positions of the jack on the
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panel - <br>
This command defines the size of the panel. The 2 dimensions
are the width and height of the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Background - <br>
This command takes a single color following the equal sign.
The entire panel will be filled with this color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text - This command is somewhat
different from the others. After the equal sign, it takes 3
floating point numbers, a color, and a text string. The fist
2 floating point num&acirc; <br>
bers are the X, Y position of the text on the panel. The
third number is the height of the text. The color represents
the color of the text, and the text string repre&acirc; <br>
sents the font to be used. No checking is done before
preparing the PostScript; you are responsible for ensuring
that the font is available on your printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is then followed by
another line containing the text to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dial - This command introduces a
new dial. The Dial command describes the X,Y center of the
dial. The following commands then further refine the details
of this particular <br>
dial. This relationship between the Dial command and
it&rsquo;s successors is the only place where the order of
the commands within the file matters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radius - <br>
This command takes a single value which is the radius of the
circle which forms the inside of the tick marks. This
command refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Span - This command describes
the angle over which the control may operate. Typically,
this would be 270 for a potentiometer and 180 for a variable
capacitor. This command <br>
refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NumTicks - <br>
This command describes the total number of tick marks, large
and small, to be drawn. This is usually an odd number since
the starting and ending values are counted. Typ&acirc; <br>
ically this will be 11, 101, or a similar number. This
command refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BigPer - <br>
This command tells the program how many small tick marks
there are per large tick mark. This command refers to the
current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SizeTicks - <br>
This command describes the length of the small tick marks.
This command refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SizeBig - <br>
This command describes the length of the large tick marks.
This command refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartingIndicator - <br>
This command describes the value to be placed on the
furthest counterclockwise large tick mark. This command
refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IncrementPerBigTick - <br>
This command tells rcrpanel how much to increment the value
in StartingIndicator for each succeding large tick mark.
This command refers to the current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SizeFont - <br>
This command describes how large to make the annotation on
the ticks. This command refers to the current Dial
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColorCircle - <br>
This command takes a single color as an argument, which is
used to draw the inner circle. This command refers to the
current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColorTickMarks - <br>
This command permits setting the color to draw the small
tick marks. This command refers to the current Dial
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColorBigTickMarks - <br>
This command permits setting the color to draw the large
tick marks. This command refers to the current Dial
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ColorText - <br>
This command accepts a single color which will be used for
the annotation. This command refers to the current Dial
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartAngle - <br>
By default, rcrpanel arranges dials so the dead spot on the
control is straight down. This is the desired behavior in
almost all cases. However, sometimes you may want <br>
to rotate a control to some other orientation. The single
argument to StartAngle is the number of degrees clockwise to
rotate the control. This command refers to the <br>
current Dial command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Current compiled in limits are 20 dials, 50 controls and 50
text strings. Strings are limited to 127 characters and font
names may be no more than 31 characters long.</p>

John J. McDonough, WB8RCR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None known</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rcrpanel is still lacking the
ability to draw random straight lines on the panel.</p>
