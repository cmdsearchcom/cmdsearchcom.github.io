pullnews - Pull news from multiple news servers and feed it
to another</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
The &quot;Net::NNTP&quot; module must be installed. This
module is available as part of the libnet distribution and
comes with recent versions of Perl. For older versions of
Perl, you <br>
can download it from &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pullnews reads a config file named pullnews.marks, and
connects to the upstream servers given there as a reader
client. This file is looked for in pathdb when pullnews is
run as <br>
the user set in runasuser in inn.conf (which is by default
the &quot;news&quot; user); otherwise, this file is looked
for in the running user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pullnews connects to
all servers listed in the configuration file, but you can
limit pullnews to specific servers by listing them on the
command line: a whitespace- <br>
separated list of server names can be specified, like
from-server for one of them. For each server it connects to,
it pulls over articles and feeds them to the destination
<br>
server via the IHAVE or POST commands. This means that the
system pullnews is run on must have feeding access to the
destination news server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pullnews is designed for very
small sites that do not want to bother setting up
traditional peering and is not meant for handling large
feeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a hashfeed <br>
This option is a deterministic way to control the flow of
articles and to split a feed. The hashfeed parameter must be
in the form &quot;value/mod&quot; or
&quot;start-end/mod&quot;. The <br>
Message-ID of each article is hashed using MD5, which
results in a 128-bit hash. The lowest 32 bits are then taken
by default as the hashfeed value (which is an integer). <br>
If the hashfeed value modulus &quot;mod&quot; plus one
equals &quot;value&quot; or is between &quot;start&quot; and
&quot;end&quot;, pullnews will feed the article. All these
numbers must be integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pullnews -a 1/2 Feeds about 50%
of all articles. <br>
pullnews -a 2/2 Feeds the other 50% of all articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pullnews -a 1-3/10 Feeds about
30% of all articles. <br>
pullnews -a 4-5/10 Feeds about 20% of all articles. <br>
pullnews -a 6-10/10 Feeds about 50% of all articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use an extended syntax
of the form &quot;value/mod:offset&quot; or
&quot;start-end/mod:offset&quot; (using an underscore
&quot;_&quot; instead of a colon &quot;:&quot; is also
recognized). As MD5 generates <br>
a 128-bit return value, it is possible to specify from which
byte-offset the 32-bit integer used by hashfeed starts. The
default value for &quot;offset&quot; is &quot;:0&quot; and
thirteen <br>
overlapping values from &quot;:0&quot; to &quot;:12&quot;
can be used. Only up to four totally independent values
exist: &quot;:0&quot;, &quot;:4&quot;, &quot;:8&quot; and
&quot;:12&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore, it allows to a
generate a second level of deterministic distribution.
Indeed, if pullnews feeds &quot;1/2&quot;, it can go on
splitting thanks to &quot;1-3/9:4&quot; for instance. <br>
Up to four levels of deterministic distribution can be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm is compatible with
the one used by Diablo 5.1 and up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b fraction <br>
Backtrack on server numbering reset. Specify the proportion
(0.0 to 1.0) of a group&rsquo;s articles to pull when the
server&rsquo;s article number is less than our high for that
group. <br>
When fraction is 1.0, pull all the articles on a renumbered
server. The default is to do nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Feed is header-only, that is
to say pullnews only feeds the headers of the articles, plus
one blank line. It adds the Bytes: header field if the
article does not already <br>
have one, and keeps the body only if the article is a
control article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c config <br>
Normally, the config file is stored in pullnews.marks in
pathdb when pullnews is run as the news user, or otherwise
in the running user&rsquo;s home directory. If -c is given,
<br>
config will be used as the config file instead. This is
useful if you&rsquo;re running pullnews as a system user on
an automated basis out of cron or as an individual user,
rather <br>
than the news user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;CONFIG FILE&quot;
below for the format of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C width <br>
Use width characters per line for the progress table. The
default value is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d level <br>
Set the debugging level to the integer level; more debugging
output will be logged as this increases. The default value
is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f fraction <br>
This changes the proportion of articles to get from each
group to fraction and should be in the range 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0
being the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F fakehop <br>
Prepend fakehop as a host to the Path: header of articles
fed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g groups <br>
Specify a collection of groups to get. groups is a list of
newsgroups separated by commas (only commas, no spaces).
Each group must be defined in the config file, and only <br>
the remote hosts that carry those groups will be contacted.
Note that this is a simple list of groups, not a wildmat
expression, and wildcards are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G newsgroups <br>
Add the comma-separated list of groups newsgroups to each
server in the configuration file (see also -g and -w).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H headers <br>
Remove these named headers (colon-separated list) from fed
articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k checkpt <br>
Checkpoint (save) the config file every checkpt articles
(default is 0, that is to say at the end of the
session).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
Log progress/stats to logfile (default is
&quot;stdout&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m header_pats <br>
Feed an article based on header matching. The argument is a
number of whitespace-separated tuples (each tuple being a
colon-separated header and regular expression). For <br>
instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &quot;Hdr1:regexp1
!Hdr2:regexp2 #Hdr3:regexp3 !#Hdr4:regexp4&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifies that the article will
be passed only if the &quot;Hdr1:&quot; header matches
&quot;regexp1&quot; and the &quot;Hdr2:&quot; header does
not match &quot;regexp2&quot;. Besides, if the
&quot;Hdr3:&quot; header <br>
matches &quot;regexp3&quot;, that header is removed; and if
the &quot;Hdr4:&quot; header does not match
&quot;regexp4&quot;, that header is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M num <br>
Specify the maximum number of articles (per group) to
process. The default is to process all new articles. See
also -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do nothing but read articles
-- does not feed articles downstream, writes no rnews file,
does not update the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N timeout <br>
Specify the timeout length, as timeout seconds, when
establishing an NNTP connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Use an optimized mode:
pullnews checks whether the article already exists on the
downstream server, before downloading it. It may help for
huge articles or a slow link to <br>
upstream hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Connect to the destination news server on a port other than
the default of 119. This option does not change the port
used to connect to the source news servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P hop_limit <br>
Restrict feeding an article based on the number of hops it
has already made. Count the hops in the Path: header
(hop_count), feeding the article only when hop_limit is <br>
&quot;+num&quot; and hop_count is more than num; or
hop_limit is &quot;-num&quot; and hop_count is less than
num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Print out less status
information while running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q level <br>
Set the quietness level (&quot;-Q 2&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;-q&quot;). The higher this value, the less gets
logged. The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r file <br>
Rather than feeding the downloaded articles to a destination
server, instead create a batch file that can later be fed to
a server using rnews. See rnews(1) for more <br>
information about the batch file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Be a reader (use MODE READER
and POST commands) to the downstream server. The default is
to use the IHAVE command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s to-server[:port] <br>
Normally, pullnews will feed the articles it retrieves to
the news server running on localhost. To connect to a
different host, specify a server with the -s flag. You can
<br>
also specify the port with this same flag or use -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S max-run <br>
Specify the maximum time max-run in seconds for pullnews to
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t retries <br>
The maximum number (retries) of attempts to connect to a
server (see also -T). The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T connect-pause <br>
Pause connect-pause seconds between connection retries (see
also -t). The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w num <br>
Set each group&rsquo;s high water mark (last received
article number) to num. If num is negative, calculate
Current+num instead (i.e. get the last num articles).
Therefore, a num <br>
of 0 will re-get all articles on the server; whereas a num
of &quot;-0&quot; will get no old articles, setting the
water mark to Current (the most recent article on the
server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x If the -x flag is used, an
Xref: header is added to any article that lacks one. It can
be useful for instance if articles are fed to a news server
which has xrefslave set in <br>
inn.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z article-pause <br>
Sleep article-pause seconds between articles. The default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z group-pause <br>
Sleep group-pause seconds between groups. The default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
The config file for pullnews is divided into blocks, one
block for each remote server to connect to. A block begins
with the host line (which must have no leading whitespace)
<br>
and contains just the hostname of the remote server,
optionally followed by authentication details (username and
password for that server). Note that authentication details
can <br>
also be provided for the downstream server (a host line
could be added for it in the configuration file, with no
newsgroup to fetch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the host line should
be one or more newsgroup lines which start with whitespace
followed by the name of a newsgroup to retrieve. Only one
newsgroup should be listed on <br>
each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pullnews will update the config
file to include the time the group was last checked and the
highest numbered article successfully retrieved and
transferred to the destination <br>
server. It uses this data to avoid doing duplicate work the
next time it runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full syntax is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;host&gt; [&lt;username&gt;
&lt;password&gt;] <br>
&lt;group&gt; [&lt;time&gt; &lt;high&gt;] <br>
&lt;group&gt; [&lt;time&gt; &lt;high&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where the &lt;host&gt; line must
not have leading whitespace and the &lt;group&gt; lines
must.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical configuration file
would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Format group date high <br>
data.pa.vix.com <br>
rec.bicycles.racing 908086612 783 <br>
rec.humor.funny 908086613 18 <br>
comp.programming.threads <br>
nnrp.vix.com pull sekret <br>
comp.std.lisp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that an earlier run of
pullnews has filled in details about the last article
downloads from the two rec.* groups. The two comp.* groups
were just added by the user and have <br>
not yet been checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nnrp.vix.com server requires
authentication, and pullnews will use the username
&quot;pull&quot; and the password &quot;sekret&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
pathbin/pullnews <br>
The Perl script itself used to pull news from upstream
servers and feed it to another news server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathdb/pullnews.marks or
~/pullnews.marks <br>
The default config file. It is stored in pullnews.marks in
pathdb when pullnews is run as the news user, or otherwise
in the running user&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pullnews was written by James Brister for INN. The
documentation was rewritten in POD by Russ Allbery
&lt;eagle@eyrie.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Geraint A. Edwards greatly
improved pullnews, adding no more than 16 new recognized
flags, fixing some bugs and integrating the backupfeed
contrib script by Kai Henningsen, <br>
adding again 6 other flags.</p>
