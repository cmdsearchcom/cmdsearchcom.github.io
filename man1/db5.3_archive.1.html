db5.3_archive - Find unused log files for archiving purposes

The db5.3_archive utility writes the pathnames of log files that are no longer
  in use (for example, no longer involved in active transactions), to the
  standard output, one pathname per line. These log files should be written to
  backup media to provide for recovery in the case of catastrophic failure
  (which also requires a snapshot of the database files), but they may then be
  deleted from the system to reclaim disk space.

    It is possible that some of the files to which the log refers have since
      been deleted from the system. In this case, db5.3_archive will ignore
      them. When db5.3_recover is run, any files to which the log refers that
      are not present during recovery are assumed to have been deleted and will
      not be recovered.</dd>

Log cursor handles (returned by the DB_ENV-&gt;log_cursor method) may have open
  file descriptors for log files in the database environment. Also, the Berkeley
  DB interfaces to the database environment logging subsystem (for example,
  DB_ENV-&gt;log_put and DB_TXN-&gt;abort) may allocate log cursors and have
  open file descriptors for log files as well. On operating systems where
  filesystem related system calls (for example, rename and unlink on Windows/NT)
  can fail if a process has an open file descriptor for the affected file,
  attempting to move or remove the log files listed by db5.3_archive may fail.
  All Berkeley DB internal use of log cursors operates on active log files only
  and furthermore, is short-lived in nature. So, an application seeing such a
  failure should be restructured to close any open log cursors it may have, and
  otherwise to retry the operation until it succeeds. (Although the latter is
  not likely to be necessary; it is hard to imagine a reason to move or rename a
  log file in which transactions are being logged or aborted.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The db5.3_archive utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
  <b>-h</b> option, the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the
  utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order
  to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
  db5.3_archive should always be given the chance to detach from the environment
  and exit gracefully. To cause db5.3_archive to release all environment
  resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive method is the underlying method used by the
  db5.3_archive utility. See the db5.3_archive utility source code for an
  example of using DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
  environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The db5.3_archive utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.
