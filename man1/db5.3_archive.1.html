<p>DB5.3_ARCHIVE(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_ARCHIVE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_archive - Find unused log files for archiving
purposes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_archive [-adlsVv] [-h home] [-P password]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_archive utility writes the pathnames of log files
that are no longer in use (for example, no longer involved
in active transactions), to the standard output, one
path&acirc; <br>
name per line. These log files should be written to backup
media to provide for recovery in the case of catastrophic
failure (which also requires a snapshot of the database <br>
files), but they may then be deleted from the system to
reclaim disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Write all pathnames as absolute pathnames, instead of
relative to the database home directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Remove log files that are no
longer needed; no filenames are written. Automatic log file
removal is likely to make catastrophic recovery
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify a home directory for
the database environment; by default, the current working
directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Write out the pathnames of
all the database log files, whether or not they are involved
in active transactions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Write the pathnames of all
the database files that need to be archived in order to
recover the database from catastrophic failure. If any of
the database files have not <br>
been accessed during the lifetime of the current log files,
db5.3_archive will not include them in this output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible that some of the
files to which the log refers have since been deleted from
the system. In this case, db5.3_archive will ignore them.
When db5.3_recover <br>
is run, any files to which the log refers that are not
present during recovery are assumed to have been deleted and
will not be recovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Run in verbose mode, listing
the checkpoints in the log files as they are reviewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log cursor handles (returned by
the DB_ENV-&gt;log_cursor method) may have open file
descriptors for log files in the database environment. Also,
the Berkeley DB interfaces to the <br>
database environment logging subsystem (for example,
DB_ENV-&gt;log_put and DB_TXN-&gt;abort) may allocate log
cursors and have open file descriptors for log files as
well. On operat&acirc; <br>
ing systems where filesystem related system calls (for
example, rename and unlink on Windows/NT) can fail if a
process has an open file descriptor for the affected file,
attempt&acirc; <br>
ing to move or remove the log files listed by db5.3_archive
may fail. All Berkeley DB internal use of log cursors
operates on active log files only and furthermore, is short-
<br>
lived in nature. So, an application seeing such a failure
should be restructured to close any open log cursors it may
have, and otherwise to retry the operation until it
suc&acirc; <br>
ceeds. (Although the latter is not likely to be necessary;
it is hard to imagine a reason to move or rename a log file
in which transactions are being logged or aborted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_archive utility uses a
Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the
environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run
in a directory contain&acirc; <br>
ing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_archive should always be given the chance to detach
from the <br>
environment and exit gracefully. To cause db5.3_archive to
release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it
an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive
method is the underlying method used by the db5.3_archive
utility. See the db5.3_archive utility source code for an
example of using DB_ENV-&gt;log_archive <br>
in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_archive utility exits
0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
