Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials from
  system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for usernames and
  passwords. The git-credential command exposes this interface to scripts which
  may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in the same manner as
  Git. The design of this scriptable interface models the internal C API; see
  <b>the Git credential API</b>[1] for more background on the concepts.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
git-credential takes an &quot;action&quot; option on the command-line (one of
  fill, approve, or reject) and reads a credential description on stdin (see
  INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the action is fill, git-credential will attempt to add &quot;username&quot;
  and &quot;password&quot; attributes to the description by reading config
  files, by contacting any configured credential helpers, or by prompting the
  user. The username and password attributes of the credential description are
  then printed to stdout together with the attributes already provided.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the action is approve, git-credential will send the description to any
  configured credential helpers, which may store the credential for later use.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the action is reject, git-credential will send the description to any
  configured credential helpers, which may erase any stored credential matching
  the description.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the action is approve or reject, no output should be emitted.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TYPICAL_USE_OF_GIT_CREDENTIAL"><a class="selflink" href="#TYPICAL_USE_OF_GIT_CREDENTIAL">TYPICAL
  USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL</a></h1>
An application using git-credential will typically use git credential following
  these steps:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.Generate a credential description based on
  the context.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, if we want a password for https://example.com/foo.git, we might
  generate the following credential description (don&#x2019;t forget the blank
  line at the end; it tells git credential that the application finished feeding
  all the information it has):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
protocol=https
host=example.com
path=foo.git
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.Ask git-credential to give us a username
  and password for this description. This is done by running git credential
  fill, feeding the description from step (1) to its standard input. The
  complete credential description (including the credential per se, i.e. the
  login and password) will be produced on standard output, like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
protocol=https
host=example.com
username=bob
password=secr3t
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In most cases, this means the attributes given in the input will be repeated in
  the output, but Git may also modify the credential description, for example by
  removing the path attribute when the protocol is HTTP(s) and
  credential.useHttpPath is false.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the git credential knew about the password, this step may not have involved
  the user actually typing this password (the user may have typed a password to
  unlock the keychain instead, or no user interaction was done if the keychain
  was already unlocked) before it returned password=secr3t.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 3.Use the credential (e.g., access the URL
  with the username and password from step (2)), and see if it&#x2019;s
  accepted.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 4.Report on the success or failure of the
  password. If the credential allowed the operation to complete successfully,
  then it can be marked with an &quot;approve&quot; action to tell git
  credential to reuse it in its next invocation. If the credential was rejected
  during the operation, use the &quot;reject&quot; action so that git credential
  will ask for a new password in its next invocation. In either case, git
  credential should be fed with the credential description obtained from step
  (2) (which also contain the ones provided in step (1)).</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#INPUT/OUTPUT_FORMAT">INPUT/OUTPUT
  FORMAT</a></h1>
git credential reads and/or writes (depending on the action used) credential
  information in its standard input/output. This information can correspond
  either to keys for which git credential will obtain the login/password
  information (e.g. host, protocol, path), or to the actual credential data to
  be obtained (login/password).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The credential is split into a set of named attributes, with one attribute per
  line. Each attribute is specified by a key-value pair, separated by an =
  (equals) sign, followed by a newline. The key may contain any bytes except =,
  newline, or NUL. The value may contain any bytes except newline or NUL. In
  both cases, all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there is no quoting, and one
  cannot transmit a value with newline or NUL in it). The list of attributes is
  terminated by a blank line or end-of-file. Git understands the following
  attributes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
protocol
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The protocol over which the credential will be
  used (e.g., https).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
host
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The remote hostname for a network
  credential.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
path
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The path with which the credential will be
  used. E.g., for accessing a remote https repository, this will be the
  repository&#x2019;s path on the server.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
username
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The credential&#x2019;s username, if we
  already have one (e.g., from a URL, from the user, or from a previously run
  helper).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
password
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The credential&#x2019;s password, if we are
  asking it to be stored.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
url
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">When this special attribute is read by git
  credential, the value is parsed as a URL and treated as if its constituent
  parts were read (e.g., url=https://example.com would behave as if
  protocol=https and host=example.com had been provided). This can help callers
  avoid parsing URLs themselves. Note that any components which are missing from
  the URL (e.g., there is no username in the example above) will be set to
  empty; if you want to provide a URL and override some attributes, provide the
  URL attribute first, followed by any overrides.</div>
