<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-credential - Retrieve and store user credentials</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git credential &lt;fill|approve|reject&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving
credentials from system-specific helpers, as well as
prompting the user for usernames and passwords. The
git-credential <br>
command exposes this interface to scripts which may want to
retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in the same
manner as Git. The design of this scriptable interface
models <br>
the internal C API; see the Git credential API[1] for more
background on the concepts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-credential takes an
&quot;action&quot; option on the command-line (one of fill,
approve, or reject) and reads a credential description on
stdin (see INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the action is fill,
git-credential will attempt to add &quot;username&quot; and
&quot;password&quot; attributes to the description by
reading config files, by contacting any configured
credential <br>
helpers, or by prompting the user. The username and password
attributes of the credential description are then printed to
stdout together with the attributes already provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the action is approve,
git-credential will send the description to any configured
credential helpers, which may store the credential for later
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the action is reject,
git-credential will send the description to any configured
credential helpers, which may erase any stored credential
matching the description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the action is approve or
reject, no output should be emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TYPICAL USE OF GIT CREDENTIAL
<br>
An application using git-credential will typically use git
credential following these steps:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Generate a credential
description based on the context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if we want a
password for https://example.com/foo.git, we might generate
the following credential description (don&acirc;t forget the
blank line at the end; it tells <br>
git credential that the application finished feeding all the
information it has):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol=https <br>
host=example.com <br>
path=foo.git</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Ask git-credential to give us
a username and password for this description. This is done
by running git credential fill, feeding the description from
step (1) to its standard <br>
input. The complete credential description (including the
credential per se, i.e. the login and password) will be
produced on standard output, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol=https <br>
host=example.com <br>
username=bob <br>
password=secr3t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, this means the
attributes given in the input will be repeated in the
output, but Git may also modify the credential description,
for example by removing the <br>
path attribute when the protocol is HTTP(s) and
credential.useHttpPath is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the git credential knew about
the password, this step may not have involved the user
actually typing this password (the user may have typed a
password to unlock the <br>
keychain instead, or no user interaction was done if the
keychain was already unlocked) before it returned
password=secr3t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Use the credential (e.g.,
access the URL with the username and password from step
(2)), and see if it&acirc;s accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Report on the success or
failure of the password. If the credential allowed the
operation to complete successfully, then it can be marked
with an &quot;approve&quot; action to tell git <br>
credential to reuse it in its next invocation. If the
credential was rejected during the operation, use the
&quot;reject&quot; action so that git credential will ask
for a new password <br>
in its next invocation. In either case, git credential
should be fed with the credential description obtained from
step (2) (which also contain the ones provided in step <br>
(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
git credential reads and/or writes (depending on the action
used) credential information in its standard input/output.
This information can correspond either to keys for which
<br>
git credential will obtain the login/password information
(e.g. host, protocol, path), or to the actual credential
data to be obtained (login/password).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The credential is split into a
set of named attributes, with one attribute per line. Each
attribute is specified by a key-value pair, separated by an
= (equals) sign, followed by <br>
a newline. The key may contain any bytes except =, newline,
or NUL. The value may contain any bytes except newline or
NUL. In both cases, all bytes are treated as-is (i.e., there
<br>
is no quoting, and one cannot transmit a value with newline
or NUL in it). The list of attributes is terminated by a
blank line or end-of-file. Git understands the following
<br>
attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">protocol <br>
The protocol over which the credential will be used (e.g.,
https).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host <br>
The remote hostname for a network credential.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path <br>
The path with which the credential will be used. E.g., for
accessing a remote https repository, this will be the
repository&acirc;s path on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">username <br>
The credential&acirc;s username, if we already have one
(e.g., from a URL, from the user, or from a previously run
helper).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
The credential&acirc;s password, if we are asking it to be
stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url <br>
When this special attribute is read by git credential, the
value is parsed as a URL and treated as if its constituent
parts were read (e.g., url=https://example.com would <br>
behave as if protocol=https and host=example.com had been
provided). This can help callers avoid parsing URLs
themselves. Note that any components which are missing from
the <br>
URL (e.g., there is no username in the example above) will
be set to empty; if you want to provide a URL and override
some attributes, provide the URL attribute first, <br>
followed by any overrides.</p>
