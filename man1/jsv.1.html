<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
JSV - Sun Grid Engine Job Submission Verifier</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
JSV is an abbreviation for Job Submission Verifier. A JSV is
a script or binary that can be used to verify, modify or
reject a job during the time of job submission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JSVs will be triggered by submit
clients like qsub, qrsh, qsh and qmon on submit hosts
(Client JSV) or they verify incoming jobs on the master host
(Server JSV) or both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
JSVs can be configured on various locations. Either a
jsv_url can be provided with the -jsv submit parameter
during job submission, a corresponding switch can be added
to one of <br>
the sge_request files or a jsv_url can be configured in the
global cluster configuration of the Sun Grid Engine
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All defined JSV instances will
be executed in following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) qsub -jsv ... <br>
2) $cwd/.sge_request <br>
3) $HOME/.sge_request <br>
4) $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request <br>
5) Global configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Client JSVs (1-3) can be
defined by Sun Grid Engine end users whereas the client JSV
defined in the global sge_request file (4) and the server
JSV (5) can only be defined by <br>
the Sun Grid Engine administrators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to the fact that (4) and (5)
are defined and configured by Sun Grid Engine administrators
and because they are executed as last JSV instances in the
sequence of JSV scripts, <br>
an administrator has an additional way to define certain
policies for a cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As soon as one JSV instance
rejects a job the whole process of verification is stopped
and the end user will get a corresponding error message that
the submission of the job has <br>
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a JSV accepts a job or
accepts a job after it applied several modifications then
the following JSV instance will get the job parameters
including all modifications as input <br>
for the verification process. This is done as long as either
the job is accepted or rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find more information how to use
Client JSVs in qsub(1) and for Server JSVs in
sge_conf(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIFETIME <br>
A Client or Server JSV is started as own UNIX process. This
process communicates either with a Sun Grid Engine client
process or the master daemon by exchanging commands, job
<br>
parameters and other data via stdin/stdout channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Client JSV instances are started
by client applications before a job is sent to qmaster. This
instance does the job verification for the job to be
submitted. After that verifica&acirc; <br>
tion the JSV process is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Server JSV instances are started
for each worker thread part of the qmaster process (for
version 6.2 of Sun Grid Engine this means that two processes
are started). Each of those <br>
processes have to verify job parameters for multiple jobs as
long as the master is running, the underlying JSV
configuration is not changed and no error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEOUT <br>
The timeout is a modifiable value that will measure the
response time of either the client or server JSV. In the
event that the response time of the JSV is longer than
timeout <br>
value specified, this will result in the JSV being
re-started. The server JSV timeout value is specified
through the qmaster parameter jsv_timeout. The client JSV
timeout value <br>
is set through the environment variable SGE_JSV_TIMEOUT. The
default value is 10 seconds, and this value must be greater
than 0. If the timeout has been reach, the JSV will only
<br>
try to re-start once, if the timeout is reached again an
error will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THRESHOLD <br>
The threshold value is defined as a qmaster parameter
jsv_threshold. This value measures the time for a server job
verification. If this time exceeds the defined threshold
then <br>
additional logging will appear in the master message file at
the INFO level. This value is specified in milliseconds and
has a default value of 5000. If a value of 0 is defined <br>
then this means all jobs will be logged in the message
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL <br>
After a JSV script or binary is started it will get commands
through its stdin stream and it has to respond with certain
commands on the stdout stream. Data which is send via the
<br>
stderr stream of a JSV instance is ignored. Each command
which is send to/by a JSV script has to be terminated by a
new line character (&rsquo;0) whereas new line characters
are not <br>
allowed in the whole command string itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general commands which are
exchanged between a JSV and client/qmaster have following
format. Commands and arguments are case sensitive. Find the
EBNF command description <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command := command_name &rsquo;
&rsquo; { argument &rsquo; &rsquo; } ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A command starts with a
command_name followed by a space character and a space
separated list of arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL (JSV side) <br>
Following commands have to be implemented by an JSV script
so that it conforms to version 1.0 of the JSV protocol which
was first implemented in Sun Grid Engine 6.2u2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">begin_command :=
&rsquo;BEGIN&rsquo; ; <br>
After a JSV instance has received all env_commands and
param_commands of a job which should be verified, the
client/qmaster will trigger the verification process by
send&acirc; <br>
ing one begin_command. After that it will wait for
param_commands and env_commands which are sent back from the
JSV instance to modify the job specification. As part of
<br>
the verification process a JSV script or binary has to use
the result_command to indicate that the verification process
is finished for a job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env_command := ENV &rsquo;
&rsquo; modifier &rsquo; &rsquo; name &rsquo; &rsquo; value
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modifier := &rsquo;ADD&rsquo; |
&rsquo;MOD&rsquo; | &rsquo;DEL&rsquo; ; <br>
The env_command is an optional command which has only to be
implemented by a JSV instance if the send_data_command is
sent by this JSV before a the started_command was <br>
sent. Only in that case the client or master will use one or
multiple env_commands to pass the environment variables
(name and value) to the JSV instance which would be <br>
exported to the job environment when the job would be
started. Client and qmaster will only sent env_commands with
the modifier &rsquo;ADD&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JSV instances modify the set of
environment variables by sending back env_commands and by
using the modifiers ADD, MOD and DEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param_command :=
&rsquo;PARAM&rsquo; &rsquo; &rsquo; param_parameter &rsquo;
&rsquo; value ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param_parameter :=
submit_parameter | pseudo_parameter ; <br>
The param_command has two additional arguments which are
separated by space characters. The first argument is either
a submit_parameter as it is specified in qsub(1) or it <br>
is a pseudo_parameters as documented below. The second
parameter is the value of the corresponding
param_parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple param_commands will be
sent to a JSV instance after the JSV has sent a
started_command. The sum of all param_commands which is sent
represents a job specification <br>
of that job which should be verified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submit_parameters are for
example b (similar to the qsub -b switch) or masterq
(similar to qsub -masterq switch). Find a complete list of
submit_parameters in the qsub(1) <br>
man page. Please note that not in all cases the
param_parameter name and the corresponding value format is
equivalent with the qsub switch name and its argument
format. <br>
E.g. the qsub -pe parameters will by available as a set of
parameters with the name pe_name, pe_min, pe_max or the
switch combination -soft -l will be passed to JSV <br>
scripts as l_soft parameter. For details concerning this
differences consult also the qsub(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start_command :=
&rsquo;START&rsquo; ; <br>
The start_command has no additional arguments. This command
indicates that a new job verification should be started. It
is the first command which will be sent to JSV <br>
script after it has been started and it will initiate each
new job verification. A JSV instance might trash cached
values which are still stored due to a previous job
ver&acirc; <br>
ification. The application which send the start_command will
wait for a started_command before it continues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit_command :=
&rsquo;QUIT&rsquo; ; <br>
The quit_command has no additional arguments. If this
command is sent to a JSV instance then it should terminate
itself immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROTOCOL (client/qmaster side)
<br>
A JSV script or binary can send a set of commands to a
client/qmaster process to indicate its state in the
communication process, to change the job specification of a
job which <br>
should be verified and to report messages or errors. Below
you can find the commands which are understood by the
client/qmaster which will implement version 1.0 of the
communica&acirc; <br>
tion protocol which was first implemented in Sun Grid Engine
6.2u2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error_command :=
&rsquo;ERROR&rsquo; message ; <br>
Any time a JSV script encounters an error it might report it
to the client/qmaster. If the error happens during a job
verification the job which is currently verified will <br>
be rejected. The JSV binary or script will also be restarted
before it gets a new verification task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_command := &rsquo;LOG&rsquo;
log_level ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_level := &rsquo;INFO&rsquo;
| &rsquo;WARNING&rsquo; | &rsquo;ERROR&rsquo; <br>
log_commands can be used whenever the client or qmaster
expects input from a JSV instance. This command can be used
in client JSVs to send information to the user submit&acirc;
<br>
ting the job. In client JSVs all messages, independent of
the log_level will be printed to the stdout stream of the
used submit client. If a server JSV receives a
log_com&acirc; <br>
mand it will add the received message to the message file
respecting the specified log_level. Please note that message
might contain spaces but no new line characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param_command (find definition
above) <br>
By sending param_commands a JSV script can change the job
specification of the job which should be verified. If a JSV
instance later on sends a result_command which indi&acirc;
<br>
cates that a JSV instance should be accepted with correction
then the values provided with these param_commands will be
used to modify the job before it is accepted by the <br>
Sun Grid Engine system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result_command :=
&rsquo;RESULT&rsquo; result_type [ message ] ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result_type :=
&rsquo;ACCEPT&rsquo; | &rsquo;CORRECT&rsquo; |
&rsquo;REJECT&rsquo; | &rsquo;REJECT_WAIT&rsquo; ; <br>
After the verification of a job is done a JSV script or
binary has to send a result_command which indicates what
should happen with the job. If the result_type is <br>
ACCEPTED the job will be accepted as it was initially
submitted by the end user. All param_commands and
env_commands which might have been sent before the
result_command <br>
are ignored in this case. The result_type CORRECT indicates
that the job should be accepted after all modifications sent
via param_commands and env_commands are applied <br>
to the job. REJECT and REJECT_WAIT cause the client or
qmaster instance to reject the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send_data_command :=
&rsquo;SEND&rsquo; data_name ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data_name := &rsquo;ENV&rsquo;;
<br>
If a client/qmaster receives a send_env_command from a JSV
instance before a started_command is sent, then it will not
only pass job parameters with param_commands but <br>
also env_commands which provide the JSV with the information
which environment variables would be exported to the job
environment if the job is accepted and started later <br>
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job environment is not
passed to JSV instances as default because the job
environment of the end user might contain data which might
be interpreted wrong in the JSV <br>
context and might therefore cause errors or security
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">started_command :=
&rsquo;STARTED&rsquo; ; <br>
By sending the started_command a JSV instance indicates that
it is ready to receive param_commands and env_commands for a
new job verification. It will only receive <br>
env_commands if it sends a send_data_command before the
started_command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSEUDO PARAMETERS <br>
CLIENT The corresponding value for the CLIENT parameters is
either &rsquo;qmaster&rsquo; or the name of a submit client
like &rsquo;qsub&rsquo;, <br>
&rsquo;qsh&rsquo;, &rsquo;qrsh&rsquo;, &rsquo;qlogin&rsquo;
and so on This parameter value can&rsquo;t be changed by JSV
instances. It will always be sent as part of a job
verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMDARGS <br>
Number of arguments which will be passed to the job script
or command when the job execution is started. It will always
be sent as part of a job verification. If no <br>
arguments should be passed to the job script or command it
will have the value 0. This parameter can be changed by JSV
instances. If the value of CMDARGS is bigger than <br>
the number of available CMDARG&lt;id&gt; parameters then the
missing parameters will be automatically passed as empty
parameters to the job script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMDNAME <br>
Either the path to the script or the command name in case of
binary submission. It will always be sent as part of a job
verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
Either &rsquo;client&rsquo; if the JSV which receives this
param_command was started by a commandline client like qsub,
qsh, ... or &rsquo;master&rsquo; if it was started by the
sge_qmaster <br>
process. It will always be sent as part of a job
verification. Changing the value of this parameters is not
possible within JSV instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROUP Defines Primary group of
the user which tries to submit the job which should be
verified. This parameter cannot be changed but is always
sent as part of the verification <br>
process. The user name is passed as parameters with the name
USER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOB_ID Not available in the
client context (see CONTEXT). Otherwise it contains the job
number of the job which will be submitted to Grid Engine
when the verification process is <br>
successful. JOB_ID is an optional parameter which
can&rsquo;t be changed by JSV instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER Username of the user which
tries to submit the job which should be verified. Cannot be
changed but is always sent as part of the verification
process. The group name is <br>
passed as parameter with the name GROUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
VERSION will always be sent as part of a job verification
process and it will always be the first parameter which is
sent. It will contain a version number of the format <br>
&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;. In version 6.2u2 and higher the
value will be &rsquo;1.0&rsquo;. The value of this parameter
can&rsquo;t be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Here is an example for the communication of a client with a
JSV instance when following job is submitted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; qsub -pe p 3 -hard -l
a=1,b=5 -soft -l q=all.q
$SGE_ROOT/examples/jobs/sleeper.sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data in the first column is sent
from the client/qmaster to the JSV instance. That data
contained in the second column is sent from the JSV script
to the client/qmaster. New line <br>
characters which terminate each line in the communication
protocol are omitted.</p>
