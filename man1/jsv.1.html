JSV - Sun Grid Engine Job Submission Verifier
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
JSV is an abbreviation for Job Submission Verifier. A JSV is a script or binary
  that can be used to verify, modify or reject a job during the time of job
  submission.
<div class="Pp"></div>
JSVs will be triggered by submit clients like <i>qsub</i>, <i>qrsh</i>,
  <i>qsh</i> and <i>qmon</i> on submit hosts (Client JSV) or they verify
  incoming jobs on the master host (Server JSV) or both.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
JSVs can be configured on various locations. Either a <b>jsv_url</b> can be
  provided with the <b>-jsv</b> submit parameter during job submission, a
  corresponding switch can be added to one of the <b>sge_request</b> files or a
  <b>jsv_url</b> can be configured in the global cluster configuration of the
  Sun Grid Engine installation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All defined JSV instances will be executed in following order:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 1) qsub -jsv ...
<br/>
 2) $cwd/.sge_request
<br/>
 3) $HOME/.sge_request
<br/>
 4) $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request
<br/>
 5) Global configuration
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Client JSVs (1-3) can be defined by Sun Grid Engine end users whereas the
  client JSV defined in the global sge_request file (4) and the server JSV (5)
  can only be defined by the Sun Grid Engine administrators.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to the fact that (4) and (5) are defined and configured by Sun Grid Engine
  administrators and because they are executed as last JSV instances in the
  sequence of JSV scripts, an administrator has an additional way to define
  certain policies for a cluster.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As soon as one JSV instance rejects a job the whole process of verification is
  stopped and the end user will get a corresponding error message that the
  submission of the job has failed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a JSV accepts a job or accepts a job after it applied several modifications
  then the following JSV instance will get the job parameters including all
  modifications as input for the verification process. This is done as long as
  either the job is accepted or rejected.
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIFETIME"><a class="selflink" href="#LIFETIME">LIFETIME</a></h1>
A Client or Server JSV is started as own UNIX process. This process communicates
  either with a Sun Grid Engine client process or the master daemon by
  exchanging commands, job parameters and other data via
  <b>stdin</b>/<b>stdout</b> channels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Client JSV instances are started by client applications before a job is sent to
  qmaster. This instance does the job verification for the job to be submitted.
  After that verification the JSV process is stopped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Server JSV instances are started for each worker thread part of the qmaster
  process (for version 6.2 of Sun Grid Engine this means that two processes are
  started). Each of those processes have to verify job parameters for multiple
  jobs as long as the master is running, the underlying JSV configuration is not
  changed and no error occurs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TIMEOUT"><a class="selflink" href="#TIMEOUT">TIMEOUT</a></h1>
The timeout is a modifiable value that will measure the response time of either
  the client or server JSV. In the event that the response time of the JSV is
  longer than timeout value specified, this will result in the JSV being
  re-started. The server JSV timeout value is specified through the qmaster
  parameter jsv_timeout. The client JSV timeout value is set through the
  environment variable <b>SGE_JSV_TIMEOUT</b>. The default value is 10 seconds,
  and this value must be greater than 0. If the timeout has been reach, the JSV
  will only try to re-start once, if the timeout is reached again an error will
  occur.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THRESHOLD"><a class="selflink" href="#THRESHOLD">THRESHOLD</a></h1>
The threshold value is defined as a qmaster parameter jsv_threshold. This value
  measures the time for a server job verification. If this time exceeds the
  defined threshold then additional logging will appear in the master message
  file at the INFO level. This value is specified in milliseconds and has a
  default value of 5000. If a value of 0 is defined then this means all jobs
  will be logged in the message file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROTOCOL"><a class="selflink" href="#PROTOCOL">PROTOCOL</a></h1>
After a JSV script or binary is started it will get commands through its
  <b>stdin</b> stream and it has to respond with certain commands on the
  <b>stdout</b> stream. Data which is send via the <b>stderr</b> stream of a JSV
  instance is ignored. Each command which is send to/by a JSV script has to be
  terminated by a new line character (' <b>\n</b>') whereas new line characters
  are not allowed in the whole command string itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general commands which are exchanged between a JSV and client/qmaster have
  following format. Commands and arguments are case sensitive. Find the EBNF
  command description below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 <b>command</b> := <b>command_name</b> ' ' { <b>argument</b> ' ' } ;
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>command</b> starts with a <b>command_name</b> followed by a space character
  and a space separated list of <b>arguments</b>.

Following <b>commands</b> have to be implemented by an JSV script so that it
  conforms to version 1.0 of the JSV protocol which was first implemented in Sun
  Grid Engine 6.2u2:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>begin_command</b> := '<b>BEGIN</b>' ;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">After a JSV instance has received all <b>env_commands</b>
      and <b>param_commands</b> of a job which should be verified, the
      client/qmaster will trigger the verification process by sending one
      <b>begin_command</b>. After that it will wait for <b>param_commands</b>
      and <b>env_commands</b> which are sent back from the JSV instance to
      modify the job specification. As part of the verification process a JSV
      script or binary has to use the <b>result_command</b> to indicate that the
      verification process is finished for a job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>env_command</b> := <b>ENV</b> ' ' <b>modifier</b> ' '

  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>env_command</b> is an optional command which has
      only to be implemented by a JSV instance if the <b>send_data_command</b>

      that case the client or master will use one or multiple
      <b>env_commands</b> to pass the environment variables ( <b>name</b> and
      <b>value</b>) to the JSV instance which would be exported to the job
      environment when the job would be started. Client and qmaster will only

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    JSV instances modify the set of environment variables by sending back

      <b>value</b> of the corresponding <b>param_parameter</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Multiple <b>param_commands</b> will be sent to a JSV instance after the JSV
      has sent a <b>started_command</b>. The sum of all <b>param_commands</b>
      which is sent represents a job specification of that job which should be

     <b>submit_parameters</b> are for example <b>b</b> (similar to the

      <b>-masterq</b> switch). Find a complete list of <b>submit_parameters</b>
      in the man page. Please note that not in all cases the
      <b>param_parameter</b> name and the corresponding <b>value</b> format is
      equivalent with the qsub switch name and its argument format. E.g. the

A JSV script or binary can send a set of commands to a client/qmaster process to
  indicate its state in the communication process, to change the job
  specification of a job which should be verified and to report messages or
  errors. Below you can find the commands which are understood by the
  client/qmaster which will implement version 1.0 of the communication protocol
  which was first implemented in Sun Grid Engine 6.2u2:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>error_command</b> := '<b>ERROR</b>' <b>message</b>
    ;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Any time a JSV script encounters an error it might report
      it to the client/qmaster. If the error happens during a job verification
      the job which is currently verified will be rejected. The JSV binary or
      script will also be restarted before it gets a new verification task.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>log_level</b> := '<b>INFO</b>' | '<b>WARNING</b>' |
    '<b>ERROR</b>'</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>log_commands</b> can be used whenever the client or
      qmaster expects input from a JSV instance. This command can be used in
      client JSVs to send information to the user submitting the job. In client
      JSVs all messages, independent of the <b>log_level</b> will be printed to
      the <b>stdout</b> stream of the used submit client. If a server JSV
      receives a <b>log_command</b> it will add the received message to the
      message file respecting the specified <b>log_level</b>. Please note that
      <b>message</b> might contain spaces but no new line characters.</dd>
