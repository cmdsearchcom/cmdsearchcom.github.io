<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fvwm1 - F(?) Virtual Window Manager for X11, version 1.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fvwm1 [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fvwm is a window manager for X11. It is a derivative of twm,
redesigned to minimize memory consumption, provide a 3-D
look to window frames, and provide a simple virtual desktop.
<br>
Memory consumption is estimated at about one-half to
one-third the memory consumption of twm, due primarily to a
redesign of twm&rsquo;s method of storing mouse bindings. In
addition, <br>
many of the configurable options of twm have been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name &quot;FVWM&quot; used
to stand for something, but I forgot what. (Feeble, famous,
foobar? It doesn&rsquo;t really matter, this is an acronym
based society anyway.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS OF THIS SOFTWARE <br>
Since the release of FVWM 2.2 in March 1999, this release is
officially deprecated and no longer supported. Please do not
report any bugs in this software. Also, for Debian <br>
users, the module manpages for this release of FVWM will be
found as FvwmAudio1(1x) etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIAL NOTE FOR XFREE86 USERS
<br>
XFree86 provides a virtual screen whose operation can be
confusing when used in conjunction with fvwm. With XFree86
all windows which appear on the virtual screen actually get
<br>
drawn into video memory (whether or not they appear on the
physical screen), so the virtual screen size is limited by
available video memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With fvwm&rsquo;s virtual
desktop, windows which do not appear on the screen do not
actually get drawn into video RAM. The size of the virtual
desktop is limited to about 32,000 by <br>
32,000 pixels, but it is probably impractical to use a
virtual desktop more than about 5 times the visible screen
in each direction. Note that memory usage is a function of
the <br>
number of windows which exist - the size of the desktop
makes no difference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When becoming familiar with fvwm
it is recommended that you disable XFree86&rsquo;s virtual
screen by setting the virtual screen size to the physical
screen size. After you become <br>
familiar with fvwm you may want to re-enable XFree86&rsquo;s
virtual screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANATOMY OF A WINDOW <br>
Fvwm puts a decorative border around most windows. This
border consists of a bar on each side and a small
&quot;L&quot; shaped section on each corner. There is an
additional top bar <br>
called the title bar which is used to display the name of
the window. In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar
buttons. The top, side, and bottom bars are collectively
known as <br>
the side-bars. The corner pieces are called the frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the standard defaults
files are modified, pressing mouse button 1 in the title or
side-bars will begin a move operation on the window.
Pressing button 1 in the corner <br>
frame pieces will begin a resize operation. Pressing button
2 anywhere in the border brings up an extensive list of
window operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up to ten title-bar buttons may
exist. Their use is completely user definable. The default
configuration has a title-bar button on each side of the
title-bar. The one on the <br>
left is used to bring up a list of window options,
regardless of which mouse button is used. The one on the
right is used to iconify the window. The number of title-bar
buttons <br>
used depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to them.
See the section on the &quot;Mouse&quot; configuration
parameter below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP <br>
Fvwm provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish
to use them. The screen is a viewport onto a desktop which
may be larger than the screen. Several distinct desktops can
<br>
be accessed (concept: one desktop for each project, or one
desktop for each application, when view applications are
distinct). Since each desktop can be larger than the
physical <br>
screen, windows which are larger than the screen or large
groups of related windows can easily be viewed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of the virtual desktops
can be specified at start-up. All virtual desktops must be
the same size. The total number of distinct desktops need
not be specified, but is <br>
limited to approximately 4 billion total. All windows on the
current desktop can be displayed in a Pager, a miniature
view of the current desktop. Windows which are not on the
<br>
current desktop can be listed, along with their geometries,
in a window list, accessible as a pop-up menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Sticky&quot; windows are
windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
&quot;Sticking to the screen&rsquo;s glass.&quot; They
always stay put on the screen. This is convenient for things
like <br>
clocks and xbiff&rsquo;s, so you only need to run one such
gadget and it always stays with you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window geometries are specified
relative to the current viewport. That is: <br>
xterm -geometry +0+0 <br>
will always show up in the upper-left hand corner of the
visible portion of the screen. It is permissible to specify
geometries which place windows on the virtual desktop, but
<br>
off the screen. For example, if the visible screen is 1000
by 1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the current
viewport is at the upper left hand corner of the desktop,
<br>
then invoking: <br>
xterm -geometry +1000+1000 <br>
will place the window just off of the lower right hand
corner of the screen. It can be found by moving the mouse to
the lower right hand corner of the screen and waiting for it
<br>
to scroll into view. There is currently no way to cause a
window to map onto a desktop other than the currently active
desk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A geometry specified as
something like: <br>
xterm -geometry -5-5 <br>
will generally place the window&rsquo;s lower right hand
corner 5 pixels from the lower right corner of the visible
portion of the screen. Not all applications support window
geome&acirc; <br>
tries with negative offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some applications, like xterm
and xfontsel, allow the user to specify the start-up desk on
the command line: <br>
xterm -xrm &quot;*Desk:1&quot; <br>
will start an xterm on desk number 1. Not all applications
understand this option, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
During initialization, fvwm will search for a configuration
file which describes key and button bindings, and a few
other things. The format of these files will be described
<br>
later. First, fvwm will search for a file named .fvwmrc in
the users home directory. Failing that, it will look for
/etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc for system-wide defaults. If
that <br>
file is not found, fvwm will exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fvwm will set two environment
variables which will be inherited by its children. These are
$DISPLAY which describes the display on which fvwm is
running. $DISPLAY may be unix:0.0 <br>
or :0.0, which doesn&rsquo;t work too well when passed
through rsh to another machine, so $HOSTDISPLAY will also be
set and will use a network-ready description of the display.
$HOST&acirc; <br>
DISPLAY will always use the TCP/IP transport protocol (even
for a local connection) so $DISPLAY should be used for local
connections, as it may use Unix-domain sockets, which are
<br>
faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHAPED WINDOWS <br>
If you typically use shaped windows such as xeyes or oclock,
you have several options. You can make them all undecorated
(NoBorder oclock and NoTitle oclock, for example) or you
<br>
can use the default configuration and leave them decorated,
in which case a decorative border and a solid-color backdrop
are shown. Alternately, you can compile in the SHAPE <br>
extensions by changing a flag in the Makefile, in which case
you get the shaped window with no backdrop, and a title bar
floats above the window. The shaped window extensions <br>
increase the window manager&rsquo;s memory consumption by
about 60 Kbytes when no shaped windows are present but have
little effect when shaped windows are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICONS <br>
The basic Fvwm configuration uses monochrome bitmap icons,
similar to twm. If XPM extensions are compiled in, then
color icons similar to ctwm, MS-Windows, or the Macintosh
icons <br>
can be used. In order to use these options you will need the
XPM package, as described in the Makefile.noImake and the
Imakefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both the SHAPE and XPM
options are compiled in you will get shaped color icons,
which are very spiffy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULES <br>
A module is a separate program which runs as a separate Unix
process but transmits commands to fvwm to execute. Future
releases are expected to provide a means for these modules
<br>
to extract window information from fvwm. Users can write
their own modules to do any weird or bizarre manipulations
without affecting the integrity of fvwm itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules MUST be spawned by fvwm
so that it can set up two pipes for fvwm and the module to
communicate with. The pipes will already be open for the
module when it starts and the <br>
file descriptors for the pipes are provided as command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules can be spawned during
fvwm initialization via the Module option, or at any time
during the X session by use of the Module built-in. Modules
can exist for the duration of <br>
the X session, or can perform a single task and exit. If the
module is still active when fvwm is told to quit, then fvwm
will close the communication pipes and wait to receive a
<br>
SIGCHLD from the module, indicating that it has detected the
pipe closure and has exited. If modules fail to detect the
pipe closure fvwm will exit after approximately 30 seconds
<br>
anyway. The number of simultaneously executing modules is
limited by the operating system&rsquo;s maximum number of
simultaneously open files, usually between 60 and 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules simply transmit text
commands to the fvwm built-in command engine. Text commands
are formatted just as in the case of a mouse binding in the
.fvwmrc setup file. Certain <br>
auxiliary information is also transmitted, as in the sample
module GoodStuff. The GoodStuff module is documented in its
own man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICCCM COMPLIANCE <br>
Fvwm attempts to be ICCCM 1.1 compliant. As of this (1.20l)
colormap handling is not completely ICCCM compliant. In
addition, ICCCM states that it should be possible for
applica&acirc; <br>
tions to receive ANY keystroke, which is not consistent with
the keyboard shortcut approach used in fvwm and most other
window managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M4 PREPROCESSING <br>
If fvwm is compiled with the M4 option, fvwm uses m4(1) to
preprocess its setup files before parsing. This way you can
use m4 macros to perform operations at runtime. This makes
<br>
it very easy to work with different displays with different
characteristics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, depending on your
mood, you might want different color schemes. One way of
doing this is by using the -m4opt to specify your mood. For
a sunny mood use -m4opt <br>
-DSunny; for a dark mood use -m4opt -DDark. Your .fvwmrc
file might then contain: <br>
ifdef(&lsquo;Sunny&rsquo;,&lsquo; <br>
StdForeColor Black <br>
StdBackColor LightSkyBlue <br>
HiForeColor yellow <br>
HiBackColor PeachPuff1 <br>
PagerBackColor BlanchedAlmond &rsquo;)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifdef(&lsquo;Dark&rsquo;,&lsquo;
<br>
StdForeColor Black <br>
StdBackColor #60a0c0 <br>
HiForeColor black <br>
HiBackColor #c06077 <br>
PagerBackColor #5c54c0 <br>
PagerForeColor orchid <br>
StickyForeColor Black <br>
StickyBackColor #60c0a0 &rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following m4 symbols are
predefined by fvwm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BITS_PER_RGB The number of
significant bits in an RGB color. (log base 2 of the number
of distinct colors that can be created. This is often
different from the num&acirc; <br>
ber of colors that can be displayed at once.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASS Your visual class. Will
return one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor,
PseudoColor, TrueColor, DirectColor, or, if it cannot
determine what you have, <br>
NonStandard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTHOST The machine that is
running the clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR This will be either
&rsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &rsquo;No&rsquo;. This is just a
wrapper around the CLASS definition. Returns
&rsquo;Yes&rsquo; on *Color and &rsquo;No&rsquo; on
StaticGray and GrayScale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FVWMDIR This is set to the path
where the modules were configured to be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FVWM_VERSION This is a string
containing the version of fvwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HEIGHT The height of your
display in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME The user&rsquo;s home
directory. Obtained from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAME The canonical hostname
running the clients (ie. a fully-qualified version of
CLIENTHOST).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS This is a string of
compile time options used. Each option is separated from the
other by a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLANES The number of bit planes
your display supports in the default root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELEASE The release number of
your X server. For MIT X11R5 this is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REVISION The X minor protocol
revision. As seen by ProtocolRevision(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVERHOST This variable is set
to the name of the machine that is running the X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWM_TYPE Tells which twm
offshoot is running. It will always be set to the string
&quot;fvwm&quot; in this program. This is useful for
protecting parts of your .twmrc file <br>
that fvwm proper won&rsquo;t understand (like WorkSpaces) so
that it is still usable with other twm programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER The name of the user
running the program. Obtained from the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VENDOR The vendor of your X
server. For example: MIT X Consortium.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION The X major protocol
version. As seen by ProtocolVersion(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDTH The width of your display
in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X_RESOLUTION The X resolution of
your display in pixels per meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y_RESOLUTION The Y resolution of
your display in pixels per meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may well find that if you
research the m4(1) manual well and understand the power of
m4, this will be a very useful and powerful tool. But if you
use any of the symbols <br>
which are predefined by m4, you are in severe danger! For
example, Sun&rsquo;s m4 predefines include, so if you use
that name in your .fvwmrc, you are out of luck. The correct
solu&acirc; <br>
tion to this problem is to put a set of quotes around the
troublesome word: &lsquo;include&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To help alleviate this problem,
the following options may be useful. To change the quoting
characters used by m4, use the options -m4-squote and
-m4-equote. Be sure to specify <br>
both options otherwise m4 will be confused. When these are
given, a changequote macro is given before the users fvwmrc
file is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Some versions of m4 are
broken with respect to changing quoting characters and
included files. When the quoting strings are longer than one
character, the macro <br>
&quot;include(&lt;&lt;file&gt;&gt;)&quot;, where
&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; are the
quoting characters, contains extra characters around the
contents of the included file. This will confuse fvwm. SunOS
4.1.3 is <br>
known to have this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using GNU m4 an
additional option is available. By specifying -m4-prefix
when starting fvwm, m4 is instructed to prefix all builtin
macros with m4_. Thus, include <br>
becomes m4_include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The availability of the m4
preprocessing is subject to the compilation define M4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
These are the command line options that are recoginzed by
fvwm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f config_file <br>
Causes fvwm to use config_file in the user&rsquo;s home
directory instead of .fvwmrc as the window manager
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Puts X transactions in
synchronous mode, which dramatically slows things down, but
guarantees that fvwm&rsquo;s internal error messages are
correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d displayname <br>
Manage the display called &quot;displayname&quot; instead of
the name obtained from the environment variable
$DISPLAY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s On a multi-screen display,
run fvwm only on the screen named in the $DISPLAY
environment variable or provided through the -d option.
Normally, fvwm will attempt to start <br>
up on all screens of a multi-screen display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print the version of fvwm to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available only if fvwm is compiled with the M4 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-m4 Do not use m4 to
preprocess the .fvwmrc. The default is to preprocess the
startup file using m4(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-prefix <br>
If GNU m4 is available, cause m4 to prefix all builtin
commands with m4_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4opt option <br>
Pass this option to m4. The option can be any string of
characters without spaces. This option can occur multiple
times. If GNU m4 is available, DO NOT pass the -P <br>
option here. Use -m4-prefix instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-squote string <br>
Use this given string as the starting quote characters. You
must also specify -m4-equote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-equote string <br>
Use this given string as the ending quote characters. You
must also specify -m4-squote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4prog path <br>
Use path as the location of the desired m4 processor. By
default, m4prog is set to &quot;m4&quot; which must exist
somewhere on the user&rsquo;s path. This option allows the
user to <br>
explicitly choose the version of m4 to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
The configuration file is used to describe mouse and button
bindings, colors, the virtual display size, and related
items. This section describes the configuration options.
Lines <br>
beginning with &rsquo;#&rsquo; will be ignored by fvwm.
Lines starting with &rsquo;*&rsquo; are expected to contain
module configuration commands (rather than configuration
commands for fvwm itself).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AppsBackingStore <br>
Causes application windows to request backing store. This
option compromises the ICCCM compliance of the window
manager. While this option can speed things up in an
X-ter&acirc; <br>
minal, where redraws of windows are expensive, it may not
help much on regular workstations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRaise delay <br>
Enables auto-raising of windows and specifies the time delay
(in milliseconds) between when a window acquires the input
focus and when it is automatically raised. This <br>
option works in focus-follows-mouse mode, and in
click-to-focus mode if the focus is changed by clicking in
the application window instead of a decoration window. In
<br>
click-to-focus mode, you can suppress the raise-on-focus
behavior by specifying a negative delay value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackingStore <br>
Causes fvwm decorations to request backing store. See the
discussion on AppsBackingStore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BoundaryWidth Width <br>
Changes the boundary width on decorated windows to the
specified value. The default is 6 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying
BoundaryWidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButtonStyle button# WidthxHeight
<br>
Defines the rectangular decoration shape to be used in a
title-bar button. button# is the title-bar button number,
and is between 0 and 9. A description of title-bar <br>
button numbers is given in the Mouse section below. Width is
the percentage of the full button width which is to be used.
Height is the percentage of the full height to <br>
be used. Negative numbers cause the shading to be
inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And that&rsquo;s not all! If you
use a line like: <br>
ButtonStyle : 2 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1 <br>
then the button 2 decoration will use a 4-point pattern
consisting of a line from (x=50,y=30) to (70,70) in the
shadow color (@0), and then to (30,70) in the shadow color,
<br>
and finally to (50,30) in the highlight color (@1). Is that
too confusing? See the sample system.fvwmrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CenterOnCirculate <br>
When circulating, the desktop page containing the window
which the pointer is moving to is automatically selected. If
CenterOnCirculate is selected then fvwm will do its <br>
best to center the target window in the desktop viewport,
rather than just lining up to the closest page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CirculateSkip windowname <br>
Causes windows with the indicated name to be skipped over
when the circulate-up or circulate-down functions are
invoked. windowname can be a window&rsquo;s name or its
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying
CirculateSkip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CirculateSkipIcons <br>
Causes circulate and warp operations to skip over iconified
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickTime delay <br>
Specifies the maximum delay (in milliseconds) between a
button press and a button release for the Function built-in
to consider the action a mouse click. The default delay <br>
is 150 milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickToFocus <br>
Normally keyboard input goes to the window the mouse pointer
is in. If this option is set the keyboard input stays with
one window until the mouse is clicked with the <br>
pointer positioned in a new window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor cursor_num cursor_type
<br>
This provides a very awkward way of changing cursor styles.
Cursor_num tells which cursor you are changing, and is a
number between 0 and 12, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 POSITION - used when initially
placing windows. <br>
1 TITLE - used in a window title-bar. <br>
2 DEFAULT - used in windows that don&rsquo;t set their
cursor. <br>
3 SYS - used in one of the title-bar buttons. <br>
4 MOVE - used when moving or resizing windows. <br>
5 WAIT - used during an EXEC builtin command. <br>
6 MENU - used in menus. <br>
7 SELECT - used for various builtin commands such as
iconify. <br>
8 DESTROY - used for DESTROY and DELETE built-ins. <br>
9 TOP - used in the top side-bar of a window. <br>
10 RIGHT - used in the right side-bar of a window. <br>
11 BOTTOM - used in the bottom side-bar of a window. <br>
12 LEFT - used in the left side-bar of a window. <br>
13 TOP_LEFT - used in the top left corner of a window. <br>
14 TOP_RIGHT - used in the top right corner of a window.
<br>
15 BOTTOM_LEFT - used in the bottom left corner of a window.
<br>
16 BOTTOM_RIGHT - used in the bottom right corner of a
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cursor_type argument is a
number which tells the cursor shape to use. The available

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DecorateTransients <br>
Causes transient windows, which are normally left
undecorated, to be given the usual fvwm decorations. Note
that some pop-up windows, such as the xterm menus, are not
man&acirc; <br>
aged by the window manager and still do not receive
decorations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DeskTopScale Scale <br>
Defines the virtual desktop scale with respect to the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DeskTopSize HorizontalxVertical
<br>
Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical
screen size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DontMoveOff <br>
Prevents windows from being moved off or initially placed
off of the desktop. A few programs will not work correctly
if you use this option. This only keeps windows from <br>
being completely lost off the edge of the desktop. It
insists on keeping 16 pixels on the desktop but
doesn&rsquo;t care a bit about keeping the whole window on
the desk. See <br>
EdgeResistance if you don&rsquo;t like having windows
partially off the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeResistance scrolling moving
<br>
Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport
by moving the mouse over the edge of the screen and how hard
it should be to move a window over the edge of the <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first parameter tells how
milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge
before fvwm will move the viewport. This is intended for
people who use &quot;EdgeScroll <br>
100 100&quot; but find themselves accidentally flipping
pages when they don&rsquo;t want to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second parameter tells how
many pixels over the edge of the screen a window&rsquo;s
edge must move before it actually moves partially off the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, with &quot;EdgeScroll
0 0&quot;, it is still possible to move or resize windows
across the edge of the current screen. By making the first
parameter to EdgeResistance <br>
10000 this type of motion is impossible. With EdgeResistance
less than 10000 but greater than 0 moving over pages becomes
difficult but not impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EdgeScroll horizontal vertical
<br>
Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor
hits the edge of a page. If you don&rsquo;t want any paging
or scrolling when you hit the edge of a page include <br>
&quot;EdgeScroll 0 0&quot; in your .fvwmrc file. If you want
whole pages, use &quot;EdgeScroll 100 100&quot;. Both
horizontal and vertical should be positive numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the horizontal and vertical
percentages are multiplied by 1000 then scrolling will wrap
around at the edge of the desktop. If &quot;EdgeScroll
100000 100000&quot; is used fvwm <br>
will scroll by whole pages, wrapping around at the edge of
the desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font fontname <br>
Makes fvwm use font fontname instead of &quot;fixed&quot;
for menus, the resize indicators, and icon labels (if
IconFont is not specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function FunctionName <br>
Starts the definition of a complex function, composed of the
fvwm built-in functions, which will later be bound to a
mouse button or key. FunctionName must be enclosed in <br>
quotes. Function entries are included on lines following the
Function keyword. The definition ends with the key word
EndFunction. Function entries are specified as shown <br>
in the following example. The first word on each line is the
built-in function which will be performed, followed the type
of event which should trigger the action <br>
(enclosed in quotes), followed by any additional arguments
needed by the built-in function. Menus can be specified by
using the Popup built-in as long as the menu was <br>
defined earlier in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trigger actions which are
recognized are Immediate, Motion, Click, and DoubleClick.
Immediate actions are executed as soon as the function is
activated, even if a win&acirc; <br>
dow has not been selected. If there are actions other than
immediate ones, fvwm will wait to see if the user is
clicking, double-clicking, or dragging the mouse. After the
<br>
decision is made, fvwm will execute only the built-ins from
the function definition whose trigger action matches the
action performed by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the following example were
bound to button 1 in a window title-bar, then, when button 1
is pressed, fvwm would wait 150 msec to see if the button is
released. If the <br>
button is not released fvwm will start a move operation.
When the move operation is complete a raise operation will
be performed. If a button release is detected then fvwm <br>
will wait another 150 msec for a second click. If only one
click is detected then the window will be raised. If two
clicks are detected the window will be alternately <br>
raised and lowered. The 150 msec wait duration can be
altered using the ClickTime option. <br>
Function &quot;Move-or-Raise&quot; <br>
Move &quot;Motion&quot; <br>
Raise &quot;Motion&quot; <br>
Raise &quot;Click&quot; <br>
RaiseLower &quot;DoubleClick&quot; <br>
EndFunction <br>
The clicking and double clicking concepts do not carry
through to using keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two special functions exist:
InitFunction and RestartFunction. The InitFunction will be
called when fvwm is started for the first time in any X
session and can be used to <br>
start modules, set background patterns, and begin programs.
The restart function will be called when fvwm is restarted.
It can be used to start modules and set background <br>
patterns but probably should not be used to start
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiBackColor colorname <br>
Sets the background color of the selected window to
colorname. When using a monochrome screen this option is
ignored and white is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HiForeColor colorname <br>
Sets the color of the selected window&rsquo;s title to
colorname. When using a monochrome screen this option is
ignored and black is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon windowname bitmap-file <br>
Specifies the bitmap to be used for a window when it is
iconified. The windowname can be an application&rsquo;s
window name or class name and must be enclosed in quotes.
The <br>
bitmap-file is either the full path name to a standard X11
bitmap file or a file in the IconPath or PixmapPath. The
specified bitmap/pixmap is used in preference to any <br>
icon supplied by the window itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fvwm is compiled with XPM
support for color icons then bitmap can be an XPM pixmap
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windowname should be enclosed in
double quotes but bitmap-file should not. Environment
variables should not be used in the bitmap-file
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If windowname is an empty string
then the specified file is the default icon, and will be
used if no other icon bitmap or pixmap can be found: <br>
Icon &quot;&quot; my-favorite-icon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying Icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconBox left top right bottom
<br>
Defines regions of the screen in which to place icons. Up to
four icon boxes can be defined. If an IconBox line is
provided then icons will automatically be placed in <br>
them, if possible. Each time a window is iconified a new
place is found for it. Icon boxes are searched for space
going left to right, then top to bottom. Icons will not <br>
be auto-placed on top of other icons but they may be placed
underneath application windows. If left or right is
negative, then fvwm will add the screen width to it. If top
<br>
or bottom is negative, then fvwm will add the screen height
to it. NOTE: -0 is not parsed as the right or bottom pixel
on the screen. You have to use -1 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no IconBox line is provided
or all icon boxes are full, then fvwm will place icons near
the current pointer location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconFont fontname <br>
Makes fvwm use font fontname for icon labels. If omitted,
the menu font (specified by the Font configuration
parameter) will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IconPath path <br>
Specifies a colon separated list of full path names of
directories where bitmap (monochrome) icons can be found.
Each path should start with a slash. Note: if the M4 <br>
patches are included when fvwm is built, then m4 will want
to mangle the word &quot;include&quot; which will frequently
show up in the IconPath or PixmapPath command. To fix this
<br>
add undefine(&lsquo;include&rsquo;) prior to the IconPath
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key keyname Context Modifiers
Function <br>
Binds a keyboard key to a specified fvwm built-in function.
Definition is the same as for a mouse binding except that
the mouse button number is replaced with a key name. <br>
The keyname is one of the entries from
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, with the leading XK_ omitted.
The Context and Modifiers fields are defined as in the mouse
binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binding a key to a title-bar
button will not cause that button to appear unless a mouse
binding also exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lenience <br>
The ICCCM states that if an application sets the input field
of the wm_hints structure to False, then it never wants the
window manager to give it the input focus. The <br>
only application that I know of which needs this is sxpm,
and that is a silly bug with a trivial fix and has no
overall effect on the program anyway. Rumor is that some
<br>
older applications have problems too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this parameter is set then
fvwm will ignore this ICCCM convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuBackColor colorname <br>
Sets the menu background color. When using monochrome this
option is ignored. This option is only available if fvwm is
compiled with MENUCOLOR defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuForeColor colorname <br>
Sets the menu foreground color. When using monochrome this
option is ignored. This option is only available if fvwm is
compiled with MENUCOLOR defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MenuStippleColor colorname <br>
Sets the color for shaded out entries in menus (for
functions which are not allowed on the currently selected
window). When using monochrome this option is ignored and a
<br>
stipple pattern is used. This option is only available if
fvwm is compiled with MENUCOLOR defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module ModuleName <br>
Specifies a module which should be spawned during
initialization. At the current time the available modules
are FvwmAudio, FvwmBacker, FvwmBanner, FvwmClean, FvwmDebug,
<br>
FvwmIconBox, FvwmIdent, FvwmPager, FvwmSave, FvwmSaveDesk,
FvwmScroll, FvwmWinList, and GoodStuff. These modules have
their own man pages. Module can also be used as a <br>
built-in. Modules can be short lived transient programs or,
like GoodStuff, can remain for the duration of the X
session. Modules will be terminated by the window manager
<br>
prior to restarts and quits, if possible. See the
introductory section on modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ModulePath <br>
Specifies a colon separated list of paths for fvwm to search
when looking for a module to load. Individual directories do
not need trailing slashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse Button Context Modifiers
Function <br>
Defines a mouse binding. Button is the mouse button number.
If Button is zero then any button will perform the specified
function. Context describes where the binding <br>
applies. Valid contexts are R for the root window, W for an
application window, T for a window title bar, S for a window
side, top, or bottom bar, F for a window frame <br>
(the corners), I for an Icon window, or 0 through 9 for
title-bar buttons, or any combination of these letters. A is
for any context except for title-bar buttons. For <br>
instance, a context of FST will apply when the mouse is
anywhere in a window&rsquo;s border except the title-bar
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifiers is any combination of
N for no modifiers, C for control, S for shift, M for Meta,
or A for any modifier. For example, a modifier of SM will
apply when both the <br>
Meta and shift keys are down. X11 modifiers mod1 through
mod5 are represented as the digits 1 through 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function is one of fvwm&rsquo;s
built-in functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The title bar buttons are
numbered with odd numbered buttons on the left side of the
title bar and even numbers on the right. Smaller-numbered
buttons are displayed toward <br>
the outside of the window while larger-numbered buttons
appear toward the middle of the window (0 is short for 10).
In summary, the buttons are numbered: <br>
1 3 5 7 9 0 8 6 4 2 <br>
The highest odd numbered button which has an action bound to
it determines the number of buttons drawn on the left side
of the title bar. The highest even number deter&acirc; <br>
mines the number or right side buttons which are drawn.
Actions can be bound to either mouse buttons or keyboard
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWMBorders <br>
Substitutes MWM style 1 pixel wide relief lines instead of
fvwm&rsquo;s 2 pixel borders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWMButtons <br>
Disables button press feedback for all decorations except
the title bar and title-bar buttons, as in MWM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWMDecorHints <br>
Causes fvwm to read the MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom from application
windows and to parse and attempt to replicate the Motif
behavior with regard to window decorations. Note that <br>
mwm allows function hints to affect window decorations but
these effects are not replicated by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWMFunctionHints <br>
Causes fvwm to read the MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom from application
windows and to parse and attempt to replicate the Motif
behavior with regard to allowed window functions. <br>
Unlike mwm, which simply removes prohibited functions from
the window&rsquo;s menus, fvwm simply shades out the
prohibited functions. Also, because fvwm implements some
func&acirc; <br>
tions in user defined macros that mwm implements internally,
the mapping of prohibited functions is partially based on
the menu item label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWMHintOverride <br>
If MWMFunctionHints is used then maximization and
iconfication are prohibited for transients. Also, windows
can specify that the window manager should not destroy or
<br>
delete them. Since these MWM rules are kind of stupid,
especially with regard to the transient windows, I provide
this MWMHintOverride option. When it is used menu items <br>
will be shaded out if MWM would prohibit their use, but the
user can go ahead and select that item and it will operate
as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The override should be used
cautiously because some applications will break if you
override their mwm hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MWMMenus <br>
Substitutes MWM look and feel menus in place of the standard
fvwm versions. This option also triggers a few other
mwm-style options, such as centering the size/resize <br>
window on the screen, instead of leaving it in the upper
left, and switches the resize-on-initial-placement trigger
action to shift-button-1 instead of the twm style <br>
press-button-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoBorder windowname <br>
Keeps fvwm from putting decorative borders on windows named
windowname. This command has no effect on the title-bar.
This is handy for clocks and similar gadgets that you <br>
don&rsquo;t want to take up too much space. windowname can
be a window&rsquo;s name or its class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify both NoBorder
windowname and NoTitle windowname for the same window in
your .fvwmrc file the window will be completely
undecorated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windowname can contain the
wildcards &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; which match window
names in the normal Unix filename matching manner. Actual
&quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, and &quot; <br>
can be entered by preceding the character with a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying NoBorder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoBoundaryWidth Width <br>
Changes the width of the decorations for windows with no
titles and no borders. The default is 1. Any positive or
zero value is acceptable. Decorations for these
undeco&acirc; <br>
rated windows have the same context as the side-bars on
normally decorated windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying
NoBoundaryWidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoPPosition <br>
Instructs fvwm to ignore the PPosition field when adding new
windows. Adherence to the PPosition field is required for
some applications, but if you don&rsquo;t have one of <br>
those its a real headache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoTitle windowname <br>
Keeps fvwm from putting a title-bar in the decorations for
windows named windowname. This is handy for clocks and
similar gadgets that you don&rsquo;t want to take up too
much <br>
space. windowname can be a window&rsquo;s name or its
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windowname can contain the
wildcards &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; which match window
names in the normal Unix filename matching manner. Actual
&quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, and &quot; <br>
can be entered by preceding the character with a &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying NoTitle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueMove percentage <br>
Tells fvwm the maximum size window with which opaque window
movement should be used. The percentage is percent of the
total screen area. With &quot;OpaqueMove 0&quot; all windows
<br>
will be moved using the traditional rubber-band outline.
With &quot;OpaqueMove 100&quot; all windows will be move as
solid windows. The default is &quot;OpaqueMove 5&quot;,
which allows small <br>
windows to be moved in an opaque manner but large windows
are moved as rubber-bands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpaqueResize <br>
Causes resize operations to be done with the window itself
instead of an outline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pager X_Location Y_Location <br>
Enables a paging style of moving across the desktop. A Pager
window (not a pop-up) will appear at (X_Location,
Y_Location). Miniature versions of all the non-sticky
win&acirc; <br>
dows on the virtual desktop are shown in the pager. The
color of the miniature version is the same as the color of
the full-size window&rsquo;s border.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Pager window, pressing
mouse button 1 will move the desktop viewport to the
selected page (in click-to-focus mode; it will also move the
keyboard focus to the win&acirc; <br>
dow whose miniature you click on). Pressing button 2 on a
window in the pager will begin a window move, using the
miniature to quickly move the window anywhere on the <br>
desktop. Pressing button 3 will move the top-left corner of
the viewport to the location of the button press, even if it
does not line up with a page. Dragging button 3 <br>
will cause the selected viewport to scroll as you move the
pointer. The Pager is automatically sticky but does not
automatically stay on top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PagerForeColor colorname <br>
Causes the pager foreground color to be colorname instead of
black. This is the color used to highlight the current
viewport in the pager window. On a monochrome screen <br>
this option is ignored. If the NO_PAGER option is set when
building fvwm this option is unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PagerBackColor colorname <br>
Causes the pager background color to be colorname instead of
white. On a monochrome screen this option is ignored. If the
NO_PAGER option is set when building fvwm this <br>
option is unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PagerFont fontname <br>
Makes fvwm use font fontname for writing window icon names
in the window&rsquo;s representation in the pager. If this
option is omitted no names are written in the pager
win&acirc; <br>
dows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PagingDefault pagingdefaultvalue
<br>
Tells fvwm if it should start up with paging enabled or
disabled. &quot;PagingDefault 0&quot; will start fvwm with
paging disabled; &quot;PagingDefault 1&quot; will start fvwm
with paging <br>
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PixmapPath path <br>
Specifies a colon separated list of full path names of
directories where pixmap (color) icons can be found. Each
path should start with a slash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup PopupName <br>
Starts the definition of a pop-up menu which will later be
bound to a mouse button or key. PopupName must be enclosed
in quotes. Menu entries are included on lines fol&acirc;
<br>
lowing the Popup keyword. The menu definition ends with the
key word EndPopup. Menu entries are specified as shown in
the following example. The first word on each line <br>
is the built-in function which will be performed, followed
by the caption (enclosed in quotes) which will be shown in
the menu, followed by any additional arguments needed <br>
by the built-in function. Sub-menus can be specified by
using the Popup built-in as long as the sub-menu was defined
earlier in the configuration file. <br>
Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot; <br>
Title &quot;Window Ops&quot; <br>
Move &quot;Move&quot; <br>
Resize &quot;Resize&quot; <br>
Raise &quot;Raise&quot; <br>
Lower &quot;Lower&quot; <br>
Iconify &quot;(De)Iconify&quot; <br>
Nop &quot; &quot; <br>
Destroy &quot;Destroy&quot; <br>
Title &quot;HARDCOPY&quot; <br>
Exec &quot;Hardcopy&quot; exec xdpr &amp; <br>
Exec &quot;Hardcopy RV&quot; exec xdpr -rv &amp; <br>
EndMenu <br>
Note that if a tab character is embedded in the caption of a
menu entry then the text following the tab will be entered
into a second column in the menu and the entire <br>
menu will be left-adjusted. This is intended for shortcut
labeling. The tab character must really be a tab. If it is
expanded into spaces it will not work! For example: <br>
Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot; <br>
Title &quot;Window Ops Alt-F1&quot; <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
Is the start of a left adjusted menu. Alt-F1 will be placed
toward the right side of the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shortcut keys may be specified
in the menu definition by preceding the character with an
ampersand. The ampersand will not be displayed but the
character after it will be <br>
displayed underlined, and if the user presses the
corresponding key then that item will be activated as if the
user had clicked on it with the mouse. Only alphabetic and
<br>
numeric characters may be used as shortcut keys. The shift
state of the keyboard is ignored when testing shortcut
characters. For example: <br>
Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot; <br>
Maximize &quot;Ma&amp;ximise&quot; 100 100 <br>
EndMenu <br>
When this menu is popped up the &rsquo;x&rsquo; will be
underlined and pressing the &rsquo;x&rsquo; key will cause
the current window to be maximized. Shortcut keys are not
operative unless <br>
MENU_HOTKEYS was defined when building fvwm. If
WINDOWLIST_HOTKEYS was also defined then hot keys are
automatically added to the WindowList when it is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RandomPlacement <br>
Causes windows which would normally require user placement
to be automatically placed in ever-so-slightly random
locations. For the best of all possible worlds use both <br>
RandomPlacement and SmartPlacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SaveUnders <br>
Causes the fvwm decoration frames to request save-unders.
This can significantly improve the performance during opaque
moves but it causes a significant increase in memory <br>
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SloppyFocus <br>
This focusing mode is like focus-follows-mouse (the default)
except that the focus will not be removed from a window
until your mouse enters a new window. Exiting a window <br>
to enter the root window will leave the focus unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SmartPlacement <br>
Causes windows which would normally require user placement
to be automatically placed in a smart location - a location
in which they do not overlap any other windows on <br>
the screen. If no such position can be found user placement
or random placement will be used as a fall-back method. For
the best of all possible worlds use both Random&acirc; <br>
Placement and SmartPlacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsOnDesk windowname
desk-number <br>
This command causes windows whose name or class is
windowname to be initially placed on desktop number
desk-number. windowname should be enclosed in double quotes.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StaysOnTop windowname <br>
These windows always try to stay on top of the other
windows. This might be handy for clocks or mailboxes that
you would always like to be visible. If the window is <br>
explicitly lowered it will not try to force its way back to
the top until it is explicitly raised. windowname can be a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sticky windowname <br>
Sticky windows &quot;stick to the screen&rsquo;s
glass.&quot; That is, they don&rsquo;t move the the viewport
into the virtual desktop changes. windowname can be a
window&rsquo;s name or its class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windowname can contain the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StickyIcons <br>
Causes icons to always stick to the screen&rsquo;s glass.
That is, icons always follow you around the desktop. When a
window is de-iconified it gets un-stuck. Some people find
<br>
this a useful way of moving windows around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StubbornIcons <br>
Changes de-iconification behavior a bit. Instead of having
windows always de-iconify themselves on the current page
they de-iconify into their original position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StubbornIconPlacement <br>
When used with IconBoxes, causes icons to avoid placing
themselves underneath existing windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StubbornPlacement <br>
When using SmartPlacement, causes new windows to avoid
placing themselves over icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style windowname options <br>
This command is intended to replace the commands NoBorder,
NoTitle, StartsOnDesk, Sticky, StaysOnTop, Icon,
WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip, SuppressIcons, BoundaryWidth,
<br>
NoBoundaryWidth, StdForeColor, and StdBackColor with a
single flexible and comprehensive command. This command is
used to set attributes of a window to values other than <br>
the default or to set the window manager default styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windowname can be a
window&rsquo;s name, class, or resource string. It can
contain the wildcards * and/or ?, which are matched in the
usual Unix filename manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above list some options
are listed as style-option/opposite-style-option. The
opposite-style-option for entries that have them describes
the fvwm default behavior <br>
and can be used if you want to change the fvwm default
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icon takes an (optional)
unquoted string argument which is the icon bitmap or pixmap
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StartsOnDesk takes a numeric
argument which is the desktop number on which the window
should be initially placed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BorderWidth takes a numeric
argument which is the width of the border to place the
window if it does not have resize-handles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HandleWidth takes a numeric
argument which is the width of the border to place the
window if it does have resize-handles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button and NoButton take a
numeric argument which is the number of the title-bar button
which is to be included/omitted.</p>

Note that all properties for a window will be OR&rsquo;ed
together. In the above example &quot;FvwmPager&quot; gets
the property StaysOnTop via an exact window name match but
also gets <br>
NoHandles, Sticky, and WindowListSkip by a match to
&quot;Fvwm*&quot;. It will get NoTitle by virtue of a match
to &quot;*&quot;. If conflicting styles are specified for a
window, then the <br>
last style specified will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the NoIcon attribute is set
then the specified window will simply disappear when it is
iconified. The window can be recovered through the
window-list. If Icon is set <br>
without an argument then the NoIcon attribute is cleared but
no icon is specified. An example which allows only the
FvwmPager module icon to exist: <br>
Style &quot;*&quot; NoIcon <br>
Style &quot;Fvwm Pager&quot; Icon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SuppressIcons <br>
Prevents icon windows from being created or drawn. When used
with the window-list this provides a sort of icon
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Style command provides
another (more general) method for specifying
SuppressIcons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowFont fontname <br>
Makes fvwm use font fontname instead of &quot;fixed&quot;
for the window title bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowListSkip windowname <br>
Causes windows with the indicated name to be left out of the
window list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windowname can contain the
wildcards &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; which match window
names in the normal Unix filename matching manner. Actual

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XORvalue number <br>
Changes the value with which bits are XOR&rsquo;ed when
doing rubber-band window moving or resizing. Setting this
value is a trial-and-error process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILT IN FUNCTIONS <br>
Fvwm supports a set of built-in functions which can be bound
to keyboard or mouse buttons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beep Makes the computer
beep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CirculateDown [ name window_name
] <br>
Causes the pointer to move to the next window in the list of
windows for which CirculateSkip has not not been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional arguments are
supplied then the focus will move to the first window whose
name (or icon name or class) matches window_name. The
optional argument name is <br>
required if window_name is supplied and is enclosed in
quotes. This argument is the name which appears in menus if
the function is called from a menu, but serves no pur&acirc;
<br>
pose if the function is not called from a menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CirculateUp [ name window_name ]
<br>
Causes the pointer to move to the previous window in the
list of windows for which CirculateSkip has not not been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional arguments are
supplied then the focus will move to the first window whose
name (or icon name or class) matches window_name. The
optional argument name is <br>
required if window_name is supplied and is enclosed in
quotes. This argument is the name which appears in menus if
the function is called from a menu, but serves no pur&acirc;
<br>
pose if the function is not called from a menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example that
move the focus to an xterm window when Alt-F1 is pressed:
<br>
Key F1 A M CirculateUp &quot;whatever&quot; xterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close If the window accepts the
delete window protocol a message is sent to the window
asking it to gracefully remove itself. If the window does
not understand the delete window <br>
protocol then the window is destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CursorMove horizonal vertical
<br>
Moves the mouse pointer by horizontal pages in the X
direction and vertical pages in the Y direction. Either or
both entries may be negative. Both horizontal and vertical
<br>
values are expressed in percent of pages, so
&quot;CursorMove 100 100&quot; means to move down and left
by one full page. &quot;CursorMove 50 25&quot; means to move
left half a page and down <br>
a quarter of a page. The CursorMove function should not be
called from pop-up menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete Sends a message to a
window asking that it remove itself, frequently causing the
application to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Desk arg1 arg2 <br>
Changes to another desktop (workspace, room).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is non zero then the
next desktop number will be the current desktop number plus
arg1. Desktop numbers can be negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is zero then the new
desktop number will be arg2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of active desktops is
determined dynamically. Only desktops which contain windows
or are currently being displayed are active. Desktop numbers
must be between <br>
2147483647 and -2147483648 (is that enough?).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Destroy <br>
Destroys a window. Guaranteed to get rid of the window, but
is a fairly violent way to terminate an application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exec name command <br>
Executes command. command is not quoted but name is. name is
the name that appears in a menu, if that is where the
function is called from. name is required even if the <br>
function is not called from a menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example binds
function key F1 in the root window, with no modifiers, to
the exec function. The program rxvt will be started with an
assortment of options. <br>
Key F1 R N Exec &quot;rxvt&quot; exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg
blue -e /bin/tcsh &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Focus Moves the viewport or
window as needed to make the selected window visible. Sets
the keyboard focus to the selected window. Raises the window
if needed to make it visi&acirc; <br>
ble. Warps the pointer into the selected window in
focus-follows-mouse mode. Does not de-iconify. This function
is primarily for use with a module such as FvwmWinList.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function <br>
Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example binds
mouse button 1 to a function called
&quot;Move-or-Raise&quot;, whose definition was provided as
an example earlier in this man page. After performing <br>
this binding fvwm will execute to move-or-raise function
whenever button 1 is pressed in a window title-bar. <br>
Mouse 1 T A Function &quot;Move-or-Raise&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GotoPage x y <br>
Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y). The upper left
page is (0,0), the upper right is (N,0), where N is one less
than the current number of horizontal pages specified <br>
in the DeskTopSize command. The lower left page is (0,M),
and the lower right page is (N,M), where M is the
desktop&rsquo;s vertical size as specified in the
DeskTopSize com&acirc; <br>
mand. The GotoPage function should not be used in a pop-up
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Iconify [ value ] <br>
Iconifies a window if it is not already iconified or
de-iconifies it if it is already iconified. If the optional
argument value is positive the only iconification will be
<br>
allowed. It the optional argument is negative only
de-iconification will be allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lower Allows the user to lower a
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximize [ horizontal vertical ]
<br>
Without its optional arguments Maximize causes the window to
alternately switch from a full-screen size to its normal
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the optional arguments
horizontal and vertical, which are expressed as percentage
of a full screen, the user can control the new size of the
window. If horizontal is <br>
greater than 0 then the horizontal dimension of the window
will be set to horizontal*screen_width/100. The vertical
resizing is similar. For example, the following will <br>
add a title-bar button to switch a window to the full
vertical size of the screen: <br>
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100 <br>
The following causes windows to be stretched to the full
width: <br>
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0 <br>
This makes a window that is half the screen size in each
direction: <br>
Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50 <br>
Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the letter &quot;p&quot; is
appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or vertical),
then the scroll amount will be measured in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module name ModuleName <br>
Specifies a module which should be spawned. Modules can be
short lived transient programs or can remain for the
duration of the X session. Modules will be terminated by
<br>
the window manager prior to restarts and quits, if possible.
name is a double-qouted string which has absolutely no
significance, but must exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move [ x y ] <br>
Allows the user to move a window. If called from somewhere
in a window or its border, then that window will be moved.
If called from the root window then the user will be <br>
allowed to select the target window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional arguments x and
y are provided, then the window will be moved so that its
upper left corner is at location (x,y). The units of x and y
are percent-of- <br>
screen, unless a letter &quot;p&quot; is appended to each
coordinate, in which case the location is specified in
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
Mouse 1 T A Move <br>
Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10 <br>
Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p <br>
In the first example, an interactive move is indicated. In
the second, the window whose title-bar is selected will be
moved so that its upper left hand corner is 10 per&acirc;
<br>
cent of the screen width in from the left of the screen, and
10 percent down from the top. The final example moves the
window to coordinate (10,10) pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nop Does nothing. This is used
to insert a blank line or separator in a menu. If the menu
item specification is Nop &quot; &quot;, then a blank line
is inserted. If it looks like Nop <br>
&quot;&quot;, then a separator line is inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup This built-in has two
purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse button, and to
bind a sub-menu into a menu. The formats for the two
purposes differ slightly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To bind a previously defined
pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example binds
mouse buttons 2 and 3 to a pop-up called &quot;Window
Ops&quot;, whose definition was provided as an example
earlier in this man page. The menu will <br>
pop up if the buttons 2 or 3 are pressed in the window
frame, side-bar, or title-bar, with no modifiers (none of
shift, control, or meta). <br>
Mouse 2 FST N Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot; <br>
Mouse 3 FST N Popup &quot;Window Ops&quot; <br>
Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of the key
modifier. Pop-ups can be operated without using the mouse by
binding to keys and operating via the up arrow, down <br>
arrow, and enter keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To bind a previously defined
pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a sub-menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example defines a
sub menu, &quot;Quit-Verify&quot; and binds it into a main
menu, called &quot;Utilities&quot;: <br>
Popup &quot;Quit-Verify&quot; <br>
Title &quot;Really Quit Fvwm?&quot; <br>
Quit &quot;Yes, Really Quit&quot; <br>
Restart &quot;Restart Fvwm&quot; fvwm <br>
Nop &quot;&quot; <br>
Nop &quot;No, Don&rsquo;t Quit&quot; <br>
EndPopup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup &quot;Utilities&quot; <br>
Title &quot;Utilities&quot; <br>
Exec &quot;Xterm&quot; exec xterm &amp; <br>
Exec &quot;Rxvt&quot; exec rxvt &amp; <br>
Exec &quot;Top&quot; exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top &amp;
<br>
Exec &quot;Calculator&quot; exec xcalc &amp; <br>
Exec &quot;Xman&quot; exec xman &amp; <br>
Exec &quot;Xmag&quot; exec xmag &amp; <br>
Nop &quot;&quot; <br>
Popup &quot;Exit Fvwm&quot; Quit-Verify <br>
EndPopup <br>
Sub-menus must be defined prior to the main menu in which
they are bound. Sub-menu nesting can be arbitrarily
deep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit Exits fvwm, generally
causing X to exit too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raise Allows the user to raise a
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RaiseLower <br>
Alternately raises and lowers a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refresh <br>
Causes all windows on the screen to redraw themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resize [ x y ] <br>
Allows the user to resize a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the optional arguments x and
y are provided, then the window will be moved so that its
upper left corner is at location (x,y). The units of x and y
are percent-of- <br>
screen, unless a letter &quot;p&quot; is appended to each
coordinate, in which case the location is specified in
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart name WindowManagerName
<br>
Causes fvwm to restart itself if WindowManagerName is
&quot;fvwm&quot;, or to switch to an alternate window
manager if WindowManagerName is other than &quot;fvwm&quot;.
If the window manager <br>
is not in your default search path, then you should use the
full path name for WindowManagerName.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowManagerName is not quoted
but name is. name is the name that appears in a menu, if
that is where the function is called from. name is required
even if the function <br>
is not called from a menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command should not have a
trailing ampersand or any command line arguments and should
not make use of any environmental variables. Of the
following examples, the <br>
first three are sure losers, but the third is OK: <br>
Key F1 R N Restart &quot; &quot; fvwm &amp; <br>
Key F1 R N Restart &quot; &quot; $(HOME)/bin/fvwm <br>
Key F1 R N Restart &quot; &quot; twm -f .mystartupfile <br>
Key F1 R N Restart &quot; &quot; /home/nation/bin/fvwm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stick Makes a window sticky if
it is not already sticky, or non-sticky if it is already
sticky.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scroll horizonal vertical <br>
Scrolls the virtual desktop&rsquo;s viewport by horizontal
pages in the x-direction and vertical pages in the
y-direction. Either or both entries may be negative. Both
horizon&acirc; <br>
tal and vertical values are expressed in percent of pages,
so &quot;Scroll 100 100&quot; means to scroll down and left
by one full page. &quot;Scroll 50 25&quot; means to scroll
left half a <br>
page and down a quarter of a page. The scroll function
should not be called from pop-up menus. Normally, scrolling
stops at the edge of the desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the horizontal and vertical
percentages are multiplied by 1000 then scrolling will wrap
around at the edge of the desktop. If &quot;Scroll 100000
0&quot; is executed over and <br>
over fvwm will move to the next desktop page on each
execution and will wrap around at the edge of the desktop,
so that every page is hit in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the letter &quot;p&quot; is
appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or vertical),
then the scroll amount will be measured in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title Does nothing. This is used
to insert a title line in a popup or menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TogglePage <br>
Temporarily disables edge scrolling. Edge scrolling can be
re-enabled by calling this again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait name <br>
This built-in is intended to be used in fvwm functions only.
It causes execution of a function to pause until a new
window name name appears. Fvwm remains fully functional <br>
during a wait. This is particularly useful in the
InitFunction if you are trying to start windows on specific
desktops: <br>
Function &quot;InitFunction&quot; <br>
Exec &quot;I&quot; exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0 <br>
Wait &quot;I&quot; xterm <br>
Desk &quot;I&quot; 0 2 <br>
Exec &quot;I&quot; exec xmh -font fixed -geometry
507x750+0+0 &amp; <br>
Wait &quot;I&quot; xmh <br>
Desk &quot;I&quot; 0 0 <br>
EndFunction <br>
The above function starts an xterm on the current desk,
waits for it to map itself, then switches to desk 2 and
starts an xmh. After the xmh window appears control moves
<br>
to desk 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warp [ name window_name ] <br>
Same as CirculateDown but de-iconifies any iconified windows
as it focuses on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowsDesk new_desk <br>
Moves the selected window the the desktop specified as
new_desk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowList arg1 arg2 <br>
Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in which the title
and geometry of each of the windows currently on the desk
top are shown. The geometry of iconified windows is <br>
shown in brackets. Selecting an item from the window list
pop-up menu will cause that window to be moved onto the
desktop if it is currently not on it, will move the
desk&acirc; <br>
top viewport to the page containing the upper left hand
corner of the window, will de-iconify the window if it is
iconified, and will raise the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is an even number then
the windows will be listed using the window name (the name
that shows up in the title-bar). If it is odd then the
window&rsquo;s icon name is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is less than 2 then all
windows on all desktops (except those listed in
WindowListSkip directives) will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is 2 or 3 then only
windows on the current desktop will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If arg1 is 4 or 5 then only
windows on desktop number arg2 will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS <br>
All (I think) window manager operations can be performed
from the keyboard so mouseless operation should be possible.
In addition to scrolling around the virtual desktop by
bind&acirc; <br>
ing the Scroll built-in to appropriate keys, pop-ups, move,
resize, and most other built-ins can be bound to keys. Once
a built-in function is started the pointer is moved by <br>
using the up, down, left, and right arrows, and the action
is terminated by pressing return. Holding down the shift key
will cause the pointer movement to go in larger steps and
<br>
holding down the control key will cause the cursor movement
to go in smaller steps. Standard emacs and vi cursor
movement controls (^n, ^p, ^f, ^b, and ^j, ^k, ^h, ^l) can
be <br>
used instead of the arrow keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPLIED CONFIGURATION <br>
A sample configuration file, system.fvwmrc, is supplied with
the fvwm distribution. It is well commented and can be used
as a source of examples for fvwm configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USE ON MULTI-SCREEN DISPLAYS
<br>
If the -s command line argument is not given, fvwm will
automatically start up on every screen on the specified
display. After fvwm starts each screen is treated
independently. <br>
Restarts of fvwm need to be performed separately on each
screen. The use of EdgeScroll 0 0 is strongly recommended
for multi-screen displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to quit on each
screen to quit from the X session completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multi-screen support is only
available if fvwm is compiled with -DMULTIPLE_SCREENS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
As of fvwm 0.99 there were exactly 39.342 unidentified bugs.
Identified bugs have mostly been fixed, though. Since then
9.34 bugs have been fixed. Assuming that there are at <br>
least 10 unidentified bugs for every identified one, that
leaves us with 39.342 - 9.32 + 10 * 9.34 = 123.402
unidentified bugs. If we follow this to its logical
conclusion we <br>
will have an infinite number of unidentified bugs before the
number of bugs can start to diminish, at which point the
program will be bug-free. Since this is a computer program
<br>
infinity = 3.4028e+38 if you don&rsquo;t insist on
double-precision. At the current rate of bug discovery we
should expect to achieve this point in 3.37e+27 years. I
guess I better <br>
plan on passing this thing on to my children....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binding a key to a window
decoration but not to the window itself is discouraged
because when the key-press event finally gets to the window
it will be marked as SYNTHETIC and <br>
will be ignored by many applications.</p>
