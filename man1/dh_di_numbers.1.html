<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dh_di_numbers - install numbered scripts into package build
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dh_di_numbers [debhelper options] [dir [...] dest]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dh_di_numbers is a debhelper program that installs
directories of numbered scripts into package build
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within each directory, there
should be a &quot;_numbers&quot; file in which each line
contains at least two space-separated fields. The first
field in each line is a two-digit number, <br>
which will be prefixed to the entry name to provide ordering
within the directory; the second is the entry name, which
must correspond to a file or directory alongside the <br>
&quot;_numbers&quot; file; and the third field, if present,
is another two-digit number which identifies another entry
with the same entry name to which this entry should be a
symlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any additional directory names
specified as parameters will be installed in the package
build directory of the first package dh_di_numbers is told
to act on. By default, this is <br>
the first binary package in debian/control, but if you use
-p, -i, or -a flags, it will be the first package specified
by those flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
debian/package.di-numbers <br>
List the directories to install into each package and the
directory they should be installed to. The format is a set
of lines, where each line lists a directory or <br>
directories to install, and at the end of the line tells the
directory they should be installed in. The name of the
directories to install should be given relative to the <br>
current directory, while the installation directory is given
relative to the package build directory. You may use
wildcards in the names of the files to install (in v3 mode
<br>
and above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
dir [...] dest <br>
Lists directories to install and where to install them to.
The files will be installed into the first package
dh_di_numbers acts on.</p>
