Systems which use passwords and/or encryption keys to authenticate an
  individual's identity or protect against interception of communications
  achieve the highest degree of security when each password or key is used
  <i>only once</i>. Spies are furnished ``one-time pads'' containing pages of
  keys used to encrypt individual characters of secret messages, then discarded.
  As long as the physical security of the two copies of a one-time pad is
  assured and the keys on the pad are sufficiently random, security is absolute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Swiss banks which accept electronic payment orders use a similar mechanism to
  verify the identity of the issuer of an order. When a client authorises the
  bank to accept electronic orders, the bank delivers, by registered mail, a
  list of individual session passwords (usually numbers of 4 to 6 digits). The
  customer agrees to keep the list of passwords physically secure, and to not
  hold the bank liable if the customer allows the list to fall into unauthorised
  hands. Each time an order is given, in addition to the regular user identity
  and password, the next key from the list must be entered, and then crossed off
  by the user. The bank verifies the key against a copy of the list stored in
  their own secure computer, and only if the key matches is the order accepted.
  Multiple incorrect entries block electronic access to the customer's account
  until re-enabled by the customer providing suitable verification that an
  unauthorised access attempt did not, in fact, occur.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that even if the customer's entire communication session with the bank is
  intercepted, the eavesdropper will not be able to subsequently issue orders in
  the customer's name since the one-time password used in the compromised
  session will never be used again, and provides no usable clue as to subsequent
  one-time passwords.

<b>otp</b> creates key and password lists for verification and security purposes
  in a variety of formats. Keys can be of any length, consist of digits or
  letters (capital or lower case), and alphabetic passwords can either be
  entirely random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of English text
  (easier to remember when transcribing, but less secure).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For computer applications, for example one-time login passwords, <b>otp</b> can
  create a file containing the MD5 signature of each of the generated keys. This
  permits the computer to verify keys without the need to store the keys in
  plaintext. As noted below, this improves security only if keys are
  sufficiently long to deter exhaustive search for their signatures.

      known to both. If you're about to use up all the keys on a sheet, you can
      generate a new pair of sheets by using the last key on the sheet as the
      seed for a new one. (This is not as secure as physically exchanging a new
      pair of sheets, but if you're about to run out of keys, it's better than
      nothing.) If the <b>-r</b> option is not specified, the generator is

If you're using <b>otp</b>-generated keys for computer system passwords, it's
  wise to include one or more non-alphanumeric characters and to mix upper and
  lower case letters; this makes your password much more difficult to guess by
  exhaustive search. For example, if <b>otp</b> generated a password of
  <b>jxuc-uiuf</b> and you're using a system on which passwords are limited to 8
  characters, you might actually use <b>jXu&amp;uIU=</b> as your password.

When using one-time keys to communicate with other people, it's often a good
  idea to supply both the current session key and the key for the previous
  session. It's easy to forget to cross off a key after using it; including the
  previous key makes it easier to discover if this has happened and get back in
  sync. Similarly, in computer-based authentication systems it's a good idea to
  respond to entry of an incorrect key by prompting the user with the key from
  the last session.

Pseudorandom numbers on which entries in the pads are based are generated by the
  exclusive-or of four concurrently-running BSD <b>random</b>() generators, each
  with 256 bytes of state, independently seeded from 4 byte segments of the
  16-byte MD5 signature of the original seed.

The English-digraph frequency key generator is based on the ``mpw'' program
  developed at MIT, which was converted from Multics PL/I to C by Bill
  Sommerfeld, 4/21/86. The original PL/I version was provided by Jerry Saltzer.

The implementation of MD5 message-digest algorithm is based on a public domain
  version written by Colin Plumb in 1993. The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.
  The algorithm is described in Internet RFC 1321.
