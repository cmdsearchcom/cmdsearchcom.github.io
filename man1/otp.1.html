<p>OTP(1) General Commands Manual OTP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
otp - generate one-time key pads or password lists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
otp [ -cchars -ddigits -echars -lchars -msigfile -nnkeys
-rseed -snchars -u -wlinelen outfile ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Systems which use passwords and/or encryption keys to
authenticate an individual&rsquo;s identity or protect
against interception of communications achieve the highest
degree of secu&acirc; <br>
rity when each password or key is used only once. Spies are
furnished &lsquo;&lsquo;one-time pads&rsquo;&rsquo;
containing pages of keys used to encrypt individual
characters of secret messages, then <br>
discarded. As long as the physical security of the two
copies of a one-time pad is assured and the keys on the pad
are sufficiently random, security is absolute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Swiss banks which accept
electronic payment orders use a similar mechanism to verify
the identity of the issuer of an order. When a client
authorises the bank to accept elec&acirc; <br>
tronic orders, the bank delivers, by registered mail, a list
of individual session passwords (usually numbers of 4 to 6
digits). The customer agrees to keep the list of pass&acirc;
<br>
words physically secure, and to not hold the bank liable if
the customer allows the list to fall into unauthorised
hands. Each time an order is given, in addition to the
regular <br>
user identity and password, the next key from the list must
be entered, and then crossed off by the user. The bank
verifies the key against a copy of the list stored in their
<br>
own secure computer, and only if the key matches is the
order accepted. Multiple incorrect entries block electronic
access to the customer&rsquo;s account until re-enabled by
the cus&acirc; <br>
tomer providing suitable verification that an unauthorised
access attempt did not, in fact, occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even if the
customer&rsquo;s entire communication session with the bank
is intercepted, the eavesdropper will not be able to
subsequently issue orders in the customer&rsquo;s name <br>
since the one-time password used in the compromised session
will never be used again, and provides no usable clue as to
subsequent one-time passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otp creates key and password
lists for verification and security purposes in a variety of
formats. Keys can be of any length, consist of digits or
letters (capital or lower <br>
case), and alphabetic passwords can either be entirely
random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of
English text (easier to remember when transcribing, but less
se&acirc; <br>
cure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For computer applications, for
example one-time login passwords, otp can create a file
containing the MD5 signature of each of the generated keys.
This permits the computer to <br>
verify keys without the need to store the keys in plaintext.
As noted below, this improves security only if keys are
sufficiently long to deter exhaustive search for their
sig&acirc; <br>
natures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-cchars Generate keys consisting of chars (default 8)
capital letters. The keys consist of random letters unless
the -e option is also specified, in which case they obey the
<br>
digraph statistics of English text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ddigits Generate keys
consisting of digits (default 8) decimal digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-echars Generate keys consisting
of chars (default 8) letters which obey the digraph
statistics of English text. Such keys are usually easier to
remember when transcribing <br>
from a printed pad to a computer, but are less secure than
entirely random sequences of letters. Keys default to lower
case letters; specify the -c option along with <br>
-e if you prefer capital letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lchars Generate keys consisting
of chars (default 8) lower case letters. The keys consist of
random letters unless the -e option is also specified, in
which case they obey <br>
the digraph statistics of English text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msigfile A file sigfile is
written which contains the MD5 signature of each of the
generated keys, with each 128 bit signature written as 32
hexadecimal digits on a line by <br>
itself. Computer applications can use this signature file
for verification when the user supplies a key, rather than
storing a copy of the keys as plaintext. Note <br>
that if the MD5 signature file is compromised, short keys
are still vulnerable since their MD5 signatures can be found
by exhaustive search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nnkeys Generate nkeys keys. By
default, 50 keys are generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rseed The string seed is used
to initialise the random number generator. Every run of otp
with the same seed will produce the same output. This is
primarily useful for <br>
testing, but it also allows users at different locations to
produce identical sheets given only a seed known to both. If
you&rsquo;re about to use up all the keys on a <br>
sheet, you can generate a new pair of sheets by using the
last key on the sheet as the seed for a new one. (This is
not as secure as physically exchanging a new pair <br>
of sheets, but if you&rsquo;re about to run out of keys,
it&rsquo;s better than nothing.) If the -r option is not
specified, the generator is initialised with a value derived
<br>
from the date and time and various system environment
information; each run will produce a different sheet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-snchars Include a hyphen
separator every nchars characters in the keys. Breaking up
long keys into segments with separators makes them easier to
transcribe. By default, a <br>
hyphen is inserted every 4 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Print how-to-call
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wlinelen Format output so lines
are less than or equal to linelen characters (unless
individual keys exceed the line length). The default line
length is 79 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If no outfile is specified, output is written on standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION NOTES <br>
If you&rsquo;re using otp-generated keys for computer system
passwords, it&rsquo;s wise to include one or more
non-alphanumeric characters and to mix upper and lower case
letters; this makes <br>
your password much more difficult to guess by exhaustive
search. For example, if otp generated a password of
jxuc-uiuf and you&rsquo;re using a system on which passwords
are limited <br>
to 8 characters, you might actually use jXu&amp;uIU= as your
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using one-time keys to
communicate with other people, it&rsquo;s often a good idea
to supply both the current session key and the key for the
previous session. It&rsquo;s easy to for&acirc; <br>
get to cross off a key after using it; including the
previous key makes it easier to discover if this has
happened and get back in sync. Similarly, in computer-based
authentica&acirc; <br>
tion systems it&rsquo;s a good idea to respond to entry of
an incorrect key by prompting the user with the key from the
last session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pseudorandom numbers on which
entries in the pads are based are generated by the
exclusive-or of four concurrently-running BSD random()
generators, each with 256 bytes of state, <br>
independently seeded from 4 byte segments of the 16-byte MD5
signature of the original seed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
random(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
otp returns status 0 if processing was completed without
errors, and 2 if an error prevented generation of
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br>
The English-digraph frequency key generator is based on the
&lsquo;&lsquo;mpw&rsquo;&rsquo; program developed at MIT,
which was converted from Multics PL/I to C by Bill
Sommerfeld, 4/21/86. The origi&acirc; <br>
nal PL/I version was provided by Jerry Saltzer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation of MD5
message-digest algorithm is based on a public domain version
written by Colin Plumb in 1993. The algorithm is due to Ron
Rivest. The algorithm is de&acirc; <br>
scribed in Internet RFC 1321.</p>
