<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
To create a job is to submit an executable script to a batch
server. The batch server will be the default server unless
the -q option is specified. See discussion of <br>
PBS_DEFAULT under Environment Variables below. Typically,
the script is a shell script which will be executed by a
command shell such as sh or csh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options on the qsub command
allow the specification of attributes which affect the
behavior of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub command will pass
certain environment variables in the Variable_List attribute
of the job. These variables will be available to the job.
The value for the following <br>
variables will be taken from the environment of the qsub
command: HOME, LANG, LOGNAME, PATH, MAIL, SHELL, and TZ.
These values will be assigned to a new name which is the
cur&acirc; <br>
rent name prefixed with the string &quot;PBS_O_&quot;. For
example, the job will have access to an environment variable
named PBS_O_HOME which have the value of the variable HOME
in the <br>
qsub command environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the above, the
following environment variables will be available to the
batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_O_HOST <br>
the name of the host upon which the qsub command is
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_SERVER <br>
the hostname of the pbs_server which qsub submits the job
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_O_QUEUE <br>
the name of the original queue to which the job was
submitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_O_WORKDIR <br>
the absolute path of the current working directory of the
qsub command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_ARRAYID <br>
each member of a job array is assigned a unique identifier
(see -t)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_ENVIRONMENT <br>
set to PBS_BATCH to indicate the job is a batch job, or to
PBS_INTERACTIVE to indicate the job is a PBS interactive
job, see -I option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_JOBID <br>
the job identifier assigned to the job by the batch
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_JOBNAME <br>
the job name supplied by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_NODEFILE <br>
the name of the file contain the list of nodes assigned to
the job (for parallel and cluster systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS_QUEUE <br>
the name of the queue from which the job is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a date_time <br>
Declares the time after which the job is eligible for
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The date_time argument is in the
form: [[[[CC]YY]MM]DD]hhmm[.SS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where CC is the first two digits
of the year (the century), YY is the second two digits of
the year, MM is the two digits for the month, DD is the day
of the month, hh is <br>
the hour, mm is the minute, and the optional SS is the
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the month, MM, is not
specified, it will default to the current month if the
specified day DD, is in the future. Otherwise, the month
will be set to next month. <br>
Likewise, if the day, DD, is not specified, it will default
to today if the time hhmm is in the future. Otherwise, the
day will be set to tomorrow. For example, if you <br>
submit a job at 11:15am with a time of -a 1110, the job will
be eligible to run at 11:10am tomorrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A account_string <br>
Defines the account string associated with the job. The
account_string is an undefined string of characters and is
interpreted by the server which executes the job. See <br>
section 2.7.1 of the PBS ERS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b seconds <br>
Defines the maximum number of seconds qsub will block
attempting to contact pbs_server. If pbs_server is down, or
for a variety of communication failures, qsub will
con&acirc; <br>
tinually retry connecting to pbs_server for job submission.
This value overrides the CLIENTRETRY parameter in
torque.cfg. This is a non-portable TORQUE extension. <br>
Portability-minded users can use the PBS_CLIENTRETRY
environmental variable. A negative value is interpreted as
infinity. The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c checkpoint_options <br>
Defines the options that will apply to the job. If the job
executes upon a host which does not support checkpoint,
these options will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid checkpoint options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
No checkpointing is to be performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enabled <br>
Specify that checkpointing is allowed but must be explicitly
invoked by either the qhold or qchkpt commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shutdown <br>
Specify that checkpointing is to be done on a job at pbs_mom
shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">periodic <br>
Specify that periodic checkpointing is enabled. The default
interval is 10 minutes and can be changed by the
$checkpoint_interval option in the mom config file or by
<br>
specifying an interval when the job is submitted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interval=minutes <br>
Checkpointing is to be performed at an interval of minutes,
which is the integer number of minutes of wall time used by
the job. This value must be greater than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">depth=number <br>
Specify a number (depth) of checkpoint images to be kept in
the checkpoint directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir=path <br>
Specify a checkpoint directory (default is
/var/spool/torque/checkpoint).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C directive_prefix <br>
Defines the prefix that declares a directive to the qsub
command within the script file. See the paragraph on script
directives in the Extended Description section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -C option is presented
with a directive_prefix argument that is the null string,
qsub will not scan the script file for directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d path Defines the working
directory path to be used for the job. If the -d option is
not specified, the default working directory is the home
directory. This option sets the <br>
environment variable PBS_O_INITDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D path Defines the root
directory to be used for the job. This option sets the
environment variable PBS_O_ROOTDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e path Defines the path to be
used for the standard error stream of the batch job. The
path argument is of the form: <br>
[hostname:][path_name] <br>
where hostname is the name of a host to which the file will
be returned and path_name is the path name on that host in
the syntax recognized by POSIX. The argument will <br>
be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qsub
command will expand the path name relative to the current
working directory of the command. The com&acirc; <br>
mand will supply the name of the host upon which it is
executing for the hostname component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qsub
command will not expand the path name relative to the
current working directory of the command. On <br>
delivery of the standard error, the path name will be
expanded relative to the user&rsquo;s home directory on the
hostname system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, then the
qsub will supply the name of the host on which it is
executing for the hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, the path
will be used as specified. hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname: <br>
Where hostname specifies the name of the host that the file
should be returned to. The path will be the default file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -e option is not
specified or the path_name is not specified or is specified
and is a directory, the default file name for the standard
error stream will be used. <br>
The default name has the following form: <br>
job_name.esequence_number <br>
where job_name is the name of the job, see -N option, and
sequence_number is the job number assigned when the job is
submitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Specifies that the job is
fault tolerant. The fault_tolerant attribute will be set to
true, which indicates that the job can survive the loss of a
mom other than the <br>
&quot;mother superior&quot; mom (the first node in the exec
hosts )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specifies that a user hold be
applied to the job at submission time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Declares that the job is to
be run &quot;interactively&quot;. The job will be queued and
scheduled as any PBS batch job, but when executed, the
standard input, output, and error <br>
streams of the job are connected through qsub to the
terminal session in which qsub is running. Interactive jobs
are forced to not rerunable. See the &quot;Extended
Descrip&acirc; <br>
tion&quot; paragraph for addition information of interactive
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j join Declares if the standard
error stream of the job will be merged with the standard
output stream of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An option argument value of oe
directs that the two streams will be merged, intermixed, as
standard output. An option argument value of eo directs that
the two streams <br>
will be merged, intermixed, as standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the join argument is n or the
option is not specified, the two streams will be two
separate files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keep Defines which (if
either) of standard output or standard error will be
retained on the execution host. If set for a stream, this
option overrides the path name for that <br>
stream. If not set, neither stream is retained on the
execution host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument is either the
single letter &quot;e&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, or the letters
&quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; combined in either order. Or
the argument is the letter &quot;n&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e The standard error stream is
to retained on the execution host. The stream will be placed
in the home directory of the user under whose user id the
job executed. <br>
The file name will be the default file name given by:
job_name.esequence where job_name is the name specified for
the job, and sequence is the sequence number compo&acirc;
<br>
nent of the job identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The standard output stream is
to retained on the execution host. The stream will be placed
in the home directory of the user under whose user id the
job executed. <br>
The file name will be the default file name given by:
job_name.osequence where job_name is the name specified for
the job, and sequence is the sequence number compo&acirc;
<br>
nent of the job identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eo Both the standard output and
standard error streams will be retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oe Both the standard output and
standard error streams will be retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Neither stream is
retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l resource_list <br>
Defines the resources that are required by the job and
establishes a limit to the amount of resource that can be
consumed. If not set for a generally available resource,
<br>
such as CPU time, the limit is infinite. The resource_list
argument is of the form: <br>
resource_name[=[value]][,resource_name[=[value]],...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mail_options <br>
Defines the set of conditions under which the execution
server will send a mail message about the job. The
mail_options argument is a string which consists of either
the <br>
single character &quot;n&quot;, or one or more of the
characters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and
&quot;e&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the character &quot;n&quot;
is specified, no mail will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the letters &quot;a&quot;,
&quot;b&quot;, and &quot;e&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a mail is sent when the job is
aborted by the batch system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b mail is sent when the job
begins execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e mail is sent when the job
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -m option is not
specified, mail will be sent if the job is aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M user_list <br>
Declares the list of users to whom mail is sent by the
execution server when it sends mail about the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user_list argument is of the
form: <br>
user[@host][,user[@host],...] <br>
If unset, the list defaults to the submitting user at the
qsub host, i.e. the job owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Specifies that the job has
exclusive access to the nodes it is executing on. This is
intended to be used in conjunction with a scheduler that
enforces exclusive access, <br>
and it tells the cpuset to give the job access to all of
that node&rsquo;s resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N name Declares a name for the
job. The name specified may be up to and including 15
characters in length. It must consist of printable, non
white space characters with the <br>
first character alphabetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -N option is not
specified, the job name will be the base name of the job
script file specified on the command line. If no script file
name was specified and the <br>
script was read from the standard input, then the job name
will be set to STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o path Defines the path to be
used for the standard output stream of the batch job. The
path argument is of the form: <br>
[hostname:][path_name] <br>
where hostname is the name of a host to which the file will
be returned and path_name is the path name on that host in
the syntax recognized by POSIX. The argument will <br>
be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qsub
command will expand the path name relative to the current
working directory of the command. The com&acirc; <br>
mand will supply the name of the host upon which it is
executing for the hostname component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the qsub
command will not expand the path name relative to the
current working directory of the command. On <br>
delivery of the standard output, the path name will be
expanded relative to the user&rsquo;s home directory on the
hostname system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, then the
qsub will supply the name of the host on which it is
executing for the hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, the path
will be used as specified. hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname: <br>
Where hostname specifies the name of the host that the file
should be returned to. The path will be the default file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -o option is not
specified or the path_name is not specified or is specified
and is a directory, the default file name for the standard
output stream will be used. <br>
The default name has the following form: <br>
job_name.osequence_number <br>
where job_name is the name of the job, see -N option, and
sequence_number is the job number assigned when the job is
submitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p priority <br>
Defines the priority of the job. The priority argument must
be a integer between -1024 and +1023 inclusive. The default
is no priority which is equivalent to a priority <br>
of zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P proxy_user[:group] <br>
Proxy user for whom the job should be submitted. This option
is only available for the super user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q destination <br>
Defines the destination of the job. The destination names a
queue, a server, or a queue at a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub command will submit the
script to the server defined by the destination argument. If
the destination is a routing queue, the job may be routed by
the server to <br>
a new destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q option is not
specified, the qsub command will submit the script to the
default server. See PBS_DEFAULT under the Environment
Variables section on this man <br>
page and the PBS ERS section 2.7.4, &quot;Default
Server&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q option is specified,
it is in one of the following three forms: <br>
queue <br>
@server <br>
queue@server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the destination argument
names a queue and does not name a server, the job will be
submitted to the named queue at the default server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the destination argument
names a server and does not name a queue, the job will be
submitted to the default queue at the named server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the destination argument
names both a queue and a server, the job will be submitted
to the named queue at the named server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r y|n Declares whether the job
is rerunable. See the qrerun command. The option argument is
a single character, either y or n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the argument is
&quot;y&quot;, the job is rerunable. If the argument is
&quot;n&quot;, the job is not rerunable. The default value
is &rsquo;y&rsquo;, rerunable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S path_list <br>
Declares the shell that interprets the job script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option argument path_list is
in the form: <br>
path[@host][,path[@host],...] <br>
Only one path may be specified for any host named. Only one
path may be specified without the corresponding host name.
The path selected will be the one with the host <br>
name that matched the name of the execution host. If no
matching host is found, then the path specified without a
host will be selected, if present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -S option is not
specified, the option argument is the null string, or no
entry from the path_list is selected, the execution will use
the user&rsquo;s login shell on <br>
the execution host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t array_request <br>
Specifies the task ids of a job array. Single task arrays
are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The array_request argument is an
integer id or a range of integers. Multiple ids or id ranges
can be combined in a comma delimted list. Examples : -t
1-100 or -t <br>
1,10,50-100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional slot limit can be
specified to limit the amount of jobs that can run
concurrently in the job array. The default value is
unlimited. The slot limit must be the <br>
last thing specified in the array_request and is delimited
from the array by a percent sign (%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsub script.sh -t 0-299%5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets the slot limit to 5.
Only 5 jobs from this array can run at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: You can use qalter to
modify slot limits on an array. The server parameter
max_slot_limit can be used to set a global slot limit
policy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T script_name <br>
Allows for per job prologue and epilogue scripts. The full
script name will be prologue.[name] or epilogue.[name]. For
the job submission, only request the name of the <br>
prologue or epilogue script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: qsub -T prescript <br>
Specifies to use the script prologue.prescript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user_list <br>
Defines the user name under which the job is to run on the
execution system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user_list argument is of the
form: <br>
user[@host][,user[@host],...] <br>
Only one user name may be given per specified host. Only one
of the user specifications may be supplied without the
corresponding host specification. That user name <br>
will used for execution on any host not named in the
argument list. If unset, the user list defaults to the user
who is running qsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v variable_list <br>
Expands the list of environment variables that are exported
to the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the variables
described in the &quot;Description&quot; section above,
variable_list names environment variables from the qsub
command environment which are made <br>
available to the job when it executes. The variable_list is
a comma separated list of strings of the form variable or
variable=value. These variables and their values <br>
are passed to the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Declares that all environment
variables in the qsub command&rsquo;s environment are to be
exported to the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w path Defines the working
directory path to be used for the job. If the -w option is
not specified, the default working directory is the current
directory. This option sets <br>
the environment variable PBS_O_WORKDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W additional_attributes <br>
The -W option allows for the specification of additional job
attributes. The general syntax of the -W is in the form:
<br>
-W attr_name=attr_value[,attr_name=attr_value...] <br>
Note if white space occurs anywhere within the option
argument string or the equal sign, &quot;=&quot;, occurs
within an attribute_value string, then the string must be
enclosed <br>
with either single or double quote marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS currently supports the
following attributes within the -W option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">depend=dependency_list <br>
Defines the dependency between this and other jobs. The
dependency_list is in the form: <br>
type[:argument[:argument...][,type:argument...]. <br>
The argument is either a numeric count or a PBS job id
according to type . If argument is a count, it must be
greater than 0. If it is a job id and not fully specified
<br>
in the form seq_number.server.name, it will be expanded
according to the default server rules which apply to job IDs
on most commands. If argument is null (the preceding <br>
colon need not be specified), the dependency of the
corresponding type is cleared (unset).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">synccount:count <br>
This job is the first in a set of jobs to be executed at the
same time. Count is the number of additional jobs in the
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syncwith:jobid <br>
This job is an additional member of a set of jobs to be
executed at the same time. In the above and following
dependency types, jobid is the job identifier of <br>
the first job in the set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">after:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution at any point after
jobs jobid have started execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afterok:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution only after jobs
jobid have terminated with no errors. See the csh warning
under &quot;Extended Description&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afternotok:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution only after jobs
jobid have terminated with errors. See the csh warning under
&quot;Extended Description&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afterany:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution after jobs jobid
have terminated, with or without errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on:count <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution after count
dependencies on other jobs have been satisfied. This form is
used in conjunction with one of the before <br>
forms, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
When this job has begun execution, then jobs jobid... may
begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beforeok:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
If this job terminates execution without errors, then jobs
jobid... may begin. See the csh warning under &quot;Extended
Description&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Array Dependencies <br>
It is now possible to have a job depend on an array. These
dependencies are in the form depend=arraydep:arrayid[num].
If [num] is not present, then the dependen&acirc; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group_list=g_list <br>
Defines the group name under which the job is to run on the
execution system. The g_list argument is of the form: <br>
group[@host][,group[@host],...] <br>
Only one group name may be given per specified host. Only
one of the group specifications may be supplied without the
corresponding host specification. That group name <br>
will used for execution on any host not named in the
argument list. If not set, the group_list defaults to the
primary group of the user under which the job will be
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interactive=true <br>
If the interactive attribute is specified, the job is an
interactive job. The -I option is a alternative method of
specifying this attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stagein=file_list <br>
stageout=file_list <br>
Specifies which files are staged (copied) in before job
start or staged out after the job completes execution. On
completion of the job, all staged-in and staged-out <br>
files are removed from the execution system. The file_list
is in the form <br>
local_file@hostname:remote_file[,...] <br>
regardless of the direction of the copy. The name local_file
is the name of the file on the system where the job
executed. It may be an absolute path or relative to the <br>
home directory of the user. The name remote_file is the
destination name on the host specified by hostname. The name
may be absolute or relative to the user&rsquo;s home <br>
directory on the destination host. The use of wildcards in
the file name is not recommended. The file names map to a
remote copy program (rcp) call on the execution <br>
system in the follow manner: <br>
For stagein: rcp hostname:remote_file local_file <br>
For stageout: rcp local_file hostname:remote_file <br>
Data staging examples: <br>
-W stagein=/tmp/input.txt@headnode:/home/user/input.txt <br>
-W stageout=/tmp/output.txt@headnode:/home/user/output.txt
<br>
If TORQUE has been compiled with wordexp support, then
variables can be used in the specified paths. Currently only
$PBS_JOBID, $HOME, and $TMPDIR are supported for <br>
stagein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask=XXX <br>
Sets umask used to create stdout and stderr spool files in
pbs_mom spool directory. Values starting with 0 are treated
as octal values, otherwise the value is treated as <br>
a decimal umask value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x When running an interactive
job, the -x flag makes it so that the script won&rsquo;t be
parsed for PBS directives, but instead will be a command
that is launched once the <br>
interactive job has started. The job will terminate at the
completion of this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Enables X11 forwarding. The
DISPLAY environment variable must be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Directs that the qsub command
is not to write the job identifier assigned to the job to
the command&rsquo;s standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The qsub command accepts a script operand that is the path
to the script of the job. If the path is relative, it will
be expanded relative to the working directory of the qsub
<br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the script operand is not
provided or the operand is the single character
&quot;-&quot;, the qsub command reads the script from
standard input. When the script is being read from
Stan&acirc; <br>
dard Input, qsub will copy the file to a temporary file.
This temporary file is passed to the library interface
routine pbs_submit. The temporary file is removed by qsub
after <br>
pbs_submit returns or upon the receipt of a signal which
would cause qsub to terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD INPUT <br>
The qsub command reads the script for the job from standard
input if the script operand is missing or is the single
character &quot;-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The script file is read by the qsub command. Qsub acts upon
any directives found in the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the job is created, a copy
of the script file is made and that copy cannot be
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD OUTPUT <br>
Unless the -z option is set, the job identifier assigned to
the job will be written to standard output if the job is
successfully created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD ERROR <br>
The qsub command will write a diagnostic message to standard
error for each error occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The values of some or all of the variables in the qsub
command&rsquo;s environment are exported with the job, see
the -v and -V options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
PBS_DEFAULT defines the name of the default server.
Typically, it corresponds to the system name of the host on
which the server is running. If <br>
PBS_DEFAULT is not set, the default is defined by an
administrator established file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
PBS_DPREFIX determines the prefix string which identifies
directives in the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
PBS_CLIENTRETRY defines the maximum number of seconds qsub
will block. See the -b option above. Despite the name,
currently qsub is the only client <br>
that supports this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TORQUE.CFG <br>
The torque.cfg file, located in PBS_SERVER_HOME
(/var/spool/torque by default) controls the behavior of the
qsub command. This file contains a list of parameters and
values sepa&acirc; <br>
rated by whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QSUBSLEEP takes an integer
operand which specifies time to sleep when running qsub
command. Used to prevent users from overwhelming the
scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBMITFILTER specifies the path
to the submit filter used to pre-process job submission. The
default path is $(libexecdir)/qsub_filter, which falls back
to <br>
/usr/local/sbin/torque_submitfilter for backwards
compatibility. This torque.cfg parameter overrides this
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SERVERHOST specifies the value
for the PBS_SERVER environment variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QSUBHOST specifies the hostname
for the jobs QSUB_O_HOST variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QSUBSENDUID specifies a uid to
use for the jobs PBS_O_UID variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAUTHPATH specifies the path to
xauth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTRETRY specifies the
integer seconds between retry attempts to communicate with
pbs_server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALIDATEGROUP set this parameter
to force qsub to verify the submitter&rsquo;s group id</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTCKPT specifies the
default value for the jobs checkpoint attribute. The user
overrides this with the -c qsub option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VALIDATEPATH set this parameter
to force qsub to validate local existence of a
&quot;-d&quot; working directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RERUNNABLEBYDEFAULT this
parameter specifies if a job is rerunnable by default. The
default is true, setting this to false causes the rerunnable
attribute value to be false <br>
unless the users specifies otherwise with the -r option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAULT_TOLERANT_BY_DEFAULT this
parameter specifies if a job is fault tolerant by default.
The default value for the fault_tolerant job attribute is
false, setting this parameter <br>
to true causes the default value of the attribute to be
true. The user can specify their preference with the -f qsub
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: <br>
QSUBSLEEP 2 <br>
RERUNNABLEBYDEFAULT false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
Script Processing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A job script may consist of PBS
directives, comments and executable statements. A PBS
directive provides a way of specifying job attributes in
addition to the command line <br>
options. For example: <br>
: <br>
#PBS -N Job_name <br>
#PBS -l walltime=10:30,mem=320kb <br>
#PBS -m be <br>
# <br>
step1 arg1 arg2 <br>
step2 arg3 arg4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qsub command scans the lines
of the script file for directives. An initial line in the
script that begins with the characters &quot;#!&quot; or the
character &quot;:&quot; will be ignored and <br>
scanning will start with the next line. Scanning will
continue until the first executable line, that is a line
that is not blank, not a directive line, nor a line whose
first <br>
non white space character is &quot;#&quot;. If directives
occur on subsequent lines, they will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line in the script file will
be processed as a directive to qsub if and only if the
string of characters starting with the first non white space
character on the line and of <br>
the same length as the directive prefix matches the
directive prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the directive
line consists of the options to qsub in the same syntax as
they appear on the command line. The option character is to
be preceded with the &quot;-&quot; <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option is present in both
a directive and on the command line, that option and its
argument, if any, will be ignored in the directive. The
command line takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an option is present in a
directive and not on the command line, that option and its
argument, if any, will be processed as if it had occurred on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directive prefix string will
be determined in order of preference from:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the -C option
argument if the option is specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of the environment
variable PBS_DPREFIX if it is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The four character string
#PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -C option is found in a
directive in the script file, it will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Authorization:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the user submits a job from
a system other than the one on which the PBS Server is
running, the name under which the job is to be executed is
selected according to the rules <br>
listed under the -u option. The user submitting the job must
be authorized to run the job under the execution user name.
This authorization is provided if</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) The host on which qsub is
run is trusted by the execution host (see
/etc/hosts.equiv),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(2) The execution user has an
.rhosts file naming the submitting user on the submitting
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Shell .logout File:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following warning applies
for users of the c-shell, csh. If the job is executed under
the csh and a .logout file exists in the home directory in
which the job executes, the <br>
exit status of the job is that of the .logout script, not
the job script. This may impact any inter-job dependencies.
To preserve the job exit status, either remove the .logout
<br>
file or place the following line as the first line in the
.logout file <br>
set EXITVAL = $status <br>
and the following line as the last executable line in
.logout <br>
exit $EXITVAL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive Jobs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -I option is specified on
the command line or in a script directive, or if the
&quot;interactive&quot; job attribute declared true via the
-W option, -W interactive=true, either on <br>
the command line or in a script directive, the job is an
interactive job. The script will be processed for
directives, but will not be included with the job. When the
job <br>
begins execution, all input to the job is from the terminal
session in which qsub is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an interactive job is
submitted, the qsub command will not terminate when the job
is submitted. Qsub will remain running until the job
terminates, is aborted, or the user <br>
interrupts qsub with an SIGINT (the control-C key). If qsub
is interrupted prior to job start, it will query if the user
wishes to exit. If the user response &quot;yes&quot;, qsub
exits <br>
and the job is aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the interactive job has
started execution, input to and output from the job pass
through qsub. Keyboard generated interrupts are passed to
the job. Lines entered that <br>
begin with the tilde (&rsquo;~&rsquo;) character and contain
special sequences are escaped by qsub. The recognized escape
sequences are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~. Qsub terminates execution.
The batch job is also terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~susp Suspend the qsub program
if running under the C shell. &quot;susp&quot; is the
suspend character, usually CNTL-Z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~asusp Suspend the input half of
qsub (terminal to job), but allow output to continue to be
displayed. Only works under the C shell. &quot;asusp&quot;
is the auxiliary suspend <br>
character, usually CNTL-Y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon successful processing, the qsub exit status will be a
value of zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the qsub command fails, the
command exits with a value greater than zero.</p>
