<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfwp - X firewall proxy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfwp [option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The command line options that can be specified are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cdt num_secs <br>
Used to override the default time-to-close (604800 seconds)
for xfwp client data connections on which there is no
activity (connections over which X protocol is already <br>
being relayed by xfwp)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clt num_secs <br>
Used to override the default time-to-close (86400 seconds)
for xfwp client listen ports (ports on xfwp to which X
clients first connect when trying to reach an X server)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pdt num_secs <br>
Used to override the default time-to-close (3600 seconds)
for Proxy Manager connections on which there is no
activity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config file_name <br>
Used to specify the configuration the name of the
configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pmport port_number <br>
Used to override the default port address (4444) for proxy
manager connections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verify Used to display the
configuration file rule that was actually matched for each
service request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile file_name <br>
Used to specify the name of a file where audit information
should be logged. The format of a logged entry is: time of
day; event code; source IP address; destination IP <br>
address; and configuration rule number. The event codes are:
&quot;0&quot; for a successful connection; &quot;1&quot; if
a connection is denied because of a configuration rule; and
&quot;2&quot; if a <br>
connection is denied because of an authorization failure. If
the event code is &quot;1&quot;, and a configuration file is
used, the configuration rule number is the line number of
<br>
the configuration file where the match was made (see the
section CONFIGURATION FILE for more information). If the
event code is not &quot;1&quot;, or if no configuration file
is <br>
used, the configuration rule number is &quot;-1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-loglevel {0,1} <br>
Used to specify the amount of audit detail that should be
logged. If &quot;0&quot;, all connections are logged. If
&quot;1&quot;, only unsuccessful connections are logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max_pm_conns num_connections
<br>
Used to specify the maximum number of Proxy Manager
connections. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max_pm_conns num_connections
<br>
Used to specify the maximum number of X server connections.
The default is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The X firewall proxy (xfwp) is an application layer gateway
proxy that may be run on a network firewall host to forward
X traffic across the firewall. Used in conjunction with <br>
the X server Security extension and authorization checking,
xfwp constitutes a safe, simple, and reliable mechanism both
to hide the addresses of X servers located on the <br>
Intranet and to enforce a server connection policy. Xfwp
cannot protect against mischief originating on the Intranet;
however, when properly configured it can guarantee that <br>
only trusted clients originating on authorized external
Internet hosts will be allowed inbound access to local X
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use xfwp there must be an X
proxy manager running in the local environment which has
been configured at start-up to know the location of the
xfwp. [NOTE: There may be more <br>
than one xfwp running in a local environment; see notes
below on load balancing for further discussion.] Using the
xfindproxy utility (which relays its requests through the
<br>
proxy manager) a user asks xfwp to allocate a client listen
port for a particular X server, which is internally
associated with all future connection requests for that
server. <br>
This client listen port address is returned by the proxy
manager through xfindproxy. The xfwp hostname and port
number is then passed out-of-band (i.e., via a Web browser)
to <br>
some remote X client, which will subsequently connect to
xfwp instead of to the target X server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an X client connection
request appears on one of xfwp&rsquo;s listen ports, xfwp
connects to the X server associated with this listen port
and performs authorization checks <br>
against the server as well as against its own configurable
access control list for requesting clients. If these checks
fail, or if the requested server does not support the X <br>
Security Extension, the client connection is refused.
Otherwise, the connection is accepted and all ensuing data
between client and server is relayed by xfwp until the
client <br>
terminates the connection or, in the case of an inactive
client, until a configured timeout period is exceeded. Xfwp
is designed to block while waiting for activity on its
con&acirc; <br>
nections, thereby minimizing demand for system cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If xfwp is run without a
configuration file and thus no sitepolicy is defined, if
xfwp is using an X server where xhost + has been run to turn
off host-based authorization <br>
checks, when a client tries to connect to this X server via
xfwp, the X server will deny the connection. If xfwp does
not define a sitepolicy, host-based authorization must be
<br>
turned on for clients to connect to an X server via the
xfwp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTEROPERATION WITH IP
PACKET-FILTERING ROUTERS <br>
The whole purpose of the xfwp is to provide reliable control
over access to Intranet X servers by clients originating
outside the firewall. At the present time, such access
con&acirc; <br>
trol is typically achieved by firewall configurations
incorporating IP packet-filtering routers. Frequently, the
rules for such filters deny access to X server ports (range
6000 <br>
- 6xxx) for all Intranet host machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for xfwp to do its job,
restrictions on access for ports 6001 - 6xxx must be removed
from the rule-base of the IP packet-filtering router. [NOTE:
xfwp only assigns <br>
ports in the range beginning with 6001; access to port 6000
on all Intranet hosts may continue to be denied.] This does
not mean the Intranet firewall will be opened for
indis&acirc; <br>
criminate entry by X clients. Instead, xfwp supports a fully
configurable rule-based access control system, similar to
that of the IP packet-filter router itself. Xfwp in <br>
effect adds another level of packet-filtering control which
is fully configurable and applies specifically to X traffic.
See section entitled CONFIGURATION FILE, below, for
fur&acirc; <br>
ther details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION, SETUP AND
TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Xfwp is typically run as a background process on the
Intranet firewall host. It can be launched using any of the
command-line options described above. As noted above, xfwp
<br>
works only in conjunction with proxy manager and the
xfindproxy utility. It can also be configured to support a
user-defined X server site security policy, in which the X
server <br>
is required to indicate to xfwp whether or not it supports
the particular policy. Consult the X server man pages for
further information on these components. Xfwp diagnostics
<br>
can be turned on by compiling with the -DDEBUG switch.
Connection status can be recorded by using the -logfile and
-loglevel command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE, LOAD BALANCING AND
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT <br>
Xfwp manages four different kinds of connections: proxy
manager (PM) data, X client listen, X client data, and X
server. The sysadmin employing xfwp must understand how the
<br>
resources for each of these connection types are allocated
and reclaimed by xfwp in order to optimize the availability
of xfwp service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each connection-type has a
default number of allocation slots and a default timeout.
The number of allocation slots for PM connections and X
server connections is configurable <br>
via command line options. Connection timeouts are also
configurable via command line options. Each connection
timeout represents the period the connection will be allowed
to <br>
remain open in the absence of any activity on that
connection. Whenever there is activity on a connection, the
time-to-close is automatically reset. The default
distribution of <br>
total process connection slots across the four connection
types, as well as the choice of default timeouts for the
connection types, is governed by a number of assumptions
embed&acirc; <br>
ded in the xfwp use model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default number of PM
connections is 10 and the default duration for PM
connections is 3,600 seconds (1 hour) for each connection
after time of last activity. At start-up, <br>
xfwp listens for PM connection requests on any non-reserved
port (default of 4444 if not specified on the xfwp
command-line). The PM normally connects to xfwp only when a
call <br>
is made to the PM with xfindproxy. Thereafter, the PM
remains connected to xfwp, even after the messaging between
them has been completed, for the default connection duration
<br>
period. In some cases this may result in depletion of
available PM connection slots. If the sysadmin expects
connections to a single xfwp from many PM&rsquo;s, xfwp
should be started <br>
using the -pdt command line option, with a timeout value
reflecting the desired duration that inactive connections
will be permitted to remain open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xfwp client listeners are set up
by a call to xfindproxy and continue to listen for X client
connection requests for a default duration of 86,400 seconds
(24 hours) from the <br>
point of last activity. After this time they are
automatically closed and their fd&rsquo;s recovered for
future allocation. In addressing the question of how to
choose some alterna&acirc; <br>
tive timeout value which will guarantee the availability of
client listen ports, sysadmins should take into
consideration the expected delay between the time when the
listener <br>
was allocated (using xfindproxy) and the time when a client
actually attempts to connect to xfwp, as well the likelihood
that client listeners will be re-used after the initial <br>
client data connection is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each client connection is
allocated a default lifetime of 604,800 seconds (7 * 24
hours) from the point when it last saw activity. After this
time it is automatically closed and <br>
its fd&rsquo;s recovered for future allocation. Because
server connections are not actually established until a
connection request from a remote X client arrives at one of
the xfwp&rsquo;s <br>
client listen ports, the client data timeout applies both to
client-xfwp connections as well as to xfwp-server
connections. If the system administrator expects many client
data <br>
connections through xfwp, an overriding of the default
timeout should be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
The xfwp configuration file resides on the xfwp host machine
and is used to determine whether X client data connection
requests will be permitted or denied. The path to the file
<br>
is specified at start-up time. If no configuration file is
specified, all X client data connection requests routed
through xfwp will be by default permitted, assuming that
other <br>
X server authorization checks are successful. If a
configuration file is supplied but none of its entries
matches the connection request then the connection is by
default <br>
denied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a line in the configuration
file begins with the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character or a new-line
character, the line is ignored and the evaluator will skip
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file supports
two entirely independent authorization checks: one which is
performed by xfwp itself, and a second which is the result
of xfwp&rsquo;s querying the <br>
target X server. For the first of these, the configuration
file employs a syntax and semantic similar to that of IP
packet-filtering routers. It contains zero or more source-
<br>
destination rules of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{permit | deny} &lt;src&gt;
&lt;src mask&gt; [&lt;dest&gt; &lt;dest mask&gt;
[&lt;operator&gt; &lt;service&gt;]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permit/deny the keywords
&lsquo;&lsquo;permit&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;deny&rsquo;&rsquo; indicate whether the rule
will enable or disable access, respectively</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src the IP address against the
host who originated the connection request will be matched,
expressed in IP format (x.x.x.x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src mask a subnet mask, also in
IP format, for further qualifying the source mask. Bits set
in the mask indicate bits of the incoming address to be
ignored when comparing to <br>
the specified src</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dest the IP address against
which the destination of the incoming connection request
(i.e. the host IP of the X server to which the incoming
client is attempting to con&acirc; <br>
nect) will be matched</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dest mask a subnet mask, also in
IP format, for further qualifying the destination mask. Bits
set in the mask indicate bits of the destination address to
be ignored when com&acirc; <br>
paring to the specified dest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">operator always
&lsquo;&lsquo;eq&rsquo;&rsquo; (if the service field is not
NULL)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">service one of the following
three strings: &lsquo;&lsquo;pm&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;fp&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;cd&rsquo;&rsquo;, corresponding to proxy
manager, xfindproxy, or client data, respectively</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the second type of
authorization check, the configuration file contains zero or
more site policy rules of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{require | disallow} sitepolicy
&lt;site_policy&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">require specifies that the X
server must be configured with at least one of the
corresponding site policies, else it must refuse the
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disallow specifies that the X
server must not be configured with any of the corresponding
site policies, else it must refuse the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sitepolicy a required
keyword</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;site_policy&gt; <br>
specifies the policy string. The string may contain any
combination of alphanumeric characters subject only to
interpretation by the target X server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RULES FOR EVALUATING THE XFWP
CONFIGURATION FILE ENTRIES <br>
For the first type of configurable authorization checking,
access can be permitted or denied for each connection type
based upon source and, optionally, destination and service.
<br>
Each file entry must at a minimum specify the keyword
&lsquo;&lsquo;permit&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;deny&rsquo;&rsquo; and the two source fields.
The destination and service fields can be used to provide
finer-grained <br>
access control if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm for rule-matching
is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while (more entries to check)
<br>
{ <br>
if ((&lt;originator IP&gt; AND (NOT &lt;src mask&gt;)) ==
src) <br>
[if ((&lt;dest X server IP&gt; AND (NOT &lt;dest mask&gt;))
== dest)] <br>
[if (service fields present and matching)] <br>
do either permit or deny connection depending on keyword
<br>
else <br>
continue <br>
} <br>
if (no rule matches) <br>
deny connection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a permit or deny rule does
not specify a service and operation, then the rule applies
to all services. If a configuration file is specified and it
contains at least one valid <br>
deny or permit rule, then a host that is not explicitly
permitted will be denied a connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Site policy configuration
checking constitutes a separate (and X server only)
authorization check on incoming connection requests. Any
number of require or disallow rules may be <br>
specified, but all rules must be of the same type; that is,
a single rule file cannot have both
&lsquo;&lsquo;require&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;disallow&rsquo;&rsquo; keywords. The algorithm
for this check is as fol&acirc; <br>
lows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (X server recognizes any of
the site policy strings) <br>
if (keyword == require) <br>
permit connection <br>
else <br>
deny connection <br>
else <br>
if (keyword == require) <br>
deny connection <br>
else <br>
permit connection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The site policy check is
performed by xfwp only if the source-destination rules
permit the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># if and only if server supports
one of these policies then authorize <br>
# connections, but still subject to applicable rule matches
<br>
# <br>
require sitepolicy policy1 <br>
require sitepolicy policy2 <br>
# <br>
# deny pm connections originating on 8.7.6.5 [NOTE: If pm
service <br>
# is explicitly qualified, line must include destination
fields as <br>
# shown.] <br>
# <br>
deny 8.7.6.5 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 eq pm <br>
# <br>
# permit xfindproxy X server connects to anywhere [NOTE: If
<br>
# fp service is explicitly qualified, line must include
source fields <br>
# as shown.] <br>
# <br>
permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 eq fp
<br>
# <br>
# permit all connection types originating from the 192.0.0.0
<br>
# IP domain only <br>
# <br>
permit 192.0.0.0 0.255.255.255</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Care should be taken that
source-destination rules are written in the correct order,
as the first matching rule will be applied. In addition to
parser syntax checking, a special <br>
command-line switch (-verify) has been provided to assist
the sysadmin in determining which rule was actually
matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Xfwp should check server site policy and security extension
before allocating a listen port.</p>
