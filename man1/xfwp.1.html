The X firewall proxy (xfwp) is an application layer gateway proxy that may be
  run on a network firewall host to forward X traffic across the firewall. Used
  in conjunction with the X server Security extension and authorization
  checking, xfwp constitutes a safe, simple, and reliable mechanism both to hide
  the addresses of X servers located on the Intranet and to enforce a server
  connection policy. Xfwp cannot protect against mischief originating on the
  Intranet; however, when properly configured it can guarantee that only trusted
  clients originating on authorized external Internet hosts will be allowed
  inbound access to local X servers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To use xfwp there must be an X proxy manager running in the local environment
  which has been configured at start-up to know the location of the xfwp. [NOTE:
  There may be more than one xfwp running in a local environment; see notes
  below on load balancing for further discussion.] Using the xfindproxy utility
  (which relays its requests through the proxy manager) a user asks xfwp to
  allocate a client listen port for a particular X server, which is internally
  associated with all future connection requests for that server. This client
  listen port address is returned by the proxy manager through xfindproxy. The
  xfwp hostname and port number is then passed out-of-band (i.e., via a Web
  browser) to some remote X client, which will subsequently connect to xfwp
  instead of to the target X server.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When an X client connection request appears on one of xfwp's listen ports, xfwp
  connects to the X server associated with this listen port and performs
  authorization checks against the server as well as against its own
  configurable access control list for requesting clients. If these checks fail,
  or if the requested server does not support the X Security Extension, the
  client connection is refused. Otherwise, the connection is accepted and all
  ensuing data between client and server is relayed by xfwp until the client
  terminates the connection or, in the case of an inactive client, until a
  configured timeout period is exceeded. Xfwp is designed to block while waiting
  for activity on its connections, thereby minimizing demand for system cycles.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If xfwp is run without a configuration file and thus no sitepolicy is defined,
  if xfwp is using an X server where xhost + has been run to turn off host-based
  authorization checks, when a client tries to connect to this X server via
  xfwp, the X server will deny the connection. If xfwp does not define a
  sitepolicy, host-based authorization must be turned on for clients to connect
  to an X server via the xfwp.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTEROPERATION_WITH_IP_PACKET-FILTERING_ROUTERS"><a class="selflink" href="#INTEROPERATION_WITH_IP_PACKET-FILTERING_ROUTERS">INTEROPERATION
  WITH IP PACKET-FILTERING ROUTERS</a></h1>
The whole purpose of the xfwp is to provide reliable control over access to
  Intranet X servers by clients originating outside the firewall. At the present
  time, such access control is typically achieved by firewall configurations
  incorporating IP packet-filtering routers. Frequently, the rules for such
  filters deny access to X server ports (range 6000 - 6xxx) for all Intranet
  host machines.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In order for xfwp to do its job, restrictions on access for ports 6001 - 6xxx
  must be removed from the rule-base of the IP packet-filtering router. [NOTE:
  xfwp only assigns ports in the range beginning with 6001; access to port 6000
  on all Intranet hosts may continue to be denied.] This does not mean the
  Intranet firewall will be opened for indiscriminate entry by X clients.
  Instead, xfwp supports a fully configurable rule-based access control system,
  similar to that of the IP packet-filter router itself. Xfwp in effect adds
  another level of packet-filtering control which is fully configurable and
  applies specifically to X traffic. See section entitled CONFIGURATION FILE,
  below, for further details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INSTALLATION,_SETUP_AND_TROUBLESHOOTING"><a class="selflink" href="#INSTALLATION,_SETUP_AND_TROUBLESHOOTING">INSTALLATION,
  SETUP AND TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
Xfwp is typically run as a background process on the Intranet firewall host. It
  can be launched using any of the command-line options described above. As
  noted above, xfwp works only in conjunction with proxy manager and the
  xfindproxy utility. It can also be configured to support a user-defined X
  server site security policy, in which the X server is required to indicate to
  xfwp whether or not it supports the particular policy. Consult the X server
  man pages for further information on these components. Xfwp diagnostics can be
  turned on by compiling with the -DDEBUG switch. Connection status can be
  recorded by using the -logfile and -loglevel command line options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE,_LOAD_BALANCING_AND_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#PERFORMANCE,_LOAD_BALANCING_AND_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT">PERFORMANCE,
  LOAD BALANCING AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</a></h1>
Xfwp manages four different kinds of connections: proxy manager (PM) data, X
  client listen, X client data, and X server. The sysadmin employing xfwp must
  understand how the resources for each of these connection types are allocated
  and reclaimed by xfwp in order to optimize the availability of xfwp service.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each connection-type has a default number of allocation slots and a default
  timeout. The number of allocation slots for PM connections and X server
  connections is configurable via command line options. Connection timeouts are
  also configurable via command line options. Each connection timeout represents
  the period the connection will be allowed to remain open in the absence of any
  activity on that connection. Whenever there is activity on a connection, the
  time-to-close is automatically reset. The default distribution of total
  process connection slots across the four connection types, as well as the
  choice of default timeouts for the connection types, is governed by a number
  of assumptions embedded in the xfwp use model.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default number of PM connections is 10 and the default duration for PM
  connections is 3,600 seconds (1 hour) for each connection after time of last
  activity. At start-up, xfwp listens for PM connection requests on any
  non-reserved port (default of 4444 if not specified on the xfwp command-line).
  The PM normally connects to xfwp only when a call is made to the PM with
  xfindproxy. Thereafter, the PM remains connected to xfwp, even after the
  messaging between them has been completed, for the default connection duration
  period. In some cases this may result in depletion of available PM connection
  slots. If the sysadmin expects connections to a single xfwp from many PM's,
  xfwp should be started using the -pdt command line option, with a timeout
  value reflecting the desired duration that inactive connections will be
  permitted to remain open.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Xfwp client listeners are set up by a call to xfindproxy and continue to listen
  for X client connection requests for a default duration of 86,400 seconds (24
  hours) from the point of last activity. After this time they are automatically
  closed and their fd's recovered for future allocation. In addressing the
  question of how to choose some alternative timeout value which will guarantee
  the availability of client listen ports, sysadmins should take into
  consideration the expected delay between the time when the listener was
  allocated (using xfindproxy) and the time when a client actually attempts to
  connect to xfwp, as well the likelihood that client listeners will be re-used
  after the initial client data connection is closed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each client connection is allocated a default lifetime of 604,800 seconds (7 *
  24 hours) from the point when it last saw activity. After this time it is
  automatically closed and its fd's recovered for future allocation. Because
  server connections are not actually established until a connection request
  from a remote X client arrives at one of the xfwp's client listen ports, the
  client data timeout applies both to client-xfwp connections as well as to
  xfwp-server connections. If the system administrator expects many client data
  connections through xfwp, an overriding of the default timeout should be
  considered.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE">CONFIGURATION
  FILE</a></h1>
The xfwp configuration file resides on the xfwp host machine and is used to
  determine whether X client data connection requests will be permitted or
  denied. The path to the file is specified at start-up time. If no
  configuration file is specified, all X client data connection requests routed
  through xfwp will be by default permitted, assuming that other X server
  authorization checks are successful. If a configuration file is supplied but
  none of its entries matches the connection request then the connection is by
  default denied.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a line in the configuration file begins with the '#' character or a new-line
  character, the line is ignored and the evaluator will skip the line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The configuration file supports two entirely independent authorization checks:
  one which is performed by xfwp itself, and a second which is the result of
  xfwp's querying the target X server. For the first of these, the configuration
  file employs a syntax and semantic similar to that of IP packet-filtering
  routers. It contains zero or more source-destination rules of the following
  form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
{permit | deny} &lt;src&gt; &lt;src mask&gt; [&lt;dest&gt; &lt;dest mask&gt;
  [&lt;operator&gt; &lt;service&gt;]]

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt class="It-tag">dest</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the IP address against which the destination of the

  <dt class="It-tag">dest mask</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a subnet mask, also in IP format, for further qualifying

      ``cd'', corresponding to proxy manager, xfindproxy, or client data,

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the second type of authorization check, the configuration file contains zero
  or more site policy rules of the following form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
{require | disallow} sitepolicy &lt;site_policy&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">disallow</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">specifies that the X server <i>must not</i> be configured

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RULES_FOR_EVALUATING_THE_XFWP_CONFIGURATION_FILE_ENTRIES"><a class="selflink" href="#RULES_FOR_EVALUATING_THE_XFWP_CONFIGURATION_FILE_ENTRIES">RULES
  FOR EVALUATING THE XFWP CONFIGURATION FILE ENTRIES</a></h1>
For the first type of configurable authorization checking, access can be
  permitted or denied for each connection type based upon source and,
  optionally, destination and service. Each file entry must at a minimum specify
  the keyword ``permit'' or ``deny'' and the two source fields. The destination
  and service fields can be used to provide finer-grained access control if
  desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The algorithm for rule-matching is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 3.00ex;">
<br/>
 while (more entries to check)
<br/>
 {
<br/>
 if ((&lt;originator IP&gt; AND (NOT &lt;src mask&gt;)) == src)
<br/>
 [if ((&lt;dest X server IP&gt; AND (NOT &lt;dest mask&gt;)) == dest)]
<br/>
 [if (service fields present and matching)]
<br/>
 do either permit or deny connection depending on keyword
<br/>
 else
<br/>
 continue
<br/>
 }
<br/>
 if (no rule matches)
<br/>
 deny connection</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a permit or deny rule does not specify a service and operation, then the rule
  applies to all services. If a configuration file is specified and it contains
  at least one valid deny or permit rule, then a host that is not explicitly
  permitted will be denied a connection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Site policy configuration checking constitutes a separate (and X server only)
  authorization check on incoming connection requests. Any number of require or
  disallow rules may be specified, but all rules must be of the same type; that
  is, a single rule file cannot have both ``require'' and ``disallow'' keywords.
  The algorithm for this check is as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 3.00ex;">
<br/>
 if (X server recognizes any of the site policy strings)
<br/>
 if (keyword == require)
<br/>
 permit connection
<br/>
 else
<br/>
 deny connection
<br/>
 else
<br/>
 if (keyword == require)
<br/>
 deny connection
<br/>
 else
<br/>
 permit connection</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The site policy check is performed by xfwp only if the source-destination rules
  permit the connection.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<pre>
# if and only if server supports one of these policies then authorize 
# connections, but still subject to applicable rule matches
#
require sitepolicy policy1
require sitepolicy policy2
#
# deny pm connections originating on 8.7.6.5 [NOTE:  If pm service
# is explicitly qualified, line must include destination fields as
# shown.]
#
deny  8.7.6.5  0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255  eq  pm
#
# permit xfindproxy X server connects to anywhere [NOTE:  If
# fp service is explicitly qualified, line must include source fields
# as shown.]
#
permit  0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255   0.0.0.0  255.255.255.255  eq  fp 
#
# permit all connection types originating from the 192.0.0.0 
# IP domain only 
#
permit  192.0.0.0   0.255.255.255 
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Care should be taken that source-destination rules are written in the correct
  order, as the first matching rule will be applied. In addition to parser
  syntax checking, a special command-line switch (-verify) has been provided to
  assist the sysadmin in determining which rule was actually matched.
