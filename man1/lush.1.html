<p>LUSH(1) Lisp Universal Shell LUSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lush - Lisp Universal Shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lush [@initfile][lushfile...args...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lush starts the Lisp Universal Shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lush is an object-oriented Lisp
interpreter/compiler with features designed to please people
who want to prototype large numerical applications. Lush
includes an extensive <br>
library of vector/matrix/tensor manipulation, a set of
graphic functions, a simple GUI toolkit, and interfaces to
various libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, the SGI Multimedia
<br>
library (video/audio grabbing), the Numerical Recipes
library, and others. Lush is an ideal frontend script
language for programming projects written in C or other
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING LUSH INTERACTIVELY <br>
Online help on the standard library is available by typing
(helptool) at the Lush prompt. You can leave Lush by typing
CTRL-D at the prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, Lush loads various
libraries from the sys and lsh directories, as well as a
.lushrc file in the user&rsquo;s home directory. It is
recommended to add a directory lsh in <br>
your home directory and to include the line (addpath
&quot;your-home-directory/lsh&quot;) to your .lushrc so that
your own Lush programs are found in Lush&rsquo;s search
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is quite convenient to run
Lush from within Emacs, which can be done by creating
somewhere in your path a symbolic link named
&quot;lisp&quot; to the lush executable. Then, type ESC-X
<br>
run-lisp in Emacs. It is probably a good idea to add the
following line in your .emacs so Emacs switches to Lisp mode
when editing a Lush file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(setq auto-mode-alist (append
(cons &quot;.lsh$&quot; &rsquo;lisp-mode)
auto-mode-alist))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING NON-INTERACTIVE LUSH
SCRIPTS <br>
In Unix, Lush can be used to write scripts that can be
called from a shell prompt (like shell or Perl scripts). A
list of command-line arguments are put in the argv
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example: create a
file (say &quot;capargs&quot;) with the following content
(replacing the first line by the path to your lush
executable):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
exec lush &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot; <br>
!# <br>
(printf &quot;capitalizing the arguments:0) <br>
(each ((arg argv)) (printf &quot;%s %s0 arg (upcase
arg)))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then, make capargs executable:
chmod a+x capargs. You can now invoke capargs at the shell
prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% capargs asd gfdf <br>
capitalizing the arguments: <br>
capargs CAPARGS <br>
asd ASD <br>
gfdf GFDF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/share/lush <br>
The top of the Lush directory structure <br>
/usr/share/lush/src <br>
Source code of the interpreter <br>
/usr/share/lush/sys <br>
Core libraries (lush sources) without which Lush cannot run.
A minimal/customized version of Lush needs only that
directory to run. <br>
/usr/share/lush/etc <br>
Various shell scripts and utilities <br>
/usr/share/lush/include <br>
/usr/share/lush/lsh <br>
Library files (lush sources) that are part of the standard
distribution. Although they are not required for Lush to
run, life would really suck without them. <br>
/usr/share/lush/packages <br>
Library files (lush sources) for special applications or
platforms, or programs that have been contributed by users
and cannot be assumed to be present/working in all <br>
installations of Lush. <br>
/usr/share/lush/local <br>
Lush libraries that are specific to your site. <br>
~/.lushrc <br>
Personal Lush initialization file <br>
~/.lush <br>
Personal Lush directory: on-demand built libraries, etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Lush is the direct descendant of the SN system. SN was first
developed as a neural network simulator with a Lisp-like
scripting language. The project was started in 1987 by Leon
<br>
Bottou and Yann LeCun, and rewritten several times since
then. SN was used at AT&amp;T for many research projects in
machine learning, pattern recognition, and image processing.
Its <br>
various incarnations were used at AT&amp;T Bell Labs,
AT&amp;T Labs, the Salk Institute, the University of
Toronto, Universite of Montreal, UC Berkeley, and many other
research institu&acirc; <br>
tions. The commercial versions of SN were used in several
large companies as a prototyping tool: Thomson-CSF,
ONERA.</p>
