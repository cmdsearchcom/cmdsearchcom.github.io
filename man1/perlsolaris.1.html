<p>PERLSOLARIS(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLSOLARIS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlsolaris - Perl version 5 on Solaris systems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes various features of Sun&rsquo;s
Solaris operating system that will affect how Perl version 5
(hereafter just perl) is compiled and/or runs. Some issues
<br>
relating to the older SunOS 4.x are also discussed, though
they may be out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the most part, everything
should just work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Solaris 8,
perl5.00503 (or higher) is supplied with the operating
system, so you might not even need to build a newer version
of perl at all. The Sun-supplied <br>
version is installed in /usr/perl5 with /usr/bin/perl
pointing to /usr/perl5/bin/perl. Do not disturb that
installation unless you really know what you are doing. If
you remove <br>
the perl supplied with the OS, you will render some bits of
your system inoperable. If you wish to install a newer
version of perl, install it under a different prefix from
<br>
/usr/perl5. Common prefixes to use are /usr/local and
/opt/perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may wish to put your version
of perl in the PATH of all users by changing the link
/usr/bin/perl. This is probably OK, as most perl scripts
shipped with Solaris use an <br>
explicit path. (There are a few exceptions, such as
/usr/bin/rpm2cpio and /etc/rcm/scripts/README, but these are
also sufficiently generic that the actual version of perl
<br>
probably doesn&rsquo;t matter too much.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris ships with a range of
Solaris-specific modules. If you choose to install your own
version of perl you will find the source of many of these
modules is available on CPAN <br>
under the Sun::Solaris:: namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris may include two versions
of perl, e.g. Solaris 9 includes both 5.005_03 and 5.6.1.
This is to provide stability across Solaris releases, in
cases where a later perl <br>
version has incompatibilities with the version included in
the preceding Solaris release. The default perl version will
always be the most recent, and in general the old version
<br>
will only be retained for one Solaris release. Note also
that the default perl will NOT be configured to search for
modules in the older version, again due to <br>
compatibility/stability concerns. As a consequence if you
upgrade Solaris, you will have to rebuild/reinstall any
additional CPAN modules that you installed for the previous
<br>
Solaris version. See the CPAN manpage under
&rsquo;autobundle&rsquo; for a quick way of doing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an interim measure, you may
either change the #! line of your scripts to specifically
refer to the old perl version, e.g. on Solaris 9 use
#!/usr/perl5/5.00503/bin/perl to use <br>
the perl version that was the default for Solaris 8, or if
you have a large number of scripts it may be more convenient
to make the old version of perl the default on your <br>
system. You can do this by changing the appropriate symlinks
under /usr/perl5 as follows (example for Solaris 9):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd /usr/perl5 <br>
# rm bin man pod <br>
# ln -s ./5.00503/bin <br>
# ln -s ./5.00503/man <br>
# ln -s ./5.00503/lib/pod <br>
# rm /usr/bin/perl <br>
# ln -s ../perl5/5.00503/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases this should only
be considered to be a temporary measure - you should upgrade
to the later version of perl as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that the perl
command-line utilities (e.g. perldoc) and any that are added
by modules that you install will be under /usr/perl5/bin, so
that directory should be added <br>
to your PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris Version Numbers. <br>
For consistency with common usage, perl&rsquo;s Configure
script performs some minor manipulations on the operating
system name and version number as reported by uname.
Here&rsquo;s a <br>
partial translation table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun: perl&rsquo;s Configure:
<br>
uname uname -r Name osname osvers <br>
SunOS 4.1.3 Solaris 1.1 sunos 4.1.3 <br>
SunOS 5.6 Solaris 2.6 solaris 2.6 <br>
SunOS 5.8 Solaris 8 solaris 2.8 <br>
SunOS 5.9 Solaris 9 solaris 2.9 <br>
SunOS 5.10 Solaris 10 solaris 2.10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complete table can be found
in the Sun Managers&rsquo; FAQ
&lt;ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/jdd/sunmanagers/faq&gt;
under &quot;9.1) Which Sun models run which versions of
SunOS?&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>
There are many, many sources for Solaris information. A few
of the important ones for perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris FAQ <br>
The Solaris FAQ is available at
&lt;http://www.science.uva.nl/pub/solaris/solaris2.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Sun Managers&rsquo; FAQ is
available at
&lt;ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/jdd/sunmanagers/faq&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precompiled Binaries <br>
Precompiled binaries, links to many sites, and much, much
more are available at &lt;http://www.sunfreeware.com/&gt;
and &lt;http://www.blastwave.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris Documentation <br>
All Solaris documentation is available on-line at
&lt;http://docs.sun.com/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING UP <br>
File Extraction Problems on Solaris. <br>
Be sure to use a tar program compiled under Solaris (not
SunOS 4.x) to extract the perl-5.x.x.tar.gz file. Do not use
GNU tar compiled for SunOS4 on Solaris. (GNU tar compiled
<br>
for Solaris should be fine.) When you run SunOS4 binaries on
Solaris, the run-time system magically alters pathnames
matching m#lib/locale# so that when tar tries to create <br>
lib/locale.pm, a file named lib/oldlocale.pm gets created
instead. If you found this advice too late and used a
SunOS4-compiled tar anyway, you must find the incorrectly
renamed <br>
file and move it back to lib/locale.pm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiler and Related Tools on
Solaris. <br>
You must use an ANSI C compiler to build perl. Perl can be
compiled with either Sun&rsquo;s add-on C compiler or with
gcc. The C compiler that shipped with SunOS4 will not
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Include /usr/ccs/bin/ in your
PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several tools needed to build
perl are located in /usr/ccs/bin/: ar, as, ld, and make.
Make sure that /usr/ccs/bin/ is in your PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On all the released versions of
Solaris (8, 9 and 10) you need to make sure the following
packages are installed (this info is extracted from the
Solaris FAQ):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for tools (sccs, lex, yacc,
make, nm, truss, ld, as): SUNWbtool, SUNWsprot, SUNWtoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for libraries &amp; headers:
SUNWhea, SUNWarc, SUNWlibm, SUNWlibms, SUNWdfbh, SUNWcg6h,
SUNWxwinc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionaly, on Solaris 8 and 9
you also need:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for 64 bit development:
SUNWarcx, SUNWbtoox, SUNWdplx, SUNWscpux, SUNWsprox,
SUNWtoox, SUNWlmsx, SUNWlmx, SUNWlibCx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And only on Solaris 8 you also
need:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for libraries &amp; headers:
SUNWolinc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are in doubt which
package contains a file you are missing, try to find an
installation that has that file. Then do a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ grep /my/missing/file
/var/sadm/install/contents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will display a line like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/include/sys/errno.h f none
0644 root bin 7471 37605 956241356 SUNWhea</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last item listed (SUNWhea in
this example) is the package you need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid /usr/ucb/cc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t need to have
/usr/ucb/ in your PATH to build perl. If you want /usr/ucb/
in your PATH anyway, make sure that /usr/ucb/ is NOT in your
PATH before the directory <br>
containing the right C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun&rsquo;s C Compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use Sun&rsquo;s C
compiler, make sure the correct directory (usually
/opt/SUNWspro/bin/) is in your PATH (before /usr/ucb/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use gcc, make sure your
installation is recent and complete. perl versions since
5.6.0 build fine with gcc &gt; 2.8.1 on Solaris &gt;=
2.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must Configure perl with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sh Configure -Dcc=gcc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t, you may
experience strange build errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have updated your Solaris
version, you may also have to update your gcc. For example,
if you are running Solaris 2.6 and your gcc is installed
under /usr/local, check in <br>
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib and make sure you have the
appropriate directory, sparc-sun-solaris2.6/ or
i386-pc-solaris2.6/. If gcc&rsquo;s directory is for a
different version of Solaris <br>
than you are running, then you will need to rebuild gcc for
your new version of Solaris.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get a precompiled
version of gcc from &lt;http://www.sunfreeware.com/&gt; or
&lt;http://www.blastwave.org/&gt;. Make sure you pick up the
package for your Solaris release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to use gcc to build
add-on modules for use with the perl shipped with Solaris,
you should use the Solaris::PerlGcc module which is
available from CPAN. The perl <br>
shipped with Solaris is configured and built with the Sun
compilers, and the compiler configuration information stored
in Config.pm is therefore only relevant to the Sun <br>
compilers. The Solaris:PerlGcc module contains a replacement
Config.pm that is correct for gcc - see the module for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU as and GNU ld</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following information
applies to gcc version 2. Volunteers to update it as
appropriately for gcc version 3 would be appreciated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The versions of as and ld
supplied with Solaris work fine for building perl. There is
normally no need to install the GNU versions to compile
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you decide to ignore this
advice and use the GNU versions anyway, then be sure that
they are relatively recent. Versions newer than 2.7 are
apparently new enough. Older <br>
versions may have trouble with dynamic loading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to use GNU ld, then
you need to pass it the -Wl,-E flag. The hints/solaris_2.sh
file tries to do this automatically by setting the following
Configure variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccdlflags=&quot;$ccdlflags
-Wl,-E&quot; <br>
lddlflags=&quot;$lddlflags -Wl,-E -G&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, over the years, changes
in gcc, GNU ld, and Solaris ld have made it difficult to
automatically detect which ld ultimately gets called. You
may have to manually edit <br>
config.sh and add the -Wl,-E flags yourself, or else run
Configure interactively and add the flags at the appropriate
prompts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your gcc is configured to use
GNU as and ld but you want to use the Solaris ones instead
to build perl, then you&rsquo;ll need to add -B/usr/ccs/bin/
to the gcc command line. One <br>
convenient way to do that is with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sh Configure -Dcc=&rsquo;gcc
-B/usr/ccs/bin/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the trailing slash is
required. This will result in some harmless warnings as
Configure is run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc: file path prefix
&lsquo;/usr/ccs/bin/&rsquo; never used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These messages may safely be
ignored. (Note that for a SunOS4 system, you must use
-B/bin/ instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can use the
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX environment variable to ensure that
Sun&rsquo;s as and ld are used. Consult your gcc
documentation for further information on the -B <br>
option and the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun and GNU make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The make under /usr/ccs/bin
works fine for building perl. If you have the Sun C
compilers, you will also have a parallel version of make
(dmake). This works fine to build perl, <br>
but can sometimes cause problems when running &rsquo;make
test&rsquo; due to underspecified dependencies between the
different test harness files. The same problem can also
affect the <br>
building of some add-on modules, so in those cases either
specify &rsquo;-m serial&rsquo; on the dmake command line,
or use /usr/ccs/bin/make instead. If you wish to use GNU
make, be sure <br>
that the set-group-id bit is not set. If it is, then arrange
your PATH so that /usr/ccs/bin/make is before GNU make or
else have the system administrator disable the set-group-
<br>
id bit on GNU make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid libucb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris provides some
BSD-compatibility functions in /usr/ucblib/libucb.a. Perl
will not build and run correctly if linked against -lucb
since it contains routines that are <br>
incompatible with the standard Solaris libc. Normally this
is not a problem since the solaris hints file prevents
Configure from even looking in /usr/ucblib for libraries,
and <br>
also explicitly omits -lucb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment for Compiling perl
on Solaris <br>
PATH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure your PATH includes the
compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/ if you&rsquo;re using
Sun&rsquo;s compiler) as well as /usr/ccs/bin/ to pick up
the other development tools (such as make, ar, <br>
as, and ld). Make sure your path either doesn&rsquo;t
include /usr/ucb or that it includes it after the compiler
and compiler tools and other standard Solaris directories.
You <br>
definitely don&rsquo;t want /usr/ucb/cc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable set, be sure that it does NOT include
/lib or /usr/lib. If you will be building extensions that
call third-party shared <br>
libraries (e.g. Berkeley DB) then make sure that your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes the directory
with that library (e.g. /usr/local/lib).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you get an error message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dlopen: stub interception
failed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it is probably because your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes a directory
which is a symlink to /usr/lib (such as /lib). The reason
this causes a problem is quite <br>
subtle. The file libdl.so.1.0 actually *only* contains
functions which generate &rsquo;stub interception
failed&rsquo; errors! The runtime linker intercepts links to
<br>
&quot;/usr/lib/libdl.so.1.0&quot; and links in internal
implementations of those functions instead. [Thanks to Tim
Bunce for this explanation.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN CONFIGURE. <br>
See the INSTALL file for general information regarding
Configure. Only Solaris-specific issues are discussed here.
Usually, the defaults should be fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64-bit perl on Solaris. <br>
See the INSTALL file for general information regarding
64-bit compiles. In general, the defaults should be fine for
most people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, perl-5.6.0 (or
later) is compiled as a 32-bit application with largefile
and long-long support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General 32-bit vs. 64-bit
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris 7 and above will run in
either 32 bit or 64 bit mode on SPARC CPUs, via a reboot.
You can build 64 bit apps whilst running 32 bit mode and
vice-versa. 32 bit apps will <br>
run under Solaris running in either 32 or 64 bit mode. 64
bit apps require Solaris to be running 64 bit mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Existing 32 bit apps are
properly known as LP32, i.e. Longs and Pointers are 32 bit.
64-bit apps are more properly known as LP64. The
discriminating feature of a LP64 bit app <br>
is its ability to utilise a 64-bit address space. It is
perfectly possible to have a LP32 bit app that supports both
64-bit integers (long long) and largefiles (&gt; 2GB), and
this <br>
is the default for perl-5.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete explanation
of 64-bit issues, see the &quot;Solaris 64-bit
Developer&rsquo;s Guide&quot; at
&lt;http://docs.sun.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can detect the OS mode using
&quot;isainfo -v&quot;, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ isainfo -v # Ultra 30 in 64
bit mode <br>
64-bit sparcv9 applications <br>
32-bit sparc applications</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, perl will be
compiled as a 32-bit application. Unless you want to
allocate more than ~ 4GB of memory inside perl, or unless
you need more than 255 open file <br>
descriptors, you probably don&rsquo;t need perl to be a
64-bit app.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Large File Support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For Solaris 2.6 and onwards,
there are two different ways for 32-bit applications to
manipulate large files (files whose size is &gt; 2GByte). (A
64-bit application automatically <br>
has largefile support built in by default.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First is the &quot;transitional
compilation environment&quot;, described in lfcompile64(5).
According to the man page,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transitional compilation
environment exports all the <br>
explicit 64-bit functions (xxx64()) and types in addition to
<br>
all the regular functions (xxx()) and types. Both xxx() and
<br>
xxx64() functions are available to the program source. A
<br>
32-bit application must use the xxx64() functions in order
<br>
to access large files. See the lf64(5) manual page for a
<br>
complete listing of the 64-bit transitional interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transitional compilation
environment is obtained with the following compiler and
linker flags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getconf LFS64_CFLAGS
-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE <br>
getconf LFS64_LDFLAG # nothing special needed <br>
getconf LFS64_LIBS # nothing special needed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second is the &quot;large file
compilation environment&quot;, described in lfcompile(5).
According to the man page,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each interface named xxx() that
needs to access 64-bit entities <br>
to access large files maps to a xxx64() call in the <br>
resulting binary. All relevant data types are defined to be
<br>
of correct size (for example, off_t has a typedef definition
<br>
for a 64-bit entity).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application compiled in this
environment is able to use <br>
the xxx() source interfaces to access both large and small
<br>
files, rather than having to explicitly utilize the
transitional <br>
xxx64() interface calls to access large files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two exceptions are fseek() and
ftell(). 32-bit applications should use fseeko(3C) and
ftello(3C). These will get automatically mapped to
fseeko64() and ftello64().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The large file compilation
environment is obtained with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getconf LFS_CFLAGS
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 <br>
getconf LFS_LDFLAGS # nothing special needed <br>
getconf LFS_LIBS # nothing special needed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, perl uses the large
file compilation environment and relies on Solaris to do the
underlying mapping of interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Building an LP64 perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compile a 64-bit application
on an UltraSparc with a recent Sun Compiler, you need to use
the flag &quot;-xarch=v9&quot;. getconf(1) will tell you
this, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ getconf -a | grep v9 <br>
XBS5_LP64_OFF64_CFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LDFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LINTFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_CFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LINTFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
_XBS5_LP64_OFF64_CFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
_XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LDFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
_XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LINTFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
_XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_CFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
_XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS: -xarch=v9 <br>
_XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LINTFLAGS: -xarch=v9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is supported in Sun
WorkShop Compilers 5.0 and onwards (now marketed under the
name Forte) when used on Solaris 7 or later on UltraSparc
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using gcc, you would
need to use -mcpu=v9 -m64 instead. This option is not yet
supported as of gcc 2.95.2; from install/SPECIFIC in that
release:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC version 2.95 is not able to
compile code correctly for sparc64 <br>
targets. Users of the Linux kernel, at least, can use the
sparc32 <br>
program to start up a new shell invocation with an
environment that <br>
causes configure to recognize (via uname -a) the system as
sparc-*-* <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All this should be handled
automatically by the hints file, if requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long Doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of 5.8.1, long doubles are
working if you use the Sun compilers (needed for additional
math routines not included in libm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threads in perl on Solaris. <br>
It is possible to build a threaded version of perl on
Solaris. The entire perl thread implementation is still
experimental, however, so beware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Malloc Issues with perl on
Solaris. <br>
Starting from perl 5.7.1 perl uses the Solaris malloc, since
the perl malloc breaks when dealing with more than 2GB of
memory, and the Solaris malloc also seems to be faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you for some reason (such as
binary backward compatibility) really need to use
perl&rsquo;s malloc, you can rebuild perl from the sources
and Configure the build with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sh Configure -Dusemymalloc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should not use perl&rsquo;s
malloc if you are building with gcc. There are reports of
core dumps, especially in the PDL module. The problem
appears to go away under -DDEBUGGING, <br>
so it has been difficult to track down. Sun&rsquo;s compiler
appears to be okay with or without perl&rsquo;s malloc. [XXX
further investigation is needed here.]</p>

Dynamic Loading Problems With GNU as and GNU ld <br>
If you have problems with dynamic loading using gcc on SunOS
or Solaris, and you are using GNU as and GNU ld, see the
section &quot;GNU as and GNU ld&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ld.so.1: ./perl: fatal:
relocation error: <br>
If you get this message on SunOS or Solaris, and
you&rsquo;re using gcc, it&rsquo;s probably the GNU as or
GNU ld problem in the previous item &quot;GNU as and GNU
ld&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dlopen: stub interception failed
<br>
The primary cause of the &rsquo;dlopen: stub interception
failed&rsquo; message is that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable includes a directory which is a symlink
to /usr/lib (such <br>
as /lib). See &quot;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#error &quot;No DATAMODEL_NATIVE
specified&quot; <br>
This is a common error when trying to build perl on Solaris
2.6 with a gcc installation from Solaris 2.5 or 2.5.1. The
Solaris header files changed, so you need to update <br>
your gcc installation. You can either rerun the fixincludes
script from gcc or take the opportunity to update your gcc
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh: ar: not found <br>
This is a message from your shell telling you that the
command &rsquo;ar&rsquo; was not found. You need to check
your PATH environment variable to make sure that it includes
the <br>
directory with the &rsquo;ar&rsquo; command. This is a
common problem on Solaris, where &rsquo;ar&rsquo; is in the
/usr/ccs/bin/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAKE TEST <br>
op/stat.t test 4 in Solaris <br>
op/stat.t test 4 may fail if you are on a tmpfs of some
sort. Building in /tmp sometimes shows this behavior. The
test suite detects if you are building in /tmp, but it may
not <br>
be able to catch all tmpfs situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREBUILT BINARIES OF PERL FOR
SOLARIS. <br>
You can pick up prebuilt binaries for Solaris from
&lt;http://www.sunfreeware.com/&gt;,
&lt;http://www.blastwave.org&gt;, ActiveState
&lt;http://www.activestate.com/&gt;, and <br>
&lt;http://www.perl.com/&gt; under the Binaries list at the
top of the page. There are probably other sources as well.

<br>
respective owners, not the perl developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME ISSUES FOR PERL ON
SOLARIS. <br>
Limits on Numbers of Open Files on Solaris. <br>
The stdio(3C) manpage notes that for LP32 applications, only
255 files may be opened using fopen(), and only file
descriptors 0 through 255 can be used in a stream. Since
perl <br>
calls open() and then fdopen(3C) with the resulting file
descriptor, perl is limited to 255 simultaneous open files,
even if sysopen() is used. If this proves to be an <br>
insurmountable problem, you can compile perl as a LP64
application, see &quot;Building an LP64 perl&quot; for
details. Note also that the default resource limit for open
file descriptors <br>
on Solaris is 255, so you will have to modify your ulimit or
rctl (Solaris 9 onwards) appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOLARIS-SPECIFIC MODULES. <br>
See the modules under the Solaris:: and Sun::Solaris
namespaces on CPAN, see
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Solaris/
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Solaris/&gt; and
<br>
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Sun/
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Sun/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOLARIS-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH
MODULES. <br>
Proc::ProcessTable on Solaris <br>
Proc::ProcessTable does not compile on Solaris with
perl5.6.0 and higher if you have LARGEFILES defined. Since
largefile support is the default in 5.6.0 and later, you
have to <br>
take special steps to use this module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem is that various
structures visible via procfs use off_t, and if you compile
with largefile support these change from 32 bits to 64 bits.
Thus what you get back from <br>
procfs doesn&rsquo;t match up with the structures in perl,
resulting in garbage. See proc(4) for further
discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fix for Proc::ProcessTable is
to edit Makefile to explicitly remove the largefile flags
from the ones MakeMaker picks up from Config.pm. This will
result in Proc::ProcessTable <br>
being built under the correct environment. Everything should
then be OK as long as Proc::ProcessTable doesn&rsquo;t try
to share off_t&rsquo;s with the rest of perl, or if it does
they <br>
should be explicitly specified as off64_t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BSD::Resource on Solaris <br>
BSD::Resource versions earlier than 1.09 do not compile on
Solaris with perl 5.6.0 and higher, for the same reasons as
Proc::ProcessTable. BSD::Resource versions starting from
<br>
1.09 have a workaround for the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Net::SSLeay on Solaris <br>
Net::SSLeay requires a /dev/urandom to be present. This
device is available from Solaris 9 onwards. For earlier
Solaris versions you can either get the package SUNWski
(packaged <br>
with several Sun software products, for example the Sun
WebServer, which is part of the Solaris Server Intranet
Extension, or the Sun Directory Services, part of Solaris
for <br>
ISPs) or download the ANDIrand package from
&lt;http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~andi/&gt;. If you use
SUNWski, make a symbolic link /dev/urandom pointing to
/dev/random. For more details, <br>
see Document ID27606 entitled &quot;Differing /dev/random
support requirements within Solaris[TM] Operating
Environments&quot;, available at
&lt;http://sunsolve.sun.com&gt; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may be possible to use the
Entropy Gathering Daemon (written in Perl!), available from
&lt;http://www.lothar.com/tech/crypto/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SunOS 4.x <br>
In SunOS 4.x you most probably want to use the SunOS ld,
/usr/bin/ld, since the more recent versions of GNU ld (like
2.13) do not seem to work for building Perl anymore. When
<br>
linking the extensions, the GNU ld gets very unhappy and
spews a lot of errors like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... relocation truncated to fit:
BASE13 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and dies. Therefore the SunOS
4.1 hints file explicitly sets the ld to be /usr/bin/ld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of Perl 5.8.1 the dynamic
loading of libraries (DynaLoader, XSLoader) also seems to
have become broken in in SunOS 4.x. Therefore the default is
to build Perl statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the test suite in SunOS
4.1 is a bit tricky since the lib/Tie/File/t/09_gen_rs test
hangs (subtest #51, FWIW) for some unknown reason. Just stop
the test and kill that <br>
particular Perl process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are various other
failures, that as of SunOS 4.1.4 and gcc 3.2.2 look a lot
like gcc bugs. Many of the failures happen in the Encode
tests, where for example when the test <br>
expects &quot;0&quot; you get &quot;&amp;#48;&quot; which
should after a little squinting look very odd indeed.
Another example is earlier in t/run/fresh_perl where
chr(0xff) is expected but the test <br>
fails because the result is chr(0xff). Exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the &quot;make
test&quot; result from the said combination:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failed 27 test scripts out of
745, 96.38% okay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the &quot;harness&quot;
is painful because of the many failing Unicode-related tests
will output megabytes of failure messages, but if one
patiently waits, one gets these results:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alarm() test failure is
caused by system() apparently blocking alarm(). That is
probably a libc bug, and given that SunOS 4.x has been
end-of-lifed years ago, don&rsquo;t hold <br>
your breath for a fix. In addition to that, don&rsquo;t try
anything too Unicode-y, especially with Encode, and you
should be fine in SunOS 4.x.</p>
