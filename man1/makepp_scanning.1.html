makepp_scanning -- How makepp finds include files and other hidden dependencies
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Makepp can determine additional dependencies or targets for certain commands
  that it knows something about. This is especially important for C/C++
  compilation, where it is too error-prone to list manually all of the include
  files that a given source file depends on. By looking at the compilation
  command and the source files themselves, makepp is able to determine
  accurately which object files need to be rebuilt when some include file
  changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Example: Given a rule
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    foo.o:                      # Usually %.o: %.c, just for illustration
        time -p /bin/libtool -bar /usr/bin/cc -c -I somewhere foo.c
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
makepp knows that &quot;time&quot; and &quot;libtool&quot; must be skipped and
  that &quot;cc&quot; is the actual command to be parsed here. It understands
  that <i>foo.c</i> is the input file and thus a dependency of this rule.
  Moreover it will scan that file looking for include statements, also in
  directory <i>somewhere</i>, because it understood the command options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Actually there are three steps to what is historically known as scanning:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The rule action is split into lines (continuation lines
      count as one). Each line (except builtins and Perl blocks) is <b>lexically
      analyzed</b> as one or more Shell commands. Redirections are recognized as
      inputs or outputs to this rule. The first word of each command is looked
      up (with its directory part but, if not found, again without it) to find a
      parser for it. These become optional dependencies, they are built if
      possible, but ignored if not found, as makepp can't know which part of a
      complex command is actually run.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Commands in backquotes are analyzed but not executed. (Often execution is
      important, but this would be a major interference by makepp.) It is better
      style to avoid them. Instead have makepp run the command at most once by
      assigning it in this special way:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    XYZFLAGS ;= $(shell pkg-config --cflags xyz)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Currently there is only one lexer class, which understands Bourne Shell. To
      better handle C Shell or &quot;command.com&quot;, subclasses might be
      created. However, much syntax is similar enough to not warrant this. Get
      in touch if you want to contribute either.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For known commands the corresponding <b>command parser</b>
      (also referred to just as parser) analyzes the important options and
      arguments. The available ones are described below.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Even if no specialized parser was found, the generic one makes the command
      executable an input of this rule. You can change that with the
      --no-path-executable-dependencies command option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the parser recognized any input files, they get sent to
      the <b>scanner</b> chosen by the parser. It finds further inputs by
      looking for &quot;#include&quot; or comparable statements.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is the most expensive step. All the results get cached to avoid
      repeating it unnecessarily.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If makepp thinks it's compiling a C/C++ source but can't find a parser, it will
  give a warning message to let you know. This usually means that you buried
  your compiler command too deeply in the action for makepp to find it. For
  example, I have seen rules like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %.o: %.c
        @echo Compiling $&lt; now; obscure_wrapper gcc -c $&lt; $(CFLAGS) -o $@
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first words of the actions here are &quot;echo&quot; and
  &quot;obscure_wrapper&quot;, for which there are no parsers, so makepp will
  not scan for include files in this case. You can ignore the prefixed command
  by:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    register-parser obscure_wrapper skip-word
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following sections document the built in parsers and scanners. In the name
  you can use &quot;-&quot; interchangeably with &quot;_&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCANNERS_(PARSERS)"><a class="selflink" href="#SCANNERS_(PARSERS)">SCANNERS
  (PARSERS)</a></h1>
The various scanners must be chosen by a command parser, which is given in
  parentheses:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="C/C++_compilation_(c-compilation,_gcc-compilation)"><a class="selflink" href="#C/C++_compilation_(c-compilation,_gcc-compilation)">C/C++
  compilation (c-compilation, gcc-compilation)</a></h2>
The C/C++ scanner, handles both languages indifferently. In fact it looks only
  at preprocessor statements, so it can be used for quite a few languages. The
  parser that activates it has a special variant for gcc's many options, which
  gets chosen if the command name includes the string &quot;gcc&quot; or g++. If
  compilers for other languages with C preprocessor use the same options as the
  C compiler (at least &quot;-I&quot;) then this parser works fine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It looks at the command for &quot;-Idir&quot; options specifying the include
  path or &quot;-Ldir&quot; options specifying the link path. It then scans any
  source files for &quot;#include&quot; directives, and also looks at the
  command line to see if there are any source files or libraries mentioned which
  are not listed as dependencies. It recognizes these by their extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This scanner gives a warning message if files included with
  &quot;#include&#x00A0;&quot;file.h&quot;&quot; are not found, or not buildable
  by makepp, in the include path, or in the directory containing the file which
  is &quot;#includ&quot;ing, or in <i>/usr/include</i>. No warning is given if a
  file included with &quot;#include&#x00A0;&lt;file.h&gt;&quot; is not found.
  Makepp assumes it is in some system include directory that the compiler knows
  about, and that files in system include directories won't change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, files in <i>/usr/include</i>, <i>/usr/local/include</i>,
  <i>/usr/X11R6/include</i>, and any other directory which is not writable are
  not scanned to see what they include. Makepp assumes that these files won't
  change. (If you're running as root, the writability test is performed with the
  UID and GID of the directory you ran makepp from. This is so compiling a
  program as an ordinary user and then doing &quot;makepp&#x00A0;install&quot;
  as root won't cause extra directories to be scanned.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a fairly simple-minded scanner. It will get confused if you do things
  like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #ifdef INCLUDE_THIS
    #include &quot;this.h&quot;
    #endif
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
because it doesn't know about preprocessor conditionals. This is usually
  harmless; it might cause additional extra files to be labeled as dependencies
  (occasionally causing unnecessary rebuilds), or else it might cause makepp to
  warn that the include file was not found. You can either ignore the warning
  messages, or put an empty file &quot;this.h&quot; out there to shut makepp up.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your compiler has a funny name, you can say either of
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    register-parser obscure_c_compiler c-compilation
    register-parser obscure_gcc_alias gcc-compilation
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Embedded_SQL_C/C++_compilation_(esql-compilation)"><a class="selflink" href="#Embedded_SQL_C/C++_compilation_(esql-compilation)">Embedded
  SQL C/C++ compilation (esql-compilation)</a></h2>
These commands, which come with the various databases, preprocess special
  sections in otherwise C/C++-like sources, and produce C/C++ headers and
  sources. This finds EXEC SQL INCLUDE &quot;filename&quot; or $INCLUDE
  &quot;filename&quot; directives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These preprocessors are recognized: Altibase APRE*C/C++ ( <i>apre</i>),
  CASEMaker DBMaker ( <i>dmppcc</i>), Firebird / InterBase (<i>gpre</i>), IBM
  DB2 ( <i>db2</i> <i>precompile, db2 prep</i>) &amp; Informix ESQL/C
  (<i>esql</i>), Ingres ( <i>esqlc</i>), Mimer ( <i>esql</i>), Oracle
  (<i>proc</i>), PostgreSQL ( <i>ecpg</i>) &amp; YARD (<i>yardpc</i>). If your
  preprocessor is not recognized, you can say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    register-parser obscure_esqlc_preprocessor esql-compilation
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will however only handle the style common to Informix and others: Command
  arguments ending in &quot;.ec&quot; are files to be scanned, &quot;-I&quot;
  defines the include path and EXEC SQL INCLUDE directives without a suffix get
  &quot;.h&quot; appended.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Swig_(swig)"><a class="selflink" href="#Swig_(swig)">Swig
  (swig)</a></h2>
Swig (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, http://www.swig.org/) is a
  program that converts a C/C++ header file into the wrapper functions needed to
  make your code callable from a variety of other languages, such as Perl,
  Python, Tcl, C#, Ruby, OCaml, and probably some others that I don't know
  about.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp understands and parses the swig command line, looking for &quot;-I&quot;
  and &quot;-l&quot; options. It also knows how to scan swig's interface
  definition files ( <i>.i</i> files) looking for %include, %import, and also
  &quot;#include&quot; if &quot;-includeall&quot; is in effect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your swig has a funny name, you can say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    register-parser obscure_swig_alias swig
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Vera_and_Verilog_(vcs_compilation)"><a class="selflink" href="#Vera_and_Verilog_(vcs_compilation)">Vera
  and Verilog (vcs_compilation)</a></h2>
If you design hardware, this will come in handy.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Ignorable_wrappers_(skip-word,_shell)"><a class="selflink" href="#Ignorable_wrappers_(skip-word,_shell)">Ignorable
  wrappers (skip-word, shell)</a></h2>
Makepp recognizes the following command words and many more and skips over them
  appropriately in in its search for the correct scanner:
  &quot;condor_compile&quot;, &quot;distcc&quot;, &quot;ignore_error&quot;,
  &quot;libtool&quot;, &quot;noecho&quot; &quot;purify&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a variant of this which finds the nested commands in &quot;sh -c
  'command1; command2'&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have more such commands, you can say
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    register-parser command skip-word
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Libtool</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Libtool is a very clever compilation system that greatly simplifies making
  shared libraries by hiding all the system-dependent details away in a shell
  script. The only difficulty is that the library binary files are not actually
  stored in the same directory as the output file--libtool actually creates a
  subdirectory, &quot;.libs&quot;, which contains the real files. This is
  ordinarily not a problem, but makepp has to know where the real binaries are
  if it is to link them in from a repository. At the moment, libtool libraries
  (&quot;.la&quot; files) are not linked in from repositories; they are always
  rebuilt if needed. Also, makepp at the moment is not able to use the
  dependency information that is stored inside the &quot;.la&quot; file itself.
  This will hopefully change soon.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Suppressing_the_scan_(none)"><a class="selflink" href="#Suppressing_the_scan_(none)">Suppressing
  the scan (none)</a></h2>
Sometimes you may not want a rule or a certain command to be parsed. You can
  turn off parsing and thereby scanning with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    register-parser cc none
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RELATED_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RELATED_OPTIONS">RELATED
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Quickscan_and_smartscan"><a class="selflink" href="#Quickscan_and_smartscan">Quickscan
  and smartscan</a></h2>
The &quot;:quickscan&quot; and &quot;:smartscan&quot; rule options, if
  applicable, affect the way that files are scanned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In &quot;:quickscan&quot; mode (the default), all include directives are assumed
  active. This allows for very efficient scanning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In &quot;:smartscan&quot; mode, an attempt is made to interpret macros and
  expressions so that inactive include directives are ignored. For example, the
  executable produced by compiling the following C program ought <i>not</i> to
  depend on <i>foo.h</i>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #if 0
    #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
    #endif
    int main() { return 0; }
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CUSTOM_SCANNERS"><a class="selflink" href="#CUSTOM_SCANNERS">CUSTOM
  SCANNERS</a></h1>
You can specify your own parser either in a rule option like &quot;:parser
  foo&quot;, or by using the &quot;register_parser&quot; or
  &quot;register_command_parser&quot; statements.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Either way, as described under &quot;register_parser&quot;, there you must
  directly or indirectly (via a class) specify a function that creates a parser
  object. This object will usually create a scanner object for files, and feed
  it with its findings from the command line options. These two objects will
  call the parser's &quot;add_*_dependency&quot; methods which forward the
  information to the somewhat more complicated
  &quot;Mpp::Lexer::add_*_dependency&quot; utility functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However your parser function can also do this work itself for simple cases.
  There are a couple of special return values if this function doesn't return a
  parser object:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;undef&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The scan info is not cacheable and must be recalculated
      next time the rule's target needs to be built.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&quot;p_none, p_skip_word&quot; or &quot;p_shell&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">These are in fact numeric constants, which tell the lexer
      to do the work of these pseudo-parsers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">any reference, e.g. &quot;\1&quot;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is equivalent to returning a parser object of the
      &quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; base class, which will only additionally
      make the command executable itself a dependency.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In most cases, objects of type &quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; should instantiate
  at least one object of type &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot;. The
  &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; base class takes care of the distinction between
  quickscan and smartscan. Note that the behavior of &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot;
  can be markedly affected by this distinction, but that should be transparent
  to the derived class if it is well-formed. New derived
  &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; classes ought to be tested in both modes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you write your own &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; class, you should also base your
  rescanning decision on the build info &quot;RESCAN&quot;. This gets set by
  &quot;makeppreplay&quot; after signing files without scanning. So despite the
  signatures being consistent, a rescan is still necessary. If your
  &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; uses the inherited &quot;scan_file1&quot; method,
  you're probably fine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more details, refer to the respective class documentation. For examples, see
  &quot;Mpp::CommandParser::Gcc&quot; and &quot;Mpp::CommandParser::Vcs&quot;.
  Look at the &quot;p_&quot; functions in <i>Mpp/Subs.pm</i> which get aliased
  into their respective classes as &quot;factory&quot; when loaded.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Caching_scanner_info"><a class="selflink" href="#Caching_scanner_info">Caching
  scanner info</a></h2>
If the all of the scanner's important side effects are effected through calls to
  methods of the &quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; base class, then those side
  effects can be cached in the build info file, so that they can be played back
  by a subsequent invocation of makepp without doing all of the costly scanning
  work. This can save quite a bit of time, especially in smartscan mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the scanner has other important side effects, then it should call the
  &quot;Rule&quot; object's mark_scaninfo_uncacheable method. Otherwise, the
  scanner info retrieved from the build info may be inaccurate, causing the
  build result possibly to be incorrect. This method is called automatically
  when a value from the %parsers hash does not return an object of type
  &quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot;, or when the parser is specified with a rule
  option and the &quot;p_*&quot; routine does not return an object of type
  &quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cached scan info is invalidated using criteria similar to those used for
  determining when the target is out of date. Similarly, it can be retrieved
  from a repository using criteria similar to those used for determining when a
  target can be linked in from a repository.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can force makepp to ignore the cached scanner info with the
  &quot;--force-rescan&quot; option. This is useful when a broken scanner may
  have caused incorrect scanner info to be cached.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Ad_Hoc_Scanner"><a class="selflink" href="#Ad_Hoc_Scanner">Ad
  Hoc Scanner</a></h2>
Often you will have just one or few files which contain dependency information.
  You don't want to write this into a makefile redundantly (since redundancy
  later often leads to inconsistencies when one update gets forgotten). But you
  also don't want to write a Mpp::Scanner? As a workaround you can generate an
  include file on the fly. For example Qt has <i>.qrc</i> files which can look
  like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    &lt;RCC&gt;
      &lt;qresource prefix=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
        &lt;file&gt;abc&lt;/file&gt;
        &lt;file&gt;xyz&lt;/file&gt;
        ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you adhere to the above layout, you can transform the relevant lines into a
  makepp include file, which gets automatically created by being included.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %.qrc.makepp: %.qrc
        &amp;grep 's!&lt;RCC&gt;\n!$(stem).cc:! || s! *&lt;file&gt;! ! &amp;&amp; s!&lt;/file&gt;\n!!' $(input) -o $(output)
 
    include $(wildcard *.qrc)   # .makepp is appended automatically
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Several variants of this are given in the Cookbook. The drawback is that you
  begin building while reading the makefile. So the --loop command option will
  not be so useful on the first iteration.</div>
