<p>MAKEPP_SCANNING(1) Makepp MAKEPP_SCANNING(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_scanning -- How makepp finds include files and other
hidden dependencies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Makepp can determine additional dependencies or targets for
certain commands that it knows something about. This is
especially important for C/C++ compilation, where it is too
<br>
error-prone to list manually all of the include files that a
given source file depends on. By looking at the compilation
command and the source files themselves, makepp is able <br>
to determine accurately which object files need to be
rebuilt when some include file changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: Given a rule</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo.o: # Usually %.o: %.c, just
for illustration <br>
time -p /bin/libtool -bar /usr/bin/cc -c -I somewhere
foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp knows that
&quot;time&quot; and &quot;libtool&quot; must be skipped and
that &quot;cc&quot; is the actual command to be parsed here.
It understands that foo.c is the input file and thus a
dependency <br>
of this rule. Moreover it will scan that file looking for
include statements, also in directory somewhere, because it
understood the command options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually there are three steps
to what is historically known as scanning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The rule action is split into
lines (continuation lines count as one). Each line (except
builtins and Perl blocks) is lexically analyzed as one or
more Shell commands. <br>
Redirections are recognized as inputs or outputs to this
rule. The first word of each command is looked up (with its
directory part but, if not found, again without it) to <br>
find a parser for it. These become optional dependencies,
they are built if possible, but ignored if not found, as
makepp can&rsquo;t know which part of a complex command is
<br>
actually run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands in backquotes are
analyzed but not executed. (Often execution is important,
but this would be a major interference by makepp.) It is
better style to avoid them. <br>
Instead have makepp run the command at most once by
assigning it in this special way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XYZFLAGS ;= $(shell pkg-config
--cflags xyz)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there is only one
lexer class, which understands Bourne Shell. To better
handle C Shell or &quot;command.com&quot;, subclasses might
be created. However, much syntax is <br>
similar enough to not warrant this. Get in touch if you want
to contribute either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. For known commands the
corresponding command parser (also referred to just as
parser) analyzes the important options and arguments. The
available ones are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if no specialized parser
was found, the generic one makes the command executable an
input of this rule. You can change that with the
--no-path-executable-dependencies <br>
command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the parser recognized any
input files, they get sent to the scanner chosen by the
parser. It finds further inputs by looking for
&quot;#include&quot; or comparable statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the most expensive step.
All the results get cached to avoid repeating it
unnecessarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If makepp thinks it&rsquo;s
compiling a C/C++ source but can&rsquo;t find a parser, it
will give a warning message to let you know. This usually
means that you buried your compiler command <br>
too deeply in the action for makepp to find it. For example,
I have seen rules like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.c <br>
@echo Compiling $&lt; now; obscure_wrapper gcc -c $&lt;
$(CFLAGS) -o $@</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first words of the actions
here are &quot;echo&quot; and &quot;obscure_wrapper&quot;,
for which there are no parsers, so makepp will not scan for
include files in this case. You can ignore the <br>
prefixed command by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register-parser obscure_wrapper
skip-word</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections document
the built in parsers and scanners. In the name you can use
&quot;-&quot; interchangeably with &quot;_&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCANNERS (PARSERS) <br>
The various scanners must be chosen by a command parser,
which is given in parentheses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C/C++ compilation
(c-compilation, gcc-compilation) <br>
The C/C++ scanner, handles both languages indifferently. In
fact it looks only at preprocessor statements, so it can be
used for quite a few languages. The parser that <br>
activates it has a special variant for gcc&rsquo;s many
options, which gets chosen if the command name includes the
string &quot;gcc&quot; or g++. If compilers for other
languages with C <br>
preprocessor use the same options as the C compiler (at
least &quot;-I&quot;) then this parser works fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It looks at the command for
&quot;-Idir&quot; options specifying the include path or
&quot;-Ldir&quot; options specifying the link path. It then
scans any source files for &quot;#include&quot; directives,
<br>
and also looks at the command line to see if there are any
source files or libraries mentioned which are not listed as
dependencies. It recognizes these by their extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This scanner gives a warning
message if files included with &quot;#include
&quot;file.h&quot;&quot; are not found, or not buildable by
makepp, in the include path, or in the directory containing
the <br>
file which is &quot;#includ&quot;ing, or in /usr/include. No
warning is given if a file included with &quot;#include
&lt;file.h&gt;&quot; is not found. Makepp assumes it is in
some system include <br>
directory that the compiler knows about, and that files in
system include directories won&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, files in
/usr/include, /usr/local/include, /usr/X11R6/include, and
any other directory which is not writable are not scanned to
see what they include. Makepp <br>
assumes that these files won&rsquo;t change. (If
you&rsquo;re running as root, the writability test is
performed with the UID and GID of the directory you ran
makepp from. This is so <br>
compiling a program as an ordinary user and then doing
&quot;makepp install&quot; as root won&rsquo;t cause extra
directories to be scanned.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a fairly simple-minded
scanner. It will get confused if you do things like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef INCLUDE_THIS <br>
#include &quot;this.h&quot; <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because it doesn&rsquo;t know
about preprocessor conditionals. This is usually harmless;
it might cause additional extra files to be labeled as
dependencies (occasionally causing <br>
unnecessary rebuilds), or else it might cause makepp to warn
that the include file was not found. You can either ignore
the warning messages, or put an empty file
&quot;this.h&quot; out <br>
there to shut makepp up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your compiler has a funny
name, you can say either of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register-parser
obscure_c_compiler c-compilation <br>
register-parser obscure_gcc_alias gcc-compilation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Embedded SQL C/C++ compilation
(esql-compilation) <br>
These commands, which come with the various databases,
preprocess special sections in otherwise C/C++-like sources,
and produce C/C++ headers and sources. This finds EXEC SQL
<br>
INCLUDE &quot;filename&quot; or $INCLUDE
&quot;filename&quot; directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These preprocessors are
recognized: Altibase APRE*C/C++ (apre), CASEMaker DBMaker
(dmppcc), Firebird / InterBase (gpre), IBM DB2 (db2
precompile, db2 prep) &amp; Informix ESQL/C <br>
(esql), Ingres (esqlc), Mimer (esql), Oracle (proc),
PostgreSQL (ecpg) &amp; YARD (yardpc). If your preprocessor
is not recognized, you can say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register-parser
obscure_esqlc_preprocessor esql-compilation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will however only handle
the style common to Informix and others: Command arguments
ending in &quot;.ec&quot; are files to be scanned,
&quot;-I&quot; defines the include path and EXEC SQL <br>
INCLUDE directives without a suffix get &quot;.h&quot;
appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Swig (swig) <br>
Swig (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator,
http://www.swig.org/) is a program that converts a C/C++
header file into the wrapper functions needed to make your
code <br>
callable from a variety of other languages, such as Perl,
Python, Tcl, C#, Ruby, OCaml, and probably some others that
I don&rsquo;t know about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp understands and parses
the swig command line, looking for &quot;-I&quot; and
&quot;-l&quot; options. It also knows how to scan
swig&rsquo;s interface definition files (.i files) looking
for <br>
%include, %import, and also &quot;#include&quot; if
&quot;-includeall&quot; is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your swig has a funny name,
you can say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register-parser
obscure_swig_alias swig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vera and Verilog
(vcs_compilation) <br>
If you design hardware, this will come in handy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ignorable wrappers (skip-word,
shell) <br>
Makepp recognizes the following command words and many more
and skips over them appropriately in in its search for the
correct scanner: &quot;condor_compile&quot;,
&quot;distcc&quot;, <br>
&quot;ignore_error&quot;, &quot;libtool&quot;,
&quot;noecho&quot; &quot;purify&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a variant of this which
finds the nested commands in &quot;sh -c &rsquo;command1;
command2&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have more such commands,
you can say</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register-parser command
skip-word</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libtool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Libtool is a very clever
compilation system that greatly simplifies making shared
libraries by hiding all the system-dependent details away in
a shell script. The only <br>
difficulty is that the library binary files are not actually
stored in the same directory as the output file--libtool
actually creates a subdirectory, &quot;.libs&quot;, which
contains the <br>
real files. This is ordinarily not a problem, but makepp has
to know where the real binaries are if it is to link them in
from a repository. At the moment, libtool libraries <br>
(&quot;.la&quot; files) are not linked in from repositories;
they are always rebuilt if needed. Also, makepp at the
moment is not able to use the dependency information that is
stored <br>
inside the &quot;.la&quot; file itself. This will hopefully
change soon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppressing the scan (none) <br>
Sometimes you may not want a rule or a certain command to be
parsed. You can turn off parsing and thereby scanning
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">register-parser cc none</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELATED OPTIONS <br>
Quickscan and smartscan <br>
The &quot;:quickscan&quot; and &quot;:smartscan&quot; rule
options, if applicable, affect the way that files are
scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &quot;:quickscan&quot; mode
(the default), all include directives are assumed active.
This allows for very efficient scanning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &quot;:smartscan&quot; mode,
an attempt is made to interpret macros and expressions so
that inactive include directives are ignored. For example,
the executable produced by compiling <br>
the following C program ought not to depend on foo.h:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if 0 <br>
#include &quot;foo.h&quot; <br>
#endif <br>
int main() { return 0; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM SCANNERS <br>
You can specify your own parser either in a rule option like
&quot;:parser foo&quot;, or by using the
&quot;register_parser&quot; or
&quot;register_command_parser&quot; statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either way, as described under
&quot;register_parser&quot;, there you must directly or
indirectly (via a class) specify a function that creates a
parser object. This object will usually <br>
create a scanner object for files, and feed it with its
findings from the command line options. These two objects
will call the parser&rsquo;s &quot;add_*_dependency&quot;
methods which forward <br>
the information to the somewhat more complicated
&quot;Mpp::Lexer::add_*_dependency&quot; utility
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However your parser function can
also do this work itself for simple cases. There are a
couple of special return values if this function
doesn&rsquo;t return a parser object:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;undef&quot; <br>
The scan info is not cacheable and must be recalculated next
time the rule&rsquo;s target needs to be built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;p_none, p_skip_word&quot;
or &quot;p_shell&quot; <br>
These are in fact numeric constants, which tell the lexer to
do the work of these pseudo-parsers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any reference, e.g.
&quot;1&quot; <br>
This is equivalent to returning a parser object of the
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; base class, which will only
additionally make the command executable itself a
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, objects of type
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; should instantiate at least
one object of type &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot;. The
&quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; base class takes care of the
distinction <br>
between quickscan and smartscan. Note that the behavior of
&quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; can be markedly affected by this
distinction, but that should be transparent to the derived
class if it <br>
is well-formed. New derived &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; classes
ought to be tested in both modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you write your own
&quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot; class, you should also base your
rescanning decision on the build info &quot;RESCAN&quot;.
This gets set by &quot;makeppreplay&quot; after signing
files without <br>
scanning. So despite the signatures being consistent, a
rescan is still necessary. If your &quot;Mpp::Scanner&quot;
uses the inherited &quot;scan_file1&quot; method,
you&rsquo;re probably fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, refer to the
respective class documentation. For examples, see
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser::Gcc&quot; and
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser::Vcs&quot;. Look at the
&quot;p_&quot; functions in <br>
Mpp/Subs.pm which get aliased into their respective classes
as &quot;factory&quot; when loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caching scanner info <br>
If the all of the scanner&rsquo;s important side effects are
effected through calls to methods of the
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot; base class, then those side
effects can be cached in the <br>
build info file, so that they can be played back by a
subsequent invocation of makepp without doing all of the
costly scanning work. This can save quite a bit of time,
<br>
especially in smartscan mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the scanner has other
important side effects, then it should call the
&quot;Rule&quot; object&rsquo;s mark_scaninfo_uncacheable
method. Otherwise, the scanner info retrieved from the build
<br>
info may be inaccurate, causing the build result possibly to
be incorrect. This method is called automatically when a
value from the %parsers hash does not return an object of
<br>
type &quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot;, or when the parser is
specified with a rule option and the &quot;p_*&quot; routine
does not return an object of type
&quot;Mpp::CommandParser&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cached scan info is invalidated
using criteria similar to those used for determining when
the target is out of date. Similarly, it can be retrieved
from a repository using <br>
criteria similar to those used for determining when a target
can be linked in from a repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can force makepp to ignore
the cached scanner info with the &quot;--force-rescan&quot;
option. This is useful when a broken scanner may have caused
incorrect scanner info to be <br>
cached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ad Hoc Scanner <br>
Often you will have just one or few files which contain
dependency information. You don&rsquo;t want to write this
into a makefile redundantly (since redundancy later often
leads to <br>
inconsistencies when one update gets forgotten). But you
also don&rsquo;t want to write a Mpp::Scanner? As a
workaround you can generate an include file on the fly. For
example Qt <br>
has .qrc files which can look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;RCC&gt; <br>
&lt;qresource prefix=&quot;...&quot;&gt; <br>
&lt;file&gt;abc&lt;/file&gt; <br>
&lt;file&gt;xyz&lt;/file&gt; <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you adhere to the above
layout, you can transform the relevant lines into a makepp
include file, which gets automatically created by being
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.qrc.makepp: %.qrc <br>
&amp;grep &rsquo;s!&lt;RCC&gt;0$(stem).cc:! || s!
*&lt;file&gt;! ! &amp;&amp; s!&lt;/file&gt;0!&rsquo;
$(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include $(wildcard *.qrc) #
.makepp is appended automatically</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several variants of this are
given in the Cookbook. The drawback is that you begin
building while reading the makefile. So the --loop command
option will not be so useful on <br>
the first iteration.</p>
