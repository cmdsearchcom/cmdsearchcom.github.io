<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zonesigner - Generates encryption keys and signs a DNS
zone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zonesigner [options] &lt;zone-file&gt;
&lt;signed-zone-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># get started immediately
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># first run on a zone for
example.com: <br>
zonesigner -genkeys -endtime +2678400 example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># future runs before expiration
time (reuses the same keys): <br>
zonesigner -endtime +2678400 example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This script combines into a single command many actions that
are required to sign a DNS zone. It generates the required
KSK and ZSK keys, adds the key data to a zone record <br>
file, signs the zone file, and runs checks to ensure that
everything worked properly. It also keeps records about the
keys and how the zone was signed in order to facilitate re-
<br>
signing of the zone in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zonesigner-specific
zone-signing records are kept in keyrec files. Using keyrec
files, defined and maintained by DNSSEC-Tools, zonesigner
can automatically gather many of <br>
the options used to previously sign and generate a zone and
its keys. This allows the zone to be maintained using the
same key lengths and expiration times, for example, without
<br>
an administrator needing to manually track these fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK START <br>
The following are examples that will allow a quick start on
using zonesigner:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first run on example.com <br>
The following command will generate keys and sign the zone
file for example.com, giving an expiration date 31 days in
the future. The zone file is named example.com and the <br>
signed zone file will be named example.com.signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner -genkeys -endtime
+2678400 example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subsequent runs on example.com
<br>
The following command will re-sign example.com&rsquo;s zone
file, but will not generate new keys. The files and all
key-generation and zone-signing arguments will remain the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING ZONESIGNER <br>
zonesigner is used in this way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner [options]
&lt;zone-file&gt; &lt;signed-zone-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zone-file argument is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zone-file is the name of the
zone file from which a signed zone file will be created. If
the -zone option is not given, then zone-file will be used
as the name of the zone that <br>
will be signed. Generated keys are given this name as their
base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once zonesigner has created a
set of keys for a zone and signed the zone, it may be used
to re-sign the as the zonefile changes. When run without any
options, zonesigner will <br>
consult the zone&rsquo;s keyrec to find the appropriate set
of keys and will then sign the specified zone with them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zone file is modified to
have include commands, which will include the KSK and ZSK
keys. These lines are placed at the end of the file and
should not be modified by the <br>
user. If the zone file already includes any key files, those
inclusions will be deleted. These lines are distinguished by
starting with &quot;$INCLUDE&quot; and end with
&quot;.key&quot;. Only <br>
the actual include lines are deleted; any related comment
lines are left untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An intermediate file is used in
signing the zone. zone-file is copied to the intermediate
file and is modified in preparation of signing the zone
file. Several $INCLUDE lines <br>
will be added at the end of the file and the SOA serial
number will be incremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signed-zone is the name of the
signed zone file. If it is not given on the command line,
the default signed zone filename is the zone-file appended
with &quot;.signed&quot;. Thus, <br>
executing zonesigner example.com will result in the signed
zone being stored in example.com.signed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the -genkeys, -genksk,
-genzsk, or -newpubksk options are specified, the last keys
generated for a particular zone will be used in subsequent
zonesigner executions. DS <br>
records will be included in signing operations unless the
-nogends option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner can be used with a
rollover manager, such as rollerd, to provide automated
management of a zone, its keys, and the signing of the zone.
If a rollerd-managed zonefile <br>
changes while rollerd is waiting for a zone rollover to
begin or a rollover phase to complete, zonesigner may be
used to sign the zone with the proper set of keys; rollerd
will <br>
not be disrupted by this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYREC FILES <br>
keyrec files retain information about previous
key-generation and zone-signing operations. If a keyrec file
is not specified (by way of the -krfile option), then a
default <br>
keyrec file is used. If this default is not specified in the
system&rsquo;s DNSSEC-Tools configuration file, the filename
will be the zone name appended with .krf. If the -nokrfile
<br>
option is given, then no keyrec file will be consulted or
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each keyrec contains a set of
&quot;key/value&quot; entries, one per line. Example 4 below
contains the contents of a sample keyrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyrec files contain three types
of entries: zone keyrecs, set keyrecs, and key keyrecs. Zone
keyrecs contain information specifically about the zone,
such as the number of <br>
ZSKs used to sign the zone, the end-time for the zone, and
the key signing set names (names of set keyrecs.) Set
keyrecs contain lists of key keyrec names used for a
specific <br>
purpose, such as the current ZSK keys or the published ZSK
keys. Key keyrecs contain information about the generated
keys themselves, such as encryption algorithm, key length,
<br>
and key lifetime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a zone proceeds through key
rollover, new cryptographic keys will be generated for the
zone. The various key parameters (e.g., key length and
crypto algorithm) will be the <br>
same as the parameters previously used to generate keys for
that zone. The keymod command allows these key parameters to
be modified as needs change. If a particular parameter <br>
is changed, such as the KSK length changing from 1024 to
2048, then future keys will reflect that change; current and
past keys will not be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyrec Files and RFC5011 KSK
Revocation <br>
If RFC5011 processing is enabled, there is special handling
of the zone&rsquo;s set keyrec of revoked KSK keys. The
&quot;kskrev&quot; field in the zone&rsquo;s keyrec points
to a set keyrec, marked <br>
as being of type &quot;kskrev&quot;. This set keyrec, in
turn, points to a number of other set keyrecs, all of which
are also marked as being of type &quot;kskrev&quot;. The
group of all revoked <br>
KSK keys is found by consulting that subsidiary set of
&quot;kskrev&quot; set keyrecs. When the ages of these
revoked keys exceeds their revocation periods, they are
marked as being <br>
obsolete (&quot;kskobs&quot;). If this happens as part of
normal rollover, these revoked key and set keyrecs are all
removed from the chain of active, revoked keyrecs. If this
happens to <br>
a key that&rsquo;s part of a larger set of keys, it is
removed from that signing set and put in its own new signing
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENTROPY <br>
On some systems, the implementation of the pseudo-random
number generator requires keyboard activity. This keyboard
activity is used to fill a buffer in the system&rsquo;s
random <br>
number generator. If zonesigner appears hung, you may have
to add entropy to the random number generator by randomly
striking keys until the program completes. Display of this
<br>
message is controlled by the entropy_msg configuration file
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETERMINING OPTION VALUES <br>
zonesigner checks four places in order to determine option
values. In descending order of precedence, these places
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command line options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyrec file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSSEC-Tools configuration
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner defaults</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each is checked until a value is
found. That value is then used for that zonesigner execution
and the value is stored in the keyrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>
For example, the KSK length has the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksklength command line option:
8192</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyrec file: 1024</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DNSSEC-Tools configuration file:
512</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner defaults: 2048</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all are present, then the KSK
length will be 8192.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -ksklength command line
option wasn&rsquo;t given, the KSK length will be 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the KSK length wasn&rsquo;t
given in the configuration file, it will be 8192.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the KSK length wasn&rsquo;t
in the keyrec file or the configuration file, the KSK length
will be 8192.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -ksklength command line
option wasn&rsquo;t given and the KSK length wasn&rsquo;t in
the configuration file, it&rsquo;ll be 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the command line option
wasn&rsquo;t given, the KSK length wasn&rsquo;t in the
keyrec file, and it wasn&rsquo;t in the configuration file,
then the KSK length will be 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Three types of options may be given, based on the command
for which they are intended. These commands are
dnssec-keygen, dnssec-signzone, and zonesigner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zonesigner-specific Options <br>
-archivedir <br>
The key archive directory. If a key archive directory
hasn&rsquo;t been specified (on the command line or in the
DNSSEC-Tools configuration file) and the -nosave option was
not <br>
given, then zonesigner will leave the keys in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the files are saved into
the archive directory, the existing file names are prepended
with a timestamp. The timestamp indicates when the files are
archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directory may not be the
root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-droprevoked <br>
Explicitly obsolete currently revoked KSKs and remove them
from the signing set before resigning. This is mutually
exclusive from -nodroprevoked. If neither -droprevoked <br>
nor -nodroprevoked are given, then -droprevoked
functionality is assumed..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dsdir <br>
Specify a directory for storing dssets. This directory will
be created if it does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory must be writable
and may not be the root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-genkeys <br>
Generate new KSKs and ZSKs for the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-genksk <br>
Generate new Current KSKs for the zone. Any existing Current
KSKs will be marked as obsolete. If this option is not
given, the last KSKs generated for this zone will be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-genzsk <br>
Generate new ZSKs for the zone. By default, the last ZSKs
generated for this zone will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Display a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-intermediate <br>
Filename to use for the temporary zone file. The zone file
will be copied to this file and then the key names
appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keydirectory <br>
The directory in which KSK and ZSK keys will be stored. The
default is to store the keys in the directory in which
zonesigner is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directory may not be the
root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-krfile <br>
keyrec file to use in processing options. See the man page
for Net::DNS::SEC::Tools::tooloptions.pm for more details
about this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksignset <br>
The name of the KSK signing set to use. If the signing set
does not exist, then this must be used in conjunction with
either -genkeys or -genksk. The name may contain <br>
alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens, periods, and
commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name may contain
alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens, periods, and commas.
The default signing set name is &quot;zone-signset-N&quot;,
where zone is the zone being signed and N is <br>
a number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -ksignset is not specified,
then zonesigner will use the default and increment the
number for subsequent signing sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kskcount <br>
The number of KSK keys to generate and with which to sign
the zone. The default is to use a single KSK key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kskdirectory <br>
The directory in which KSK keys will be stored. The default
is to store the keys in the directory in which zonesigner is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directory may not be the
root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksklife <br>
The time between KSK rollovers. This is measured in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-newpubksk <br>
Generate new Published KSKs for the zone. Any existing
Published KSKs will be marked as obsolete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodroprevoked <br>
Explicitly turn off obsoleting currently revoked KSKs and
remove them from the signing set before resigning. This is
mutually exclusive from -droprevoked. If neither <br>
-droprevoked nor -nodroprevoked are given, then -droprevoked
functionality is assumed..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nokrfile <br>
No keyrec file will be consulted or created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-norfc5011 <br>
Disable RFC5011 KSK revocation when rolling or replacing
existing KSK key sets. By default, zonesigner performs
RFC5011 KSK revocation and this option supersedes this <br>
behavior and any option setting within the keyrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosave <br>
Do not save obsolete keys to the key archive directory. The
default behavior is to save obsolete keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-phase <br>
Specify an rollover option based on the rollover phase, as
opposed to using the option naming the specific action to be
performed. The purpose of this option is to bring <br>
clarity and greater understanding to how zonesigner is used
in the rollover process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are the mappings
between the -phase options and the action options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Phase Option Action-based Option
<br>
-phase ksk2 -newpubksk <br>
-phase ksk4 -rollksk <br>
-phase zsk2 -usezskpub <br>
-phase zsk4b -rollzsk <br>
-phase zsk4b (no option)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The -phase option
should only be used if you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rollksk <br>
Force a rollover of the KSK keys. The Current KSK keys are
marked as Obsolete and the Published KSK keys are marked as
Current. The zone is then signed with the new set of <br>
Current KSK keys. If the zone&rsquo;s keyrec does not list a
Current or Published KSK, an error message is printed and
zonesigner stops execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The zone&rsquo;s keyrec file is
updated to show the new key state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyrecs of the KSK keys are
adjusted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Current KSK keys are marked
as Obsolete. <br>
The Published KSK keys are marked as Current. <br>
The Obsolete KSK keys are moved to the archive
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If RFC5011 processing is
enabled, then the KSK rollover sequence is modified as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Current KSK keys are marked
as Revoked. <br>
The Published KSK keys are marked as Current. <br>
The Revoked KSK keys are checked to see if they are still
<br>
within their revocation period. If not, they are marked <br>
as Obsolete. <br>
The Obsolete KSK keys are moved to the archive
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The timing of
key-rolling is critical. Great care must be taken when using
this option. In the future, rollerd will automate the KSK
rollover process and may be <br>
used to safely take care of this aspect of DNSSEC
management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Using the -rollksk
option should only be used if you know what you&rsquo;re
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: This is may be a
temporary method of KSK rollover. It may be changed in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rollmgr <br>
The zone&rsquo;s rollover manager. This indicates that the
zone is under control of a rollover manager. If a user
wishes to sign a zone in the middle of a rollover wait
phase, <br>
this field helps zonesigner and the rollover manager to
determine how best to handle the zone-signing operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rollzsk <br>
Force a rollover of the ZSK keys using the Pre-Publish Key
Rollover method. The rollover process adjusts the keys used
to sign the specified zone, generates new keys, signs <br>
the zone with the appropriate keys, and updates the keyrec
file. The Pre-Publish Key Rollover process is described in
the DNSSEC Operational Practices document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three sets of ZSK keys are used
in the rollover process: Current, Published, and New.
Current ZSKs are those which are used to sign the zone.
Published ZSKs are available <br>
in the zone data, and therefore in cached zone data, but are
not yet used to sign the zone. New ZSKs are not available in
zone data nor yet used to sign the zone, but are <br>
waiting in the wings for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyrecs of the ZSK keys are
adjusted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Current ZSK keys are marked
as obsolete. <br>
The Published ZSK keys are marked as Current. <br>
The New ZSK keys, if they exist, are marked as Published.
<br>
Another set of ZSK keys are generated, which will be <br>
marked as the New ZSK keys. <br>
The Published ZSK keys&rsquo; zsklife field is copied to the
<br>
new ZSK keys&rsquo; keyrecs. <br>
The obsolete ZSK keys are moved to the archive
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The quick summary of proper ZSK
rolling (which rollerd does for you if you use it):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- wait 2 * max(TTL in zone) <br>
- run zonesigner using -usezskpub <br>
- wait 2 * max(TTL in zone) <br>
- run zonesigner using -rollzsk <br>
- wait 2 * max(TTL in zone)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The timing of
key-rolling is critical. Great care must be taken when using
this option. rollerd automates the rollover process and may
be used to safely take care <br>
of this aspect of DNSSEC management. Using the -rollzsk
option should only be used if you know what you&rsquo;re
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showkeycmd <br>
Display the actual key-generation command (with options and
arguments) that is executed. This is a small subset of
verbose level 3 output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showsigncmd <br>
Display the actual zone-signing command (with options and
arguments) that is executed. This is a small subset of
verbose level 3 output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signonly <br>
Sign the zone without performing any key generation or key
rollover operations. The keys used in the most recent
zonesigner signing of this zone will be the keys used for
<br>
this signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-signset <br>
The name of the ZSK signing set to use as the Current ZSK
signing set. The zone is signed and the given signing set
becomes the zone&rsquo;s new Current ZSK signing set. If the
<br>
signing set does not exist, then this must be used in
conjunction with either -genkeys or -genzsk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name may contain
alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens, periods, and commas.
The default signing set name is &quot;zonesignset-N&quot;,
where zone is the zone being signed and N is <br>
a number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -signset is not specified,
then zonesigner will use the default and increment the
number for subsequent signing sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-threshold <br>
Sign the zone if a threshold condition is met. Depending on
how the threshold is specified, it may be relative to the
last time the zone was signed or to the zone&rsquo;s <br>
expiration date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threshold-time is the threshold
value, given as a numeric value, with an optional unit
specifier. The unit may be &rsquo;s&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo;,
&rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;d&rsquo;, for seconds, minutes,
hours, or <br>
days. If the unit is not given, then the value is in
seconds. The threshold value must have either the
&rsquo;-&rsquo; prefix or the &rsquo;+&rsquo; prefix to
indicate which threshold to measure. <br>
The threshold value +10d refers to ten days prior to a
zone&rsquo;s expiration date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &rsquo;-&rsquo; prefix is
used, then the zone will be re-signed if zonesigner is
executed no more than threshold-time after the last time the
zone was signed. threshold-time is <br>
determined by subtracting the threshold value from the
upcoming midnight. If this would put the threshold time in
the future, then it is calculated from the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &rsquo;+&rsquo; prefix is
used, then the zone will be re-signed if zonesigner is
executed no more than threshold-time before the zone&rsquo;s
expiration date. threshold-time is <br>
determined by subtracting the threshold value from the
previous midnight. If this would put threshold-time in the
past, then it is calculated from the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-useboth <br>
Use the existing Current and Published ZSKs to sign the
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usezskpub <br>
Use the existing Published ZSKs to sign the zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Display the version information for zonesigner and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Verbose output will be given. As more instances of -verbose
are given on the command line, additional levels of
verbosity are achieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">level output <br>
----- ------ <br>
1 operations being performed <br>
(e.g., generating key files, signing zone) <br>
2 details on operations and some operation results <br>
(e.g., new key names, zone serial number) <br>
3 operations&rsquo; parameters and additional details <br>
(e.g., key lengths, encryption algorithm, <br>
executed commands)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Higher levels of verbosity are
cumulative. Specifying two instances of -verbose will get
the output from the first and second levels of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xc Display a message associated
with a zonesigner exit value. This option is intended for
use by those programs who wish for zonesigner to run
silently, but need a description <br>
for why zonesigner has exited with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are the exit codes

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cthulhu <br>
This option is for internal use only and should never be
used by a user. If this warning is ignored, then undefined,
unnameable eldritch horrors may be visited upon your <br>
zone files. Do not use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zone <br>
Name of the zone that will be signed. This zone name may be
given with this option or as the first non-option command
line argument. In the second case, if the argument <br>
contains directory separators, then final element of the
path will be used for the zone name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zskcount <br>
The number of ZSK keys to generate and with which to sign
the zone. The default is to use a single ZSK key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zskdirectory <br>
The directory in which ZSK keys will be stored. The default
is to store the keys in the directory in which zonesigner is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directory may not be the
root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zsklife <br>
The time between ZSK rollovers. This is measured in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-keygen-specific Options
<br>
-algorithm <br>
Cryptographic algorithm used to generate the zone&rsquo;s
keys. The default value is RSASHA1. The option value is
passed to dnssec-keygen as the -a flag. Consult
dnssec-keygen&rsquo;s <br>
manual page to determine legal values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kgopts <br>
Additional options for dnssec-keygen may be specified using
this option. The additional options are passed as a single
string value as an argument to the -kgopts option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksklength <br>
Bit length of the zone&rsquo;s KSK key. The default is
2048.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nsec3optout <br>
When this flag and the -usensec3 flag are set, the zone will
be signed using the Opt-Out support described in RFC5155. A
quick summary is that only sub-domains with valid DS <br>
or public keys available will be signed and the rest will
not be. This greatly reduces the computational and memory
requirements of extremely large zones with lots of <br>
unsigned children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-random <br>
Source of randomness used to generate the zone&rsquo;s keys.
This is assumed to be a file, for example /dev/urandom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usensec3 <br>
Signs the zone using NSEC3 (see RFC5155)
proof-of-non-existence records rather than NSEC records. The
keys used to sign the zone must support the use of NSEC3 or
else zone- <br>
signing will fail. Zonesigner will automatically generate
new keys of the correct type if one of the -genkeys or
similar options is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zsklength <br>
Bit length of the zone&rsquo;s ZSK key. The default is
1024.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnssec-signzone-specific Options
<br>
-endtime <br>
Time that the zone expires, as measured from the current
time. If given as a number, it is a count of seconds. If it
is given as a number followed by &rsquo;s&rsquo;,
&rsquo;m&rsquo;, &rsquo;h&rsquo;, or &rsquo;d&rsquo;, <br>
then it is the number of seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
The default value is 2764800 seconds (32 days.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gends <br>
Force dnssec-signzone to generate DS records for the zone.
This option is translated into -g when passed to
dnssec-signzone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is obsolete. DS
records are generated by default. Use the -nogends option if
DS records should not be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ksdir <br>
Specify a directory for storing keysets. This is passed to
dnssec-signzone as the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogends <br>
Prevent dnssec-signzone from generating DS records for the
zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-szopts <br>
Additional options for dnssec-signzone may be specified
using this option. The additional options are passed as a
single string value as an argument to the -szopts
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for this
option is &quot;-i local&quot;, set in defaults.pm. This
value has been found to greatly improve the amount of time
it takes named-checkzone to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
-zcopts <br>
Additional options for named-checkzone may be specified
using this option. The additional options are passed as a
single string value as an argument to the -zcopts
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first example, an
existing keyrec file is used to assist in signing the
example.com domain. Zone data are stored in example.com, and
the keyrec is in example.krf. The <br>

this execution:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># zonesigner -krfile example.krf

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
1. One Zone in a keyrec File <br>
There is a bug in the signing-set code that necessitates
only storing one zone in a keyrec file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. SOA Serial Numbers <br>
Serial numbers in SOA records are merely incremented in this
version. Future plans are to allow for more flexible serial
number manipulation.</p>
