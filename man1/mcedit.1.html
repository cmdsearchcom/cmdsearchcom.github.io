<p>MCEDIT(1) GNU Midnight Commander MCEDIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mcedit - Internal file editor of GNU Midnight Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] [+lineno] [file1] [file2] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?]
file1:lineno[:] file2:lineno[:] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mcedit is a link to mc, the main GNU Midnight Commander
executable. Executing GNU Midnight Commander under this name
runs the internal editor and opens files specified on the
<br>
command line. The editor is based on the terminal version of
cooledit - standalone editor for X Window System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
+lineno <br>
Go to the line specified by number (do not put a space
between the + sign and the number). Several line numbers are
allowed but only the last one will be used, and it will <br>
be applied to the first file only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Force black and white
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Force ANSI color mode on
terminals that don&rsquo;t seem to have color support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C
&lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=
... <br>
Specify a different color set. See the Colors section in
mc(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Disable mouse support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Display the compiled-in
search path for GNU Midnight Commander data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Force using termcap database
instead of terminfo. This option is only applicable if GNU
Midnight Commander was compiled with S-Lang library with
terminfo support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display the version of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Force xterm mode. Used when
running on xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and
able to send mouse escape sequences).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
The internal file editor is a full-featured windowed editor.
It can edit several files at the same time. Maximim size of
each file is 64 megabytes. It is possible to edit binary
<br>
files. The features it presently supports are: block copy,
move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus;
file insertion; macro commands; regular expression search
<br>
and replace; shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported by
the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; autoindent; tunable
tab size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and
<br>
an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like
indent and ispell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each file is opened in its own
window in full-screen mode. Window control in mcedit is
similar to the window control in other multi-window program:
double click on window title <br>
maximizes the window to full-screen or restores window size
and position; left-click on window title and mouse drag
moves the window in editor area; left-click on low-right
frame <br>
corner and mouse drag resizes the window. These actions can
be made using &quot;Window&quot; menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYS <br>
The editor is easy to use and can be used without learning.
The pull-down menu is invoked by pressing F9. You can learn
other keys from the menu and from the button bar labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to that, Shift
combined with arrows does text highlighting (if supported by
the terminal): Ctrl-Ins copies to the file
~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, Shift-Ins <br>
pastes from ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, Shift-Del cuts
to ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes
highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works on some
termi&acirc; <br>
nals. To use the standard mouse support provided by your
terminal, hold the Shift key. Please note that the mouse
support in the terminal doesn&rsquo;t share the clipboard
with <br>
mcedit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The completion key (usually
Meta-Tab or Escape Tab) completes the word under the cursor
using the words used in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MACRO <br>
To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the keys
you want to be executed. Press Ctrl-R again when finished.
The macro can be assigned to any key by pressing that key.
<br>
The macro is executed when you press the assigned key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macro commands are stored in
section [editor] it the file
~/.local/share/mc/mc.macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External scripts (filters) can
be assigned into the any hotkey by edit mc.macros like
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[editor] <br>
ctrl-W=ExecuteScript:25;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that ctrl-W hotkey
initiates the ExecuteScript(25) action, then editor handler
translates this into execution of
~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/macro.25.sh shell <br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External scripts are stored in
~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/ directory and must be
named as macro.XXXX.sh where XXXX is the number from 0 to
9999. See Menu File Edit for <br>
more detail about format of the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following macro definition and
directives can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#silent <br>
If this directive is set, then script starts without
interactive subshell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%c The cursor column position
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i The indent of blank space,
equal the cursor column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%y The syntax type of current
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b The block file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f The current file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n Only the current file name
without extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%x The extension of current file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d The current directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%F The current file in the
unselected panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D The directory name of the
unselected panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t The currently tagged
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T The tagged files in the
unselected panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u and %U <br>
Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files
are untagged. You can use this macro only once per menu file
entry or extension file entry, because next time <br>
there will be no tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s and %S <br>
The selected files: The tagged files if there are any.
Otherwise the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feel free to edit this files, if
you need. Here is a sample external script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l comment selection <br>
TMPFILE=&lsquo;mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/up.XXXXXX&lsquo; ||
exit 1 <br>
echo #if 0 &gt; $TMPFILE <br>
cat %b &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE <br>
echo #endif &gt;&gt; $TMPFILE <br>
cat $TMPFILE &gt; %b <br>
rm -f $TMPFILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If some keys don&rsquo;t work,
you can use Learn Keys in the Options menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CODE NAVIGATION <br>
mcedit can be used for navigation through code with tags
files created by etags or ctags commands. If there is no
TAGS file code navigation will not work. For example, in
case <br>
of exuberant-ctags for C language command will be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctags -e --language-force=C -R
./</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta-Enter shows list box to
select item under cursor (cursor should stand at the end of
the word).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta-Minus where minus is symbol
&quot;-&quot; goes to previous function in navigation list
(like browser&rsquo;s Back button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta-Equal where equal is symbol
&quot;=&quot; goes to next function in navigation list (like
browser&rsquo;s Forward button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING <br>
mcedit supports syntax highlighting. This means that
keywords and contexts (like C comments, string constants,
etc) are highlighted in different colors. The following
section <br>
explains the format of the file ~/.config/mc/mcedit/Syntax.
If this file is missing, system-wide
/usr/share/mc/syntax/Syntax is used. The file
~/.config/mc/mcedit/Syntax is <br>
rescanned on opening of every new editor file. The file
contains rules for highlighting, each of which is given on a
separate line, and define which keywords will be highlighted
<br>
with what color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is divided into
sections, each beginning with a line with the file command.
The sections are normally put into separate files using the
include command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file command has three
arguments. The first argument is a regular expression that
is applied to the file name to determine if the following
section applies to the file. The <br>
second argument is the description of the file type. It is
used in cooledit; future versions of mcedit may use it as
well. The third optional argument is a regular expression
<br>
to match the first line of text of the file. The rules in
the following section apply if either the file name or the
first line of text matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A section ends with the start of
another section. Each section is divided into contexts, and
each context contains rules. A context is a scope within the
text that a particular <br>
set of rules belongs to. For instance, the text within a C
style comment (i.e. between /* and */) has its own color.
This is a context, although it has no further rules inside
<br>
it because there is probably nothing that we want
highlighted within a C comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A trivial C programming section
might look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file ..c Cogramle
(#include|/\</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wholechars
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># default colors <br>
define comment brown <br>
context default <br>
keyword whole if yellow <br>
keyword whole else yellow <br>
keyword whole for yellow <br>
keyword whole while yellow <br>
keyword whole do yellow <br>
keyword whole switch yellow <br>
keyword whole case yellow <br>
keyword whole static yellow <br>
keyword whole extern yellow <br>
keyword { brightcyan <br>
keyword } brightcyan <br>
keyword &rsquo;*&rsquo; green</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># C comments <br>
context / comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># C preprocessor directives <br>
context linestart # red <br>
keyword \ brightred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># C string constants <br>
context &quot; &quot; green <br>
keyword %d brightgreen <br>
keyword %s brightgreen <br>
keyword %c brightgreen <br>
keyword \&quot; brightgreen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each context starts with a line
of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context [exclusive]
[whole|wholeright|wholeleft] [linestart] delim [linestart]
delim [foreground] [background] [attributes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first context is an
exception. It must start with the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">context default [foreground]
[background] [attributes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise mcedit will report an
error. The linestart option specifies that delim must start
at the beginning of a line. The whole option tells that
delim must be a whole word. <br>
To specify that a word must begin on the word boundary only
on the left side, you can use the wholeleft option, and
similarly a word that must end on the word boundary is
speci&acirc; <br>
fied by wholeright.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set of characters that
constitute a whole word can be changed at any point in the
file with the wholechars command. The left and right set of
characters can be set sepa&acirc; <br>
rately with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wholechars [left|right]
characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exclusive option causes the
text between the delimiters to be highlighted, but not the
delimiters themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each rule is a line of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword
[whole|wholeright|wholeleft] [linestart] string foreground
[background] [attributes]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context or keyword strings are
interpreted, so that you can include tabs and spaces with
the sequences and Newlines and backslashes are specified
with and \ respec&acirc; <br>
tively. Since whitespace is used as a separator, it may not
be used as is. Also, must be used to specify an asterisk.
The * itself is a wildcard that matches any length of <br>
characters. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword &rsquo;*&rsquo;
green</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colors all C single character
constants green. You also could use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword &quot;*&quot; green</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to color string constants, but
the matched string would not be allowed to span across
multiple newlines. The wildcard may be used within context
delimiters as well, but you can&acirc; <br>
not have a wildcard as the last or first character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important to note is the
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword \ brightgreen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This line defines a keyword
containing the backslash and newline characters. Since the
keywords are matched before the context delimiters, this
keyword prevents the context from <br>
ending at the end of the lines that end in a backslash, thus
allowing C preprocessor directive to continue across
multiple lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible colors are: black,
gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow,
blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan,
lightgray and white. The spe&acirc; <br>
cial keyword &quot;default&quot; means the terminal&rsquo;s
default. Another special keyword &quot;base&quot; means
mc&rsquo;s main colors, it is useful as a placeholder if you
want to specify attributes with&acirc; <br>
out modifying the background color. When 256 colors are
available, they can be specified either as color16 to
color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the syntax file is shared
with cooledit, it is possible to specify different colors
for mcedit and cooledit by separating them with a slash,
e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword #include red/Orange</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcedit uses the color before the
slash. See cooledit(1) for supported cooledit colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes can be any of bold,
underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if
more than one are desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments may be put on a
separate line starting with the hash sign (#).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are describing case
insensitive language you need to use caseinsensitive
directive. It should be specified at the beginning of syntax
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the simplicity of the
implementation, there are a few intricacies that will not be
dealt with correctly but these are a minor irritation. On
the whole, a broad spec&acirc; <br>
trum of quite complicated situations are handled with these
simple rules. It is a good idea to take a look at the syntax
file to see some of the nifty tricks you can do with a <br>
little imagination. If you cannot get by with the rules I
have coded, and you think you have a rule that would be
useful, please email me with your request. However, do not
ask <br>
for regular expression support, because this is flatly
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A useful hint is to work with as
much as possible with the things you can do rather than try
to do things that this implementation cannot deal with. Also
remember that the aim <br>
of syntax highlighting is to make programming less prone to
error, not to make code look pretty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax highlighting can be
toggled using Ctrl-s shortcut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLORS <br>
The default colors may be changed by appending to the
MC_COLOR_TABLE environment variable. Foreground and
background colors pairs may be specified for example
with:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">MC_COLOR_TABLE=&quot;$MC_COLOR_TABLE:
editnormal=lightgray,black: editbold=yellow,black:
editmarked=black,cyan&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Most options can be set from Options dialog box. See the
Options menu. The following options are defined in
~/.config/mc/ini and have obvious counterparts in the dialog
box. <br>
You can modify them to change the editor behavior, by
editing the file. Unless specified, a 1 sets the option to
on, and a 0 sets it to off, as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_internal_edit <br>
This option is ignored when invoking mcedit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_tab_spacing <br>
Interpret the tab character as being of this length. Default
is 8. You should avoid using other than 8 since most other
editors and text viewers assume a tab spacing of <br>
8. Use editor_fake_half_tabs to simulate a smaller tab
spacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces
<br>
Never insert a tab character. Rather insert spaces (ascii
32) to fill to the desired tab size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_return_does_auto_indent
<br>
Pressing return will tab across to match the indentation of
the first line above that has text on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_backspace_through_tabs
<br>
Make a single backspace delete all the space to the left
margin if there is no text between the cursor and the left
margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_fake_half_tabs <br>
This will emulate a half tab for those who want to program
with a tab spacing of 4, but do not want the tab size
changed from 8 (so that the code will be formatted the <br>
same when displayed by other programs). When editing between
text and the left margin, moving and tabbing will be as
though a tab space were 4, while actually using spaces <br>
and normal tabs for an optimal fill. When editing anywhere
else, a normal tab is inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_option_save_mode <br>
Possible values 0, 1 and 2. The save mode (see the options
menu also) allows you to change the method of saving a file.
Quick save (0) saves the file immediately, trun&acirc; <br>
cating the disk file to zero length (i.e. erasing it) and
then writing the editor contents to the file. This method is
fast, but dangerous, since a system error during a <br>
file save will leave the file only partially written,
possibly rendering the data irretrievable. When saving, the
safe save (1) option enables creation of a temporary <br>
file into which the file contents are first written. In the
event of a problem, the original file is untouched. When the
temporary file is successfully written, it is <br>
renamed to the name of the original file, thus replacing it.
The safest method is create backups (2): a backup file is
created before any changes are made. You can spec&acirc;
<br>
ify your own backup file extension in the dialog. Note that
saving twice will replace your backup as well as your
original file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_word_wrap_line_length
<br>
Line length to wrap at. Default is 72.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_backup_extension <br>
Symbol to add to name of backup files. Default is
&quot;~&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_line_state <br>
Show state line of editor. Currently it shows current line
number (in the future it might show things like folding,
breakpoints, etc.). M-n toggles this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_visible_spaces <br>
Toggle &quot;show visible trailing spaces&quot;. If
editor_visible_spaces=1, they are shown as
&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_visible_tabs <br>
Toggle &quot;show visible tabs&quot;. If
editor_visible_tabs=1, tabs are shown as
&rsquo;&lt;----&gt;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_persistent_selections
<br>
Do not remove block selection after cursor movement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_cursor_beyond_eol <br>
Allow moving cursor beyond the end of line.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_cursor_after_inserted_block
<br>
Allow moving cursor after inserted block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_syntax_highlighting <br>
enable syntax highlighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_edit_confirm_save <br>
Show confirmation dialog on save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_option_typewriter_wrap
<br>
to be described</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_option_auto_para_formatting
<br>
to be described</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_option_save_position <br>
save file position on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_codepage <br>
symbol representation of codepage name for file (i.e.
CP1251, ~ - default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_group_undo <br>
do UNDO for several of the same type of action
(inserting/overwriting, deleting, navigating, typing)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
<br>
Search autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just
from begin of file to cursor position (0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spell_language <br>
Spelling language (en, en-variant_0, ru, etc) installed with
aspell package (a full list can be get using
&rsquo;aspell&rsquo; utility). Use spell_language = NONE to
disable aspell <br>
support. Default value is &rsquo;en&rsquo;. Option must
located in the [Misc] section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS <br>
You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace a
C format string. First take a look at the sscanf and sprintf
man pages to see what a format string is and how it <br>
works. Here&rsquo;s an example: suppose that you want to
replace all occurrences of an open bracket, three comma
separated numbers, and a close bracket, with the word
apples, the <br>
third number, the word oranges and then the second number.
You would fill in the Replace dialog box as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter search string <br>
(%d,%d,%d) <br>
Enter replace string <br>
apples %d oranges %d <br>
Enter replacement argument order <br>
3,2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last line specifies that the
third and then the second number are to be used in place of
the first and second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is advisable to use this
feature with Prompt On Replace on, because a match is
thought to be found whenever the number of arguments found
matches the number given, which is <br>
not always a real match. Scanf also treats whitespace as
being elastic. Note that the scanf format %[ is very useful
for scanning strings, and whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The editor also displays non-us
characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set
display bits to 7 bits in the Midnight Commander options
menu to keep the spacing <br>
clean.</p>
