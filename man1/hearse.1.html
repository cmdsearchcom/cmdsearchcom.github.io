<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hearse - exchange Nethack bones files with other players</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hearse [-b | --bones-dir dir] [--bones-mode mode] [-c |
--config-file file] [--cron] [--debug] [--delete-uploaded]
[--help] [--lock-file file] [-q | --quiet] [--run-as-me]

[--user-token token] [--user-token-file file]
[--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Nethack sometimes saves the level on which you die
(including your stuff, what killed you, and your ghost) in a
&quot;bones file&quot;. These files get loaded into later
Nethack games. <br>
If you&rsquo;re the only Nethack player on your system
you&rsquo;ll only get bones files you created yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hearse lets you automatically
exchange Nethack bones file with other players. When run it
uploads any new bones files it finds on your system, then
downloads any bones files the <br>
server feels like giving it. See
&lt;http://www.argon.org/~roderick/hearse/&gt; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An important thing to note is
that by default using hearse will cause you to end up with
more bones than you otherwise would have. This changes the
game&rsquo;s balance and is <br>
considered by many players to be a mild form of cheating.
You can address this by turning on the --delete-uploaded
option, but the down side is you&rsquo;ll never encounter
your own <br>
bones files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to use the Hearse
server, you&rsquo;ve got to supply your email address. Do
this by using the --user-email switch the first time you use
the program, or by putting <br>
&quot;user-email address&quot; in the config file. Your
email address will only be used to contact you about Hearse,
and will never be given to any third party. If you enter an
invalid <br>
address, the server won&rsquo;t be able to support you if
you download a bad bones file, and will be forced to ban you
if any of your uploaded files are bad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hearse was set up as a service
to the Nethack community. Please respect that; abuse of the
service can only lead to it being removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK START <br>
The defaults are set up for a Linux system using a nethack
binary which is either set-uid or set-gid games. If this is
what you&rsquo;ve got, as root run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># hearse --user-email
your@address.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one time by hand, then put</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 3 * * * root perl -we
&rsquo;sleep rand 3600&rsquo;; hearse --quiet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in /etc/crontab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
hearse comes with default values for its various
configuration settings which match the way many Linux
systems are set up. If any of them don&rsquo;t match your
system, you can either <br>
change them in a configuration file, or you can specify the
right values via command line switches. This last
isn&rsquo;t as onerous as it sounds, because most people run
it from <br>
cron. You can put the switches in the crontab file and leave
it at that. If you&rsquo;d rather use a configuration file,
you can use the default location (/etc/nethack/hearse.conf),
<br>
or use the -c (aka --config-file) switch to specify the file
you&rsquo;d like to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file can
specify all of the options for which it makes sense, using
the long version of the option name followed by the value.
Blank and commented lines are <br>
ignored in the usual fashion. A string value can be given as
&quot;-&quot; to mean the empty string. Booleans can use
on/off/true/false/yes/no/1/0. A sample hearse.conf is
included with <br>
the distribution. Eg,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bones-dir
/local/games/nethackdir <br>
bones-mode 600 <br>
quiet on <br>
run-as-user daemon <br>
run-as-group - <br>
user-token-file
/local/games/nethackdir/hearse.user-token</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRIVILEGES <br>
hearse needs to run with permissions like those used by
Nethack itself, so that it can read and write the bones
files. It should not be made set-uid or set-gid, though; it
<br>
hasn&rsquo;t been audited for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default configuration will
try to set both the user and group ids to &quot;games&quot;.
Nethack itself will generally only be set-id to either one
or the other, but using both hurts <br>
nothing and allows hearse to run as-is on more systems. This
will only work if you run hearse as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to disable
hearse&rsquo;s id setting and take care of it externally you
can use the --run-as-me switch to turn it off, or the
--run-as-user and --run-as-group switches for <br>
finer grained control. Specify &rsquo;&rsquo; or
&quot;-&quot; for either of the latter to disable just that
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING FROM CRON <br>
If you&rsquo;re using the pre-packaged .deb or .rpm version
of hearse, the program is already set up to run
automatically (both daily and when you connect to the
Internet). You don&rsquo;t <br>
have to do anything unless you want to change this behavior.
If you&rsquo;re installing hearse by hand, read on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The normal way to use the
program is to run it from cron, either daily or on whatever
schedule you like. (There&rsquo;s no harm in running it
often, if it doesn&rsquo;t find any new bones <br>
files it doesn&rsquo;t even contact the server.) If letting
it manage its own permissions, you&rsquo;d just run it as
root. Eg, to run it some time in the 3:00 hour, put
something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 3 * * * root perl -we
&rsquo;sleep rand 3600&rsquo;; hearse --quiet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in /etc/crontab. The
randomization is to prevent the server from getting hammered
at the top of each time zone&rsquo;s 3:00 hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;d like to see what
the server&rsquo;s doing, you can use --cron rather than
--quiet. This will cause it to output its status message,
but only when it actually transfers a <br>
bones file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING FOR MULTIPLE NETHACK
VARIANTS <br>
If you use multiple Nethack variants which are supported by
the Hearse server, you can run hearse for all of them. The
normal way to do this is to run hearse once for each <br>
variant, specifying the bones directory on the command
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># hearse -b
/var/games/slashem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leaving the rest of the
configuration settings to be read from the configuration
file. The last upload time is by default stored in the bones
directory, so everything just <br>
works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Hearse protocol requires
that you have only a single concurrent connection for each
user account (it decides what kind of bones file to send you
based on the kind you most <br>
recently uploaded), so hearse does locking on the user token
file in order to ensure this. See the --lock-file switch for
more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --bones-dir dir <br>
Specify the bones directory. By default the program uses the
first of /var/games/nethack, /usr/games/lib/nethackdir, and
the current directory which contains a file called <br>
record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bones-mode mode <br>
Specify the mode for the bones files hearse creates. The
default is 660.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config-file file <br>
Specify an alternative configuration file. The default is
/etc/nethack/hearse.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cron <br>
Suppress the &quot;no bones to upload&quot; message. This
makes it so that there&rsquo;s no output at all when
there&rsquo;s nothing to do, but you still see what&rsquo;s
going on when bones files are <br>
transfered. This is a nice way to run it from cron if you
want to keep an eye on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turn debugging on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-uploaded <br>
Delete locally generated bones files after uploading them.
Some people might want to do this in order to avoid changing
the game&rsquo;s balance. Since the server normally gives
<br>
you 1 bones file for each one you upload, if you delete your
local bones after uploading them you&rsquo;ll end up with
the same number of bones you otherwise would have had, but
<br>
they&rsquo;ll be somebody else&rsquo;s rather than your
own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Show the usage message and die.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-file file <br>
The Hearse protocol requires that hearse do locking to be
sure that only a single connection per user can happen at a
time. It does this by locking the --user-token-file. <br>
You should not generally change this, but if you have
special requirements (that that file be read only, eg), you
can override it with this switch. Use &rsquo;&rsquo; to
disable locking <br>
(which I do not recommend).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Don&rsquo;t output information messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-as-me <br>
Turn off both --run-as-user and --run-as-group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-as-user user <br>
Use user as the real and effecitve user id, default
&quot;games&quot;. You&rsquo;ve generally got to be root for
this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run-as-group group <br>
Use group as the real and effecitve group id, default
&quot;games&quot;. You&rsquo;ve generally got to be root for
this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server-url url <br>
Specify the URL for the server program. See the source or
the --help message for the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stamp-file file <br>
hearse only tries to upload bones files which were created
since the last time it sucessfully talked to the server. The
modification time of the --stamp-file <br>
(.hearse.timestamp by default) tells it when that was. This
path is taken relative to the --bones-dir (unless it&rsquo;s
absolute).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user-email address <br>
Specify your email address. You only have to do this the
first time you run hearse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user-token token <br>
Specify your user token directly. You won&rsquo;t normally
need to do this, as hearse requests the token from the
server and stores it in the --user-token-file for later <br>
retrieval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user-token-file file <br>
Specify the file used to store the user token, by default
/etc/nethack/hearse.user-token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version number and exit.</p>
