Nethack sometimes saves the level on which you die (including your stuff, what
  killed you, and your ghost) in a &quot;bones file&quot;. These files get
  loaded into later Nethack games. If you're the only Nethack player on your
  system you'll only get bones files you created yourself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>hearse</b> lets you automatically exchange Nethack bones file with other
  players. When run it uploads any new bones files it finds on your system, then
  downloads any bones files the server feels like giving it. See
  &lt;http://www.argon.org/~roderick/hearse/&gt; for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An important thing to note is that by default using <b>hearse</b> will cause you
  to end up with more bones than you otherwise would have. This changes the
  game's balance and is considered by many players to be a mild form of
  cheating. You can address this by turning on the <b>--delete-uploaded</b>
  option, but the down side is you'll never encounter your own bones files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to use the Hearse server, you've got to supply your email address. Do
  this by using the <b>--user-email</b> switch the first time you use the
  program, or by putting &quot;user-email <i>address</i>&quot; in the config
  file. Your email address will only be used to contact you about Hearse, and
  will never be given to any third party. If you enter an invalid address, the
  server won't be able to support you if you download a bad bones file, and will
  be forced to ban you if any of your uploaded files are bad.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hearse was set up as a service to the Nethack community. Please respect that;
  abuse of the service can only lead to it being removed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="QUICK_START"><a class="selflink" href="#QUICK_START">QUICK
  START</a></h1>
The defaults are set up for a Linux system using a nethack binary which is
  either set-uid or set-gid games. If this is what you've got, as root run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # hearse --user-email your@address.com
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
one time by hand, then put
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    0 3 * * * root perl -we 'sleep rand 3600'; hearse --quiet
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
in <i>/etc/crontab</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<b>hearse</b> comes with default values for its various configuration settings
  which match the way many Linux systems are set up. If any of them don't match
  your system, you can either change them in a configuration file, or you can
  specify the right values via command line switches. This last isn't as onerous
  as it sounds, because most people run it from cron. You can put the switches
  in the crontab file and leave it at that. If you'd rather use a configuration
  file, you can use the default location ( <i>/etc/nethack/hearse.conf</i>), or
  use the <b>-c</b> (aka <b>--config-file</b>) switch to specify the file you'd
  like to use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The configuration file can specify all of the options for which it makes sense,
  using the long version of the option name followed by the value. Blank and
  commented lines are ignored in the usual fashion. A string value can be given
  as &quot;-&quot; to mean the empty string. Booleans can use
  on/off/true/false/yes/no/1/0. A sample <i>hearse.conf</i> is included with the
  distribution. Eg,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    bones-dir           /local/games/nethackdir
    bones-mode          600
    quiet               on
    run-as-user         daemon
    run-as-group        -
    user-token-file     /local/games/nethackdir/hearse.user-token
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PRIVILEGES"><a class="selflink" href="#PRIVILEGES">PRIVILEGES</a></h1>
<b>hearse</b> needs to run with permissions like those used by Nethack itself,
  so that it can read and write the bones files. It should not be made set-uid
  or set-gid, though; it hasn't been audited for that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default configuration will try to set both the user and group ids to
  &quot;games&quot;. Nethack itself will generally only be set-id to either one
  or the other, but using both hurts nothing and allows <b>hearse</b> to run
  as-is on more systems. This will only work if you run <b>hearse</b> as root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to disable <b>hearse</b>'s id setting and take care of it externally
  you can use the <b>--run-as-me</b> switch to turn it off, or the
  <b>--run-as-user</b> and <b>--run-as-group</b> switches for finer grained
  control. Specify '' or &quot;-&quot; for either of the latter to disable just
  that thing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNNING_FROM_CRON"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNNING_FROM_CRON">RUNNING
  FROM CRON</a></h1>
If you're using the pre-packaged <i>.deb</i> or <i>.rpm</i> version of
  <b>hearse</b>, the program is already set up to run automatically (both daily
  and when you connect to the Internet). You don't have to do anything unless
  you want to change this behavior. If you're installing <b>hearse</b> by hand,
  read on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The normal way to use the program is to run it from cron, either daily or on
  whatever schedule you like. (There's no harm in running it often, if it
  doesn't find any new bones files it doesn't even contact the server.) If
  letting it manage its own permissions, you'd just run it as root. Eg, to run
  it some time in the 3:00 hour, put something like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    0 3 * * * root perl -we 'sleep rand 3600'; hearse --quiet
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
in <i>/etc/crontab</i>. The randomization is to prevent the server from getting
  hammered at the top of each time zone's 3:00 hour.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you'd like to see what the server's doing, you can use <b>--cron</b> rather
  than <b>--quiet</b>. This will cause it to output its status message, but only
  when it actually transfers a bones file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNNING_FOR_MULTIPLE_NETHACK_VARIANTS"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNNING_FOR_MULTIPLE_NETHACK_VARIANTS">RUNNING
  FOR MULTIPLE NETHACK VARIANTS</a></h1>
If you use multiple Nethack variants which are supported by the Hearse server,
  you can run <b>hearse</b> for all of them. The normal way to do this is to run
  <b>hearse</b> once for each variant, specifying the bones directory on the
  command line
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # hearse -b /var/games/slashem
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
leaving the rest of the configuration settings to be read from the configuration
  file. The last upload time is by default stored in the bones directory, so
  everything just works.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Hearse protocol requires that you have only a single concurrent connection
  for each user account (it decides what kind of bones file to send you based on
  the kind you most recently uploaded), so <b>hearse</b> does locking on the
  user token file in order to ensure this. See the <b>--lock-file</b> switch for
  more info.

      with the same number of bones you otherwise would have had, but they'll be
