<p>PERL5100DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5100DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5100delta - what is new for perl 5.10.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes the differences between the 5.8.8
release and the 5.10.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the bug fixes in 5.10.0
were already seen in the 5.8.X maintenance releases; they
are not duplicated here and are documented in the set of man
pages named <br>
perl58[1-8]?delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
The &quot;feature&quot; pragma <br>
The &quot;feature&quot; pragma is used to enable new syntax
that would break Perl&rsquo;s backwards-compatibility with
older releases of the language. It&rsquo;s a lexical pragma,
like &quot;strict&quot; or <br>
&quot;warnings&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the following new
features are available: &quot;switch&quot; (adds a switch
statement), &quot;say&quot; (adds a &quot;say&quot; built-in
function), and &quot;state&quot; (adds a &quot;state&quot;
keyword for declaring <br>
&quot;static&quot; variables). Those features are described
in their own sections of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;feature&quot; pragma
is also implicitly loaded when you require a minimal perl
version (with the &quot;use VERSION&quot; construct) greater
than, or equal to, 5.9.5. See feature for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New -E command-line switch <br>
-E is equivalent to -e, but it implicitly enables all
optional features (like &quot;use feature
&quot;:5.10&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defined-or operator <br>
A new operator &quot;//&quot; (defined-or) has been
implemented. The following expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a // $b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is merely equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined $a ? $a : $b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the statement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$c //= $d;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can now be used instead of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$c = $d unless defined $c;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;//&quot; operator has
the same precedence and associativity as &quot;||&quot;.
Special care has been taken to ensure that this operator Do
What You Mean while not breaking old code, but <br>
some edge cases involving the empty regular expression may
now parse differently. See perlop for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch and Smart Match operator
<br>
Perl 5 now has a switch statement. It&rsquo;s available when
&quot;use feature &rsquo;switch&rsquo;&quot; is in effect.
This feature introduces three new keywords,
&quot;given&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, and
&quot;default&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">given ($foo) { <br>
when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; } <br>
when (/^def/) { $def = 1; } <br>
when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; } <br>
default { $nothing = 1; } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more complete description of
how Perl matches the switch variable against the
&quot;when&quot; conditions is given in &quot;Switch
statements&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This kind of match is called
smart match, and it&rsquo;s also possible to use it outside
of switch statements, via the new &quot;~~&quot; operator.
See &quot;Smart matching in detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature was contributed by
Robin Houston.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions <br>
Recursive Patterns <br>
It is now possible to write recursive patterns without using
the &quot;(??{})&quot; construct. This new way is more
efficient, and in many cases easier to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each capturing parenthesis can
now be treated as an independent pattern that can be entered
by using the &quot;(?PARNO)&quot; syntax (&quot;PARNO&quot;
standing for &quot;parenthesis number&quot;). For <br>
example, the following pattern will match nested balanced
angle brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ <br>
^ # start of line <br>
( # start capture buffer 1 <br>
&lt; # match an opening angle bracket <br>
(?: # match one of: <br>
(?&gt; # don&rsquo;t backtrack over the inside of this group
<br>
[^&lt;&gt;]+ # one or more non angle brackets <br>
) # end non backtracking group <br>
| # ... or ... <br>
(?1) # recurse to bracket 1 and try it again <br>
)* # 0 or more times. <br>
&gt; # match a closing angle bracket <br>
) # end capture buffer one <br>
$ # end of line <br>
/x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCRE users should note that
Perl&rsquo;s recursive regex feature allows backtracking
into a recursed pattern, whereas in PCRE the recursion is
atomic or &quot;possessive&quot; in nature. As <br>
in the example above, you can add (?&gt;) to control this
selectively. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Named Capture Buffers <br>
It is now possible to name capturing parenthesis in a
pattern and refer to the captured contents by name. The
naming syntax is &quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;....)&quot;. It&rsquo;s
possible to <br>
backreference to a named buffer with the
&quot;NAME&gt;&quot; syntax. In code, the new magical hashes
&quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%-&quot; can be used to access the
contents of the capture buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, to replace all doubled
chars with a single copy, one could write</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">s/(?&lt;letter&gt;.)letter&gt;/$+{letter}/g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only buffers with defined
contents will be &quot;visible&quot; in the &quot;%+&quot;
hash, so it&rsquo;s possible to do something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreach my $name (keys %+) {
<br>
print &quot;content of buffer &rsquo;$name&rsquo; is
$+{$name}0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;%-&quot; hash is a bit
more complete, since it will contain array refs holding
values from all capture buffers similarly named, if there
should be many of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%+&quot; and
&quot;%-&quot; are implemented as tied hashes through the
new module &quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users exposed to the .NET regex
engine will find that the perl implementation differs in
that the numerical ordering of the buffers is sequential,
and not &quot;unnamed first, <br>
then named&quot;. Thus in the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/(A)(?&lt;B&gt;B)(C)(?&lt;D&gt;D)/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$1 will be &rsquo;A&rsquo;, $2
will be &rsquo;B&rsquo;, $3 will be &rsquo;C&rsquo; and $4
will be &rsquo;D&rsquo; and not $1 is &rsquo;A&rsquo;, $2 is
&rsquo;C&rsquo; and $3 is &rsquo;B&rsquo; and $4 is
&rsquo;D&rsquo; that a .NET programmer would expect. This is
<br>
considered a feature. :-) (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possessive Quantifiers <br>
Perl now supports the &quot;possessive quantifier&quot;
syntax of the &quot;atomic match&quot; pattern. Basically a
possessive quantifier matches as much as it can and never
gives any back. Thus <br>
it can be used to control backtracking. The syntax is
similar to non-greedy matching, except instead of using a
&rsquo;?&rsquo; as the modifier the &rsquo;+&rsquo; is used.
Thus &quot;?+&quot;, &quot;*+&quot;, &quot;++&quot;, <br>
&quot;{min,max}+&quot; are now legal quantifiers. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backtracking control verbs <br>
The regex engine now supports a number of special-purpose
backtrack control verbs: (*THEN), (*PRUNE), (*MARK),
(*SKIP), (*COMMIT), (*FAIL) and (*ACCEPT). See perlre for
their <br>
descriptions. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative backreferences <br>
A new syntax &quot;N}&quot; or &quot;&quot; where
&quot;N&quot; is a decimal integer allows a safer form of
back-reference notation as well as allowing relative
backreferences. This should make it <br>
easier to generate and embed patterns that contain
backreferences. See &quot;Capture buffers&quot; in perlre.
(Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;K&quot; escape <br>
The functionality of Jeff Pinyan&rsquo;s module Regexp::Keep
has been added to the core. In regular expressions you can
now use the special escape &quot;K&quot; as a way to do
something <br>
like floating length positive lookbehind. It is also useful
in substitutions like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s/(foo)bar/$1/g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">that can now be converted to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s/fooKbar//g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is much more efficient.
(Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vertical and horizontal
whitespace, and linebreak <br>
Regular expressions now recognize the &quot;nd &quot;scapes
that match vertical and horizontal whitespace, respectively.
&quot; and &quot;ogically match their complements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; generic linebreak, that
is, vertical whitespace, plus the multi-character sequence
&quot;DA&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;say()&quot; <br>
say() is a new built-in, only available when &quot;use
feature &rsquo;say&rsquo;&quot; is in effect, that is
similar to print(), but that implicitly appends a newline to
the printed string. See &quot;say&quot; <br>
in perlfunc. (Robin Houston)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical $_ <br>
The default variable $_ can now be lexicalized, by declaring
it like any other lexical variable, with a simple</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $_;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operations that default on
$_ will use the lexically-scoped version of $_ when it
exists, instead of the global $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a &quot;map&quot; or a
&quot;grep&quot; block, if $_ was previously my&rsquo;ed,
then the $_ inside the block is lexical as well (and scoped
to the block).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a scope where $_ has been
lexicalized, you can still have access to the global version
of $_ by using $::_, or, more simply, by overriding the
lexical declaration with &quot;our <br>
$_&quot;. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;_&quot; prototype <br>
A new prototype character has been added. &quot;_&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;$&quot; but defaults to $_ if the
corresponding argument isn&rsquo;t supplied (both
&quot;$&quot; and &quot;_&quot; denote a scalar). Due to the
<br>
optional nature of the argument, you can only use it at the
end of a prototype, or before a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has a small incompatible
consequence: the prototype() function has been adjusted to
return &quot;_&quot; for some built-ins in appropriate cases
(for example, <br>
&quot;prototype(&rsquo;CORE::rmdir&rsquo;)&quot;). (Rafael
Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITCHECK blocks <br>
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, a new special code block has been
introduced, in addition to &quot;BEGIN&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot; and &quot;END&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;CHECK&quot; and
&quot;INIT&quot; blocks, while useful for some specialized
purposes, are always executed at the transition between the
compilation and the execution of the main program, and <br>
thus are useless whenever code is loaded at runtime. On the
other hand, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are executed just
after the unit which defined them has been compiled. See
perlmod for <br>
more information. (Alex Gough)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Pragma, &quot;mro&quot; <br>
A new pragma, &quot;mro&quot; (for Method Resolution Order)
has been added. It permits to switch, on a per-class basis,
the algorithm that perl uses to find inherited methods in
case of a <br>
multiple inheritance hierarchy. The default MRO hasn&rsquo;t
changed (DFS, for Depth First Search). Another MRO is
available: the C3 algorithm. See mro for more information.
(Brandon <br>
Black)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, due to changes in the
implementation of class hierarchy search, code that used to
undef the *ISA glob will most probably break. Anyway,
undef&rsquo;ing *ISA had the side- <br>
effect of removing the magic on the @ISA array and should
not have been done in the first place. Also, the cache
*::ISA::CACHE:: no longer exists; to force reset the @ISA
cache, <br>
you now need to use the &quot;mro&quot; API, or more simply
to assign to @ISA (e.g. with &quot;@ISA = @ISA&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdir() may return a
&quot;short filename&quot; on Windows <br>
The readdir() function may return a &quot;short
filename&quot; when the long filename contains characters
outside the ANSI codepage. Similarly Cwd::cwd() may return a
short directory <br>
name, and glob() may return short names as well. On the NTFS
file system these short names can always be represented in
the ANSI codepage. This will not be true for all other <br>
file system drivers; e.g. the FAT filesystem stores short
filenames in the OEM codepage, so some files on FAT volumes
remain unaccessible through the ANSI APIs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, $^X, @INC, and
$ENV{PATH} are preprocessed at startup to make sure all
paths are valid in the ANSI codepage (if possible).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Win32::GetLongPathName()
function now returns the UTF-8 encoded correct long file
name instead of using replacement characters to force the
name into the ANSI codepage. The <br>
new Win32::GetANSIPathName() function can be used to turn a
long pathname into a short one only if the long one cannot
be represented in the ANSI codepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many other functions in the
&quot;Win32&quot; module have been improved to accept UTF-8
encoded arguments. Please see Win32 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readpipe() is now overridable
<br>
The built-in function readpipe() is now overridable.
Overriding it permits also to override its operator
counterpart, &quot;qx//&quot; (a.k.a.
&quot;&lsquo;&lsquo;&quot;). Moreover, it now defaults to $_
if no <br>
argument is provided. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default argument for readline()
<br>
readline() now defaults to *ARGV if no argument is provided.
(Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">state() variables <br>
A new class of variables has been introduced. State
variables are similar to &quot;my&quot; variables, but are
declared with the &quot;state&quot; keyword in place of
&quot;my&quot;. They&rsquo;re visible only in <br>
their lexical scope, but their value is persistent: unlike
&quot;my&quot; variables, they&rsquo;re not undefined at
scope entry, but retain their previous value. (Rafael
Garcia-Suarez, Nicholas <br>
Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use state variables, one
needs to enable them by using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use feature
&rsquo;state&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or by using the &quot;-E&quot;
command-line switch in one-liners. See &quot;Persistent
Private Variables&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stacked filetest operators <br>
As a new form of syntactic sugar, it&rsquo;s now possible to
stack up filetest operators. You can now write &quot;-f -w
-x $file&quot; in a row to mean &quot;-x $file &amp;&amp; -w
_ &amp;&amp; -f _&quot;. See &quot;-X&quot; in <br>
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIVERSAL::DOES() <br>
The &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; class has a new method,
&quot;DOES()&quot;. It has been added to solve semantic
problems with the &quot;isa()&quot; method.
&quot;isa()&quot; checks for inheritance, while
&quot;DOES()&quot; has been <br>
designed to be overridden when module authors use other
types of relations between classes (in addition to
inheritance). (chromatic)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &quot;$obj-&gt;DOES( ROLE
)&quot; in UNIVERSAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats <br>
Formats were improved in several ways. A new field,
&quot;^*&quot;, can be used for variable-width,
one-line-at-a-time text. Null characters are now handled
correctly in picture lines. <br>
Using &quot;@#&quot; and &quot;~~&quot; together will now
produce a compile-time error, as those format fields are
incompatible. perlform has been improved, and miscellaneous
bugs fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Byte-order modifiers for pack()
and unpack() <br>
There are two new byte-order modifiers, &quot;&gt;&quot;
(big-endian) and &quot;&lt;&quot; (little-endian), that can
be appended to most pack() and unpack() template characters
and groups to force a <br>
certain byte-order for that type or group. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc and perlpacktut for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;no VERSION&quot; <br>
You can now use &quot;no&quot; followed by a version number
to specify that you want to use a version of perl older than
the specified one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;chdir&quot;,
&quot;chmod&quot; and &quot;chown&quot; on filehandles <br>
&quot;chdir&quot;, &quot;chmod&quot; and &quot;chown&quot;
can now work on filehandles as well as filenames, if the
system supports respectively &quot;fchdir&quot;,
&quot;fchmod&quot; and &quot;fchown&quot;, thanks to a patch
provided by <br>
Gisle Aas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS groups <br>
$( and $) now return groups in the order where the OS
returns them, thanks to Gisle Aas. This wasn&rsquo;t
previously the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive sort subs <br>
You can now use recursive subroutines with sort(), thanks to
Robin Houston.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exceptions in constant folding
<br>
The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception
handler, and if folding throws an exception (such as
attempting to evaluate 0/0), perl now retains the current
optree, <br>
rather than aborting the whole program. Without this change,
programs would not compile if they had expressions that
happened to generate exceptions, even though those <br>
expressions were in code that could never be reached at
runtime. (Nicholas Clark, Dave Mitchell)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source filters in @INC <br>
It&rsquo;s possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine
hooks in @INC by adding a source filter on top of the
filehandle opened and returned by the hook. This feature was
planned a <br>
long time ago, but wasn&rsquo;t quite working until now. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for details. (Nicholas
Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New internal variables <br>
&quot;${^RE_DEBUG_FLAGS}&quot; <br>
This variable controls what debug flags are in effect for
the regular expression engine when running under &quot;use
re &quot;debug&quot;&quot;. See re for details.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;
<br>
This variable gives the native status returned by the last
pipe close, backtick command, successful call to wait() or
waitpid(), or from the system() operator. See perlvar <br>
for details. (Contributed by Gisle Aas.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}&quot;
<br>
See &quot;Trie optimisation of literal string
alternations&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}&quot;
<br>
See &quot;Sloppy stat on Windows&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
&quot;unpack()&quot; now defaults to unpacking the $_
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mkdir()&quot; without
arguments now defaults to $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The internal dump output has
been improved, so that non-printable characters such as
newline and backspace are output in &quot;otation, rather
than octal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C option can no longer be
used on the &quot;#!&quot; line. It wasn&rsquo;t working
there anyway, since the standard streams are already set up
at this point in the execution of the perl <br>
interpreter. You can use binmode() instead to get the
desired behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UCD 5.0.0 <br>
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl
5 has been updated to version 5.0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAD <br>
MAD, which stands for Miscellaneous Attribute Decoration, is
a still-in-development work leading to a Perl 5 to Perl 6
converter. To enable it, it&rsquo;s necessary to pass the
<br>
argument &quot;-Dmad&quot; to Configure. The obtained perl
isn&rsquo;t binary compatible with a regular perl 5.10, and
has space and speed penalties; moreover not all regression
tests still pass <br>
with it. (Larry Wall, Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill() on Windows <br>
On Windows platforms, &quot;kill(-9, $pid)&quot; now kills a
process tree. (On Unix, this delivers the signal to all
processes in the same process group.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
Packing and UTF-8 strings <br>
The semantics of pack() and unpack() regarding UTF-8-encoded
data has been changed. Processing is now by default
character per character instead of byte per byte on the <br>
underlying encoding. Notably, code that used things like
&quot;pack(&quot;a*&quot;, $string)&quot; to see through the
encoding of string will now simply get back the original
$string. Packed strings <br>
can also get upgraded during processing when you store
upgraded characters. You can get the old behaviour by using
&quot;use bytes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be consistent with pack(),
the &quot;C0&quot; in unpack() templates indicates that the
data is to be processed in character mode, i.e. character by
character; on the contrary, &quot;U0&quot; in <br>
unpack() indicates UTF-8 mode, where the packed string is
processed in its UTF-8-encoded Unicode form on a byte by
byte basis. This is reversed with regard to perl 5.8.X, but
now <br>
consistent between pack() and unpack().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, &quot;C0&quot; and
&quot;U0&quot; can also be used in pack() templates to
specify respectively character and byte modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;C0&quot; and
&quot;U0&quot; in the middle of a pack or unpack format now
switch to the specified encoding mode, honoring parens
grouping. Previously, parens were ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, there is a new pack()
character format, &quot;W&quot;, which is intended to
replace the old &quot;C&quot;. &quot;C&quot; is kept for
unsigned chars coded as bytes in the strings internal
representation. <br>
&quot;W&quot; represents unsigned (logical) character
values, which can be greater than 255. It is therefore more
robust when dealing with potentially UTF-8-encoded data (as
&quot;C&quot; will wrap <br>
values outside the range 0..255, and not respect the string
encoding).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In practice, that means that
pack formats are now encoding-neutral, except
&quot;C&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For consistency, &quot;A&quot;
in unpack() format now trims all Unicode whitespace from the
end of the string. Before perl 5.9.2, it used to strip only
the classical ASCII space <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Byte/character count feature in
unpack() <br>
A new unpack() template character, &quot;.&quot;, returns
the number of bytes or characters (depending on the selected
encoding mode, see above) read so far.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The $* and $# variables have
been removed <br>
$*, which was deprecated in favor of the &quot;/s&quot; and
&quot;/m&quot; regexp modifiers, has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The deprecated $# variable
(output format for numbers) has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two new severe warnings,
&quot;$#/$* is no longer supported&quot;, have been
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">substr() lvalues are no longer
fixed-length <br>
The lvalues returned by the three argument form of substr()
used to be a &quot;fixed length window&quot; on the original
string. In some cases this could cause surprising action at
<br>
distance or other undefined behaviour. Now the length of the
window adjusts itself to the length of the string assigned
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parsing of &quot;-f _&quot; <br>
The identifier &quot;_&quot; is now forced to be a bareword
after a filetest operator. This solves a number of
misparsing issues when a global &quot;_&quot; subroutine is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;:unique&quot; <br>
The &quot;:unique&quot; attribute has been made a no-op,
since its current implementation was fundamentally flawed
and not threadsafe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Effect of pragmas in eval <br>
The compile-time value of the &quot;%^H&quot; hint variable
can now propagate into eval(&quot;&quot;)uated code. This
makes it more useful to implement lexical pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a side-effect of this, the
overloaded-ness of constants now propagates into
eval(&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir FOO <br>
A bareword argument to chdir() is now recognized as a file
handle. Earlier releases interpreted the bareword as a
directory name. (Gisle Aas)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of .pmc files <br>
An old feature of perl was that before &quot;require&quot;
or &quot;use&quot; look for a file with a .pm extension,
they will first look for a similar filename with a .pmc
extension. If this file is <br>
found, it will be loaded in place of any potentially
existing file ending in a .pm extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previously, .pmc files were
loaded only if more recent than the matching .pm file.
Starting with 5.9.4, they&rsquo;ll be always loaded if they
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^V is now a &quot;version&quot;
object instead of a v-string <br>
$^V can still be used with the %vd format in printf, but any
character-level operations will now access the string
representation of the &quot;version&quot; object and not the
ordinals of <br>
a v-string. Expressions like &quot;substr($^V, 0, 2)&quot;
or &quot;split //, $^V&quot; no longer work and must be
rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@- and @+ in patterns <br>
The special arrays &quot;@-&quot; and &quot;@+&quot; are no
longer interpolated in regular expressions. (Sadahiro
Tomoyuki)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$AUTOLOAD can now be tainted
<br>
If you call a subroutine by a tainted name, and if it defers
to an AUTOLOAD function, then $AUTOLOAD will be (correctly)
tainted. (Rick Delaney)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tainting and printf <br>
When perl is run under taint mode, &quot;printf()&quot; and
&quot;sprintf()&quot; will now reject any tainted format
argument. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undef and signal handlers <br>
Undefining or deleting a signal handler via &quot;undef
$SIG{FOO}&quot; is now equivalent to setting it to
&rsquo;DEFAULT&rsquo;. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strictures and dereferencing in
defined() <br>
&quot;use strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;&quot; was ignoring
taking a hard reference in an argument to defined(), as in
:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;;
<br>
my $x = &rsquo;foo&rsquo;; <br>
if (defined $$x) {...}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This now correctly produces the
run-time error &quot;Can&rsquo;t use string as a SCALAR ref
while &quot;strict refs&quot; in use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;defined @$foo&quot; and
&quot;defined %$bar&quot; are now also subject to
&quot;strict &rsquo;refs&rsquo;&quot; (that is, $foo and
$bar shall be proper references there.)
(&quot;defined(@foo)&quot; and &quot;defined(%bar)&quot; are
<br>
discouraged constructs anyway.) (Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;(?p{})&quot; has been
removed <br>
The regular expression construct &quot;(?p{})&quot;, which
was deprecated in perl 5.8, has been removed. Use
&quot;(??{})&quot; instead. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-hashes have been removed
<br>
Support for pseudo-hashes has been removed from Perl 5.9.
(The &quot;fields&quot; pragma remains here, but uses an
alternate implementation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removal of the bytecode compiler
and of perlcc <br>
&quot;perlcc&quot;, the byteloader and the supporting
modules (B::C, B::CC, B::Bytecode, etc.) are no longer
distributed with the perl sources. Those experimental tools
have never worked <br>
reliably, and, due to the lack of volunteers to keep them in
line with the perl interpreter developments, it was decided
to remove them instead of shipping a broken version of <br>
those. The last version of those modules can be found with
perl 5.9.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However the B compiler framework
stays supported in the perl core, as with the more useful
modules it has permitted (among others, B::Deparse and
B::Concise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removal of the JPL <br>
The JPL (Java-Perl Lingo) has been removed from the perl
sources tarball.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recursive inheritance detected
earlier <br>
Perl will now immediately throw an exception if you modify
any package&rsquo;s @ISA in such a way that it would cause
recursive inheritance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previously, the exception would
not occur until Perl attempted to make use of the recursive
inheritance while resolving a method or doing a
&quot;$foo-&gt;isa($bar)&quot; lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warnings::enabled and
warnings::warnif changed to favor users of modules <br>
The behaviour in 5.10.x favors the person using the module;
The behaviour in 5.8.x favors the module writer;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assume the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main calls Foo::Bar::baz() <br>
Foo::Bar inherits from Foo::Base <br>
Foo::Bar::baz() calls Foo::Base::_bazbaz() <br>
Foo::Base::_bazbaz() calls:
warnings::warnif(&rsquo;substr&rsquo;, &rsquo;some warning
<br>
message&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On 5.8.x, the code warns when
Foo::Bar contains &quot;use warnings;&quot; It does not
matter if Foo::Base or main have warnings enabled to disable
the warning one has to modify Foo::Bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On 5.10.0 and newer, the code
warns when main contains &quot;use warnings;&quot; It does
not matter if Foo::Base or Foo::Bar have warnings enabled to
disable the warning one has to modify <br>
main.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Upgrading individual core modules <br>
Even more core modules are now also available separately
through the CPAN. If you wish to update one of these
modules, you don&rsquo;t need to wait for a new perl
release. From <br>
within the cpan shell, running the &rsquo;r&rsquo; command
will report on modules with upgrades available. See
&quot;perldoc CPAN&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pragmata Changes <br>
&quot;feature&quot; <br>
The new pragma &quot;feature&quot; is used to enable new
features that might break old code. See &quot;The
&quot;feature&quot; pragma&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mro&quot; <br>
This new pragma enables to change the algorithm used to
resolve inherited methods. See &quot;New Pragma,
&quot;mro&quot;&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scoping of the &quot;sort&quot;
pragma <br>
The &quot;sort&quot; pragma is now lexically scoped. Its
effect used to be global.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scoping of &quot;bignum&quot;,
&quot;bigint&quot;, &quot;bigrat&quot; <br>
The three numeric pragmas &quot;bignum&quot;,
&quot;bigint&quot; and &quot;bigrat&quot; are now lexically
scoped. (Tels)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;base&quot; <br>
The &quot;base&quot; pragma now warns if a class tries to
inherit from itself. (Curtis &quot;Ovid&quot; Poe)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;strict&quot; and
&quot;warnings&quot; <br>
&quot;strict&quot; and &quot;warnings&quot; will now
complain loudly if they are loaded via incorrect casing (as
in &quot;use Strict;&quot;). (Johan Vromans)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;version&quot; <br>
The &quot;version&quot; module provides support for version
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;warnings&quot; <br>
The &quot;warnings&quot; pragma doesn&rsquo;t load
&quot;Carp&quot; anymore. That means that code that used
&quot;Carp&quot; routines without having loaded it at
compile time might need to be adjusted; <br>
typically, the following (faulty) code won&rsquo;t work
anymore, and will require parentheses to be added after the
function name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use warnings; <br>
require Carp; <br>
Carp::confess &rsquo;argh&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;less&quot; <br>
&quot;less&quot; now does something useful (or at least it
tries to). In fact, it has been turned into a lexical
pragma. So, in your modules, you can now test whether your
users have <br>
requested to use less CPU, or less memory, less magic, or
maybe even less fat. See less for more. (Joshua ben
Jore)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New modules <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;encoding::warnings&quot;, by Audrey
Tang, is a module to emit warnings whenever an ASCII
character string containing high-bit bytes is implicitly
converted into UTF-8. It&rsquo;s a <br>
lexical pragma since Perl 5.9.4; on older perls, its effect
is global.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot;, by Richard Clamp, is a small
handy module that tells you what versions of core modules
ship with any versions of Perl 5. It comes with a
command-line <br>
frontend, &quot;corelist&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Math::BigInt::FastCalc&quot; is an XS-enabled, and
thus faster, version of &quot;Math::BigInt::Calc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Compress::Zlib&quot; is an interface to the zlib
compression library. It comes with a bundled version of
zlib, so having a working zlib is not a prerequisite to
install it. It&rsquo;s <br>
used by &quot;Archive::Tar&quot; (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;IO::Zlib&quot; is an &quot;IO::&quot;-style interface
to &quot;Compress::Zlib&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Archive::Tar&quot; is a module to manipulate
&quot;tar&quot; archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Digest::SHA&quot; is a module used to calculate many
types of SHA digests, has been included for SHA support in
the CPAN module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;ExtUtils::CBuilder&quot; and
&quot;ExtUtils::ParseXS&quot; have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot;, by Anno Siegel, has been
added. This module provides support for field hashes: hashes
that maintain an association of a reference with a value, in
a <br>
thread-safe garbage-collected way. Such hashes are useful to
implement inside-out objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::Build&quot;, by Ken Williams, has been added.
It&rsquo;s an alternative to &quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;
to build and install perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::Load&quot;, by Jos Boumans, has been added. It
provides a single interface to load Perl modules and .pl
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::Loaded&quot;, by Jos Boumans, has been added.
It&rsquo;s used to mark modules as loaded or unloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Package::Constants&quot;, by Jos Boumans, has been
added. It&rsquo;s a simple helper to list all constants
declared in a given package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Win32API::File&quot;, by Tye McQueen, has been added
(for Windows builds). This module provides low-level access
to Win32 system API calls for files/dirs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Simple&quot;, needed by CPANPLUS, is
a simple wrapper around
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Lexicon&quot;. Note that
&quot;Locale::Maketext::Lexicon&quot; isn&rsquo;t included
in the perl core; <br>
the behaviour of &quot;Locale::Maketext::Simple&quot;
gracefully degrades when the later isn&rsquo;t present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Params::Check&quot; implements a generic input
parsing/checking mechanism. It is used by CPANPLUS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Term::UI&quot; simplifies the task to ask questions at
a terminal prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Object::Accessor&quot; provides an interface to create
per-object accessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::Pluggable&quot; is a simple framework to
create modules that accept pluggable sub-modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::Load::Conditional&quot; provides simple ways
to query and possibly load installed modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Time::Piece&quot; provides an object oriented
interface to time functions, overriding the built-ins
localtime() and gmtime().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;IPC::Cmd&quot; helps to find and run external
commands, possibly interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;File::Fetch&quot; provide a simple generic file
fetching mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Log::Message&quot; and
&quot;Log::Message::Simple&quot; are used by the log
facility of &quot;CPANPLUS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Archive::Extract&quot; is a generic archive extraction
mechanism for .tar (plain, gzipped or bzipped) or .zip
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;CPANPLUS&quot; provides an API and a command-line tool
to access the CPAN mirrors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Pod::Escapes&quot; provides utilities that are useful
in decoding Pod E&lt;...&gt; sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Pod::Simple&quot; is now the backend for several of
the Pod-related modules included with Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Changes to Core Modules
<br>
&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot; <br>
&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot; can now report the
caller&rsquo;s file and line number. (David Feldman)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All interpreted attributes are
now passed as array references. (Damian Conway)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Lint&quot; <br>
&quot;B::Lint&quot; is now based on
&quot;Module::Pluggable&quot;, and so can be extended with
plugins. (Joshua ben Jore)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B&quot; It&rsquo;s now
possible to access the lexical pragma hints
(&quot;%^H&quot;) by using the method B::COP::hints_hash().
It returns a &quot;B::RHE&quot; object, which in turn can be
used to get a hash <br>
reference via the method B::RHE::HASH(). (Joshua ben
Jore)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Thread&quot; <br>
As the old 5005thread threading model has been removed, in
favor of the ithreads scheme, the &quot;Thread&quot; module
is now a compatibility wrapper, to be used in old code only.
It <br>
has been removed from the default list of dynamic
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
perl -d <br>
The Perl debugger can now save all debugger commands for
sourcing later; notably, it can now emulate stepping
backwards, by restarting and rerunning all bar the last
command <br>
from a saved command history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can also display the parent
inheritance tree of a given class, with the &quot;i&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptar <br>
&quot;ptar&quot; is a pure perl implementation of
&quot;tar&quot; that comes with
&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ptardiff <br>
&quot;ptardiff&quot; is a small utility used to generate a
diff between the contents of a tar archive and a directory
tree. Like &quot;ptar&quot;, it comes with
&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shasum <br>
&quot;shasum&quot; is a command-line utility, used to print
or to check SHA digests. It comes with the new
&quot;Digest::SHA&quot; module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">corelist <br>
The &quot;corelist&quot; utility is now installed with perl
(see &quot;New modules&quot; above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2ph and h2xs <br>
&quot;h2ph&quot; and &quot;h2xs&quot; have been made more
robust with regard to &quot;modern&quot; C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;h2xs&quot; implements a
new option &quot;--use-xsloader&quot; to force use of
&quot;XSLoader&quot; even in backwards compatible
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The handling of authors&rsquo;
names that had apostrophes has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any enums with negative values
are now skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlivp <br>
&quot;perlivp&quot; no longer checks for *.ph files by
default. Use the new &quot;-a&quot; option to run all
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find2perl <br>
&quot;find2perl&quot; now assumes &quot;-print&quot; as a
default action. Previously, it needed to be specified
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several bugs have been fixed in
&quot;find2perl&quot;, regarding &quot;-exec&quot; and
&quot;-eval&quot;. Also the options &quot;-path&quot;,
&quot;-ipath&quot; and &quot;-iname&quot; have been
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">config_data <br>
&quot;config_data&quot; is a new utility that comes with
&quot;Module::Build&quot;. It provides a command-line
interface to the configuration of Perl modules that use
Module::Build&rsquo;s framework <br>
of configurability (that is, *::ConfigData modules that
contain local configuration information for their parent
modules.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpanp <br>
&quot;cpanp&quot;, the CPANPLUS shell, has been added.
(&quot;cpanp-run-perl&quot;, a helper for CPANPLUS
operation, has been added too, but isn&rsquo;t intended for
direct use).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpan2dist <br>
&quot;cpan2dist&quot; is a new utility that comes with
CPANPLUS. It&rsquo;s a tool to create distributions (or
packages) from CPAN modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod2html <br>
The output of &quot;pod2html&quot; has been enhanced to be
more customizable via CSS. Some formatting problems were
also corrected. (Jari Aalto)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Documentation <br>
The perlpragma manpage documents how to write one&rsquo;s
own lexical pragmas in pure Perl (something that is possible
starting with 5.9.4).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new perlglossary manpage is
a glossary of terms used in the Perl documentation,
technical and otherwise, kindly provided by O&rsquo;Reilly

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The perlcommunity manpage gives

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CORE manual page documents

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The long-existing feature of
&quot;/(?{...})/&quot; regexps setting $_ and pos() is now
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
In-place sorting <br>
Sorting arrays in place (&quot;@a = sort @a&quot;) is now
optimized to avoid making a temporary copy of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, &quot;reverse sort
...&quot; is now optimized to sort in reverse, avoiding the
generation of a temporary intermediate list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical array access <br>
Access to elements of lexical arrays via a numeric constant
between 0 and 255 is now faster. (This used to be only the
case for global arrays.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XS-assisted SWASHGET <br>
Some pure-perl code that perl was using to retrieve Unicode
properties and transliteration mappings has been
reimplemented in XS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant subroutines <br>
The interpreter internals now support a far more memory
efficient form of inlineable constants. Storing a reference
to a constant value in a symbol table is equivalent to a
full <br>
typeglob referencing a constant subroutine, but using about
400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant subroutine is
automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if
<br>
necessary. The approach taken is analogous to the existing
space optimisation for subroutine stub declarations, which
are stored as plain scalars in place of the full
typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several of the core modules have
been converted to use this feature for their system
dependent constants - as a result &quot;use POSIX;&quot; now
takes about 200K less memory.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot;
<br>
The new compilation flag &quot;PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot;,
introduced as an option in perl 5.8.8, is turned on by
default in perl 5.9.3. It prevents perl from creating an
empty scalar <br>
with every new typeglob. See perl589delta for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Weak references are cheaper <br>
Weak reference creation is now O(1) rather than O(n),
courtesy of Nicholas Clark. Weak reference deletion remains
O(n), but if deletion only happens at program exit, it may
be <br>
skipped completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort() enhancements <br>
Salvador Fandin~o provided improvements to reduce the memory
usage of &quot;sort&quot; and to speed up some cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory optimisations <br>
Several internal data structures (typeglobs, GVs, CVs,
formats) have been restructured to use less memory.
(Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 cache optimisation <br>
The UTF-8 caching code is now more efficient, and used more
often. (Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sloppy stat on Windows <br>
On Windows, perl&rsquo;s stat() function normally opens the
file to determine the link count and update attributes that
may have been changed through hard links. Setting <br>
${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} to a true value speeds up stat() by
not performing this operation. (Jan Dubois)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions
optimisations <br>
Engine de-recursivised <br>
The regular expression engine is no longer recursive,
meaning that patterns that used to overflow the stack will
either die with useful explanations, or run to completion,
<br>
which, since they were able to blow the stack before, will
likely take a very long time to happen. If you were
experiencing the occasional stack overflow (or segfault) and
<br>
upgrade to discover that now perl apparently hangs instead,
look for a degenerate regex. (Dave Mitchell)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single char char-classes treated
as literals <br>
Classes of a single character are now treated the same as if
the character had been used as a literal, meaning that code
that uses char-classes as an escaping mechanism will <br>
see a speedup. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trie optimisation of literal
string alternations <br>
Alternations, where possible, are optimised into more
efficient matching structures. String literal alternations
are merged into a trie and are matched simultaneously. This
<br>
means that instead of O(N) time for matching N alternations
at a given point, the new code performs in O(1) time. A new
special variable, ${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}, has been added <br>
to fine-tune this optimization. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Much code exists that
works around perl&rsquo;s historic poor performance on
alternations. Often the tricks used to do so will disable
the new optimisations. Hopefully the <br>
utility modules used for this purpose will be educated about
these new optimisations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aho-Corasick start-point
optimisation <br>
When a pattern starts with a trie-able alternation and there
aren&rsquo;t better optimisations available, the regex
engine will use Aho-Corasick matching to find the start
point. <br>
(Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
Configuration improvements <br>
&quot;-Dusesitecustomize&quot; <br>
Run-time customization of @INC can be enabled by passing the
&quot;-Dusesitecustomize&quot; flag to Configure. When
enabled, this will make perl run
$sitelibexp/sitecustomize.pl before <br>
anything else. This script can then be set up to add
additional entries to @INC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relocatable installations <br>
There is now Configure support for creating a relocatable
perl tree. If you Configure with
&quot;-Duserelocatableinc&quot;, then the paths in @INC (and
everything else in %Config) can <br>
be optionally located via the path of the perl
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That means that, if the string
&quot;.../&quot; is found at the start of any path,
it&rsquo;s substituted with the directory of $^X. So, the
relocation can be configured on a per-directory <br>
basis, although the default with
&quot;-Duserelocatableinc&quot; is that everything is
relocated. The initial install is done to the original
configured prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strlcat() and strlcpy() <br>
The configuration process now detects whether strlcat() and
strlcpy() are available. When they are not available,
perl&rsquo;s own version is used (from Russ Allbery&rsquo;s
public <br>
domain implementation). Various places in the perl
interpreter now use them. (Steve Peters)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;d_pseudofork&quot; and
&quot;d_printf_format_null&quot; <br>
A new configuration variable, available as
$Config{d_pseudofork} in the Config module, has been added,
to distinguish real fork() support from fake pseudofork used
on Windows <br>
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new configuration variable,
&quot;d_printf_format_null&quot;, has been added, to see if
printf-like formats are allowed to be NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure help <br>
&quot;Configure -h&quot; has been extended with the most
commonly used options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation improvements <br>
Parallel build <br>
Parallel makes should work properly now, although there may
still be problems if &quot;make test&quot; is instructed to
run in parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Borland&rsquo;s compilers
support <br>
Building with Borland&rsquo;s compilers on Win32 should work
more smoothly. In particular Steve Hay has worked to side
step many warnings emitted by their compilers and at least
<br>
one C compiler internal error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Static build on Windows <br>
Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built into
the Perl DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, it&rsquo;s now possible to
build a &quot;perl-static.exe&quot; that doesn&rsquo;t
depend on the Perl DLL on Win32. See the Win32 makefiles for
details. (Vadim Konovalov)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppport.h files <br>
All ppport.h files in the XS modules bundled with perl are
now autogenerated at build time. (Marcus Holland-Moritz)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C++ compatibility <br>
Efforts have been made to make perl and the core XS modules
compilable with various C++ compilers (although the
situation is not perfect with some of the compilers on some
of <br>
the platforms tested.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for Microsoft 64-bit
compiler <br>
Support for building perl with Microsoft&rsquo;s 64-bit
compiler has been improved. (ActiveState)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visual C++ <br>
Perl can now be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (and
2008 Beta 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 builds <br>
All win32 builds (MS-Win, WinCE) have been merged and
cleaned up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation improvements <br>
Module auxiliary files <br>
README files and changelogs for CPAN modules bundled with
perl are no longer installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Or Improved Platforms <br>
Perl has been reported to work on Symbian OS. See
perlsymbian for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many improvements have been made
towards making Perl work correctly on z/OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl has been reported to work
on DragonFlyBSD and MidnightBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl has also been reported to
work on NexentaOS ( http://www.gnusolaris.org/ ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VMS port has been improved.
See perlvms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for Cray XT4
Catamount/Qk has been added. See hints/catamount.sh in the
source code distribution for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vendor patches have been merged
for RedHat and Gentoo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DynaLoader::dl_unload_file() now
works on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
strictures in regexp-eval blocks <br>
&quot;strict&quot; wasn&rsquo;t in effect in regexp-eval
blocks (&quot;/(?{...})/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling CORE::require() <br>
CORE::require() and CORE::do() were always parsed as
require() and do() when they were overridden. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subscripts of slices <br>
You can now use a non-arrowed form for chained subscripts
after a list slice, like in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">({foo =&gt;
&quot;bar&quot;})[0]{foo}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This used to be a syntax error;
a &quot;-&gt;&quot; was required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;no warnings
&rsquo;category&rsquo;&quot; works correctly with -w <br>
Previously when running with warnings enabled globally via
&quot;-w&quot;, selective disabling of specific warning
categories would actually turn off all warnings. This is now
fixed; <br>
now &quot;no warnings &rsquo;io&rsquo;;&quot; will only turn
off warnings in the &quot;io&quot; class. Previously it
would erroneously turn off all warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threads improvements <br>
Several memory leaks in ithreads were closed. Also, ithreads
were made less memory-intensive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;threads&quot; is now a
dual-life module, also available on CPAN. It has been
expanded in many ways. A kill() method is available for
thread signalling. One can get thread <br>
status, or the list of running or joinable threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new
&quot;threads-&gt;exit()&quot; method is used to exit from
the application (this is the default for the main thread) or
from the current thread only (this is the default for all
<br>
other threads). On the other hand, the exit() built-in now
always causes the whole application to terminate. (Jerry D.
Hedden)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chr() and negative values <br>
chr() on a negative value now gives &quot;FFD}&quot;, the
Unicode replacement character, unless when the
&quot;bytes&quot; pragma is in effect, where the low eight
bits of the value are <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL5SHELL and tainting <br>
On Windows, the PERL5SHELL environment variable is now
checked for taintedness. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using *FILE{IO} <br>
&quot;stat()&quot; and &quot;-X&quot; filetests now treat
*FILE{IO} filehandles like *FILE filehandles. (Steve
Peters)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overloading and reblessing <br>
Overloading now works when references are reblessed into
another class. Internally, this has been implemented by
moving the flag for &quot;overloading&quot; from the
reference to the <br>
referent, which logically is where it should always have
been. (Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overloading and UTF-8 <br>
A few bugs related to UTF-8 handling with objects that have
stringification overloaded have been fixed. (Nicholas
Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval memory leaks fixed <br>
Traditionally, &quot;eval &rsquo;syntax error&rsquo;&quot;
has leaked badly. Many (but not all) of these leaks have now
been eliminated or reduced. (Dave Mitchell)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random device on Windows <br>
In previous versions, perl would read the file /dev/urandom
if it existed when seeding its random number generator. That
file is unlikely to exist on Windows, and if it did <br>
would probably not contain appropriate data, so perl no
longer tries to read it on Windows. (Alex Davies)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERLIO_DEBUG <br>
The &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; environment variable no longer
has any effect for setuid scripts and for scripts run with
-T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, with a thread-enabled
perl, using &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; could lead to an
internal buffer overflow. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO::scalar and read-only
scalars <br>
PerlIO::scalar will now prevent writing to read-only
scalars. Moreover, seek() is now supported with
PerlIO::scalar-based filehandles, the underlying string
being zero-filled <br>
as needed. (Rafael, Jarkko Hietaniemi)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">study() and UTF-8 <br>
study() never worked for UTF-8 strings, but could lead to
false results. It&rsquo;s now a no-op on UTF-8 data. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Critical signals <br>
The signals SIGILL, SIGBUS and SIGSEGV are now always
delivered in an &quot;unsafe&quot; manner (contrary to other
signals, that are deferred until the perl interpreter
reaches a <br>
reasonably stable state; see &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe
Signals)&quot; in perlipc). (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@INC-hook fix <br>
When a module or a file is loaded through an @INC-hook, and
when this hook has set a filename entry in %INC, __FILE__ is
now set for this module accordingly to the contents <br>
of that %INC entry. (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-t&quot; switch fix <br>
The &quot;-w&quot; and &quot;-t&quot; switches can now be
used together without messing up which categories of
warnings are activated. (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duping UTF-8 filehandles <br>
Duping a filehandle which has the &quot;:utf8&quot; PerlIO
layer set will now properly carry that layer on the duped
filehandle. (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Localisation of hash elements
<br>
Localizing a hash element whose key was given as a variable
didn&rsquo;t work correctly if the variable was changed
while the local() was in effect (as in &quot;local $h{$x};
++$x&quot;). <br>
(Bo Lindbergh)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New or Changed Diagnostics <br>
Use of uninitialized value <br>
Perl will now try to tell you the name of the variable (if
any) that was undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated use of my() in false
conditional <br>
A new deprecation warning, Deprecated use of my() in false
conditional, has been added, to warn against the use of the
dubious and deprecated construct</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x if 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perldiag. Use
&quot;state&quot; variables instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!=~ should be !~ <br>
A new warning, &quot;!=~ should be !~&quot;, is emitted to
prevent this misspelling of the non-matching operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Newline in left-justified string
<br>
The warning Newline in left-justified string has been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Too late for &quot;-T&quot;
option <br>
The error Too late for &quot;-T&quot; option has been
reformulated to be more descriptive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks
earlier declaration <br>
This warning is now emitted in more consistent cases; in
short, when one of the declarations involved is a
&quot;my&quot; variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $x; my $x; # warns <br>
my $x; our $x; # warns <br>
our $x; my $x; # warns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">our $x; our $x;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">now gives a
&quot;&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared&quot;
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdir()/closedir()/etc.
attempted on invalid dirhandle <br>
These new warnings are now emitted when a dirhandle is used
but is either closed or not really a dirhandle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opening dirhandle/filehandle %s
also as a file/directory <br>
Two deprecation warnings have been added: (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opening dirhandle %s also as a
file <br>
Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of -P is deprecated <br>
Perl&rsquo;s command-line switch &quot;-P&quot; is now
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v-string in use/require is
non-portable <br>
Perl will warn you against potential backwards compatibility
problems with the &quot;use VERSION&quot; syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -V <br>
&quot;perl -V&quot; has several improvements, making it more
useable from shell scripts to get the value of configuration
variables. See perlrun for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Internals <br>
In general, the source code of perl has been refactored,
tidied up, and optimized in many places. Also, memory
management and allocation has been improved in several
points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling the perl core
with gcc, as many gcc warning flags are turned on as is
possible on the platform. (This quest for cleanliness
doesn&rsquo;t extend to XS code because we <br>
cannot guarantee the tidiness of code we didn&rsquo;t
write.) Similar strictness flags have been added or
tightened for various other C compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reordering of SVt_* constants
<br>
The relative ordering of constants that define the various
types of &quot;SV&quot; have changed; in particular,
&quot;SVt_PVGV&quot; has been moved before
&quot;SVt_PVLV&quot;, &quot;SVt_PVAV&quot;,
&quot;SVt_PVHV&quot; and <br>
&quot;SVt_PVCV&quot;. This is unlikely to make any
difference unless you have code that explicitly makes
assumptions about that ordering. (The inheritance hierarchy
of &quot;B::*&quot; objects has <br>
been changed to reflect this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Elimination of SVt_PVBM <br>
Related to this, the internal type &quot;SVt_PVBM&quot; has
been removed. This dedicated type of &quot;SV&quot; was used
by the &quot;index&quot; operator and parts of the regexp
engine to facilitate fast <br>
Boyer-Moore matches. Its use internally has been replaced by
&quot;SV&quot;s of type &quot;SVt_PVGV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New type SVt_BIND <br>
A new type &quot;SVt_BIND&quot; has been added, in readiness
for the project to implement Perl 6 on 5. There deliberately
is no implementation yet, and they cannot yet be created or
<br>
destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removal of CPP symbols <br>
The C preprocessor symbols &quot;PERL_PM_APIVERSION&quot;
and &quot;PERL_XS_APIVERSION&quot;, which were supposed to
give the version number of the oldest perl binary-compatible
(resp. source- <br>
compatible) with the present one, were not used, and
sometimes had misleading values. They have been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Less space is used by ops <br>
The &quot;BASEOP&quot; structure now uses less space. The
&quot;op_seq&quot; field has been removed and replaced by a
single bit bit-field &quot;op_opt&quot;. &quot;op_type&quot;
is now 9 bits long. (Consequently, the <br>
&quot;B::OP&quot; class doesn&rsquo;t provide an
&quot;seq&quot; method anymore.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New parser <br>
perl&rsquo;s parser is now generated by bison (it used to be
generated by byacc.) As a result, it seems to be a bit more
robust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, Dave Mitchell improved the
lexer debugging output under &quot;-DT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of &quot;const&quot; <br>
Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which
function parameters and local variables could actually be
declared &quot;const&quot; to the C compiler. Steve Peters
provided new <br>
*_set macros and reworked the core to use these rather than
assigning to macros in LVALUE context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mathoms <br>
A new file, mathoms.c, has been added. It contains functions
that are no longer used in the perl core, but that remain
available for binary or source compatibility reasons. <br>
However, those functions will not be compiled in if you add
&quot;-DNO_MATHOMS&quot; in the compiler flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;AvFLAGS&quot; has been
removed <br>
The &quot;AvFLAGS&quot; macro has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;av_*&quot; changes <br>
The &quot;av_*()&quot; functions, used to manipulate arrays,
no longer accept null &quot;AV*&quot; parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$^H and %^H <br>
The implementation of the special variables $^H and %^H has
changed, to allow implementing lexical pragmas in pure
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B:: modules inheritance changed
<br>
The inheritance hierarchy of &quot;B::&quot; modules has
changed; &quot;B::NV&quot; now inherits from
&quot;B::SV&quot; (it used to inherit from
&quot;B::IV&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anonymous hash and array
constructors <br>
The anonymous hash and array constructors now take 1 op in
the optree instead of 3, now that pp_anonhash and
pp_anonlist return a reference to an hash/array when the op
is <br>
flagged with OPf_SPECIAL. (Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
There&rsquo;s still a remaining problem in the
implementation of the lexical $_: it doesn&rsquo;t work
inside &quot;/(?{...})/&quot; blocks. (See the TODO test in
t/op/mydef.t.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stacked filetest operators
won&rsquo;t work when the &quot;filetest&quot; pragma is in
effect, because they rely on the stat() buffer &quot;_&quot;
being populated, and filetest bypasses stat().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 problems <br>
The handling of Unicode still is unclean in several places,
where it&rsquo;s dependent on whether a string is internally
flagged as UTF-8. This will be made more consistent in perl
<br>
5.12, but that won&rsquo;t be possible without a certain
amount of backwards incompatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Problems <br>
When compiled with g++ and thread support on Linux,
it&rsquo;s reported that the $! stops working correctly.
This is related to the fact that the glibc provides two
strerror_r(3) <br>
implementation, and perl selects the wrong one.</p>
