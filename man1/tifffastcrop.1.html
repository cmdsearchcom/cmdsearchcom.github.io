<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tifffastcrop - extracts (crops) a rectangular region from a
tiff <br>
file, avoiding loading the full source image input.tif into
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
tifffastcrop [options] -E x,y,w,l input.tif [output]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tifffastcrop takes a single-image TIFF file, reads the
rectangular region of width w, length l, and top left corner
at position (x,y) in pixels and stores it into a new file.
The <br>
function is similar to what tiffcrop from LibTIFF does but
tifffastcrop works also on very large TIFF files and it
tries to read as little as possible from the source image
into <br>
memory, whereas many programs open the whole image even if a
very small region is requested. Therefore, it is much faster
on large files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;output&quot; name
is provided, the result is stored into a file with that
name, in the format guessed from the extension of this
filename if guess is possible (and in TIFF <br>
format if not), or in the format specified by options.
Otherwise, the name given to the output file is created by
adding the specification of the cropped region after the
name of <br>
the original image and before the extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCES <br>
In principle, cropping a (small) region from a large TIFF
file can also be achieved with several tools, as tiffcrop,
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick. However, most of the
programs <br>
start with opening and deciphering the whole image either in
memory or in a huge temporary file on the disk, which makes
them quite slow, and often unable to complete the task by
<br>
lack of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, tifffastcrop reads
as little as possible from the source image. If the input
file is a tiled TIFF with reasonable tile size, it should
read barely more than the <br>
cropped region. This yields speedup and guarantees
successful termination of the process even on computers with
modest memory. Eg. to crop a region of size 256x256 pixels
in the <br>
middle of a JPEG-compressed tiled TIFF image of size
180224x70144, on a computer with 16 GiB of RAM and an i7
CPU, tifffastcrop needs 0.3 seconds while GraphicsMagick
needs more <br>
than 80 minutes and tiffcrop and ImageMagick fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Do not report TIFF errors or
warnings. Under Windows, they are reported with noisy dialog
boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &lt;x in pixels&gt;,&lt;y in
pixels&gt;,&lt;width in pixels&gt;,&lt;length in
pixels&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specification of the rectangular
region to extract (crop). The top left corner (x,y) has to
be inside the source image. If the rectangle extends beyond
the limits of the <br>
source image, its dimensions are adjusted. Example: -E
10,20,512,256 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j[#] Requests output of JPEG
files rather than the default TIFF. Optional number # in the
range 0 to 100 indicates wanted JPEG quality (default is
75).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p[#] Requests output of PNG
files rather than the default TIFF. Optional number # in the
range 0 to 9 indicates wanted PNG compression level (default
is currently 6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If several of -j, -p, and -c
options are given, only the last one takes effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;method&gt;[:opt[:opt]...]
<br>
Requests output of TIFF files compressed with method. Method
can be &lsquo;none&rsquo; for no compression,
&lsquo;jpeg&rsquo;, &lsquo;lzw&rsquo;, &lsquo;zip&rsquo;...
as provided by the LibTIFF library (see libtiff <br>
(3TIFF)). By default, the same compression as in the input
TIFF file is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method-specific details of the
wished compression can be specified by adding one or several
group of characters starting with a colon &lsquo;:&rsquo;
after the methods&rsquo;s name, as <br>
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option to (TIFF compressed with)
JPEG method: <br>
:# set compression quality level as in option -j (see
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LZW, Deflate (zip) and LZMA2
options: <br>
:# set predictor value <br>
:p# set compression level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -c lzw:2 to get
LZW-encoded data with horizontal differencing, -c zip:3:p9
for Deflate encoding with maximum compression level and
floating point predictor, <br>
-c jpeg:r:50 for JPEG-encoded RGB data at quality 50%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If several of -j, -p, and -c
options are given, only the last one takes effect.</p>
