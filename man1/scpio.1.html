<p>SCPIO(1L) Schily&Acirc;&acute;s USER COMMANDS
SCPIO(1L)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
scpio - copy file archives in and out (LEGACY)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
scpio [ other options ] -o[aBcv] <br>
scpio [ other options ] -i[Bcdmruvf] [ pattern ... ] <br>
scpio [ other options ] -it[Bcvf] [ pattern ... ] <br>
scpio [ other options ] -p[adlmuv] directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The scpio utility, depending on the options used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; copies files to
an archive file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; extracts files
from an archive file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; lists files from
an archive file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; copies files
from one directory tree to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The scpio utility supports the XBD specification Utility
Syntax Guidelines. The cpio standard does not allow the
option modifiers to be presented as separate arguments from
the <br>
option letters. The scpio implementation allows option
modifiers to be presented as separate arguments from the
option letters. When writing portable shell scripts do never
make <br>
use of this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o (Copy Out.) Read the standard
input to obtain a list of pathnames and copy those files
onto the standard output together with pathname and status
information. Output is <br>
padded to a 512-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i (Copy In.) Extract files from
the standard input, which is assumed to be the product of a
previous scpio -o. Only files with names that match patterns
are selected. The <br>
extracted files are conditionally created and copied into
the current directory tree based upon the options described
below. The permissions of the files will be those of <br>
the previous scpio -o. The owner and group of the files will
be that of the current user unless the user has appropriate
privileges, which causes scpio to retain the <br>
owner and group of the files of the previous scpio -o. If
the archive being read does not match the modifier
specified, scpio may consider this to be an error and exit
or <br>
may recognise the archive and continue processing. Only a
user with appropriate privileges can extract block special
or character special files from an archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-it (List.) List files from the
archive. This is a sub mode of the copy in mode, no files
are created in list mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p (Pass.) Read the standard
input to obtain a list of pathnames of files that are
conditionally created and copied into the destination
directory tree based upon the option <br>
modifiers described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option modifiers
can be appended in any sequence to the -o, -i or -p
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Reset access times of input
files after they have been copied. (When option l (see
below) is also specified, the access times of the linked
files are not reset.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Block input/output 5120 bytes
to the record (does not apply to the -p option; meaningful
only with data directed to or from character special
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Create directories as
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Write or read header
information in character form for portability. Note that the
Open Group standard does not specify the archive format that
should be used with the c <br>
option. For this reason it is questionable wether the c
option increases portability in general.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive format used by scpio
with the c option is the format from the -H asc option. It
gives best cpio compatibility when transferring files to
SVR4-based systems <br>
(except that the file size is limited to 2 gigabytes). When
transferring files in cpio archives to unknown operating
systems, it is unwise to use the c option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Interactively rename files.
For each archive member matching pattern operand, a prompt
will be written to the file /dev/tty. The prompt will
contain the name of the ar&acirc; <br>
chive member, but the format is otherwise unspecified. A
line will then be read from /dev/tty. If this line is blank,
the archive member will be skipped. If this line <br>
consists of a single period, the archive member will be
processed with no modification to its name. Otherwise, its
name will be replaced with the contents of the line. The
<br>
scpio utility will immediately exit with a non-zero exit
status if end-of-file is encountered when reading a
response, or if /dev/tty cannot be opened for reading and
<br>
writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Write a table of contents of
the input. No files are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Copy unconditionally
(normally, an older file will not replace a newer file with
the same name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Verbose: print the names of
the affected files. With the t option, provides a detailed
listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Whenever possible, link files
rather than copying them. Usable only with the -p option.
The l option modifier is not yet supported by scpio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Retain previous file
modification time. This option is ineffective on directories
that are being copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Copy in all files except those
in patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following other options are
implemented as SVr4 compliant extension to the Open Group
standard:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Extract UNIX System Sixth
Edition cpio archives. This option is not valid in archive
create mode, it is mutually exclusive with -c, -H, and
artype=. As is is unclear how <br>
UNIX System Sixth Edition cpio archives look like, this
option is currently unsupported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-@ Include extended file
attributes in the archive. This option is currently
unsupported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Append files to an existing
archive. The -A option only works together with the -O
option. See star -r for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Reverses the order of the
bytes within each word. It is unclear what a word is
supposed to be. This option is unsupported but not needed as
scpio includes automatic byte <br>
order recognition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C # Sets (input/output) archive
block size to # bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E name <br>
Read filenames for store/create/list command from name. The
file name must contain a list of filenames, each on a
separate line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H header <br>
Set the archive type to header. See star(1) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I nm Use nm as archive file
name instead of stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Try to skip corrupt archive
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Follow symbolic links as if
they were files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M message <br>
Define a message that is uses when switching media. This
option is currently unsupported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O nm Use nm as archive file
name instead of stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Handle Access Control List
(ACL) information in create and extract mode. See star -acl
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R nm Reassign ownership and
group for all files based on nm. This option is currently
unsupported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Reverses the order of the
bytes within each word. It is unclear what a word is
supposed to be. This option is unsupported but not needed as
scpio includes automatic byte <br>
order recognition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Reverses the order of the
halfwords within each word. It is unclear what a word is
supposed to be. This option is unsupported but not needed as
scpio includes automatic <br>
byte order recognition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Special verbose. Print a dot
for each file that is read or written. This option is
currently unsupported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following other options are
implemented as star extension to the Open Group
standard:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Prints a summary of the
most important options for scpio(1) and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xhelp Prints a summary of the
less important options for scpio(1) and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Prints the scpio version number string and exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-/ Don&rsquo;t strip leading
slashes from file names when extracting an archive. See
star(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.. Don&rsquo;t skip files that
contain /../ in the name. See star(1) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-7z run the input or output
through a p7zip pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the p7zip program
currently does not operate on a pipe but on a /tmp file copy
and thus limits the maximum archive size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-acl Handle Access Control List
(ACL) information in create and extract mode. See star(1)
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">artype=header <br>
Set the archive type to header. See star(1) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lzo Run the input or output
through a lzop pipe - see option -z below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bz Run the input or output
through a bzip2 pipe - see option -z below. As the -bz the
-z options are non standard, it makes sense to omit -bz
options the inside shell <br>
scripts. If you are going to extract a compressed archive
that is located inside a plain file, scpio will auto detect
compression and choose the right decompression <br>
option to extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bs=# Set block size to #. You
may use the same method as in dd(1) and sdd(1). See star(1)
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fifostats <br>
Print fifo statistics at the end of a scpio run when the
fifo has been in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs=# Set fifo size to #. See
star(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-fifo <br>
Do not use a fifo to optimize data flow from/to tape. See
star(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-fsync <br>
Do not call fsync(2) for each file that has been extracted
from the archive. See star(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-statistics <br>
Do not print statistic messages at the end of a scpio
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-secure-links <br>
Do not extract hard links or symbolic links if the link name
(the target of the link) starts with a slash (/) or if /../
is contained in the link name. See star(1) for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-numeric <br>
Use the numeric user/group fields in the listing rather than
the default. See star(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time Print timing info. See
star(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xfflags <br>
Store and extract extended file flags as found on BSD and
Linux systems. See star -acl for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Run the input or output
through a gzip pipe - see option -bz above. As the -bz the
-z options are non standard, it makes sense to omit -bz
options the inside shell <br>
scripts. If you are going to extract a compressed archive
that is located inside a plain file, scpio will auto detect
compression and choose the right decompression <br>
option to extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory <br>
A pathname of an existing directory to be used as the target
of scpio -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern <br>
Expressions making use of a pattern-matching notation
similar to that used by the shell for filename pattern
matching, and similar to regular expressions. The following
<br>
metacharacters are defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Matches any string, including
the empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Matches any single
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] Matches any one of the
enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated by
&lsquo;-&rsquo; matches any symbol between the pair
(inclusive), as defined by the system default <br>
collating sequence. If the first character following the
opening &lsquo;[&rsquo; is a &lsquo;!&rsquo;, the results
are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In pattern, the special
characters &quot;?&quot;, &quot;*&quot; and &quot;[&quot;
also match the &quot;/&quot; character. Multiple cases of
pattern can be specified and if no pattern is specified, the
default <br>
for pattern is &quot;*&quot; (that is, select all
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that scpio does not use
fnmatch(3) based pattern matching as documented above, it
rather uses the pattern matcher documented in match(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
When the -o or -p options are used, the standard input is a
text file containing a list of pathnames, one per line, to
be copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -i option is used, the
standard input is an archive file formatted in any way that
is understood by the archive handling engine (see -H help
option for a complete list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The files identified by the pathnames in the standard input
are of any type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -r option is used, the
file /dev/tty is used to write prompts and read
responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
When the -o option is used, the standard output is an
archive file formatted as specified by pax with the -x cpio
option. For better compatibility with SVR4-based systems
that do <br>
not implement the cpio format correctly, scpio by default
limits the length of file names to 256 bytes. Use scpio -H
cpio to explicitly switch to the full POSIX 1003.1-1988 cpio
<br>
archive format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the standard output
contains commentary in an unspecified format concerning the
progress of the execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
When the -o option is not used, the standard error contains
commentary in an unspecified format concerning the progress
of the execution. Otherwise, the standard error is used <br>
only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Output files are created, as specified by the archive, when
the -i or -p options are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
If a file or directory cannot be created or overwritten,
scpio continues with the next file in the archive or file to
be added to the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Archives created by scpio are portable between
XSI-conformant systems provided the same procedures are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell metacharacter notation
is not fully compatible with that used by the shell and the
pax utility. Not all systems support the use of the negation
character [! ...] in <br>
cpio patterns. Portable applications must avoid the use of
this notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For portable communication of
data between XSI-conformant systems, it is recommended that
only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
International Reference Version <br>
(equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of characters be used and
that only characters defined in the Portable Filename
Character Set be used for naming files. This recommendation
is <br>
given because XSI-conformant systems support diverse
codesets and run in various geographical areas and there is
no single, well-established codeset that incorporates all of
the <br>
characters of the languages of the various geographical
areas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cpio archive format only
supports file sizes up to 8 gigabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications should migrate to
the pax archive format which is the POSIX 1003.1-2001
standard archive format and based on an extended tar
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Copy the contents of a directory onto an archive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls | scpio -o
&gt;../cpio.out</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Duplicate a directory
hierarchy:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd olddir <br>
find . -depth -print | scpio -pd ../newdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables may affect the execution
of scpio:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone used
with date and time strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ar(1), find(1), sfind(1), ls(1), match(1), pax(1), spax(1),
tar(1), star(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS NOTES <br>
The default block size for cpio is 512 bytes, this slows
down write speed. Use -B, -C, or bs= to set a different
block size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scpio -iu is equivalent to star
-xU -install -force-remove -remove-recursive and for this
reason may remove nonempty directory trees in extrace mode
without printing a warning.</p>
