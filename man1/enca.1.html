<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
enca -- detect and convert encoding of text files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
enca [-L LANGUAGE] [OPTION]... [FILE]... <br>
enconv [-L LANGUAGE] [OPTION]... [FILE]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION AND EXAMPLES <br>
If you are lucky enough, the only two things you will ever
need to know are: command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will tell you which encoding
file FILE uses (without changing it), and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enconv FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will convert file FILE to your
locale native encoding. To convert the file to some other
encoding use the -x option (see -x entry in section OPTIONS
and sections CONVERSION and <br>
ENCODINGS for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both work with multiple files
and standard input (output) too. E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca -x latin2 &lt;sometext |
lpr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assures file
&lsquo;sometext&rsquo; is in ISO Latin 2 when it&rsquo;s
sent to printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main reason why these
command will fail and turn your files into garbage is that
Enca needs to know their language to detect the encoding. It
tries to determine your lan&acirc; <br>
guage and preferred charset from locale settings, which
might not be what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can (or have to) use -L
option to tell it the right language. Suppose, you
downloaded some Russian HTML file, &lsquo;file.htm&rsquo;,
it claims it&rsquo;s windows-1251 but it isn&rsquo;t. So you
<br>
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca -L ru file.htm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and find out it&rsquo;s KOI8-R
(for example). Be warned, currently there are not many
supported languages (see section LANGUAGES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another warning concerns the
fact several Enca&rsquo;s features, namely its charset
conversion capabilities, strongly depend on what other tools
are installed on your system (see sec&acirc; <br>
tion CONVERSION)--run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to get list of features (see
section FEATURES). Also try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to get description of all other
Enca options (and to find the rest of this manual page
redundant).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Enca reads given text files, or standard input when none are
given, and uses knowledge about their language (must be
supported by you) and a mixture of parsing, statistical
anal&acirc; <br>
ysis, guessing and black magic to determine their encodings,
which it then prints to standard output (or it confesses it
doesn&rsquo;t have any idea what the encoding could be). By
<br>
default, Enca presents results as a multiline human-readable
descriptions, several other formats are available--see
Output type selectors below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enca can also convert files to
some other encoding ENC when you ask for it--either using a
built-in converter, some conversion library, or by calling
an external converter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enca&rsquo;s primary goal is to
be usable unattended, as an automatic conversion tool,
though it perhaps have not reached this point yet (please
see section SECURITY).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note except rare cases
Enca really has to know the language of input files to give
you a reliable answer. On the other hand, it can then cope
quite well with files that <br>
are not purely textual or even detect charset of text
strings inside some binary file; of course, it depends on
the character of the non-text component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enca doesn&rsquo;t care about
structure of input files, it views them as a uniform piece
of text/data. In case of multipart files (e.g. mailboxes),
you have to use some tool knowing <br>
the structure to extract the individual parts first.
It&rsquo;s the cost of ability to detect encodings of any
damaged, incomplete or otherwise incorrect files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
There are several categories of options: operation mode
options, output type selectors, guessing parameters,
conversion parameters, general options and listings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All long options can be
abbreviated as long as they are unambiguous, mandatory
parameters of long options are mandatory for short options
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation modes <br>
are following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --auto-convert <br>
Equivalent to calling Enca as enconv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no output type selector is
specified, detect file encodings, guess your preferred
charset from locales, and convert files to it (only
available with +tar&acirc; <br>
get-charset-auto feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --guess <br>
Equivalent to calling Enca as enca.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no output type selector is
specified, detect file encodings and report them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output type selectors <br>
select what action Enca will take when it determines the
encoding; most of them just choose between different names,
formats and conventions how encodings can be printed, but
one <br>
of them (-x) is special: it tells Enca to recode files to
some other encoding ENC. These options are mutually
exclusive; if you specify more than one output type selector
the <br>
last one takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several output types represent
charset name used by some other program, but not all these
programs know all the charsets which Enca recognises. Be
warned, Enca makes no differ&acirc; <br>
ence between unrecognised charset and charset having no name
in given namespace in such situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --details <br>
It used to print a few pages of details about the guessing
process, but since Enca is just a program linked against
Enca library, this is not possible and this option is <br>
roughly equivalent to --human-readable, except it reports
failure reason when Enca doesn&rsquo;t recognize the
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --enca-name <br>
Prints Enca&rsquo;s nice name of the charset, i.e., perhaps
the most generally accepted and more or less human-readable
charset identifier, with surfaces appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This name is used when calling
an external converter, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --human-readable <br>
Prints verbal description of the detected charset and
surfaces--something a human understands best. This is the
default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The precise format is following:
the first line contains charset name alone, and it&rsquo;s
followed by zero or more indented lines containing names of
detected surfaces. This <br>
format is not, however, suitable or intended for further
machine-processing, and the verbal charset descriptions are
like to change in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --iconv-name <br>
Prints how iconv(3) (and/or iconv(1)) calls the detected
charset. More precisely, it prints one, more or less
arbitrarily chosen, alias accepted by iconv. A charset <br>
unknown to iconv counts as unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This output type makes sense
only when Enca is compiled with iconv support (feature
+iconv-interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --rfc1345-name <br>
Prints RFC 1345 charset name. When such a name doesn&rsquo;t
exist because RFC 1345 doesn&rsquo;t define a given
encoding, some other name defined in some other RFC or just
the name <br>
which author considers &lsquo;the most canonical&rsquo;, is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since RFC 1345 doesn&rsquo;t
define surfaces, no surface info is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mime-name <br>
Prints preferred MIME name of detected charset. This is the
name you should normally use when fixing e-mails or web
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A charset not present in
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets counts as
unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --cstocs-name <br>
Prints how cstocs(1) calls the detected charset. A charset
unknown to cstocs counts as unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --name=WORD <br>
Prints charset (encoding) name selected by WORD (can be
abbreviated as long as is unambiguous). For names listed
above, --name=WORD is equivalent to --WORD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using aliases as the output type
causes Enca to print list of all accepted aliases of
detected charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --convert-to=[..]ENC <br>
Converts file to encoding ENC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional &lsquo;..&rsquo;
before encoding name has no special meaning, except you can
use it to remind yourself that, unlike in recode(1), you
should specify desired encoding, <br>
instead of current.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use recode(1) recoding
chains or any other kind of braindead recoding specification
for ENC, provided that you tell Enca to use some tool
understanding it for con&acirc; <br>
version (see section CONVERSION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Enca fails to determine the
encoding, it prints a warning and leaves the the file as is;
when it is run as a filter it tries to do its best to copy
standard input to <br>
standard output unchanged. Nevertheless, you should not rely
on it and do backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guessing parameters <br>
There&rsquo;s only one: -L setting language of input files.
This option is mandatory (but see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --language=LANG <br>
Sets language of input files to LANG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More precisely, LANG can be any
valid locale name (or alias with +locale-alias feature) of
some supported language. You can also specify
&lsquo;none&rsquo; as language name, only <br>
multibyte encodings are recognised then. Run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --list languages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to get list of supported
languages. When you don&rsquo;t specify any language Enca
tries to guess your language from locale settings and
assumes input files use this language. <br>
See section LANGUAGES for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversion parameters <br>
give you finer control of how charset conversion will be
performed. They don&rsquo;t affect anything when -x is not
specified as output type. Please see section CONVERSION for
the <br>
gory conversion details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --try-converters=LIST <br>
Appends comma separated LIST to the list of converters that
will be tried when you ask for conversion. Their names can
be abbreviated as long as they are unambiguous. <br>
Run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --list converters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to get list of all valid
converter names (and see section CONVERSION for their
description).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default list depends on how
Enca has been compiled, run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to find out default converter
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the default list is used
only when you don&rsquo;t specify -C at all. Otherwise, the
list is built as if it were initially empty and every -C
adds new converter(s) to it. <br>
Moreover, specifying none as converter name causes clearing
the converter list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E,
--external-converter-program=PATH <br>
Sets external converter program name to PATH. Default
external converter depends on how enca has been complied,
and the possibility to use external converters may not be
<br>
available at all. Run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to find out default converter
program in your enca build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options <br>
don&rsquo;t fit to other option categories...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --with-filename <br>
Forces Enca to prefix each result with corresponding file
name. By default, Enca prefixes results with filenames when
run on multiple files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard input is printed as
STDIN and standard output as STDOUT (the latter can be
probably seen in error messages only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --no-filename <br>
Forces Enca to not prefix results with file names. By
default, Enca doesn&rsquo;t prefix result with file name
when run on a single file (including standard input).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Increases verbosity level (each use increases it by
one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently this option in not
very useful because different parts of Enca respond
differently to the same verbosity level, mostly not at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listings <br>
are all terminal, i.e. when Enca encounters some of them it
prints the required listing and terminates without
processing any following options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints brief usage help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --license <br>
Prints full Enca license (through a pager, if possible).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list=WORD <br>
Prints list specified by WORD (can be abbreviated as long as
it is unambiguous). Available lists include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">built-in-charsets. All encodings
convertible by built-in converter, by group (both input and
output encoding must be from this list and belong to the
same group for <br>
internal conversion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">built-in-encodings. Equivalent
to built-in-charsets, but considered obsolete; will be
accepted with a warning, for a while.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">converters. All valid converter
names (to be used with -C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charsets. All encodings
(charsets). You can select what names will be printed with
--name or any name output type selector (of course, only
encodings having a name in <br>
given namespace will be printed then), the selector must be
specified before --list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encodings. Equivalent to
charsets, but considered obsolete; will be accepted with a
warning, for a while.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">languages. All supported
languages together with charsets belonging to them. Note
output type selects language name style, not charset name
style here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">names. All possible values of
--name option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lists. All possible values of
this option. (Crazy?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">surfaces. All surfaces Enca
recognises.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Prints program version and list of features (see section
FEATURES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERSION <br>
Though Enca has been originally designed as a tool for
guessing encoding only, it now features several methods of
charset conversion. You can control which of them will be
used <br>
with -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enca sequentially tries
converters from the list specified by -C until it finds some
that is able to perform required conversion or until it
exhausts the list. You should spec&acirc; <br>
ify preferred converters first, less preferred later.
External converter (extern) should be always specified last,
only as last resort, since it&rsquo;s usually not possible
to <br>
recover when it fails. The default list of converters always
starts with built-in and then continues with the first one
available from: librecode, iconv, nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted when Enca
says it is not able to perform the conversion it only means
none of the converters is able to perform it. It can be
still possible to perform the <br>
required conversion in several steps, using several
converters, but to figure out how, human intelligence is
probably needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in converter <br>
is the simplest and far the fastest of all, can perform only
a few byte-to-byte conversions and modifies files directly
in place (may be considered dangerous, but is pretty
effi&acirc; <br>
cient). You can get list of all encodings it can convert
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --list built-in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beside speed, its main advantage
(and also disadvantage) is that it doesn&rsquo;t care: it
simply converts characters having a representation in target
encoding, doesn&rsquo;t touch anything <br>
else and never prints any error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This converter can be specified
as built-in with -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Librecode converter <br>
is an interface to GNU recode library, that does the actual
recoding job. It may or may not be compiled in; run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to find out its availability in
your enca build (feature +librecode-interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be familiar with
recode(1) before using it, since recode is a quite
sophisticated and powerful charset conversion tool. You may
run into problems using it together <br>
with Enca particularly because Enca&rsquo;s support for
surfaces not 100% compatible, because recode tries too hard
to make the transformation reversible, because it sometimes
silently <br>
ignores I/O errors, and because it&rsquo;s incredibly buggy.
Please see GNU recode info pages for details about recode
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This converter can be specified
as librecode with -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Iconv converter <br>
is an interface to the UNIX98 iconv(3) conversion functions,
that do the actual recoding job. It may or may not be
compiled in; run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to find out its availability in
your enca build (feature +iconv-interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While iconv is present on most
today systems it only rarely offer some useful set of
available conversions, the only notable exception being
iconv from GNU libc. It is usually <br>
quite picky about surfaces, too (while, at the same time,
not implementing surface conversion). It however probably
represents the only standard(ized) tool able to perform
con&acirc; <br>
version from/to Unicode. Please see iconv documentation
about for details about its capabilities on your particular
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This converter can be specified
as iconv with -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External converter <br>
is an arbitrary external conversion tool that can be
specified with -E option (at most one can be defined
simultaneously). There are some standard, provided together
with enca: <br>
cstocs, recode, map, umap, and piconv. All are wrapper
scripts: for cstocs(1), recode(1), map(1), umap(1), and
piconv(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note enca has little
control what the external converter really does. If you set
it to /bin/rm you are fully responsible for the
consequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to make your own
converter to use with enca, you should know it is always
called</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERTER ENC_CURRENT ENC FILE
[-]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where CONVERTER is what has been
set by -E, ENC_CURRENT is detected encoding, ENC is what has
been specified with -x, and FILE is the file to convert,
i.e. it is called for each <br>
file separately. The optional fourth parameter, -, should
cause (when present) sending result of conversion to
standard output instead of overwriting the file FILE. The
con&acirc; <br>
verter should also take care of not changing file
permissions, returning error code 1 when it fails and
cleaning its temporary files. Please see the standard
external converters <br>
for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This converter can be specified
as extern with -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default target charset <br>
The straightforward way of specifying target charset is the
-x option, which overrides any defaults. When Enca is called
as enconv, default target charset is selected exactly <br>
the same way as recode(1) does it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the DEFAULT_CHARSET
environment variable is set, it&rsquo;s used as the target
charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if you system
provides the nl_langinfo(3) function, current locale&rsquo;s
native charset is used as the target charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When both methods fail, Enca
complains and terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reversibility notes <br>
If reversibility is crucial for you, you shouldn&rsquo;t use
enca as converter at all (or maybe you can, with very
specifically designed recode(1) wrapper). Otherwise you
should at <br>
least know that there four basic means of handling
inconvertible character entities:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fail--this is a possibility,
too, and incidentally it&rsquo;s exactly what current GNU
libc iconv implementation does (recode can be also told to
do it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">don&rsquo;t touch them--this is
what enca internal converter always does and recode can do;
though it is not reversible, a human being is usually able
to reconstruct the original (at <br>
least in principle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">approximate them--this is what
cstocs can do, and recode too, though differently; and the
best choice if you just want to make the accursed text
readable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drop them out--this is what both
recode and cstocs can do (cstocs can also replace these
characters by some fixed character instead of mere
ignoring); useful when the to-be-omit&acirc; <br>
ted characters contain only noise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please consult your favourite
converter manual for details of this issue. Generally, if
you are not lucky enough to have all convertible characters
in you file, manual interven&acirc; <br>
tion is needed anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance notes <br>
Poor performance of available converters has been one of
main reasons for including built-in converter in enca. Try
to use it whenever possible, i.e. when files in
consideration <br>
are charset-clean enough or charset-messy enough so that its
zero built-in intelligence doesn&rsquo;t matter. It requires
no extra disk space nor extra memory and can outperform <br>
recode(1) more than 10 times on large files and Perl version
(i.e. the faster one) of cstocs(1) more than 400 times on
small files (in fact it&rsquo;s almost as fast as mere
cp(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to avoid external converters
when it&rsquo;s not absolutely necessary since all the
forking and moving stuff around is incredibly slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCODINGS <br>
You can get list of recognised character sets with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --list charsets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and using --name parameter you
can select any name you want to be used in the listing. You
can also list all surfaces with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --list surfaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding and surface names are
case insensitive and non-alphanumeric characters are not
taken into account. However, non-alphanumeric characters are
mostly not allowed at all. <br>
The only allowed are: &lsquo;-&rsquo;, &lsquo;_&rsquo;,
&lsquo;.&rsquo;, &lsquo;:&rsquo;, and &lsquo;/&rsquo; (as
charset/surface separator). So &lsquo;ibm852&rsquo; and
&lsquo;IBM-852&rsquo; are the same, while &lsquo;IBM
852&rsquo; is not accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where unknown is not any real
encoding, it&rsquo;s reported when Enca is not able to give
a reliable answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Surfaces <br>
Enca has some experimental support for so-called surfaces
(see below). It detects following surfaces (not all can be
applied to all charsets):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/CR CR line terminators <br>
/LF LF line terminators <br>
/CRLF CRLF line terminators <br>
N.A. Mixed line terminators <br>
N.A. Surrounded by/intermixed with non-text data <br>
/21 Byte order reversed in pairs (1,2 -&gt; 2,1) <br>
/4321 Byte order reversed in quadruples (1,2,3,4 -&gt;
4,3,2,1) <br>
N.A. Both little and big endian chunks, concatenated <br>
/qp Quoted-printable encoded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note some surfaces have N.A. in
place of identifier--they cannot be specified on command
line, they can only be reported by Enca. This is intentional
because they only inform <br>
you why the file cannot be considered surface-consistent
instead of representing a real surface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each charset has its natural
surface (called &lsquo;implied&rsquo; in recode) which is
not reported, e.g., for IBM 852 charset it&rsquo;s
&lsquo;CRLF line terminators&rsquo;. For UCS encodings, big
endian is <br>
considered as natural surface; unusual byte orders are
constructed from 21 and 4321 permutations: 2143 is reported
simply as 21, while 3412 is reported as combination of 4321
and <br>
21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Doubly-encoded UTF-8 is neither
charset nor surface, it&rsquo;s just reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About charsets, encodings and
surfaces <br>
Charset is a set of character entities while encoding is its
representation in the terms of bytes and bits. In Enca, the
word encoding means the same as &lsquo;representation of
<br>
text&rsquo;, i.e. the relation between sequence of character
entities constituting the text and sequence of bytes (bits)
constituting the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, encoding is both character
set and so-called surface (line terminators, byte order,
combining, Base64 transformation, etc.). Nevertheless, it
proves convenient to work with <br>
some {charset,surface} pairs as with genuine charsets. So,
as in recode(1), all UCS- and UTF- encodings of Universal
character set are called charsets. Please see recode
docu&acirc; <br>
mentation for more details of this issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only good thing about
surfaces is: when you don&rsquo;t start playing with them,
neither Enca won&rsquo;t start and it will try to behave as
much as possible as a surface-unaware pro&acirc; <br>
gram, even when talking to recode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANGUAGES <br>
Enca needs to know the language of input files to work
reliably, at least in case of regular 8bit encoding.
Multibyte encodings should be recognised for any Latin,
Cyrillic or <br>
Greek language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can (or have to) use -L
option to tell Enca the language. Since people most often
work with files in the same language for which they have
configured locales, Enca tries <br>
tries to guess the language by examining value of LC_CTYPE
and other locale categories (please see locale(7)) and using
it for the language when you don&rsquo;t specify any. Of
<br>
course, it may be completely wrong and will give you
nonsense answers and damage your files, so please
don&rsquo;t forget to use the -L option. You can also use
ENCAOPT environment <br>
variable to set a default language (see section
ENVIRONMENT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following languages are
supported by Enca (each language is listed together with
supported 8bit encodings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
Several Enca&rsquo;s features depend on what is available on
your system and how it was compiled. You can get their list
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enca --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plus sign before a feature name
means it&rsquo;s available, minus sign means this build
lacks the particular feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">librecode-interface. Enca has
interface to GNU recode library charset conversion
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconv-interface. Enca has
interface to UNIX98 iconv charset conversion functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">external-converter. Enca can use
external conversion programs (if you have some suitable
installed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">language-detection. Enca tries
to guess language (-L) from locales. You don&rsquo;t need
the --language option, at least in principle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">locale-alias. Enca is able to
decrypt locale aliases used for language names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-charset-auto. Enca tries
to detect your preferred charset from locales. Option
--auto-convert and calling Enca as enconv works, at least in
principle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCAOPT. Enca is able to
correctly parse this environment variable before command
line parameters. Simple stuff like ENCAOPT=&quot;-L uk&quot;
will work even without this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The variable ENCAOPT can hold set of default Enca options.
Its content is interpreted before command line arguments.
Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t work everywhere (must have
<br>
+ENCAOPT feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE, LC_COLLATE,
LC_MESSAGES (possibly inherited from LC_ALL or LANG) is used
for guessing your language (must have +language-detection
feature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variable DEFAULT_CHARSET can
be used by enconv as the default target charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Enca returns exit code 0 when all input files were
successfully proceeded (i.e. all encodings were detected and
all files were converted to required encoding, if conversion
was <br>
asked for). Exit code 1 is returned when Enca wasn&rsquo;t
able to either guess encoding or perform conversion on any
input file because it&rsquo;s not clever enough. Exit code 2
is <br>
returned in case of serious (e.g. I/O) troubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
It should be possible to let Enca work unattended,
it&rsquo;s its goal. However:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s no warranty the
detection works 100%. Don&rsquo;t bet on it, you can easily
lose valuable data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t use enca (the
program), link to libenca instead if you want anything
resembling security. You have to perform the eventual
conversion yourself then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t use external
converters. Ideally, disable them compile-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware of ENCAOPT and all the
built-in automagic guessing various things from environment,
namely locales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
autoconvert(1), cstocs(1), file(1), iconv(1), iconv(3),
nl_langinfo(3), map(1), piconv(1), recode(1), locale(5),
locale(7), ltt(1), umap(1), unicode(7), utf-8(7),
xcode(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS <br>
It has too many unknown bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea of using LC_* value for
language is certainly braindead. However I like it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can&rsquo;t backup files
before mangling them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In certain situations, it may
behave incorrectly on &gt;31bit file systems and/or over NFS
(both untested but shouldn&rsquo;t cause problems in
practice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in converter does not
convert character &lsquo;ch&rsquo; from KOI8-CS2, and
possibly some other characters you&rsquo;ve probably never
heard about anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EOL type recognition works
poorly on Quoted-printable encoded files. This should be
fixed someday.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no command line
options to tune libenca parameters. This is intentional
(Enca should DWIM) but sometimes this is a nuisance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The manual page is too long,
especially this section. This doesn&rsquo;t matter since
nobody does read it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send bug reports to
&lt;https://github.com/nijel/enca/issues&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRIVIA <br>
Enca is Extremely Naive Charset Analyser. Nevertheless, the
&lsquo;enc&rsquo; originally comes from
&lsquo;encoding&rsquo; so the leading &lsquo;e&rsquo; should
be read as in &lsquo;encoding&rsquo; not as in
&lsquo;extreme&rsquo;.</p>
