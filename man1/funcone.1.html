Funcone performs a cone search on the RA and Dec columns of a FITS binary table.
  The distance from the center RA, Dec position to the RA, Dec in each row in
  the table is calculated. Rows whose distance is less than the specified radius
  are output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first argument to the program specifies the FITS file, raw event file, or
  raw array file. If &quot;stdin&quot; is specified, data are read from the
  standard input. Use Funtools Bracket Notation to specify FITS extensions, and
  filters. The second argument is the output FITS file. If &quot;stdout&quot; is
  specified, the FITS binary table is written to the standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third and fourth required arguments are the RA and Dec center position. By
  default, RA is specified in hours while Dec is specified in degrees. You can
  change the units of either of these by appending the character &quot;d&quot;
  (degrees), &quot;h&quot; (hours) or &quot;r&quot; (radians). Sexagesimal
  notation is supported, with colons or spaces separating hms and dms. (When
  using spaces, please ensure that the entire string is quoted.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The fifth required argument is the radius of the cone search. By default, the
  radius value is given in degrees. The units can be changed by appending the
  character &quot;d&quot; (degrees), &quot;r&quot; (radians), &quot;'&quot; (arc
  minutes) or '&quot;' (arc seconds).
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, all columns of the input file are copied to the output file.
  Selected columns can be output using an optional sixth argument in the form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  &quot;column1 column1 ... columnN&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A seventh argument allows you to output selected columns from the list file when
  <b>-j</b> switch is used. Note that the RA and Dec columns used in the cone
  calculation must not be de-selected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also by default, the RA and Dec column names are named &quot;RA&quot; and
  &quot;Dec&quot;, and are given in units of hours and degrees respectively. You
  can change both the name and the units using the -r [RA] and/or -d [Dec]
  switches. Once again, one of &quot;h&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, or &quot;r&quot; is
  appended to the column name to specify units but in this case, there must be a
  colon &quot;:&quot; between the name and the unit specification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-l [listfile]</b> switch is used, then one or more of the center RA,
  center Dec, and radius can be taken from a list file (which can be a FITS
  table or an ASCII column text file). In this case, the third (center RA),
  fourth (center Dec), and fifth (radius) command line arguments can either be a
  column name in the list file (if that parameter varies) or else a numeric
  value (if that parameter is static). When a column name is specified for the
  RA, Dec, or radius, you can append a colon followed by &quot;h&quot;,
  &quot;d&quot;, or &quot;r&quot; to specify units (also ' and &quot; for
  radius). The cone search algorithm is run once for each row in the list,
  taking RA, Dec, and radius values from the specified columns or from static
  numeric values specified on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When using a list, all valid rows from each iteration are written to a single
  output file. Use the <b>-x</b> switch to help delineate which line of the list
  file was used to produce the given output row(s). This switch causes the
  values for the center RA, Dec, radius, and row number to be appended to the
  output file, in columns called RA_CEN, DEC_CEN, RAD_CEN and CONE_KEY,
  respectively. Alternatively, the <b>-j</b> (join) switch will append all
  columns from the list row to the output row (essentially a join of the list
  row and input row), along with the CONE_KEY row number. These two switches are
  mutually exclusive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-X</b> and <b>-J</b> switches write out the same data as their lower case
  counterparts for each row satisfying a cone search. In addition, these
  switches also write out rows from the event file that do not satisfy any cone
  search. In such cases, that CONE_KEY column will be given a value of -1 and
  the center and list position information will be set to zero for the given
  row. Thus, all rows of the input event file are guaranteed to be output, with
  rows satisfying at least one cone search having additional search information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-L</b> switch acts similarly to the <b>-l</b> switch in that it takes
  centers from a list file. However, it also implicitly sets the -j switch, so
  that output rows are the join of the input event row and the center position
  row. In addition, this switch also writes out all center position rows for
  which no event satisfies the cone search criteria of that row. The CONE_KEY
  column will be given a value of -2 for center rows that were not close to any
  data row and the event columns will be zeroed out for such rows. In this way,
  all centers rows are guaranteed to be output at least once.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any of &quot;all row&quot; switches ( <b>-X</b>, <b>-J</b>, or <b>-L</b>) are
  specified, then a new column named JSTAT is added to the output table. The
  positive values in this column indicate the center position row number
  (starting from 1) in the list file that this data row successful matched in a
  cone search. A value of -1 means that the data row did not match any center
  position. A value of -2 means that the center position was not matched by any
  data row.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Given a center position and radius, the cone search algorithm calculates limit
  parameters for a box enclosing the specified cone, and only tests rows whose
  positions values lie within those limits. For small files, the overhead
  associated with this cone limit filtering can cause the program to run more
  slowly than if all events were tested. You can turn off cone limit filtering
  using the <b>-n</b> switch to see if this speeds up the processing (especially
  useful when processing a large list of positions).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the default cone search uses columns &quot;RA&quot; and
  &quot;Dec&quot; in hours and degrees (respectively) and RA position in hours,
  Dec and radius in degrees:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funone in.fits out.fits 23.45 34.56 0.01
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To specify the RA position in degrees:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcone in.fits out.fits 23.45d 34.56 0.01
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get RA and Dec from a list but use a static value for radius (and also write
  identifying info for each row in the list):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcone -x -l list.txt in.fits out.fits MYRA MYDec 0.01
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
User specified columns in degrees, RA position in hours (sexagesimal notation),
  Dec position in degrees (sexagesimal notation) and radius in arc minutes:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  funcone -r myRa:d -d myDec in.fits out.fits 12:30:15.5 30:12 15'
