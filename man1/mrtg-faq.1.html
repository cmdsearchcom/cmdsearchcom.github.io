<p>MRTG-FAQ(1) mrtg MRTG-FAQ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mrtg-faq - How to get help if you have problems with
MRTG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
MRTG seems to raise a lot of questions. There are a number
of resources apart from the documentation where you can find
help for mrtg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FAQ <br>
In the following sections you&rsquo;ll find some additonal
Frequently Asked Questions, with Answers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why is there no &quot;@#$%&quot;
(my native language) version of MRTG? <br>
Nobody has contributed a @#$%.pmd file yet. Go into the
mrtg-2.17.4/translate directory and create your own
translation file. When you are happy with it send it to me
for <br>
inclusion with the next mrtg release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I need a script to make mrtg
work with my xyz device. <br>
Probably this has already been done. Check the stuff in the
mrtg-2.17.4/contrib directory. There is a file called
00INDEX in that directory which tells what you can find in
<br>
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How does this SNMP thing work
<br>
There are many resources on the net that explain SNMP. Take
a look at this article from the Linux Journal by David
Guerrero</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.david-guerrero.com/papers/snmp/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And at this rather long document
from CISCO.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/snmp.htm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The images created by MRTG look
very strange. <br>
Remove the *-{week,day,month,year}.png files and start MRTG
again. Using MRTG for the first time, you might have to do
this twice. This will also help when you introduce new <br>
routers into the cfg file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is my Community Name? <br>
Ask the person in charge of your Router or try
&rsquo;public&rsquo;, as this is the default Community
Name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">My graphs show a flat line
during an outage. Why ? <br>
Well, the short answer is that when an SNMP query goes out
and a response doesn&rsquo;t come back, MRTG has to assume
something to put in the graph, and by default it assumes
that the <br>
last answer we got back is probably closer to the truth than
zero. This assumption is not perfect (as you have noticed).
It&rsquo;s a trade-off that happens to fail during a total
<br>
outage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is an unacceptable
trade-off, use the unknaszero option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want to know what
you&rsquo;re trading off, so in the spirit of trade-offs,
here&rsquo;s the long answer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The problem is that MRTG
doesn&rsquo;t know *why* the data didn&rsquo;t come back,
all it knows is that it didn&rsquo;t come back. It has to do
something, and it assumes it&rsquo;s a stray lost packet
<br>
rather than an outage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why don&rsquo;t we always assume
the circuit is down and use zero, which will (we think) be
more nearly right? Well, it turns out that you may be taking
advantage of MRTG&rsquo;s &quot;assume <br>
last&quot; behaviour without being aware of it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MRTG uses SNMP (Simple Network
Management Protocol) to collect data, and SNMP uses UDP
(User Datagram Protocol) to ship packets around. UDP is
connectionless (not guaranteed) <br>
unlike TCP where packets are tracked and acknowledged and,
if needed, retransmitted. UDP just throws packets at the
network and hopes they arrive. Sometimes they
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One likely cause of lost SNMP
data is congestion; another is busy routers. Other
possibilities include transient telecommunications problems,
router buffer overflows (which may <br>
or may not be congestion-related), &quot;dirty lines&quot;
(links with high error rates), and acts of God. These things
happen all the time; we just don&rsquo;t notice because many
interactive <br>
services are TCP-based and the lost packets get
retransmitted automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above cases where some
SNMP packets are lost but traffic is flowing, assuming zero
is the wrong thing to do - you end up with a graph that
looks like it&rsquo;s missing teeth <br>
whenever the link fills up. MRTG interpolates the lost data
to produce a smoother graph which is more accurate in cases
of intermittent packet loss. But with V2.8.4 and above, <br>
you can use the &quot;unknaszero&quot; option to produce
whichever graph is best under the conditions typical for
your network.</p>
