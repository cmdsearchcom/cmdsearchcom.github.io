mrtg-faq - How to get help if you have problems with MRTG
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
MRTG seems to raise a lot of questions. There are a number of resources apart
  from the documentation where you can find help for mrtg.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FAQ"><a class="selflink" href="#FAQ">FAQ</a></h1>
In the following sections you'll find some additonal Frequently Asked Questions,
  with Answers.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_is_there_no_&quot;@#$%&quot;_(my_native_language)_version_of_MRTG?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_is_there_no_&quot;@#$%&quot;_(my_native_language)_version_of_MRTG?">Why
  is there no &quot;@#$%&quot; (my native language) version of MRTG?</a></h2>
Nobody has contributed a <i>@#$%.pmd</i> file yet. Go into the
  <i>mrtg-2.17.4/translate</i> directory and create your own translation file.
  When you are happy with it send it to me for inclusion with the next mrtg
  release.

  need a script to make mrtg work with my xyz device.</a></h2>
Probably this has already been done. Check the stuff in the
  <i>mrtg-2.17.4/contrib</i> directory. There is a file called <i>00INDEX</i> in
  that directory which tells what you can find in there.

There are many resources on the net that explain SNMP. Take a look at this
  article from the Linux Journal by David Guerrero

And at this rather long document from CISCO.

Remove the *-{week,day,month,year}.png files and start MRTG again. Using MRTG
  for the first time, you might have to do this twice. This will also help when
  you introduce new routers into the cfg file.

  is my Community Name?</a></h2>
Ask the person in charge of your Router or try 'public', as this is the default
  Community Name.

  graphs show a flat line during an outage. Why ?</a></h2>
Well, the short answer is that when an SNMP query goes out and a response
  doesn't come back, MRTG has to assume something to put in the graph, and by
  default it assumes that the last answer we got back is probably closer to the
  truth than zero. This assumption is not perfect (as you have noticed). It's a
  trade-off that happens to fail during a total outage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this is an unacceptable trade-off, use the <b>unknaszero</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may want to know what you're trading off, so in the spirit of trade-offs,
  here's the long answer:
<div class="Pp"></div>
The problem is that MRTG doesn't know *why* the data didn't come back, all it
  knows is that it didn't come back. It has to do something, and it assumes it's
  a stray lost packet rather than an outage.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Why don't we always assume the circuit is down and use zero, which will (we
  think) be more nearly right? Well, it turns out that you may be taking
  advantage of MRTG's &quot;assume last&quot; behaviour without being aware of
  it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
MRTG uses SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) to collect data, and SNMP
  uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to ship packets around. UDP is
  connectionless (not guaranteed) unlike TCP where packets are tracked and
  acknowledged and, if needed, retransmitted. UDP just throws packets at the
  network and hopes they arrive. Sometimes they don't.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One likely cause of lost SNMP data is congestion; another is busy routers. Other
  possibilities include transient telecommunications problems, router buffer
  overflows (which may or may not be congestion-related), &quot;dirty
  lines&quot; (links with high error rates), and acts of God. These things
  happen all the time; we just don't notice because many interactive services
  are TCP-based and the lost packets get retransmitted automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the above cases where some SNMP packets are lost but traffic is flowing,
  assuming zero is the wrong thing to do - you end up with a graph that looks
  like it's missing teeth whenever the link fills up. MRTG interpolates the lost
  data to produce a smoother graph which is more accurate in cases of
  intermittent packet loss. But with V2.8.4 and above, you can use the
  &quot;unknaszero&quot; option to produce whichever graph is best under the
  conditions typical for your network.
