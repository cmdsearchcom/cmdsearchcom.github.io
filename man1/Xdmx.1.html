<p>Xdmx(1) General Commands Manual Xdmx(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Xdmx - Distributed Multi-head X server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Xdmx [:display] [option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X
servers as its display devices. It provides multi-head X
functionality for displays that might be located on
different <br>
machines. Xdmx functions as a front-end X server that acts
as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the
visible rendering is passed to the back-end X servers.
Clients <br>
connect to the Xdmx front-end, and everything appears as it
would in a regular multi-head configuration. If Xinerama is
enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command line), the <br>
clients see a single large screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xdmx communicates to the
back-end X servers using the standard X11 protocol, and
standard and/or commonly available X server extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In addition to the normal X server options described in the
Xserver(1) manual page, Xdmx accepts the following command
line switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display-name <br>
This specifies the name(s) of the back-end X server
display(s) to connect to. This option may be specified
multiple times to connect to more than one back-end display.
<br>
The first is used as screen 0, the second as screen 1, etc.
If this option is omitted, the $DISPLAY environment variable
is used as the single back-end X server display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xinput input-source <br>
This specifies the source to use for XInput extension
devices. The choices are the same as for -input , described
below, except that core devices on backend servers
can&acirc; <br>
not be treated as XInput extension devices. (Although
extension devices on backend and console servers are
supported as extension devices under Xdmx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-input input-source <br>
This specifies the source to use for the core input devices.
The choices are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dummy <br>
A set of dummy core input drivers are used. These never
generate any input events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local <br>
The raw keyboard and pointer from the local computer are
used. A comma-separated list of driver names can be
appended. For example, to select the example Linux
key&acirc; <br>
board and PS/2 mouse driver use: -input local,kbd,ps2. The
following drivers have been implemented for Linux: kbd, ms
(a two-button Microsoft mouse driver), ps2 (a <br>
PS/2 mouse driver), usb-mou (a USB mouse driver), usb-kbd (a
USB keyboard driver), and usb-oth (a USB non-keyboard,
non-mouse driver). Additional drivers may be <br>
implemented in the future. Appropriate defaults will be used
if no comma-separated list is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-name <br>
If the display-name is a back-end server, then core input
events are taken from the server specified. Otherwise, a
console window will be opened on the specified <br>
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the display-name is followed
by &quot;,xi&quot; then XInput extension devices on the
display will be used as Xdmx XInput extension devices. If
the display-name is followed <br>
by &quot;,noxi&quot; then XInput extension devices on the
display will not be used as Xdmx XInput extension devices.
Currently, the default is &quot;,xi&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the display-name is followed
by &quot;,console&quot; and the display-name refers to a
display that is used as a backend display, then a console
window will be opened on that <br>
display and that display will be treated as a backend
display. Otherwise (or if &quot;,noconsole&quot; is used),
the display will be treated purely as a backend or a console
<br>
display, as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the display-name is followed
by &quot;,windows&quot;, then outlines of the windows on the
backend will be displayed inside the console window.
Otherwise (or if &quot;,nowindows&quot; <br>
is used), the console window will not display the outlines
of backend windows. (This option only applies to console
input.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the display-name is followed
by &quot;,xkb&quot;, then the next 1 to 3 comma-separated
parameters will specify the keycodes, symbols, and geometry
of the keyboard for this <br>
input device. For example, &quot;,xkb,xfree86,pc104&quot;
will specify that the &quot;xfree86&quot; keycodes and the
&quot;pc104&quot; symbols should be used to initialize the
keyboard. For an <br>
SGI keyboard, &quot;,xkb,sgi/indy(pc102)&quot; might be
useful. A list of keycodes, symbols, and geometries can be
found in /usr/share/X11/xkb. Use of keycodes, symbols and
<br>
geometries for XKB configuration is deprecated in favor of
the rules, layout, model, variant and options settings
available via the -param command line switch. If <br>
this option is not specified, the input device will be
queried, perhaps using the XKEYBOARD extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option isn&rsquo;t
specified, the default input source is the first back-end
server (the one used for screen 0). The console window shows
the layout of the back-end <br>
display(s) and pointer movements and key presses within the
console window will be used as core input devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several special function keys
are active, depending on the input source:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Alt-q will terminate the
Xdmx server in all modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Alt-g will toggle a server
grab in console mode (a special cursor, currently a spider,
is used to indicate an active server grab).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Alt-f will toggle
fine-grain motion in console mode (a special cursor,
currently a cross hair, is used to indicate this mode). If
this mode is combined with <br>
a server grab, then the cursor will have 4 lines instead of
only 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F12
will switch to another VC in local (raw) mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nomulticursor <br>
This option turns off support for displaying multiple
cursors on overlapped back-end displays. This option is
available for testing and benchmarking purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fontpath <br>
This option sets the Xdmx server&rsquo;s default font path.
This option can be specified multiple times to accommodate
multiple font paths. See the FONT PATHS section below <br>
for very important information regarding setting the default
font path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-configfile filename <br>
Specify the configuration file that should be read. Note
that if the -display command-line option is used, then the
configuration file will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config name <br>
Specify a configuration to use. The name will be the name
following the virtual keyword in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stat interval screens <br>
This option enables the display of performance statistics.
The interval is in seconds. The screens is a count of the
number of back-end screens for which data is <br>
printed each interval. Specifying 0 for screens will display
data for all screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each screen, the following
information is printed: the screen number, an absolute count
of the number of XSync() calls made (SyncCount), the rate of
these calls dur&acirc; <br>
ing the previous interval (Sync/s), the average round-trip
time (in microseconds) of the last 10 XSync() calls
(avSync), the maximum round-trip time (in microseconds) of
<br>
the last 10 XSync calls (mxSync), the average number of
XSync() requests that were pending but not yet processed for
each of the last 10 processed XSync() calls, the max&acirc;
<br>
imum number of XSync() requests that were pending but not
yet processed for each of the last 10 processed XSync()
calls, and a histogram showing the distribution of the <br>
times of all of the XSync() calls that were made during the
previous interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The length of the moving
average and the number and value of histogram bins are
configurable at compile time in the dmxstat.h header
file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syncbatch interval <br>
This option sets the interval in milliseconds for XSync()
batching. An interval less than or equal to 0 will disable
XSync() batching. The default interval is 100 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nooffscreenopt <br>
This option disables the offscreen optimization. Since the
lazy window creation optimization requires the offscreen
optimization to be enabled, this option will also <br>
disable the lazy window creation optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowindowopt <br>
This option disables the lazy window creation
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosubdivprims <br>
This option disables the primitive subdivision
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noxkb Disable use of the XKB
extension for communication with the back end displays.
(Combine with -kb to disable all use of XKB.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-depth int <br>
This option sets the root window&rsquo;s default depth. When
choosing a default visual from those available on the
back-end X server, the first visual with that matches the
<br>
depth specified is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be combined with
the -cc option, which specifies the default color visual
class, to force the use of a specific depth and color class
for the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-norender <br>
This option disables the RENDER extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noglxproxy <br>
This option disables GLX proxy -- the build-in GLX extension
implementation that is DMX aware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noglxswapgroup <br>
This option disables the swap group and swap barrier
extensions in GLX proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glxsyncswap <br>
This option enables synchronization after a swap buffers
call by waiting until all X protocol has been processed.
When a client issues a glXSwapBuffers request, Xdmx <br>
relays that request to each back-end X server, and those
requests are buffered along with all other protocol
requests. However, in systems that have large network
buf&acirc; <br>
fers, this buffering can lead to the set of back-end X
servers handling the swap buffers request asynchronously.
With this option, an XSync() request is issued to each <br>
back-end X server after sending the swap buffers request.
The XSync() requests will flush all buffered protocol
(including the swap buffers requests) and wait until the
<br>
back-end X servers have processed those requests before
continuing. This option does not wait until all GL commands
have been processed so there might be previously <br>
issued commands that are still being processed in the GL
pipe when the XSync() request returns. See the
-glxfinishswap option below if Xdmx should wait until the GL
com&acirc; <br>
mands have been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glxfinishswap <br>
This option enables synchronization after a swap buffers
call by waiting until all GL commands have been completed.
It is similar to the -glxsyncswap option above; how&acirc;
<br>
ever, instead of issuing an XSync(), it issues a glFinish()
request to each back-end X server after sending the swap
buffers requests. The glFinish() request will flush <br>
all buffered protocol requests, process both X and GL
requests, and wait until all previously called GL commands
are complete before returning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignorebadfontpaths <br>
This option ignores font paths that are not available on all
back-end servers by removing the bad font path(s) from the
default font path list. If no valid font paths <br>
are left after removing the bad paths, an error to that
effect is printed in the log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-addremovescreens <br>
This option enables the dynamic addition and removal of
screens, which is disabled by default. Note that GLXProxy
and Render do not yet support dynamic addition and <br>
removal of screens, and must be disabled via the -noglxproxy
and -norender command line options described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-param This option specifies
parameters on the command line. Currently, only parameters
dealing with XKEYBOARD configuration are supported. These
parameters apply only to the <br>
core keyboard. Parameter values are installation-dependent.
Please see /usr/share/X11/xkb or a similar directory for
complete information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XkbRules <br>
Defaults to &quot;evdev&quot;. Other values may include
&quot;sgi&quot; and &quot;sun&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XkbModel <br>
Defaults to &quot;pc105&quot;. When used with
&quot;base&quot; rules, other values may include
&quot;pc102&quot;, &quot;pc104&quot;, &quot;microsoft&quot;,
and many others. When used with &quot;sun&quot; rules, other
<br>
values may include &quot;type4&quot; and
&quot;type5&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XkbLayout <br>
Defaults to &quot;us&quot;. Other country codes and
&quot;dvorak&quot; are usually available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XkbVariant <br>
Defaults to &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XkbOptions <br>
Defaults to &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE GRAMMAR <br>
The following words and tokens are reserved: <br>
virtual display wall option param { } ; #</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments start with a # mark and
extend to the end of the line. They may appear anywhere. If
a configuration file is read into xdmxconfig, the comments
in that file will be <br>
preserved, but will not be editable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The grammar is as follows: <br>
virtual-list ::= [ virtual-list ] | virtual</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual ::= virtual [ name ] [
dim ] { dw-list }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dw-list ::= [ dw-list ] | dw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dw ::= display | wall |
option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display ::= display name [
geometry ] [ / geometry ] [ origin ] ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wall ::= wall [ dim ] [ dim ]
name-list ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option ::= option name-list
;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param ::= param name-list ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param ::= param { param-list
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param-list ::= [ param-list ] |
name-list ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name-list ::= [ name-list ] |
name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name ::= string |
double-quoted-string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dim ::= integer x integer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geometry ::= [ integer x integer
] [ signed-integer signed-integer ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">origin ::= @ integer x
integer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name following virtual is
used as an identifier for the configuration, and may be
passed to Xdmx using the -config command line option. The
name of a display should be stan&acirc; <br>
dard X display name, although no checking is performed
(e.g., &quot;machine:0&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For names, double quotes are
optional unless the name is reserved or contains spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first dimension following
wall is the dimension for tiling (e.g., 2x4 or 4x4). The
second dimension following wall is the dimension of each
display in the wall (e.g., <br>
1280x1024).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first geometry following
display is the geometry of the screen window on the backend
server. The second geometry, which is always preceeded by a
slash, is the geometry of <br>
the root window. By default, the root window has the same
geometry as the screen window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option line can be used to
specify any command-line options (e.g., -input). (It cannot
be used to specify the name of the front-end display.) The
option line is processed <br>
once at server startup, just line command line options. This
behavior may be unexpected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLES <br>
Two displays being used for a desktop may be specified in
any of the following formats: <br>
virtual example0 { <br>
display d0:0 1280x1024 @0x0; <br>
display d1:0 1280x1024 @1280x0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual example1 { <br>
display d0:0 1280x1024; <br>
display d1:0 @1280x0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual example2 { <br>
display &quot;d0:0&quot;; <br>
display &quot;d1:0&quot; @1280x0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual example3 { wall 2x1 d0:0
d1:0; } <br>
A 4x4 wall of 16 total displays could be specified as
follows (if no tiling dimension is specified, an approximate
square is used): <br>
virtual example4 { <br>
wall d0:0 d1:0 d2:0 d3:0 <br>
d4:0 d5:0 d6:0 d7:0 <br>
d8:0 d9:0 da:0 db:0 <br>
dc:0 dd:0 de:0 df:0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONT PATHS <br>
The font path used by the Xdmx front-end server will be
propagated to each back-end server,which requires that each
back-end server have access to the exact same font paths as
<br>
the front-end server. This can be most easily handled by
either using a font server (e.g., xfs) or by remotely
mounting the font paths on each back-end server, and then
setting <br>
the Xdmx server&rsquo;s default font path with the -I
&quot;-fontpath&quot; command line option described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you specify a
font path with the following command line: <br>
Xdmx :1 -display d0:0 -fontpath /usr/fonts/75dpi/ -fontpath
/usr/fonts/Type1/ +xinerama <br>
Then, /usr/fonts/75dpi/ and /usr/fonts/Type1/ must be valid
font paths on the Xdmx server and all back-end server, which
is d0 in this example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font servers can also be
specified with the -fontpath option. For example,
let&rsquo;s assume that a properly configured font server is
running on host d0. Then, the following com&acirc; <br>
mand line <br>
Xdmx :1 -display d0:0 -display d1:0 -fontpath tcp/d0:7100
+xinerama <br>
will initialize the front-end Xdmx server and each of the
back-end servers to use the font server on d0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some fonts might not be
supported by either the front-end or the back-end servers.
For example, let&rsquo;s assume the front-end Xdmx server
includes support Type1 fonts, but one of <br>
the back-end servers does not. Let&rsquo;s also assume that
the default font path for Xdmx includes Type1 fonts in its
font path. Then, when Xdmx initializes the default font path
to <br>
load the default font, the font path that includes Type1
fonts (along with the other default font paths that are used
by the Xdmx server) is sent to the back-end server that
can&acirc; <br>
not handle Type1 fonts. That back-end server then rejects
the font path and sends an error back to the Xdmx server.
Xdmx then prints an error message and exits because it <br>
failed to set the default font path and was unable load the
default font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To fix this error, the offending
font path must be removed from the default font path by
using a different -fontpath command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fontpath option can also be
added to the configuration file as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE EXAMPLES <br>
The back-end machines are d0 and d1, core input is from the
pointer and keyboard attached to d0, clients will refer to
:1 when opening windows: <br>
Xdmx :1 -display d0:0 -display d1:0 +xinerama</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above, except with core input
from d1: <br>
Xdmx :1 -display d0:0 -display d1:0 -input d1:0
+xinerama</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above, except with core input
from a console window on the local display: <br>
Xdmx :1 -display d0:0 -display d1:0 -input :0 +xinerama</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As above, except with core input
from the local keyboard and mouse: <br>
Xdmx :1 -display d0:0 -display d1:0 -input local,kbd,ps2
+xinerama <br>
Note that local input can be used under Linux while another
X session is running on :0 (assuming the user can access the
Linux console tty and mouse devices): a new (blank) VC <br>
will be used for keyboard input on the local machine and the
Ctrl-Alt-F* sequence will be available to change to another
VC (possibly back to another X session running on the <br>
local machine). Using Ctrl-Alt-Backspace on the blank VC
will terminate the Xdmx session and return to the original
VC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example uses the
configuration file shown in the previous section: <br>
Xdmx :1 -input :0 +xinerama -configfile filename -config
example2 <br>
With this configuration file line: <br>
option -input :0 +xinerama; <br>
the command line can be shortened to: <br>
Xdmx :1 -configfile filename -config example2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING THE USB DEVICE DRIVERS
<br>
The USB device drivers use the devices called
/dev/input/event0, /dev/input/event1, etc. under Linux.
These devices are driven using the evdev Linux kernel
module, which is <br>
part of the hid suite. Please note that if you load the
mousedev or kbddev Linux kernel modules, then USB devices
will appear as core Linux input devices and you will not be
<br>
able to select between using the device only as an Xdmx core
device or an Xdmx XInput extension device. Further, you may
be unable to unload the mousedev Linux kernel module if <br>
XFree86 is configured to use /dev/input/mice as an input
device (this is quite helpful for laptop users and is set up
by default under some Linux distributions, but should be
<br>
changed if USB devices are to be used with Xdmx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The USB device drivers search
through the Linux devices for the first mouse, keyboard, or
non-mouse-non-keyboard Linux device and use that device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD INITIALIZATION <br>
If Xdmx was invoked with -xkb or was not compiled to use the
XKEYBOARD extension, then a keyboard on a backend or console
will be initialized using the map that the host X server
<br>
provides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the XKEYBOARD extension is
used for both Xdmx and the host X server for the keyboard
(i.e., the backend or console X server), then the type of
the keyboard will be obtained <br>
from the host X server and the keyboard under Xdmx will be
initialized with that information. Otherwise, the default
type of keyboard will be initialized. In both cases, the
<br>
map from the host X server will not be used. This means that
different initial behavior may be noted with and without
XKEYBOARD. Consistent and expected results will be <br>
obtained by running XKEYBOARD on all servers and by avoiding
the use of xmodmap on the backend or console X servers prior
to starting Xdmx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -xkbmap is specified on the
Xdmx command line, then that map will currently be used for
all keyboards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPLE CORE KEYBOARDS <br>
X was not designed to support multiple core keyboards.
However, Xdmx provides some support for multiple core
keyboards. Best results will be obtained if all of the
keyboards <br>
are of the same type and are using the same keyboard map.
Because the X server passes raw key code information to the
X client, key symbols for keyboards with different key maps
<br>
would be different if the key code for each keyboard was
sent without translation to the client. Therefore, Xdmx will
attempt to translate the key code from a core keyboard to
<br>
the key code for the key with the same key symbol of the
first core keyboard that was loaded. If the key symbol
appears in both maps, the results will be expected.
Otherwise, <br>
the second core keyboard will return a NoSymbol key symbol
for some keys that would have been translated if it was the
first core keyboard.</p>
