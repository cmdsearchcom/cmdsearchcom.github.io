<p style="margin-top: 1em">RSTARTD(1) General Commands
Manual RSTARTD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rstartd - a sample implementation of a Remote Start rsh
helper</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rstartd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rstartd.real [-c
configfilename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rstartd is an implementation of a Remote Start
&quot;helper&quot; as defined in &quot;A Flexible Remote
Execution Protocol Based on rsh&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document describes the
peculiarities of rstartd and how it is configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c configfilename <br>
This option specifies the &quot;global&quot; configuration
file that rstartd is to read. Normally, rstartd is a shell
script that invokes rstartd.real with the -c switch,
allowing <br>
local configuration of the location of the configuration
file. If rstartd.real is started without the -c option, it
reads /usr/lib/X11/rstart/config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
It is critical to successful interoperation of the Remote
Start protocol that rstartd be installed in a directory
which is in the &quot;default&quot; search path, so that
default rsh <br>
requests and the ilk will be able to find it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION AND OPERATION <br>
Rstartd is by design highly configurable. One would like
things like configuration file locations to be fixed, so
that users and administrators can find them without
searching, <br>
but reality is that no two vendors will agree on where
things should go, and nobody thinks the original location is
&quot;right&quot;. Thus, rstartd allows one to relocate all
of its <br>
files and directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rstartd has a hierarchy of
configuration files which are executed in order when a
request is made. They are: <br>
global config <br>
per-user (&quot;local&quot;) config <br>
global per-context config <br>
per-user (&quot;local&quot;) per-context config <br>
config from request <br>
As you might guess from the presence of &quot;config from
request&quot;, all of the config files are in the format of
an rstart request. Rstartd defines a few additional keywords
with the <br>
INTERNAL- prefix for specifying its configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rstartd starts by reading and
executing the global config file. This file will normally
specify the locations of the other configuration files and
any systemwide defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rstartd will then read the
user&rsquo;s local config file, default name
$HOME/.rstart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rstartd will then start
interpreting the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Presumably one of the first
lines in the request will be a CONTEXT line. The context
name is converted to lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rstartd will read the global
config file for that context, default name
/usr/lib/X11/rstart/contexts/&lt;name&gt;, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will then read the
user&rsquo;s config file for that context, default name
$HOME/.rstart.contexts/&lt;name&gt;, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If neither of these exists,
rstartd aborts with a Failure message.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rstartd will finish interpreting
the request, and execute the program specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows the system
administrator and the user a large degree of control over
the operation of rstartd. The administrator has final say,
because the global config file <br>
doesn&rsquo;t need to specify a per-user config file. If it
does, however, the user can override anything from the
global file, and can even completely replace the global
context con&acirc; <br>
fig files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The config files have a somewhat
more flexible format than requests do; they are allowed to
contain blank lines and lines beginning with &quot;#&quot;
are comments and ignored. (#s in the <br>
middle of lines are data, not comment markers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any commands run are provided a
few useful pieces of information in environment variables.
The exact names are configurable, but the supplied defaults
are: <br>
$RSTART_CONTEXT the name of the context <br>
$RSTART_GLOBAL_CONTEXTS the global contexts directory <br>
$RSTART_LOCAL_CONTEXTS the local contexts directory <br>
$RSTART_GLOBAL_COMMANDS the global generic commands
directory <br>
$RSTART_LOCAL_COMMANDS the local generic commands directory
<br>
$RSTART_{GLOBAL,LOCAL}_CONTEXTS should contain one special
file, @List, which contains a list of the contexts in that
directory in the format specified for ListContexts. The <br>
supplied version of ListContexts will cat both the global
and local copies of @List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generic commands are searched
for in several places: (defaults) <br>
per-user per-context directory
($HOME/.rstart.commands/&lt;context&gt;) <br>
global per-context directory
(/usr/lib/X11/rstart/commands/&lt;context&gt;) <br>
per-user all-contexts directory ($HOME/.rstart.commands)
<br>
global all-contexts directory (/usr/lib/X11/rstart/commands)
<br>
(Yes, this means you can&rsquo;t have an all-contexts
generic command with the same name as a context. It
didn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these directories should
have a file called @List that gives the names and
descriptions of the commands in that directory in the format
specified for ListGenericCommands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION KEYWORDS <br>
There are several &quot;special&quot; rstart keywords
defined for rstartd configuration. Unless otherwise
specified, there are no defaults; related features are
disabled in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-REGISTRIES name ...
<br>
Gives a space-separated list of &quot;MISC&quot; registries
that this system understands. (Registries other than this
are accepted but generate a Warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-LOCAL-DEFAULT
relative_filename <br>
Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-GLOBAL-CONTEXTS
absolute_directory_name <br>
Gives the name of the system-wide contexts directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-LOCAL-CONTEXTS
relative_directory_name <br>
Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user contexts
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-GLOBAL-COMMANDS
absolute_directory_name <br>
Gives the name of the system-wide generic commands
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-LOCAL-COMMANDS
relative_directory_name <br>
Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user generic
commands directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-VARIABLE-PREFIX prefix
<br>
Gives the prefix for the configuration environment variables
rstartd passes to its kids.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-AUTH-PROGRAM authscheme
program argv[0] argv[1] ... <br>
Specifies the program to run to set up authentication for
the specified authentication scheme. &quot;program argv[0]
...&quot; gives the program to run and its arguments, in the
<br>
same form as the EXEC keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-AUTH-INPUT authscheme
<br>
Specifies the data to be given to the authorization program
as its standard input. Each argument is passed as a single
line. $n, where n is a number, is replaced by the <br>
n&rsquo;th argument to the &quot;AUTH authscheme arg1 arg2
...&quot; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNAL-PRINT arbitrary text
<br>
Prints its arguments as a Debug message. Mostly for rstartd
debugging, but could be used to debug config files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When using the C shell, or any other shell which runs a
script every time the shell is started, the script may get
run several times. In the worst case, the script may get run
<br>
three times: <br>
By rsh, to run rstartd <br>
By rstartd, to run the specified command <br>
By the command, eg xterm <br>
rstartd currently limits lines, both from config files and
requests, to BUFSIZ bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETACH is implemented by
redirecting file descriptors 0,1, and 2 to /dev/null and
forking before executing the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMD is implemented by invoking
$SHELL (default /bin/sh) with &quot;-c&quot; and the
specified command as arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX-UMASK is implemented in
the obvious way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authorization programs are
run in the same context as the target program - same
environment variables, path, etc. Long term this might be a
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the X context, GENERIC-CMD
Terminal runs xterm. In the OpenWindows context, GENERIC-CMD
Terminal runs cmdtool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the X context, GENERIC-CMD
LoadMonitor runs xload. In the OpenWindows context,
GENERIC-CMD LoadMonitor runs perfmeter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERIC-CMD ListContexts lists
the contents of @List in both the system-wide and per-user
contexts directories. It is available in all contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERIC-CMD ListGenericCommands
lists the contents of @List in the system-wide and per-user
commands directories, including the per-context
subdirectories for the current con&acirc; <br>
text. It is available in all contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT None is not
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT Default is really
dull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For installation ease, the
&quot;contexts&quot; directory in the distribution contains
a file &quot;@Aliases&quot; which lists a context name and
aliases for that context. This file is used to make <br>
symlinks in the contexts and commands directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All MISC values are passed
unmodified as environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can mistreat rstartd in any
number of ways, resulting in anything from stupid behavior
to core dumps. Other than by explicitly running programs I
don&rsquo;t think it can write or <br>
delete any files, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee of that.
The important thing is that (a) it probably won&rsquo;t do
anything REALLY stupid and (b) it runs with the user&rsquo;s
permissions, so <br>
it can&rsquo;t do anything catastrophic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@List files need not be
complete; contexts or commands which are dull or which need
not or should not be advertised need not be listed. In
particular, per-user @List files <br>
should not list things which are in the system-wide @List
files. In the future, perhaps ListContexts and
ListGenericCommands will automatically suppress lines from
the system- <br>
wide files when there are per-user replacements for those
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error handling is OK to weak. In
particular, no attempt is made to properly report errors on
the exec itself. (Perversely, exec errors could be reliably
reported when detach&acirc; <br>
ing, but not when passing the stdin/out socket to the
app.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If compiled with
-DODT1_DISPLAY_HACK, rstartd will work around a bug in SCO
ODT version 1. (1.1?) (The bug is that the X clients are all
compiled with a bad library that <br>
doesn&rsquo;t know how to look host names up using DNS. The
fix is to look up a host name in $DISPLAY and substitute an
IP address.) This is a trivial example of an incompatibility
<br>
that rstart can hide.</p>
