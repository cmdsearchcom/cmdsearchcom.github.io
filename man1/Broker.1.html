<b>C++Broker</b> [ <i>options</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This is the SBW Broker, version 2.11.1 (C++ Release,Linux running on port:
  <b>-1</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The SBW Broker runs as a background process on a computer to coordinate the
  activities of SBW modules. It enables locating and starting modules on demand.
  The SBW Broker should not normally need to be started explicitly, because the
  SBW libraries start the Broker if it is not already running. However, some
  functions (such as the <b>--shutdown</b> command) do need to be invoked
  directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-a</b> | <b>--accept-address</b> ADDRESS
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is for use with host-based (non-SSH) authentication
      and when modules from other hosts are allowed to connect to the Broker.
      This option adds the given ADDRESS to the list of host addresses allowed
      to connect to this SBW Broker. The address must be specified in IPv4
      dotted quad notation: &quot;123.123.123.123&quot;. Any of the four fields
      can be replaced with the wildcard character '*' to indicate that any value
      for that field is acceptable. So, for example, &quot;132.215.42.*&quot;
      indicates any host on the subnet &quot;132.215.42.*&quot; may connect to
      the Broker. This option interacts with the <b>--deny-address</b> option
      documented below in the following way: addresses that are allowed, and not
      explicitly denied, are permitted. (This option has no effect unless the
      options <b>--remote-modules</b> or <b>--no-ssh</b> are also given.)</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-b</b> | <b>--broker-ports</b> LOW-HIGH
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, the Broker opens a port for inter-Broker
      communications by searching for the first free port in the range 10102
      through 10202, inclusive. This option allows you to specify a different
      port range, from port number LOW through port number HIGH, inclusive. For
      example, &quot;--broker-ports 11000-12000&quot; would dictate that the
      Broker should look for a free port in the range 10001 through 10010. You
      can force the Broker to try to use one particular port by using the same
      number for LOW and HIGH.</dd>

<b>-d</b> | <b>--deny-address</b> ADDRESS

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, only connections originating from the local
      host can connect to the Broker. The <b>--remote-modules</b> flag enables
      modules running on hosts other than the local host to connect to this
      Broker. This flag is not needed in normal SBW use scenarios because a
      module running on a remote host should normally be connected to a Broker
      running on that host. Also, note that this flag only affects whether
      network connections from non-local hosts are permitted; a remote module
      will still be denied if it does not have the same session key as is being
      used by the Broker.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-g</b> | <b>--registry</b> PATHNAME
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>

<b>-h</b> | <b>--help</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>

<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-l</b> | <b>--reload-key</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally, if a Broker is not already running on the local
      host when a new Broker is started, the Broker generates a new session
      authentication key and stores it in a private file inside the
      &quot;.sbw&quot; directory/folder in the user's home directory. The
      <b>--reload-key</b> flag tells the Broker to not generate a new key, and
      instead to reuse the key in the key file. This flag should not normally be
      used; it is primarily for use by remote Brokers.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Change what is assumed to be the root directory of the SBW
      installation to PATHNAME. By default, SBW uses various approaches to

  <dd class="It-tag">By default, SBW stores information in a user-specific
      subdirectory/folder called &quot;.sbw&quot; in the user's home directory.
      This flag allows you to override the default and set the user directory to
      an explicit PATHNAME. This may be useful in distributed computing
      environments where home directories are not where they're expected.</dd>
