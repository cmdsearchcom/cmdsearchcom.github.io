<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Broker - manual page for Broker 2.11.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
C++Broker [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is the SBW Broker, version 2.11.1 (C++ Release,Linux
running on port: -1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SBW Broker runs as a
background process on a computer to coordinate the
activities of SBW modules. It enables locating and starting
modules on demand. The SBW Broker should <br>
not normally need to be started explicitly, because the SBW
libraries start the Broker if it is not already running.
However, some functions (such as the --shutdown command) do
<br>
need to be invoked directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a | --accept-address
ADDRESS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is for use with host-based
(non-SSH) authentication and when modules from other hosts
are allowed to connect to the Broker. This option adds the
given ADDRESS to the <br>
list of host addresses allowed to connect to this SBW
Broker. The address must be specified in IPv4 dotted quad
notation: &quot;123.123.123.123&quot;. Any of the four
fields can <br>
be replaced with the wildcard character &rsquo;*&rsquo; to
indicate that any value for that field is acceptable. So,
for example, &quot;132.215.42.*&quot; indicates any host on
the subnet <br>
&quot;132.215.42.*&quot; may connect to the Broker. This
option interacts with the --deny-address option documented
below in the following way: addresses that are allowed, and
not <br>
explicitly denied, are permitted. (This option has no effect
unless the options --remote-modules or --no-ssh are also
given.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b | --broker-ports LOW-HIGH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the Broker opens a
port for inter-Broker communications by searching for the
first free port in the range 10102 through 10202, inclusive.
This option allows <br>
you to specify a different port range, from port number LOW
through port number HIGH, inclusive. For example,
&quot;--broker-ports 11000-12000&quot; would dictate that
the Broker <br>
should look for a free port in the range 10001 through
10010. You can force the Broker to try to use one particular
port by using the same number for LOW and HIGH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d | --deny-address ADDRESS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is for use with host-based
(non-SSH) authentication and when modules from other hosts
are allowed to connect to the Broker. This option the given
ADDRESS to the list <br>
of host addresses prevented from connecting to this SBW
Broker. The address must be specified in IPv4 dotted quad
notation: &quot;123.123.123.123&quot;. Any of the four
fields can <br>
be replaced with the wildcard character &rsquo;*&rsquo; to
indicate that any value for that field is acceptable. So,
for example, &quot;132.215.42.*&quot; indicates any host on
the subnet <br>
&quot;132.215.42.*&quot; is denied from connecting to the
Broker. This option interacts with the --accept-address
option documented above in the following way: addresses that
are <br>
allowed, and not explicitly denied, are permitted. (This
option has no effect unless the options --remote-modules or
--no-ssh are also given.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e | --remote-modules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, only connections
originating from the local host can connect to the Broker.
The --remote-modules flag enables modules running on hosts
other than the local <br>
host to connect to this Broker. This flag is not needed in
normal SBW use scenarios because a module running on a
remote host should normally be connected to a Broker <br>
running on that host. Also, note that this flag only affects
whether network connections from non-local hosts are
permitted; a remote module will still be denied if it <br>
does not have the same session key as is being used by the
Broker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g | --registry PATHNAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag specifies that the
file given by PATHNAME should be used as the Broker&rsquo;s
module registry file, instead of the Broker&rsquo;s built-in
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag tells the Broker to
print this help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i | --info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This produces a description of
the running state of the Broker (if there is a Broker
running on this computer) and then exits without doing
anything else or processing any <br>
other flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k | --key-file PATHNAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the file given by PATHNAME
as the session key file instead of the default pathname. The
default session authentication key is stored it in a private
file inside the <br>
&quot;.sbw&quot; directory/folder in the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l | --reload-key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, if a Broker is not
already running on the local host when a new Broker is
started, the Broker generates a new session authentication
key and stores it in a pri&acirc; <br>
vate file inside the &quot;.sbw&quot; directory/folder in
the user&rsquo;s home directory. The --reload-key flag tells
the Broker to not generate a new key, and instead to reuse
the key <br>
in the key file. This flag should not normally be used; it
is primarily for use by remote Brokers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m | --module-ports LOW-HIGH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the Broker opens a
port for module connections by searching for the first free
port in the range 10002 through 10102, inclusive. This
option allows you to <br>
specify a different port range, from port number LOW through
port number HIGH, inclusive. For example,
&quot;--module-ports 11000-12000&quot; would dictate that
the Broker should <br>
look for a free port in the range 10001 through 10010. You
can force the Broker to try to use one particular port by
using the same number for LOW and HIGH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o | --module-options
&quot;OPTIONS STRING&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the given options as
command-line options to modules when they are started up.
THIS OPTION CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R | --no-remote</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the Broker is always
listening for connections from other Brokers. This flag
tells the Broker to disallow remote Broker connections. It
does this by not <br>
starting up the listener thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r | --remote-from HOSTNAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flag handed to a Broker when it
is started remotely by another Broker. The HOSTNAME is the
host that started this Broker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S | --no-ssh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable the use of SSH for
remote Broker communications. <br>
It</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will still be possible to
connect Brokers manually, but there will be no security on
the communications channel and it will require manually
copying session key files <br>
between hosts and starting the individual Brokers. Use of
this option is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s | --sbw-home PATHNAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change what is assumed to be the
root directory of the SBW installation to PATHNAME. By
default, SBW uses various approaches to determine the root
of its installation; <br>
this flag allows you to override them and explicitly set the
path to the installation directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t | --trace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag can only be used with
the debugging copy of the Broker (i.e., file
SBWBroker-debug.jar). It turns on tracing of activities in
the Broker and leads to copious <br>
debugging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U | --shutdown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This shuts down a running Broker
(if any) on the local host. A new Broker is not started.
This is the preferred method for shutting down Brokers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u | --user-dir PATHNAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, SBW stores
information in a user-specific subdirectory/folder called
&quot;.sbw&quot; in the user&rsquo;s home directory. This
flag allows you to override the default and set <br>
the user directory to an explicit PATHNAME. This may be
useful in distributed computing environments where home
directories are not where they&rsquo;re expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w | --module-wait INTEGER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of time, in tenths of
a second, that the Broker should wait for a module to start
up. The default is 600 (1 minute).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SBW home page is

to sysbio-team@caltech.edu</p>
