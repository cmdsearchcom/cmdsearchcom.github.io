This manual page documents the <b>sshpass</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>sshpass</b> is a utility designed for running <b>ssh</b> using the mode
  referred to as &quot;keyboard-interactive&quot; password authentication, but
  in non-interactive mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ssh uses direct TTY access to make sure that the password is indeed issued by an
  interactive keyboard user. Sshpass runs ssh in a dedicated tty, fooling it
  into thinking it is getting the password from an interactive user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command to run is specified after sshpass' own options. Typically it will be
  &quot;ssh&quot; with arguments, but it can just as well be any other command.
  The password prompt used by ssh is, however, currently hardcoded into sshpass.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Options">Options</a></h1>
If no option is given, sshpass reads the password from the standard input. The
  user may give at most one alternative source for the password:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p<i>password</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The password is given on the command line. Please note the
      section titled &quot; <b>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</b>&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f<i>filename</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The password is the first line of the file
    <i>filename</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d<i>number</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>number</i> is a file descriptor inherited by sshpass
      from the runner. The password is read from the open file descriptor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The password is taken from the environment variable
      &quot;SSHPASS&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-P</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the password prompt. Sshpass searched for this prompt
      in the program's output to the TTY as an indication when to send the
      password. By default sshpass looks for the string &quot;assword:&quot;
      (which matches both &quot;Password:&quot; and &quot;password:&quot;). If
      your client's prompt does not fall under either of these, you can override
      the default with this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Be verbose. sshpass will output to stderr information that
      should help debug cases where the connection hangs, seemingly for no good
      reason.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS">SECURITY
  CONSIDERATIONS</a></h1>
First and foremost, users of sshpass should realize that ssh's insistance on
  only getting the password interactively is not without reason. It is close to
  impossible to securely store the password, and users of sshpass should
  consider whether ssh's public key authentication provides the same end-user
  experience, while involving less hassle and being more secure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -p option should be considered the least secure of all of sshpass's options.
  All system users can see the password in the command line with a simple
  &quot;ps&quot; command. Sshpass makes a minimal attempt to hide the password,
  but such attempts are doomed to create race conditions without actually
  solving the problem. Users of sshpass are encouraged to use one of the other
  password passing techniques, which are all more secure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In particular, people writing programs that are meant to communicate the
  password programatically are encouraged to use an anonymous pipe and pass the
  pipe's reading end to sshpass using the -d option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUES"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_VALUES">RETURN
  VALUES</a></h1>
As with any other program, sshpass returns 0 on success. In case of failure, the
  following return codes are used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invalid command line argument</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Conflicting arguments given</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">General runtime error</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Unrecognized response from ssh (parse error)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Invalid/incorrect password</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Host public key is unknown. sshpass exits without
      confirming the new key.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, ssh might be complaining about a man in the middle attack. This
  complaint does not go to the tty. In other words, even with sshpass, the error
  message from ssh is printed to standard error. In such a case ssh's return
  code is reported back. This is typically an unimaginative (and
  non-informative) &quot;255&quot; for all error cases.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
Run rsync over SSH using password authentication, passing the password on the
  command line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
rsync --rsh='sshpass -p 12345 ssh -l test' host.example.com:path .
<div class="Pp"></div>
To do the same from a bourne shell script in a marginally less exposed way:
<div class="Pp"></div>
SSHPASS=12345 rsync --rsh='sshpass -e ssh -l test' host.example.com:path .
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Sshpass is in its infancy at the moment. As such, bugs are highly possible. In
  particular, if the password is read from stdin (no password option at all), it
  is possible that some of the input aimed to be passed to ssh will be read by
  sshpass and lost.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sshpass utilizes the <b>pty</b>(7) interface to control the TTY for ssh. This
  interface, at least on Linux, has a misfeature where if no slave file
  descriptors are open, the master pty returns <b>EIO</b>. This is the normal
  behavior, except a slave pty may be born at any point by a program opening
  <b>/dev/tty</b>. This makes it impossible to reliably wait for events without
  consuming 100% of the CPU.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Over the various versions different approaches were attempted at solving this
  problem. Any given version of sshpass is released with the belief that it is
  working, but experience has shown that these things do, occasionally, break.
  This happened with OpenSSH version 5.6. As of this writing, it is believed
  that sshpass is, again, working properly.</div>
