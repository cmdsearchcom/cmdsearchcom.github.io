<p>SSHPASS(1) Sshpass User Manual SSHPASS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sshpass - noninteractive ssh password provider</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sshpass [-ffilename|-dnum|-ppassword|-e] [options] command
arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents the sshpass command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshpass is a utility designed
for running ssh using the mode referred to as
&quot;keyboard-interactive&quot; password authentication,
but in non-interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh uses direct TTY access to
make sure that the password is indeed issued by an
interactive keyboard user. Sshpass runs ssh in a dedicated
tty, fooling it into thinking it is <br>
getting the password from an interactive user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command to run is specified
after sshpass&rsquo; own options. Typically it will be
&quot;ssh&quot; with arguments, but it can just as well be
any other command. The password prompt used by <br>
ssh is, however, currently hardcoded into sshpass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
If no option is given, sshpass reads the password from the
standard input. The user may give at most one alternative
source for the password:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppassword <br>
The password is given on the command line. Please note the
section titled &quot;SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffilename <br>
The password is the first line of the file filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dnumber <br>
number is a file descriptor inherited by sshpass from the
runner. The password is read from the open file
descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e The password is taken from
the environment variable &quot;SSHPASS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Set the password prompt.
Sshpass searched for this prompt in the program&rsquo;s
output to the TTY as an indication when to send the
password. By default sshpass looks for the <br>
string &quot;assword:&quot; (which matches both
&quot;Password:&quot; and &quot;password:&quot;). If your
client&rsquo;s prompt does not fall under either of these,
you can override the default with this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose. sshpass will
output to stderr information that should help debug cases
where the connection hangs, seemingly for no good
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
First and foremost, users of sshpass should realize that
ssh&rsquo;s insistance on only getting the password
interactively is not without reason. It is close to
impossible to securely <br>
store the password, and users of sshpass should consider
whether ssh&rsquo;s public key authentication provides the
same end-user experience, while involving less hassle and
being more <br>
secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option should be
considered the least secure of all of sshpass&rsquo;s
options. All system users can see the password in the
command line with a simple &quot;ps&quot; command. Sshpass
<br>
makes a minimal attempt to hide the password, but such
attempts are doomed to create race conditions without
actually solving the problem. Users of sshpass are
encouraged to use <br>
one of the other password passing techniques, which are all
more secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, people writing
programs that are meant to communicate the password
programatically are encouraged to use an anonymous pipe and
pass the pipe&rsquo;s reading end to ssh&acirc; <br>
pass using the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
As with any other program, sshpass returns 0 on success. In
case of failure, the following return codes are used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Invalid command line
argument</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Conflicting arguments
given</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 General runtime error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Unrecognized response from ssh
(parse error)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Invalid/incorrect password</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Host public key is unknown.
sshpass exits without confirming the new key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, ssh might be
complaining about a man in the middle attack. This complaint
does not go to the tty. In other words, even with sshpass,
the error message from ssh is <br>
printed to standard error. In such a case ssh&rsquo;s return
code is reported back. This is typically an unimaginative
(and non-informative) &quot;255&quot; for all error
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Run rsync over SSH using password authentication, passing
the password on the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsync --rsh=&rsquo;sshpass -p
12345 ssh -l test&rsquo; host.example.com:path .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do the same from a bourne
shell script in a marginally less exposed way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSHPASS=12345 rsync
--rsh=&rsquo;sshpass -e ssh -l test&rsquo;
host.example.com:path .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Sshpass is in its infancy at the moment. As such, bugs are
highly possible. In particular, if the password is read from
stdin (no password option at all), it is possible that <br>
some of the input aimed to be passed to ssh will be read by
sshpass and lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sshpass utilizes the pty(7)
interface to control the TTY for ssh. This interface, at
least on Linux, has a misfeature where if no slave file
descriptors are open, the master pty <br>
returns EIO. This is the normal behavior, except a slave pty
may be born at any point by a program opening /dev/tty. This
makes it impossible to reliably wait for events without <br>
consuming 100% of the CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Over the various versions
different approaches were attempted at solving this problem.
Any given version of sshpass is released with the belief
that it is working, but experi&acirc; <br>
ence has shown that these things do, occasionally, break.
This happened with OpenSSH version 5.6. As of this writing,
it is believed that sshpass is, again, working properly.</p>
