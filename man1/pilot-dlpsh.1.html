<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pilot-dlpsh - An interactive Desktop Link Protocol (DLP)
Shell for your Palm device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECTION <br>
pilot-link: Tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pilot-dlpsh [-p|--port &lt;port&gt;] [-c|--command STRING]
[-i|--interactive] [--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pilot-dlpsh options <br>
-c, <br>
--command STRING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute cmd and exit
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter interactive mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conduit Options <br>
-p, <br>
--port &lt; <br>
port&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use device file &lt;port&gt; to
communicate with the Palm handheld. If this is not
specified, pilot-dlpsh will look for the $PILOTPORT
environment variable. If the port is missing and <br>
$PILOTPORT is not set, pilot-dlpsh will print the usage
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display the copyright
information, version number, license details and build
details and exit without connecting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pilot-dlpsh allows the user to connect to a Palm handheld
and execute arbitrary DLP commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pilot-dlpsh can query many
different types of information from your Palm device, such
as username, memory capacity, set the time, as well as other
useful functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once connected, the user may
execute most of the built-in DLP commands. (See BUILT-IN
COMMANDS below for more detail on currently supported
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connection to the Pilot is
kept alive by sending a PadTickle packet to the Pilot after
a small period of non-activity. (7 seconds by default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILT-IN COMMANDS <br>
There are many options available while connected to your
Palm handheld via pilot-dlpsh, including the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user, u</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the currently set User
information, including Username, UserID, PCid, and ViewerID.
You may also set these values from this command as well. To
set these values, simply <br>
pass the value to the option, such as &rsquo;user John Q.
Public&rsquo; for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used with -l and -r to provide
long and RAM and ROM file lists, similar to (but slightly
different from) the Unix &rsquo;ls&rsquo; command. This does
not yet allow you to narrow your listing <br>
to a certain range of files. It will simply list them
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">df</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display how much RAM and ROM is
free on your device, again similar to the Unix
&rsquo;df&rsquo; command. This does not accept arguments at
this time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntp, time, dtp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the time on the Palm from
the currently-set desktop time. This does not work on OS
version 3.3, due to a bug in PalmOS at that time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm, del</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove a file and delete it
entirely from the Palm device. This is an irrevokable
process, and you cannot &quot;undelete&quot; a file, once it
has been deleted with this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit, q, exit, bye</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit the DLP Protocol Shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Passing commandline options to pilot-dlpsh will allow you to
interact with it in unattended mode, for example:
&rsquo;pilot-dlpsh -p usb: -c user&rsquo; will connect and
display the user <br>
information, just as if you had connected interactively and
typed &rsquo;user&rsquo; at the DLP shell prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The program will connect to your Palm handheld and give the
user an interactive prompt (a &quot;shell&quot;) for
executing commands across the DLP HotSync protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
We have an online bug tracker. Using this is the only way to
ensure that your bugs are recorded and that we can track
them until they are resolved or closed. Reporting bugs via
<br>
email, while easy, is not very useful in terms of
accountability. Please point your browser to
http://bugs.pilot-link.org: http://bugs.pilot-link.org and
report your bugs and <br>
issues there.</p>
