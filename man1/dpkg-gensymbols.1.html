<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-gensymbols - generate symbols files (shared library
dependency information)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpkg-gensymbols [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dpkg-gensymbols scans a temporary build tree (debian/tmp by
default) looking for libraries and generates a symbols file
describing them. This file, if non-empty, is then <br>
installed in the DEBIAN subdirectory of the build tree so
that it ends up included in the control information of the
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating those files, it
uses as input some symbols files provided by the maintainer.
It looks for the following files (and uses the first that is
found):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
debian/package.symbols.arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
debian/symbols.arch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
debian/package.symbols</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
debian/symbols</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main interest of those files
is to provide the minimal version associated to each symbol
provided by the libraries. Usually it corresponds to the
first version of that pack&acirc; <br>
age that provided the symbol, but it can be manually
incremented by the maintainer if the ABI of the symbol is
extended without breaking backwards compatibility.
It&rsquo;s the respon&acirc; <br>
sibility of the maintainer to keep those files up-to-date
and accurate, but dpkg-gensymbols helps with that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the generated symbols files
differ from the maintainer supplied one, dpkg-gensymbols
will print a diff between the two versions. Furthermore if
the difference is too sig&acirc; <br>
nificant, it will even fail (you can customize how much
difference you can tolerate, see the -c option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAINTAINING SYMBOLS FILES <br>
The symbols files are really useful only if they reflect the
evolution of the package through several releases. Thus the
maintainer has to update them every time that a new
sym&acirc; <br>
bol is added so that its associated minimal version matches
reality. The diffs contained in the build logs can be used
as a starting point, but the maintainer, additionally, has
<br>
to make sure that the behaviour of those symbols has not
changed in a way that would make anything using those
symbols and linking against the new version, stop working
with the <br>
old version. In most cases, the diff applies directly to the
debian/package.symbols file. That said, further tweaks are
usually needed: it&rsquo;s recommended for example to drop
the <br>
Debian revision from the minimal version so that backports
with a lower version number but the same upstream version
still satisfy the generated dependencies. If the Debian <br>
revision can&rsquo;t be dropped because the symbol really
got added by the Debian specific change, then one should
suffix the version with &acirc;~&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before applying any patch to the
symbols file, the maintainer should double-check that
it&rsquo;s sane. Public symbols are not supposed to
disappear, so the patch should ideally only <br>
add new lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can put comments
in symbols files: any line with &acirc;#&acirc; as the first
character is a comment except if it starts with
&acirc;#include&acirc; (see section Using includes). Lines
<br>
starting with &acirc;#MISSING:&acirc; are special comments
documenting symbols that have disappeared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget to check if old
symbol versions need to be increased. There is no way
dpkg-gensymbols can warn about this. Blindly applying the
diff or assuming there is nothing <br>
to change if there is no diff, without checking for such
changes, can lead to packages with loose dependencies that
claim they can work with older packages they cannot work
with. <br>
This will introduce hard to find bugs with (partial)
upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using #PACKAGE# substitution
<br>
In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between
architectures. To avoid hardcoding the name of the package
in the symbols file, you can use the marker #PACKAGE#. It
<br>
will be replaced by the real package name during
installation of the symbols files. Contrary to the #MINVER#
marker, #PACKAGE# will never appear in a symbols file inside
a binary <br>
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using symbol tags <br>
Symbol tagging is useful for marking symbols that are
special in some way. Any symbol can have an arbitrary number
of tags associated with it. While all tags are parsed and
<br>
stored, only some of them are understood by dpkg-gensymbols
and trigger special handling of the symbols. See subsection
Standard symbol tags for reference of these tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tag specification comes right
before the symbol name (no whitespace is allowed in
between). It always starts with an opening bracket (, ends
with a closing bracket ) and must <br>
contain at least one tag. Multiple tags are separated by the
| character. Each tag can optionally have a value which is
separated form the tag name by the = character. Tag names
<br>
and values can be arbitrary strings except they cannot
contain any of the special ) | = characters. Symbol names
following a tag specification can optionally be quoted with
<br>
either &rsquo; or &quot; characters to allow whitespaces in
them. However, if there are no tags specified for the
symbol, quotes are treated as part of the symbol name which
continues up <br>
until the first space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(tag1=i am marked|tag name with
space)&quot;tagged quoted symbol&quot;@Base 1.0 <br>
(optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1 <br>
untagged_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first symbol in the example
is named tagged quoted symbol and has two tags: tag1 with
value i am marked and tag name with space that has no value.
The second symbol named <br>
tagged_unquoted_symbol is only tagged with the tag named
optional. The last symbol is an example of the normal
untagged symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since symbol tags are an
extension of the deb-symbols(5) format, they can only be
part of the symbols files used in source packages (those
files should then be seen as templates <br>
used to build the symbols files that are embedded in binary
packages). When dpkg-gensymbols is called without the -t
option, it will output symbols files compatible to the <br>
deb-symbols(5) format: it fully processes symbols according
to the requirements of their standard tags and strips all
tags from the output. On the contrary, in template mode (-t)
<br>
all symbols and their tags (both standard and unknown ones)
are kept in the output and are written in their original
form as they were loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard symbol tags <br>
optional <br>
A symbol marked as optional can disappear from the library
at any time and that will never cause dpkg-gensymbols to
fail. However, disappeared optional symbols will con&acirc;
<br>
tinuously appear as MISSING in the diff in each new package
revision. This behaviour serves as a reminder for the
maintainer that such a symbol needs to be removed from <br>
the symbol file or readded to the library. When the optional
symbol, which was previously declared as MISSING, suddenly
reappears in the next revision, it will be upgraded <br>
back to the &acirc;existing&acirc; status with its minimum
version unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tag is useful for symbols
which are private where their disappearance do not cause ABI
breakage. For example, most of C++ template instantiations
fall into this cate&acirc; <br>
gory. Like any other tag, this one may also have an
arbitrary value: it could be used to indicate why the symbol
is considered optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch=architecture-list <br>
arch-bits=architecture-bits <br>
arch-endian=architecture-endianness <br>
These tags allow one to restrict the set of architectures
where the symbol is supposed to exist. The arch-bits and
arch-endian tags are supported since dpkg 1.18.0. When <br>
the symbols list is updated with the symbols discovered in
the library, all arch-specific symbols which do not concern
the current host architecture are treated as if they <br>
did not exist. If an arch-specific symbol matching the
current host architecture does not exist in the library,
normal procedures for missing symbols apply and it may <br>
cause dpkg-gensymbols to fail. On the other hand, if the
arch-specific symbol is found when it was not supposed to
exist (because the current host architecture is not <br>
listed in the tag or does not match the endianness and
bits), it is made arch neutral (i.e. the arch, arch-bits and
arch-endian tags are dropped and the symbol will appear <br>
in the diff due to this change), but it is not considered as
new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When operating in the default
non-template mode, among arch-specific symbols only those
that match the current host architecture are written to the
symbols file. On the <br>
contrary, all arch-specific symbols (including those from
foreign arches) are always written to the symbol file when
operating in template mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of architecture-list
is the same as the one used in the Build-Depends field of
debian/control (except the enclosing square brackets []).
For example, the first <br>
symbol from the list below will be considered only on alpha,
any-amd64 and ia64 architectures, the second only on linux
architectures, while the third one anywhere except <br>
on armel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(arch=alpha any-amd64
ia64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=linux-any)linux_specific_symbol@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=!armel)symbol_armel_does_not_have@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The architecture-bits is either
32 or 64.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(arch-bits=32)32bit_specific_symbol@Base
1.0 <br>
(arch-bits=64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The architecture-endianness is
either little or big.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(arch-endian=little)little_endian_specific_symbol@Base
1.0 <br>
(arch-endian=big)big_endian_specific_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple restrictions can be
chained.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(arch-bits=32|arch-endian=little)32bit_le_symbol@Base
1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore-blacklist <br>
dpkg-gensymbols has an internal blacklist of symbols that
should not appear in symbols files as they are usually only
side-effects of implementation details of the <br>
toolchain. If for some reason, you really want one of those
symbols to be included in the symbols file, you should tag
the symbol with ignore-blacklist. It can be neces&acirc;
<br>
sary for some low level toolchain libraries like libgcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c++ Denotes c++ symbol pattern.
See Using symbol patterns subsection below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symver Denotes symver (symbol
version) symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns
subsection below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regex Denotes regex symbol
pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using symbol patterns <br>
Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover
multiple real symbols from the library. dpkg-gensymbols will
attempt to match each pattern against each real symbol <br>
that does not have a specific symbol counterpart defined in
the symbol file. Whenever the first matching pattern is
found, all its tags and properties will be used as a basis
<br>
specification of the symbol. If none of the patterns
matches, the symbol will be considered as new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A pattern is considered lost if
it does not match any symbol in the library. By default this
will trigger a dpkg-gensymbols failure under -c1 or higher
level. However, if the <br>
failure is undesired, the pattern may be marked with the
optional tag. Then if the pattern does not match anything,
it will only appear in the diff as MISSING. Moreover, like
any <br>
symbol, the pattern may be limited to the specific
architectures with the arch tag. Please refer to Standard
symbol tags subsection above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patterns are an extension of the
deb-symbols(5) format hence they are only valid in symbol
file templates. Pattern specification syntax is not any
different from the one of a <br>
specific symbol. However, symbol name part of the
specification serves as an expression to be matched against
name@version of the real symbol. In order to distinguish
among dif&acirc; <br>
ferent pattern types, a pattern will typically be tagged
with a special tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the moment, dpkg-gensymbols
supports three basic pattern types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c++ <br>
This pattern is denoted by the c++ tag. It matches only C++
symbols by their demangled symbol name (as emitted by
c++filt(1) utility). This pattern is very handy for matching
<br>
symbols which mangled names might vary across different
architectures while their demangled names remain the same.
One group of such symbols is non-virtual thunks which have
<br>
architecture specific offsets embedded in their mangled
names. A common instance of this case is a virtual
destructor which under diamond inheritance needs a
non-virtual thunk <br>
symbol. For example, even if _ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on
32bit architectures will probably be
_ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 64bit ones, it can be
matched with a single <br>
c++ pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
<br>
[...] <br>
(c++)&quot;non-virtual thunk to
NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base&quot; 1.0 <br>
[...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The demangled name above can be
obtained by executing the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ echo
&rsquo;_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base&rsquo; | c++filt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that while mangled
name is unique in the library by definition, this is not
necessarily true for demangled names. A couple of distinct
real symbols may have the <br>
same demangled name. For example, that&rsquo;s the case with
non-virtual thunk symbols in complex inheritance
configurations or with most constructors and destructors
(since g++ <br>
typically generates two real symbols for them). However, as
these collisions happen on the ABI level, they should not
degrade quality of the symbol file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">symver <br>
This pattern is denoted by the symver tag. Well maintained
libraries have versioned symbols where each version
corresponds to the upstream version where the symbol got
added. <br>
If that&rsquo;s the case, you can use a symver pattern to
match any symbol associated to the specific version. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libc.so.6 libc6 #MINVER# <br>
(symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0 <br>
[...] <br>
(symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7 <br>
access@GLIBC_2.0 2.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All symbols associated with
versions GLIBC_2.0 and GLIBC_2.7 will lead to minimal
version of 2.0 and 2.7 respectively with the exception of
the symbol access@GLIBC_2.0. The <br>
latter will lead to a minimal dependency on libc6 version
2.2 despite being in the scope of the
&quot;(symver)GLIBC_2.0&quot; pattern because specific
symbols take precedence over pat&acirc; <br>
terns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that while old style
wildcard patterns (denoted by &quot;*@version&quot; in the
symbol name field) are still supported, they have been
deprecated by new style syntax <br>
&quot;(symver|optional)version&quot;. For example,
&quot;*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; should be written as
&quot;(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; if the same
behaviour is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regex <br>
Regular expression patterns are denoted by the regex tag.
They match by the perl regular expression specified in the
symbol name field. A regular expression is matched as it
<br>
is, therefore do not forget to start it with the ^ character
or it may match any part of the real symbol name@version
string. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
<br>
(regex)&quot;^mystack_.*@Base$&quot; 1.0 <br>
(regex|optional)&quot;private&quot; 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbols like
&quot;mystack_new@Base&quot;, &quot;mystack_push@Base&quot;,
&quot;mystack_pop@Base&quot; etc. will be matched by the
first pattern while e.g. &quot;ng_mystack_new@Base&quot;
won&rsquo;t. The second pattern <br>
will match all symbols having the string &quot;private&quot;
in their names and matches will inherit optional tag from
the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic patterns listed above can
be combined where it makes sense. In that case, they are
processed in the order in which the tags are specified. For
example, both</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(c++|regex)&quot;^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethodt@Base&quot;
1.0 <br>
(regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethodEi@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will match symbols
&quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base&quot; and
&quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod2Ei@Base&quot;. When
matching the first pattern, the raw symbol is first
deman&acirc; <br>
gled as C++ symbol, then the demangled name is matched
against the regular expression. On the other hand, when
matching the second pattern, regular expression is matched
against <br>
the raw symbol name, then the symbol is tested if it is C++
one by attempting to demangle it. A failure of any basic
pattern will result in the failure of the whole pattern.
<br>
Therefore, for example,
&quot;__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethodEi@Base&quot; will
not match either of the patterns because it is not a valid
C++ symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, all patterns are
divided into two groups: aliases (basic c++ and symver) and
generic patterns (regex, all combinations of multiple basic
patterns). Matching of basic <br>
alias-based patterns is fast (O(1)) while generic patterns
are O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for each symbol.
Therefore, it is recommended not to overuse generic
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiple patterns match the
same real symbol, aliases (first c++, then symver) are
preferred over generic patterns. Generic patterns are
matched in the order they are found <br>
in the symbol file template until the first success. Please
note, however, that manual reordering of template file
entries is not recommended because dpkg-gensymbols generates
<br>
diffs based on the alphanumerical order of their names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using includes <br>
When the set of exported symbols differ between
architectures, it may become inefficient to use a single
symbol file. In those cases, an include directive may prove
to be useful <br>
in a couple of ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can
factorize the common part in some external file and include
that file in your package.symbols.arch file by using an
include directive like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;packages.symbols.common&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The include
directive may also be tagged like any symbol:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(tag|...|tagN)#include
&quot;file-to-include&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a result, all symbols
included from file-to-include will be considered to be
tagged with tag ... tagN by default. You can use this
feature to create a common package.sym&acirc; <br>
bols file which includes architecture specific symbol
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common_symbol1@Base 1.0 <br>
(arch=amd64 ia64 alpha)#include
&quot;package.symbols.64bit&quot; <br>
(arch=!amd64 !ia64 !alpha)#include
&quot;package.symbols.32bit&quot; <br>
common_symbol2@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The symbols files are read line
by line, and include directives are processed as soon as
they are encountered. This means that the content of the
included file can override any <br>
content that appeared before the include directive and that
any content after the directive can override anything
contained in the included file. Any symbol (or even another
<br>
#include directive) in the included file can specify
additional tags or override values of the inherited tags in
its tag specification. However, there is no way for the
symbol to <br>
remove any of the inherited tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An included file can repeat the
header line containing the SONAME of the library. In that
case, it overrides any header line previously read. However,
in general it&rsquo;s best to <br>
avoid duplicating header lines. One way to do it is the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;libsomething1.symbols.common&quot; <br>
arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Good library management <br>
A well-maintained library has the following features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; its API is
stable (public symbols are never dropped, only new public
symbols are added) and changes in incompatible ways only
when the SONAME changes;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ideally, it uses
symbol versioning to achieve ABI stability despite internal
changes and API extension;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; it doesn&rsquo;t
export private symbols (such symbols can be tagged optional
as workaround).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While maintaining the symbols
file, it&rsquo;s easy to notice appearance and disappearance
of symbols. But it&rsquo;s more difficult to catch
incompatible API and ABI change. Thus the main&acirc; <br>
tainer should read thoroughly the upstream changelog looking
for cases where the rules of good library management have
been broken. If potential problems are discovered, the <br>
upstream author should be notified as an upstream fix is
always better than a Debian specific work-around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Ppackage-build-dir <br>
Scan package-build-dir instead of debian/tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppackage <br>
Define the package name. Required if more than one binary
package is listed in debian/control (or if there&rsquo;s no
debian/control file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vversion <br>
Define the package version. Defaults to the version
extracted from debian/changelog. Required if called outside
of a source package tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-elibrary-file <br>
Only analyze libraries explicitly listed instead of finding
all public libraries. You can use shell patterns used for
pathname expansions (see the File::Glob(3perl) manual <br>
page for details) in library-file to match multiple
libraries with a single argument (otherwise you need
multiple -e).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ifilename <br>
Use filename as reference file to generate the symbols file
that is integrated in the package itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O[filename] <br>
Print the generated symbols file to standard output or to
filename if specified, rather than to
debian/tmp/DEBIAN/symbols (or
package-build-dir/DEBIAN/symbols if -P was <br>
used). If filename is pre-existing, its contents are used as
basis for the generated symbols file. You can use this
feature to update a symbols file so that it matches a <br>
newer upstream version of your library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Write the symbol file in
template mode rather than the format compatible with
deb-symbols(5). The main difference is that in the template
mode symbol names and tags are <br>
written in their original form contrary to the
post-processed symbol names with tags stripped in the
compatibility mode. Moreover, some symbols might be omitted
when <br>
writing a standard deb-symbols(5) file (according to the tag
processing rules) while all symbols are always written to
the symbol file template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[0-4] <br>
Define the checks to do when comparing the generated symbols
file with the template file used as starting point. By
default the level is 1. Increasing levels do more <br>
checks and include all checks of lower levels. Level 0 never
fails. Level 1 fails if some symbols have disappeared. Level
2 fails if some new symbols have been introduced. <br>
Level 3 fails if some libraries have disappeared. Level 4
fails if some libraries have been introduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This value can be overridden by
the environment variable DPKG_GENSYMBOLS_CHECK_LEVEL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Keep quiet and never generate
a diff between generated symbols file and the template file
used as starting point or show any warnings about new/lost
libraries or new/lost <br>
symbols. This option only disables informational output but
not the checks themselves (see -c option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aarch Assume arch as host
architecture when processing symbol files. Use this option
to generate a symbol file or diff for any architecture
provided its binaries are already <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enable debug mode. Numerous
messages are displayed to explain what dpkg-gensymbols
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Enable verbose mode. The
generated symbols file contains deprecated symbols as
comments. Furthermore in template mode, pattern symbols are
followed by comments listing <br>
real symbols that have matched the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show the usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version and exit.</p>
