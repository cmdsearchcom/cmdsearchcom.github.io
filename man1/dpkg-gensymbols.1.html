dpkg-gensymbols - generate symbols files (shared library dependency information)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> [<i>option</i>...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> scans a temporary build tree (debian/tmp by default)
  looking for libraries and generates a <i>symbols</i> file describing them.
  This file, if non-empty, is then installed in the DEBIAN subdirectory of the
  build tree so that it ends up included in the control information of the
  package.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When generating those files, it uses as input some symbols files provided by the
  maintainer. It looks for the following files (and uses the first that is
  found):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">debian/<i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">debian/symbols.<i>arch</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">debian/<i>package</i>.symbols</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">debian/symbols</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main interest of those files is to provide the minimal version associated to
  each symbol provided by the libraries. Usually it corresponds to the first
  version of that package that provided the symbol, but it can be manually
  incremented by the maintainer if the ABI of the symbol is extended without
  breaking backwards compatibility. It's the responsibility of the maintainer to
  keep those files up-to-date and accurate, but <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> helps
  with that.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the generated symbols files differ from the maintainer supplied one,
  <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> will print a diff between the two versions. Furthermore
  if the difference is too significant, it will even fail (you can customize how
  much difference you can tolerate, see the <b>-c</b> option).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MAINTAINING_SYMBOLS_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#MAINTAINING_SYMBOLS_FILES">MAINTAINING
  SYMBOLS FILES</a></h1>
The symbols files are really useful only if they reflect the evolution of the
  package through several releases. Thus the maintainer has to update them every
  time that a new symbol is added so that its associated minimal version matches
  reality. The diffs contained in the build logs can be used as a starting
  point, but the maintainer, additionally, has to make sure that the behaviour
  of those symbols has not changed in a way that would make anything using those
  symbols and linking against the new version, stop working with the old
  version. In most cases, the diff applies directly to the debian/
  <i>package</i>.symbols file. That said, further tweaks are usually needed:
  it's recommended for example to drop the Debian revision from the minimal
  version so that backports with a lower version number but the same upstream
  version still satisfy the generated dependencies. If the Debian revision can't
  be dropped because the symbol really got added by the Debian specific change,
  then one should suffix the version with &#x2018; <b>~</b>&#x2019;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before applying any patch to the symbols file, the maintainer should
  double-check that it's sane. Public symbols are not supposed to disappear, so
  the patch should ideally only add new lines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that you can put comments in symbols files: any line with &#x2018;#&#x2019;
  as the first character is a comment except if it starts with
  &#x2018;#include&#x2019; (see section <b>Using includes</b>). Lines starting
  with &#x2018;#MISSING:&#x2019; are special comments documenting symbols that
  have disappeared.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not forget to check if old symbol versions need to be increased. There is no
  way <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> can warn about this. Blindly applying the diff or
  assuming there is nothing to change if there is no diff, without checking for
  such changes, can lead to packages with loose dependencies that claim they can
  work with older packages they cannot work with. This will introduce hard to
  find bugs with (partial) upgrades.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_#PACKAGE#_substitution"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_#PACKAGE#_substitution">Using
  #PACKAGE# substitution</a></h2>
In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between architectures. To
  avoid hardcoding the name of the package in the symbols file, you can use the
  marker <i>#PACKAGE#</i>. It will be replaced by the real package name during
  installation of the symbols files. Contrary to the <i>#MINVER#</i> marker,
  <i>#PACKAGE#</i> will never appear in a symbols file inside a binary package.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_symbol_tags"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_symbol_tags">Using
  symbol tags</a></h2>
Symbol tagging is useful for marking symbols that are special in some way. Any
  symbol can have an arbitrary number of tags associated with it. While all tags
  are parsed and stored, only some of them are understood by
  <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> and trigger special handling of the symbols. See
  subsection <b>Standard symbol tags</b> for reference of these tags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Tag specification comes right before the symbol name (no whitespace is allowed
  in between). It always starts with an opening bracket <b>(</b>, ends with a
  closing bracket <b>)</b> and must contain at least one tag. Multiple tags are
  separated by the <b>|</b> character. Each tag can optionally have a value
  which is separated form the tag name by the <b>=</b> character. Tag names and
  values can be arbitrary strings except they cannot contain any of the special
  <b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>=</b> characters. Symbol names following a tag
  specification can optionally be quoted with either <b>'</b> or <b>&quot;</b>
  characters to allow whitespaces in them. However, if there are no tags
  specified for the symbol, quotes are treated as part of the symbol name which
  continues up until the first space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 (tag1=i am marked|tag name with space)&quot;tagged quoted symbol&quot;@Base 1.0
<br/>
 (optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1
<br/>
 untagged_symbol@Base 1.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first symbol in the example is named <i>tagged quoted symbol</i> and has two
  tags: <i>tag1</i> with value <i>i am marked</i> and <i>tag name with space</i>
  that has no value. The second symbol named <i>tagged_unquoted_symbol</i> is
  only tagged with the tag named <i>optional</i>. The last symbol is an example
  of the normal untagged symbol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since symbol tags are an extension of the <b>deb-symbols</b>(5) format, they can
  only be part of the symbols files used in source packages (those files should
  then be seen as templates used to build the symbols files that are embedded in
  binary packages). When <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> is called without the <b>-t</b>
  option, it will output symbols files compatible to the <b>deb-symbols</b>(5)
  format: it fully processes symbols according to the requirements of their
  standard tags and strips all tags from the output. On the contrary, in
  template mode ( <b>-t</b>) all symbols and their tags (both standard and
  unknown ones) are kept in the output and are written in their original form as
  they were loaded.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Standard_symbol_tags"><a class="selflink" href="#Standard_symbol_tags">Standard
  symbol tags</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>optional</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A symbol marked as optional can disappear from the library
      at any time and that will never cause <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> to fail.
      However, disappeared optional symbols will continuously appear as MISSING
      in the diff in each new package revision. This behaviour serves as a
      reminder for the maintainer that such a symbol needs to be removed from
      the symbol file or readded to the library. When the optional symbol, which
      was previously declared as MISSING, suddenly reappears in the next
      revision, it will be upgraded back to the &#x201C;existing&#x201D; status
      with its minimum version unchanged.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This tag is useful for symbols which are private where their disappearance
      do not cause ABI breakage. For example, most of C++ template
      instantiations fall into this category. Like any other tag, this one may
      also have an arbitrary value: it could be used to indicate why the symbol
      is considered optional.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>arch=<i>architecture-list</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>arch-bits=<i>architecture-bits</i></b>
      <b>arch-endian=<i>architecture-endianness</i></b> These tags allow one to
      restrict the set of architectures where the symbol is supposed to exist.
      The <b>arch-bits</b> and <b>arch-endian</b> tags are supported since dpkg
      1.18.0. When the symbols list is updated with the symbols discovered in
      the library, all arch-specific symbols which do not concern the current
      host architecture are treated as if they did not exist. If an
      arch-specific symbol matching the current host architecture does not exist
      in the library, normal procedures for missing symbols apply and it may
      cause <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> to fail. On the other hand, if the
      arch-specific symbol is found when it was not supposed to exist (because
      the current host architecture is not listed in the tag or does not match
      the endianness and bits), it is made arch neutral (i.e. the arch,
      arch-bits and arch-endian tags are dropped and the symbol will appear in
      the diff due to this change), but it is not considered as new.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When operating in the default non-template mode, among arch-specific symbols
      only those that match the current host architecture are written to the
      symbols file. On the contrary, all arch-specific symbols (including those
      from foreign arches) are always written to the symbol file when operating
      in template mode.

    The format of <i>architecture-list</i> is the same as the one used in the

      will be considered only on alpha, any-amd64 and ia64 architectures, the

  symbol patterns</a></h2>
Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover multiple real
  symbols from the library. <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> will attempt to match each
  pattern against each real symbol that does <i>not</i> have a specific symbol
  counterpart defined in the symbol file. Whenever the first matching pattern is
  found, all its tags and properties will be used as a basis specification of
  the symbol. If none of the patterns matches, the symbol will be considered as
  new.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A pattern is considered lost if it does not match any symbol in the library. By
  default this will trigger a <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> failure under <b>-c1</b> or
  higher level. However, if the failure is undesired, the pattern may be marked
  with the <i>optional</i> tag. Then if the pattern does not match anything, it
  will only appear in the diff as MISSING. Moreover, like any symbol, the
  pattern may be limited to the specific architectures with the <i>arch</i> tag.
  Please refer to <b>Standard symbol tags</b> subsection above for more
  information.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Patterns are an extension of the <b>deb-symbols</b>(5) format hence they are
  only valid in symbol file templates. Pattern specification syntax is not any
  different from the one of a specific symbol. However, symbol name part of the
  specification serves as an expression to be matched against
  <i>name@version</i> of the real symbol. In order to distinguish among
  different pattern types, a pattern will typically be tagged with a special
  tag.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
At the moment, <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> supports three basic pattern types:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>c++</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This pattern is denoted by the <i>c++</i> tag. It matches
      only C++ symbols by their demangled symbol name (as emitted by
      <b>c++filt</b>(1) utility). This pattern is very handy for matching
      symbols which mangled names might vary across different architectures
      while their demangled names remain the same. One group of such symbols is
      <i>non-virtual thunks</i> which have architecture specific offsets
      embedded in their mangled names. A common instance of this case is a
      virtual destructor which under diamond inheritance needs a non-virtual
      thunk symbol. For example, even if _ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 32bit
      architectures will probably be _ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 64bit
      ones, it can be matched with a single <i>c++</i> pattern:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
<br/>
 [...]
<br/>
 (c++)&quot;non-virtual thunk to NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base&quot; 1.0
<br/>
 [...]
<div class="Pp"></div>
The demangled name above can be obtained by executing the following command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 $ echo '_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base' | c++filt
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that while mangled name is unique in the library by definition, this
  is not necessarily true for demangled names. A couple of distinct real symbols
  may have the same demangled name. For example, that's the case with
  non-virtual thunk symbols in complex inheritance configurations or with most
  constructors and destructors (since g++ typically generates two real symbols
  for them). However, as these collisions happen on the ABI level, they should
  not degrade quality of the symbol file.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>symver</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This pattern is denoted by the <i>symver</i> tag. Well
      maintained libraries have versioned symbols where each version corresponds
      to the upstream version where the symbol got added. If that's the case,
      you can use a <i>symver</i> pattern to match any symbol associated to the
      specific version. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
libc.so.6 libc6 #MINVER#
<br/>
 (symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0
<br/>
 [...]
<br/>
 (symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7
<br/>
 access@GLIBC_2.0 2.2
<div class="Pp"></div>
All symbols associated with versions GLIBC_2.0 and GLIBC_2.7 will lead to
  minimal version of 2.0 and 2.7 respectively with the exception of the symbol
  access@GLIBC_2.0. The latter will lead to a minimal dependency on libc6
  version 2.2 despite being in the scope of the &quot;(symver)GLIBC_2.0&quot;
  pattern because specific symbols take precedence over patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that while old style wildcard patterns (denoted by
  &quot;*@version&quot; in the symbol name field) are still supported, they have
  been deprecated by new style syntax &quot;(symver|optional)version&quot;. For
  example, &quot;*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; should be written as
  &quot;(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0&quot; if the same behaviour is
  needed.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>regex</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Regular expression patterns are denoted by the <i>regex</i>
      tag. They match by the perl regular expression specified in the symbol
      name field. A regular expression is matched as it is, therefore do not
      forget to start it with the <i>^</i> character or it may match any part of
      the real symbol <i>name@version</i> string. For example:</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
<br/>
 (regex)&quot;^mystack_.*@Base$&quot; 1.0
<br/>
 (regex|optional)&quot;private&quot; 1.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
Symbols like &quot;mystack_new@Base&quot;, &quot;mystack_push@Base&quot;,
  &quot;mystack_pop@Base&quot; etc. will be matched by the first pattern while
  e.g. &quot;ng_mystack_new@Base&quot; won't. The second pattern will match all
  symbols having the string &quot;private&quot; in their names and matches will
  inherit <i>optional</i> tag from the pattern.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Basic patterns listed above can be combined where it makes sense. In that case,
  they are processed in the order in which the tags are specified. For example,
  both
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 (c++|regex)&quot;^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethod\d\(int\)@Base&quot; 1.0
<br/>
 (regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base 1.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
will match symbols &quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base&quot; and
  &quot;_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod2Ei@Base&quot;. When matching the
  first pattern, the raw symbol is first demangled as C++ symbol, then the
  demangled name is matched against the regular expression. On the other hand,
  when matching the second pattern, regular expression is matched against the
  raw symbol name, then the symbol is tested if it is C++ one by attempting to
  demangle it. A failure of any basic pattern will result in the failure of the
  whole pattern. Therefore, for example,
  &quot;__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base&quot; will not match either
  of the patterns because it is not a valid C++ symbol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, all patterns are divided into two groups: aliases (basic <i>c++</i>
  and <i>symver</i>) and generic patterns (<i>regex</i>, all combinations of
  multiple basic patterns). Matching of basic alias-based patterns is fast
  (O(1)) while generic patterns are O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for each
  symbol. Therefore, it is recommended not to overuse generic patterns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When multiple patterns match the same real symbol, aliases (first <i>c++</i>,
  then <i>symver</i>) are preferred over generic patterns. Generic patterns are
  matched in the order they are found in the symbol file template until the
  first success. Please note, however, that manual reordering of template file
  entries is not recommended because <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> generates diffs
  based on the alphanumerical order of their names.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_includes"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_includes">Using
  includes</a></h2>
When the set of exported symbols differ between architectures, it may become
  inefficient to use a single symbol file. In those cases, an include directive
  may prove to be useful in a couple of ways:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can factorize the common part in some external file and
      include that file in your <i>package</i>.symbols.<i>arch</i> file by using
      an include directive like this:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    #include &quot; <i>packages</i>.symbols.common&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The include directive may also be tagged like any symbol:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (tag|...|tagN)#include &quot;file-to-include&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    As a result, all symbols included from <i>file-to-include</i> will be
      considered to be tagged with <i>tag</i> ... <i>tagN</i> by default. You
      can use this feature to create a common <i>package</i>.symbols file which
      includes architecture specific symbol files:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     common_symbol1@Base 1.0
    <br/>
     (arch=amd64 ia64 alpha)#include &quot;package.symbols.64bit&quot;
    <br/>
     (arch=!amd64 !ia64 !alpha)#include &quot;package.symbols.32bit&quot;
    <br/>
     common_symbol2@Base 1.0</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The symbols files are read line by line, and include directives are processed as
  soon as they are encountered. This means that the content of the included file
  can override any content that appeared before the include directive and that
  any content after the directive can override anything contained in the
  included file. Any symbol (or even another #include directive) in the included
  file can specify additional tags or override values of the inherited tags in
  its tag specification. However, there is no way for the symbol to remove any
  of the inherited tags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An included file can repeat the header line containing the SONAME of the
  library. In that case, it overrides any header line previously read. However,
  in general it's best to avoid duplicating header lines. One way to do it is
  the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
#include &quot;libsomething1.symbols.common&quot;
<br/>
 arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0

A well-maintained library has the following features:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">its API is stable (public symbols are never dropped, only

While maintaining the symbols file, it's easy to notice appearance and
  disappearance of symbols. But it's more difficult to catch incompatible API
  and ABI change. Thus the maintainer should read thoroughly the upstream
  changelog looking for cases where the rules of good library management have
  been broken. If potential problems are discovered, the upstream author should
  be notified as an upstream fix is always better than a Debian specific
  work-around.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-P</b><i>package-build-dir</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Scan <i>package-build-dir</i> instead of debian/tmp.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b><i>package</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define the package name. Required if more than one binary
      package is listed in debian/control (or if there's no debian/control
      file).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b><i>version</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define the package version. Defaults to the version
      extracted from debian/changelog. Required if called outside of a source
      package tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e</b><i>library-file</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Only analyze libraries explicitly listed instead of finding
      all public libraries. You can use shell patterns used for pathname
      expansions (see the <b>File::Glob</b>(3perl) manual page for details) in
      <i>library-file</i> to match multiple libraries with a single argument
      (otherwise you need multiple <b>-e</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I</b><i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use <i>filename</i> as reference file to generate the
      symbols file that is integrated in the package itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-O</b>[<i>filename</i>]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print the generated symbols file to standard output or to
      <i>filename</i> if specified, rather than to
      <b>debian/tmp/DEBIAN/symbols</b> (or
      <i>package-build-dir</i><b>/DEBIAN/symbols</b> if <b>-P</b> was used). If
      <i>filename</i> is pre-existing, its contents are used as basis for the
      generated symbols file. You can use this feature to update a symbols file
      so that it matches a newer upstream version of your library.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Write the symbol file in template mode rather than the
      format compatible with <b>deb-symbols</b>(5). The main difference is that
      in the template mode symbol names and tags are written in their original
      form contrary to the post-processed symbol names with tags stripped in the
      compatibility mode. Moreover, some symbols might be omitted when writing a
      standard <b>deb-symbols</b>(5) file (according to the tag processing
      rules) while all symbols are always written to the symbol file
    template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b><i>[0-4]</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Define the checks to do when comparing the generated
      symbols file with the template file used as starting point. By default the
      level is 1. Increasing levels do more checks and include all checks of
      lower levels. Level 0 never fails. Level 1 fails if some symbols have
      disappeared. Level 2 fails if some new symbols have been introduced. Level
      3 fails if some libraries have disappeared. Level 4 fails if some
      libraries have been introduced.

  <dd class="It-tag">Keep quiet and never generate a diff between generated
      symbols file and the template file used as starting point or show any
      warnings about new/lost libraries or new/lost symbols. This option only
      disables informational output but not the checks themselves (see <b>-c</b>
      option).</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b><i>arch</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Assume <i>arch</i> as host architecture when processing
      symbol files. Use this option to generate a symbol file or diff for any
      architecture provided its binaries are already available.</dd>

      symbols are followed by comments listing real symbols that have matched
      the pattern.</dd>
