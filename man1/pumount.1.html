<p>pumount(1) General Commands Manual pumount(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pumount - umount arbitrary hotpluggable devices as normal
user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pumount [ options ] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pumount is a wrapper around the standard umount program
which permits normal users to umount removable devices
without a matching /etc/fstab entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pumount also supports encrypted
devices which use dm-crypt and have LUKS metadata. If a
LUKS-capable cryptsetup is installed, pumount will umount
the mapped device instead and <br>
call cryptsetup to close the decrypted device
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pumount expects the device as
its only argument. This will umount device from a directory
below /media if policy is met (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that, as with
pmount, you can use labels and uuids as described in fstab
(5) for devices present in /etc/fstab. In this case, the
device name need to match exactly <br>
the corresponding entry in /etc/fstab, including the LABEL=
or UUID= part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l, --lazy <br>
Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem
hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem
as soon as it is not busy anymore. (Requires kernel <br>
2.4.11 or later.) IMPORTANT NOTES This option should not be
used unless you really know what you are doing, as chances
are high that it will result in data loss on the <br>
removable drive. Please run pumount manually and wait until
it finishes. In addition, pumount will not luksClose a
device which was unmounted lazily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--luks-force <br>
Normally, pumount will not luksClose (see cryptsetup(1)) a
device pmount did not open. However, you can bypass this
restriction with this flag. You probably will need it <br>
if you did mess around with the /var/lock/pmount_luks
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Enable verbose debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the current version number and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLICY <br>
The umount will succeed if all of the following conditions
are met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is a
block device in /dev/ (it does not need to exist if -l is
supplied)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is not in
/etc/fstab (if it is, pmount executes umount device as the
calling user to handle this transparently)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; device is
mounted according to /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts with the
calling user&rsquo;s uid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mount point is
in /media</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PUMOUNT AND MISSING DEVICES <br>
pumount now supports unmounting devices that have gone
missing for some reason, such as a brutal removal of the
device, or a kernel/hardware problem. Just specify the mount
point <br>
as argument for pumount.</p>
