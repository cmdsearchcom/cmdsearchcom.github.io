<p>NSUPDATE(1) BIND9 NSUPDATE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nsupdate - Dynamic DNS update utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nsupdate [-d] [-D] [[-g] | [-o] | [-l] | [-y
[hmac:]keyname:secret] | [-k keyfile]] [-t timeout] [-u
udptimeout] [-r udpretries] [-R randomdev] [-v]
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nsupdate is used to submit Dynamic DNS Update requests as
defined in RFC 2136 to a name server. This allows resource
records to be added or removed from a zone without manually
<br>
editing the zone file. A single update request can contain
requests to add or remove more than one resource record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zones that are under dynamic
control via nsupdate or a DHCP server should not be edited
by hand. Manual edits could conflict with dynamic updates
and cause data to be lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resource records that are
dynamically added or removed with nsupdate have to be in the
same zone. Requests are sent to the zone&rsquo;s master
server. This is identified by the <br>
MNAME field of the zone&rsquo;s SOA record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option makes nsupdate
operate in debug mode. This provides tracing information
about the update requests that are made and the replies
received from the name server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D option makes nsupdate
report additional debugging information to -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L option with an integer
argument of zero or higher sets the logging debug level. If
zero, logging is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transaction signatures can be
used to authenticate the Dynamic DNS updates. These use the
TSIG resource record type described in RFC 2845 or the
SIG(0) record described in RFC <br>
2535 and RFC 2931 or GSS-TSIG as described in RFC 3645. TSIG
relies on a shared secret that should only be known to
nsupdate and the name server. Currently, the only supported
<br>
encryption algorithm for TSIG is HMAC-MD5, which is defined
in RFC 2104. Once other algorithms are defined for TSIG,
applications will need to ensure they select the appropriate
<br>
algorithm as well as the key when authenticating each other.
For instance, suitable key and server statements would be
added to /etc/named.conf so that the name server can <br>
associate the appropriate secret key and algorithm with the
IP address of the client application that will be using TSIG
authentication. SIG(0) uses public key cryptography. To <br>
use a SIG(0) key, the public key must be stored in a KEY
record in a zone served by the name server. nsupdate does
not read /etc/named.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GSS-TSIG uses Kerberos
credentials. Standard GSS-TSIG mode is switched on with the
-g flag. A non-standards-compliant variant of GSS-TSIG used
by Windows 2000 can be switched on <br>
with the -o flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nsupdate uses the -y or -k
option to provide the shared secret needed to generate a
TSIG record for authenticating Dynamic DNS update requests,
default type HMAC-MD5. These <br>
options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -y option is used, a
signature is generated from [hmac:]keyname:secret. keyname
is the name of the key, and secret is the base64 encoded
shared secret. Use of the -y <br>
option is discouraged because the shared secret is supplied
as a command line argument in clear text. This may be
visible in the output from ps(1) or in a history file
maintained <br>
by the user&rsquo;s shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -k option, nsupdate
reads the shared secret from the file keyfile. Keyfiles may
be in two formats: a single file containing a
named.conf-format key statement, which may <br>
be generated automatically by ddns-confgen, or a pair of
files whose names are of the format
K{name}.+157.+{random}.key and
K{name}.+157.+{random}.private, which can be generated <br>
by dnssec-keygen. The -k may also be used to specify a
SIG(0) key used to authenticate Dynamic DNS update requests.
In this case, the key specified is not an HMAC-MD5 key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nsupdate can be run in a
local-host only mode using the -l flag. This sets the server
address to localhost (disabling the server so that the
server address cannot be overridden). <br>
Connections to the local server will use a TSIG key found in
/var/run/named/session.key, which is automatically generated
by named if any local master zone has set update-policy <br>
to local. The location of this key file can be overridden
with the -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, nsupdate uses UDP to
send update requests to the name server unless they are too
large to fit in a UDP request in which case TCP will be
used. The -v option makes <br>
nsupdate use a TCP connection. This may be preferable when a
batch of update requests is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p sets the default port
number to use for connections to a name server. The default
is 53.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option sets the maximum
time an update request can take before it is aborted. The
default is 300 seconds. Zero can be used to disable the
timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -u option sets the UDP retry
interval. The default is 3 seconds. If zero, the interval
will be computed from the timeout interval and number of UDP
retries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option sets the number of
UDP retries. The default is 3. If zero, only one update
request will be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -R randomdev option
specifies a source of randomness. If the operating system
does not provide a /dev/random or equivalent device, the
default source of randomness is <br>
keyboard input. randomdev specifies the name of a character
device or file containing random data to be used instead of
the default. The special value keyboard indicates that <br>
keyboard input should be used. This option may be specified
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FORMAT <br>
nsupdate reads input from filename or standard input. Each
command is supplied on exactly one line of input. Some
commands are for administrative purposes. The others are
either <br>
update instructions or prerequisite checks on the contents
of the zone. These checks set conditions that some name or
set of resource records (RRset) either exists or is absent
<br>
from the zone. These conditions must be met if the entire
update request is to succeed. Updates will be rejected if
the tests for the prerequisite conditions fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every update request consists of
zero or more prerequisites and zero or more updates. This
allows a suitably authenticated update request to proceed if
some specified resource <br>
records are present or missing from the zone. A blank input
line (or the send command) causes the accumulated commands
to be sent as one Dynamic DNS update request to the name
<br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command formats and their
meaning are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server {servername} [port] <br>
Sends all dynamic update requests to the name server
servername. When no server statement is provided, nsupdate
will send updates to the master server of the correct zone.
<br>
The MNAME field of that zone&rsquo;s SOA record will
identify the master server for that zone. port is the port
number on servername where the dynamic update requests get
sent. If <br>
no port number is specified, the default DNS port number of
53 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local {address} [port] <br>
Sends all dynamic update requests using the local address.
When no local statement is provided, nsupdate will send
updates using an address and port chosen by the system. <br>
port can additionally be used to make requests come from a
specific port. If no port number is specified, the system
will assign one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zone {zonename} <br>
Specifies that all updates are to be made to the zone
zonename. If no zone statement is provided, nsupdate will
attempt determine the correct zone to update based on the
rest <br>
of the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class {classname} <br>
Specify the default class. If no class is specified, the
default class is IN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttl {seconds} <br>
Specify the default time to live for records to be added.
The value none will clear the default ttl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key {name} {secret} <br>
Specifies that all updates are to be TSIG-signed using the
keyname keysecret pair. The key command overrides any key
specified on the command line via -y or -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gsstsig <br>
Use GSS-TSIG to sign the updated. This is equivalent to
specifying -g on the commandline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oldgsstsig <br>
Use the Windows 2000 version of GSS-TSIG to sign the
updated. This is equivalent to specifying -o on the
commandline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">realm {[realm_name]} <br>
When using GSS-TSIG use realm_name rather than leaving the
realm detection up to GSSAPI. If no realm is specified the
saved realm is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[prereq] nxdomain {domain-name}
<br>
Requires that no resource record of any type exists with
name domain-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[prereq] yxdomain {domain-name}
<br>
Requires that domain-name exists (has as at least one
resource record, of any type).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[prereq] nxrrset {domain-name}
[class] {type} <br>
Requires that no resource record exists of the specified
type, class and domain-name. If class is omitted, IN
(internet) is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[prereq] yxrrset {domain-name}
[class] {type} <br>
This requires that a resource record of the specified type,
class and domain-name must exist. If class is omitted, IN
(internet) is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[prereq] yxrrset {domain-name}
[class] {type} {data...} <br>
The data from each set of prerequisites of this form sharing
a common type, class, and domain-name are combined to form a
set of RRs. This set of RRs must exactly match the <br>
set of RRs existing in the zone at the given type, class,
and domain-name. The data are written in the standard text
representation of the resource record&rsquo;s RDATA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[update] del[ete] {domain-name}
[ttl] [class] [type [data...]] <br>
Deletes any resource records named domain-name. If type and
data is provided, only matching resource records will be
removed. The internet class is assumed if class is not <br>
supplied. The ttl is ignored, and is only allowed for
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[update] add {domain-name} {ttl}
[class] {type} {data...} <br>
Adds a new resource record with the specified ttl, class and
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show <br>
Displays the current message, containing all of the
prerequisites and updates specified since the last send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send <br>
Sends the current message. This is equivalent to entering a
blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">answer <br>
Displays the answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug <br>
Turn on debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines beginning with a semicolon
are comments and are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The examples below show how nsupdate could be used to insert
and delete resource records from the example.com zone.
Notice that the input in each example contains a trailing
<br>
blank line so that a group of commands are sent as one
dynamic update request to the master name server for
example.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># nsupdate <br>
&gt; update delete oldhost.example.com A <br>
&gt; update add newhost.example.com 86400 A 172.16.1.1 <br>
&gt; send</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any A records for
oldhost.example.com are deleted. And an A record for
newhost.example.com with IP address 172.16.1.1 is added. The
newly-added record has a 1 day TTL (86400 <br>
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># nsupdate <br>
&gt; prereq nxdomain nickname.example.com <br>
&gt; update add nickname.example.com 86400 CNAME
somehost.example.com <br>
&gt; send</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prerequisite condition gets
the name server to check that there are no resource records
of any type for nickname.example.com. If there are, the
update request fails. If this <br>
name does not exist, a CNAME for it is added. This ensures
that when the CNAME is added, it cannot conflict with the
long-standing rule in RFC 1034 that a name must not exist as
<br>
any other record type if it exists as a CNAME. (The rule has
been updated for DNSSEC in RFC 2535 to allow CNAMEs to have
RRSIG, DNSKEY and NSEC records.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The TSIG key is redundantly stored in two separate files.
This is a consequence of nsupdate using the DST library for
its cryptographic operations, and may change in future <br>
releases.</p>
