<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccbuild - Strict C++ developer&rsquo;s build utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccbuild [options] [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ccbuild is a build utility that will read C++ source. It
collects all source surrounding your local includes and
links these to your main program. Global include statements
<br>
(#include ) are used to make sure the compiler gets
the&lsquo; right arguments. The link between com&acirc;
piler arguments and these global includes is made using
configuration files. <br>
These files contain lines with a global header file name and
the extra arguments the compiler needs to find and use this
file. The file name and arguments are separated by tab <br>
character(s) or a space. ccbuild reads these configuration
files in order. Only the first men&acirc; tion of a global
header file in these files is used. Usually only
./ccResolu&acirc; <br>
tions is used, but there are more possibilities. See the
sec&acirc; tion FILES for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild will follow any local
include (#include &quot;something.hh&quot;) to try to find
more source code to compile. To keep ccbuild from following
up on an include statement, separate <br>
the #-sign and the include statement by a single space
(&quot;# include&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
build [filename.cc] <br>
Build everything or the given source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lib [filename.cc] <br>
Collect all objects into an archive. If a version is given,
using --pversion, then a shared library is also build with
symbolic links. This currently forces the -fPIC <br>
argument addition. The name of your library is given the
name of the current directory or it&rsquo;s parent when the
current directory is called src.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: create an empty .cc
file which simply includes all the local libraries, run
ccbuild --pversion 0.0.1 lib that&acirc; file.cc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean [filename.cc] <br>
Clean everything or the given source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distclean <br>
Recursively remove all &quot;o&quot; directories after
removing all .md5 and .o files therein. And removes all .gch
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deps [filename.cc] <br>
List all files this source depends on. It lists three lines
separated by empty lines. The first contains the local
dependencies, the second the ignored headers (for the <br>
file) and the last contains all global includes needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dot [filename.cc] <br>
Generate dot graph files for sources on the stdout. If no
source file name is given, then for all binary targets in
the local directory a .dot file will be created. If <br>
the --verbose flag is used the dot graph will also contain
all object file names and their dependencies and lists of
ignored headers. Objects will be coloured light grey, <br>
binary targets light blue, ignored headers by a red
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makefile [filename.cc] <br>
Generate a Makefile on stdout. If no file name is given, an
all rule will be generated. Otherwise only the rules for the
given file are generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aap [filename.cc] <br>
Generate an A-A-P file on stdout. If the file name is not
given, an &quot;all&quot; rule will be added and all local
binary tar&acirc; gets will be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [filename.cc] <br>
Display source status and file name on the stdout. Status
and source path are separated with a tab character. Status
is either &quot;old&quot; or &quot;ok&quot;. When the
--verbose flag is <br>
used, another tab separated column will be inserted
containing a two letter file type ccbuild identifies it as.
This file type is &quot;bt&quot;, &quot;ot&quot;,
&quot;ih&quot; or &quot;hh&quot; for binary tar&acirc; <br>
get, object target, internal header and header
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icmake [filename.cc] <br>
icmake slave mode. This will output the used directories
with one directory per line. If a CLASSES file already
exists, it will only output the class directories not <br>
mentioned in the CLASSES file. If --verbose is given, all
classes will be listed. The output will not contain
directories with only header files. Updating the CLASSES
<br>
is typically done by run&acirc; ning: ccbuild icmake
&gt;&gt; CLASSES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resolve [filename.cc] <br>
Print all unresolved globals onto the stdout followed by a
tab character. These can be appended to the ccResolutions
file using: ccbuild resolve &gt;&gt; ccResolutions .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">md5 [filename.cc] <br>
MD5 sum all sources needed to compile all binary targets, or
the given source on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options are used to change the behaviour of the commands.
Some options are useless for some commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f --force-update <br>
Update everything by labelling everything as old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Get a list of options and commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnutouch <br>
Touch files part of the GNU software standard. They will be
touched in ../ except when there is a directory called src
in the current directory, then the current direc&acirc; <br>
tory will be used. This will touch AUTHORS, NEWS, README,
INSTALL, COPYING, TODO and ChangeLog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s --no-act <br>
Simulate, don&rsquo;t really execute any writing
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compiler cmd <br>
Set the compiler command. The default is
&quot;g++&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a --args argument <br>
Set these default compiler arguments, removing the standard
default arguments (&quot;-Wall -g&quot;). Multiple uses of
this option are concate&acirc; nated with spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C path <br>
Change directory before anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --precompile-ih <br>
Pre-compile only internal headers. This requires g++ version
3.4 up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--precompile-all <br>
Pre-compile both internal headers and normal headers. This
requires g++ version 3.4 up. When you use internal headers,
this will only slow you down. However, when you <br>
don&rsquo;t use internal headers, this pre-compilation is
all you&rsquo;ve got.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--brute <br>
Continue on compiler errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--md5 Use MD5 hashes to check
for file changes. The hashes are store in
&quot;o/filename.md5&quot; for every file. These sums are
only stored after a clean exit from ccbuild (last line <br>
showing &quot;[WR] MD5 data&quot;) or a successful
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I path <br>
Add this path to the local include search path of ccbuild
and the compiler (which will receive the same argument).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recursive-include path <br>
This is just like -I, but for the given path and every
non-empty directory with a name other then &quot;o&quot;.
Make sure you do not come to depend on this behaviour, that
would <br>
be bad practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l --highlight <br>
Highlight the output of the compiler using a red terminal
colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xof --exec-on-fail command
<br>
Execute this command when the command (pre)compilation
returns any&acirc; thing but 0. The first argument given to
the command will be rela&acirc; tive path to the file the
command <br>
was executed on (which is either a C++ source or header). If
you don&rsquo;t want to use the file name, you can append an
echo command like &quot;sleep 2; echo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xop --exec-on-pass cmd <br>
This is the same as --exec-on-fail, except it only works
when the command returns 0. The first argument given to the
command will be the relative path to the file the <br>
command was executed on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clearpc <br>
Clear the screen just before executing the command (clear
per com&acirc; mand).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append cmd <br>
Append this to every command. This can be used to redirect
output or set up pipes for compiler output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loop Loop the system with one
second intervals. This only works for the build command at
the moment. All sources who are touched will be reloaded. If
a file is removed, the <br>
whole source tree is reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodefargs <br>
Do not read the first line of ./ccResolutions for extra
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nodefres <br>
Do not load any ccResolutions files outside of
./ccResolutions. This can be used to create a monolithic
ccResolutions file or dis&acirc; cover your project&rsquo;s
dependencies with <br>
the resolve command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--addres filename <br>
Load the given resolution file before any other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pversion version <br>
Set the program version you are working on to version. This
is cur&acirc; rently only used for the library command. When
defined, the library command can make a shared object <br>
(.so) and symbolic links by using the version number. It
should not contain any file system special characters like
slashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ar Archive the objects before
linking. This should reduce the binary size because it
leaves out unused objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Show commands and produce more output for dot and check
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V --version <br>
Output version number on stdout and copyright/license on
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xml Output in XML where
supported. Currently this is only the check command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nowarn <br>
Leave out most warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--batch <br>
Compile a batch of files with one g++ call before any other
compi&acirc; lation. This effectively disables any
multi-threading, but may speed things up for larger
collections <br>
of small files. This process involves creating a temporary
directory in /tmp/ccbuild_batch.XXXX. The exact behaviour of
this option may change in the future based on <br>
performance results and user experience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j number_threads <br>
Set the maximum number of threads used during build. Only
available when OpenMP is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOLUTION CONFIGURATION <br>
The ccResolutions file links global headers to compiler
arguments. Every line should be either empty, start with a
comment character &quot;#&quot; or contain a con&acirc;
figuration line. A <br>
configuration line contains the name of the global header,
followed by one or more tab characters and then the
additional argu&acirc; ments needed when a source depends on
this global <br>
header. The arguments are POSIX shell expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first line of the
ccResolutions file starts with &quot;#&amp;&quot;, the rest
of this line is shell expanded and used and appended to the
argument list of ccbuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Examples of program use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild resolve &gt;&gt;
ccResolutions <br>
Add any of the unknown global headers to the ccResolutions
file. You can also use --nowarn to keep ccbuild quiet, but
you will have to think twice if you get compilation <br>
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild --brute <br>
Get back to development after a distclean. This will update
as much objects as will compile. Which will allow you to
focus on the errors in the next ccbuild call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild -p --compiler
&rsquo;g++-3.4&rsquo; --args -Wall --args &rsquo;-Wextra
-ansi&rsquo; <br>
Precompile internal headers using g++-3.4 and highlight all
com&acirc; piler output (-l). Also give all compiler
commands the parameters &quot;-Wall -Wextra -ansi&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild -f --args -O3 <br>
Recompiling your project for benchmarking tests. Forces the
update of all code (-f) and sets the compiler argument to
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild --verbose dot; dotty
*.dot : Graph the dependencies for all programs with
colours. Then view these using dotty. This can help you to
discover irregular depen&acirc; dencies <br>
and what test programs use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild --xof
&rsquo;gedit&rsquo; <br>
Try to compile the program and open the first file that does
not compile correctly. Open all error producing sources in
gedit. Very useful for when you change the inter&acirc; <br>
face of a class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild --compiler distcc -j 20
<br>
Use 20 distcc compilers to compile the project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Configuration files used by ccbuild</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">./ccResolutions[.USERNAME,.HOSTNAME,.KERNEL_NAME,.MACHINE,]
<br>
Local configuration which is project specific. It will load
the first existing file of: ./ccResolutions.USERNAME, <br>
./ccResolu&acirc; tions.HOSTNAME,
./ccResolutions.KERNEL_NAME, ./ccResolu&acirc;
tions.MACHINE, ./ccResolutions. Hostname, kernel name and
machine can be found with uname -nsm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ccbuild/ccResolutions <br>
Global configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ccbuild/ccResolutions.d <br>
The resolution configuration directory. All files in this
directory are considered configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Do not place any file into o directories, these will be
removed when using the distclean command. Also don&rsquo;t
use files with the same basename, but different C++
extensions, this <br>
will give problems with the objects created (for example
&quot;add.cc&quot; and &quot;add.cpp&quot; in the same
directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there is no way to
allow one object file to effect the command-line parameters
of another. This means that if all objects need a flag, you
must use the --args argument <br>
and cannot use a global header resolution line. Exam&acirc;
ples of these flags that need to be defined everywhere are
-pthreads, -mthreads and -threads. Please read the g++
manual <br>
for more information on usage of flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccbuild seems to be incompatible
with flex 2.5.4. That version of flex places an int main
function in the resulting scanner and there doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be a way to stop it from <br>
mentioning it. The result is that ccbuild will think that
the generated scanner is a test program for your class and
won&rsquo;t link it into the main program. A solution is to
move <br>
to a newer version of flex or find a way to remove the int
main function from the resulting scanner file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Report any issue with ccbuild at:
https://github.com/bneijt/ccbuild</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
ccbuild will not follow or act on any include statements
with a single space between the #-sign and the include. So
all include statements starting with &quot;# include&quot;
will be <br>
ignored, all other combinations will be acted on. This is a
feature, not a bug. In verbose mode (--verbose) these are
mentioned as warnings.</p>
