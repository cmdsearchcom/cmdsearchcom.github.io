<p>ETERM(1) X Tools ETERM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Eterm - the Enlightened terminal emulator for the X Window
System</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Eterm [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Eterm &acirc; version 0.9.6 &acirc; is a color vt102
terminal emulator intended as an xterm(1) replacement. It is
designed with a Freedom of Choice philosophy, leaving as
much power, flexi&acirc; <br>
bility, and freedom as possible in the hands of the user. It
is designed to look good and work well, but takes a
feature-rich approach rather than one of minimalism. Eterm
uses <br>
Imlib for advanced graphic abilities. See below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The Eterm options are listed below. In keeping with the
freedom-of-choice philosophy, options may be eliminated or
default values chosen at compile-time, so options and
defaults <br>
listed may not accurately reflect the version installed on
your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options that do not take a
parameter (besides -h and --help) are boolean. If you use
the POSIX (short) option, you are forcing the parameter to
&quot;true&quot;. If you use the long <br>
option, you can use any of the accepted boolean values,
which are &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;1&quot;,
and &quot;true&quot; to turn the option on, or
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, or
&quot;false&quot; to turn the option off. The <br>
same is true for boolean values in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t theme, --theme theme <br>
Load specified theme. Consult the FAQ for more details on
what constitutes an Eterm theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X conffile, --config-file
conffile <br>
Use an alternative user config file name. Otherwise Eterm
uses the default, which is user.cfg. The theme config file
is always theme.cfg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d displayname, --display
displayname <br>
Attempt to open a window on the named X display displayname.
In the absence of this option, the display specified by the
DISPLAY environment variable is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug level <br>
Show debugging output. level is an integer between 0 and 5
which determines how verbose the debugging output is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--install <br>
Tells Eterm to install its own colormap rather than using
the default one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print out a message describing available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print Eterm version and compile-time configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --reverse-video <br>
Reverse video, swaps the foreground and background
colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b color, --background-color
color <br>
Set color as the background color. NOTE: this will actually
be the foreground color if reverse video is also
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f color, --foreground-color
color <br>
Set color as the foreground (text) color. NOTE: this will
actually be the background color if reverse video is also
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color0 color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color15 color <br>
Use color as color X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colorBD color <br>
Use color as the bold color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colorUL color <br>
Use color as the underline color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pointer-color color <br>
Use color as the pointer color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c color, --cursor-color color
<br>
Use color as the cursor color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cursor-text-color color <br>
Use color as the cursor text color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g geom, --geometry geom <br>
Window geometry as Width x Height+X coord+Y coord, i.e
100x200+0+100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i,--iconic <br>
Start in iconified state (only if the window manager
supports iconification).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name, --name name <br>
Sets name of current instance to name. This will affect the
icon title and the window title string unless they are
otherwise explicitly set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T title, --title title <br>
Sets window&rsquo;s title text to title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--icon-name text <br>
Sets the icon title text to text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B type, --scrollbar-type type
<br>
Specifies the type scrollbar style should be used. type can
be any of motif, xterm, or next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrollbar-width width <br>
Set the width of the scrollbar, in pixels, to width. Eterm
does not impose any restrictions on this value, but it
should be reasonable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D desktop, --desktop desktop
<br>
Starts the Eterm on the specified desktop. desktop should be
an integer between 0 and your highest-numbered desktop.
NOTE: You must have a GNOME-compliant window manager <br>
for this feature to work. Please see
http://www.gnome.org/devel/gnomewm/ for more information on
the _WIN_WORKSPACE property and how to support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-space num <br>
Size of the extra gap, in pixels, to provide between lines
in the terminal window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bold-font font <br>
Sets the bold text font to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F font, --font font <br>
Sets the normal text font to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-font-index num <br>
Specifies the index of the default (normal) text font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--font1 font</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--font4 font <br>
Sets the font at the specified index (1-4) to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proportional <br>
Specifies that the font in use is proportional and requests
standard deviation-based character cell spacing. Terminals
must use fixed-width character cells to maintain <br>
proper columnal alignment, even when proportionally-spaced
fonts are in use. Some proportionally-spaced fonts vary
greatly between the minimum and maximum character <br>
widths. This option chooses a character cell size which is
up to two standard deviations above the average character
width but will not exceed the maximum width of the <br>
largest glyph. Note that characters larger than the chosen
cell width will overwrite (or be overwritten by) other
characters and may tend to leave pixel droppings. This <br>
behavior is an expected side-effect of an imperfect
scenario. If you object to this behavior, do not use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--font-fx effects <br>
Specifies the effects to apply to the terminal window font.
The value of effects is a single string containing a series
of corner/color pairs. These pairs define toward <br>
which corner a drop shadow of each character should be made,
and what color that shadow will be. The corner is specified
first using the following keywords: top_left or <br>
tl, top_right or tr, bottom_left or bl, and bottom_right or
br. Each corner specifier is then followed by a color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also several shortcuts
for doing common effects. You can get a single-color outline
by using the keyword outline followed by a color. A
single-color drop <br>
shadow is also available using the keyword shadow followed
by an optional corner specifier (bottom_right being the
default) and a color. For a 3-D embossed look, use <br>
emboss dark_color light_color. The opposite effect, a
carved-out look, can be obtained with carved dark_color
light_color. (Of course, with those last two, the 3-D look
<br>
will only work if you choose the light and dark colors
wisely.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, for no font effects at
all, simply specify the keyword none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is
bottom_right black which yields a black drop shadow, greatly
improving the visibility of lightly-colored fonts on top of
light spots in a background <br>
image. Note that font effects are not active in solid color
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P pic, --background-pixmap pic
<br>
Use pic as the background image. pic can be in any format
that Imlib understands. Currently this means just about
anything, including JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, PPM, etc. The <br>
image is tiled by default. To specify alternate geometry,
follow the filename with an @ sign and the geometry string.
Image geometry is specified as @wxh+x+y:ops where w <br>
and h are the horizontal/vertical scaling percentages, x and
y are the horizontal/vertical alignment percentages, and ops
is a colon-delimited list of operations: tiled <br>
(to tile the image), propscaled (for proportional scaling).
Note that these operations can be combined for various
effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I pic, --icon pic <br>
Sets the icon pixmap file to pic. Works similarly to the -P
option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--up-arrow-pixmap pic <br>
As above, except the scrollbar&rsquo;s up-arrow is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--down-arrow-pixmap pic <br>
As above, except the scrollbar&rsquo;s down-arrow is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trough-pixmap pic <br>
As above, except the scrollbar&rsquo;s background (trough)
is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anchor-pixmap pic <br>
As above, except the scrollbar&rsquo;s anchor image is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--menu-pixmap pic <br>
As above, except the menu background image is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --trans <br>
This gives a pseudo-transparent Eterm. The image is taken
directly from the root window, so any requests for changing
the pixmap are ignored. If you do not use Enlight&acirc;
<br>
enment (http://www.enlightenment.org/) as your window
manager (or another compliant window manager...I have been
told that WindowMaker works also), you will need to use <br>
the Esetroot program (found in the utils/ directory) to set
your root background image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --itrans <br>
Activate the immotile transparency optimization for
transparent Eterm windows. Note that this does NOT activate
transparency; you must still include the -O or --trans <br>
option. This option should be used on transparent windows
which are shaded or tinted and which do not move around on
the desktop much. See the Mon Mar 6 21:11:13 PST <br>
2000 ChangeLog entry for a more detailed explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--viewport-mode <br>
This activates a special Eterm mode which is hard to
describe in words. Basically, imagine the effect you get
with pseudo-transparency, where the desktop background moves
<br>
through the Eterm window as you move the window, so that it
always aligns with the desktop image. Now, imagine the same
effect, but the image used isn&rsquo;t the desktop image
<br>
but any pixmap you choose. The image is scaled or tiled up
to the size of the desktop, and dragging the Eterm around
the screen reveals different portions of the image as <br>
you move, much like a small viewport window in a ship or
submarine does. The effect is especially keen if you open
several Eterms in this mode with the same image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shade percentage <br>
Shade the background image/transparency by a specified
percentage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tint mask</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tint color <br>
Tints the background pixmap (either an image file or the
transparent portion can be shaded). The mask is an integer,
usually specified in hexadecimal in the form <br>
0xRRGGBB, where RR, GG, and BB are hexadecimal numbers
between 00 and ff (0 and 255 decimal) which represent the
brightness of the image&rsquo;s red, green, and blue values,
<br>
respectively. A value of 00 will mask that color out
entirely, while a value of ff will not change that color at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also specify an X color
such as grey75 or MidnightBlue or #babb7f instead of a
mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cmod brightness [ contrast [
gamma ] ] <br>
Specifies a color modifier to apply to the image overall.
Each of the three values is a number greater than or equal
to 0. The numbers can be specified as decimal, octal <br>
(if preceded by &quot;0&quot;), or hexadecimal (if preceded
by &quot;0x&quot;). A value of 256 (0x100) represents 100%,
or &quot;leave that value unchanged.&quot; 0 represents 0%,
512 (0x200) is <br>
200%, etc. However, be aware that overflow can occur with
excessively high values. Only the brightness value is
required for this option. Keep in mind, though, that you
<br>
must specify brightness with contrast, and both of these
with gamma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cmod-red brightness [ contrast
[ gamma ] ] <br>
Same as above, except that the modifier applies to the red
values of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cmod-green brightness [
contrast [ gamma ] ] <br>
Same as above, except that the modifier applies to the green
values of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cmod-blue brightness [
contrast [ gamma ] ] <br>
Same as above, except that the modifier applies to the blue
values of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p newpath, --path newpath <br>
Sets the pic search path. When the --background-pixmap or
other pixmap options are used, this path will be used to
find the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache size <br>
Specify the size in bytes for the Imlib2 cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N list, --anim list <br>
Specifies an animation list to be use in cycling the
background pixmap. The list consists of two or more words.
The first word defines the delay, in seconds, between <br>
updates of the background. This should be set to a
reasonable value to insure that Eterm doesn&rsquo;t spend
all its time rendering backgrounds. All remaining words
specify <br>
background images and have the same syntax as the -P option
above, including the optional geometry string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M font, --mfont font <br>
Sets the normal multibyte text font to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mfont1 font</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mfont4 font <br>
Sets multibyte font X to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mencoding encoding <br>
Sets multichar encoding mode (eucj or sjis or euckr)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input-method method <br>
Sets XIM input method</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preedit-type type <br>
Sets XIM preedit type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --login-shell <br>
Makes the new shell a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --scrollbar <br>
Enables the scrollbar. (Default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --utmp-logging <br>
Tries to enable proper utmp logging. For this to work, Eterm
probably needs to run setuid or setgid, usually setuid
root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --visual-bell <br>
Enables the &quot;visual bell&quot;. Means the window will
flash or blink rather than beep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --home-on-output <br>
Jump to bottom on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--home-on-input <br>
Jump to bottom on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --no-input <br>
Keeps Eterm from accepting keyboard input, and keeps the
window manager from focusing it. Useful for log tailers and
such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrollbar-right <br>
Display scrollbar on the right hand side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrollbar-floating <br>
Display the scrollbar without a trough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrollbar-popup <br>
Display the scrollbar only when the Eterm window is
focused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --borderless <br>
This option forces Eterm to have no borders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --sticky <br>
Start Eterm as a sticky window (shows on all desktops)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --map-alert <br>
Un-iconify on beep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8, --meta8 <br>
Causes the Meta key to set the 8th bit in the char.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--double-buffer <br>
Rather than drawing text directly onto the window, this
option causes Eterm to allocate an additional pixmap the
size of the terminal window into which the background <br>
*and* the text are rendered. This pixmap is then set as the
window background. Double-buffering uses additional memory
in the X server, but it allows Eterm to ignore <br>
expose events so redraws are faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cursor <br>
Disables the text cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pause <br>
After the child process terminates, Eterm will wait for a
keypress before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xterm-select <br>
Duplicate&rsquo;s xterm&rsquo;s treatment of cutchars. The
only real difference is what happens when you double click
on a single cutchar between two words. If this option is on,
<br>
only that single character gets selected. If it is off, that
character is selected along with the two words. The latter
behavior is useful for double-clicking on the <br>
space between someone&rsquo;s first and last names, or the @
sign in an e-mail address, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--select-line <br>
If activated, this option causes a triple click to select
the entire line from beginning to end. If off, a
triple-click selects just from the current word to the end
of <br>
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--select-trailing-spaces <br>
Determines whether or not trailing spaces in a selection are
maintained (on) or discarded (off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--report-as-keysyms <br>
Reports certain keystrokes as keysyms and modifiers rather
than escape sequences. NOTE: This option is intended for use
only with programs that support this special Eterm <br>
mode. Do not enable it unless you are executing a program
which uses this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buttonbar <br>
Toggle the display of all buttonbars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resize-gravity <br>
If true, Eterm will automatically detect the nearest corner,
and font-change resizes will cause the Eterm window to
gravitate toward that corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overstrike-bold <br>
If true (default), Eterm will simulate a bold font by
printing each character twice, offsetting the second pass by
one pixel. This makes the characters seem thicker
with&acirc; <br>
out the need for a special font. You may wish to disable
this if you use a specific color for bold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bold-brightens-foreground <br>
If true (default), Eterm will use the &quot;bold&quot; ANSI
color attribute to brighten the foreground color by using
the high-intensity colors (8 through 15) rather than the
low- <br>
intensity colors (0 through 7). Note that having a specific
color selected for bold will override this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--blink-brightens-background
<br>
If true (default), Eterm will use the &quot;blink&quot; ANSI
color attribute to brighten the background color by using
the high-intensity colors (8 through 15) rather than the
low- <br>
intensity colors (0 through 7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colors-suppress-bold <br>
If true (default), any colored text (that is, any text not
rendered using the default foreground color) will not be
given any other special treatment for bolding (e.g., <br>
bold font or bold overstrike).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--big-font-key keysym <br>
Specify a keysym to increase the font size. Default is Shift
and the + key on the keypad. Ctrl-&gt; or Meta-&gt; may also
work (if you #define one of the hotkeys in src/fea&acirc;
<br>
ture.h).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--small-font-key keysym <br>
Specify a keysym to decrease the font size. Default is Shift
and the - key on the keypad. Ctrl-&lt; or Meta-&lt; may also
work (if you #define one of the hotkeys in src/fea&acirc;
<br>
ture.h).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--meta-mod num <br>
Specify which X modifier (1-5) to treat as the Meta key. See
xmodmap(1) and the output of xmodmap -pm for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alt-mod num <br>
Same as --meta-mod, but for the Alt key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numlock-mod num <br>
Same as --meta-mod, but for the NumLock key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--greek-keyboard mode <br>
Use Greek keyboard mapping (iso or ibm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--app-keypad <br>
Start Eterm in application keypad mode (as opposed to normal
keypad mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--app-cursor <br>
Start Eterm in application cursor key mode (as opposed to
normal cursor key mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L num, --save-lines num <br>
Set the number of lines in the scrollback buffer to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a size, --min-anchor-size size
<br>
Specifies the minimum size, in pixels high, of the scrollbar
anchor. NOTE: This causes abnormal scrolling behavior when
combined with large scrollback buffers!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w width, --border-width width
<br>
Set the window&rsquo;s border width to width. The border
this controls is the gap between the edge of the X window
and the edge of the terminal window; this has nothing to do
<br>
with the window border&rsquo;s your window manager
supplies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-pipe pipe <br>
The pipe for the PrintScreen function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cut-chars separators <br>
The separators for double-click selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--finished-title title <br>
Specifies the string Eterm should add to its title bar if
--pause is specified and the child process completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--finished-text text <br>
Same as above, but displays text in the terminal window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--term-name TERM <br>
Use TERM for the value $TERM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pipe-name pipe <br>
Specifies a named pipe from which to display output. This is
useful for systems where syslog output goes to a named pipe,
like /dev/xconsole on Debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a line, --attribute line <br>
This option is used to pass config file attributes on the
command line. line should be a single string, so you will
almost certainly have to quote it. The first word of <br>
line must be the context (see config file section below)
which should parse the rest of the line. So, for example,
you could specify the foreground color like so: -a <br>
&rsquo;color foreground blue&rsquo;. Or you could add a
binding: -a &rsquo;actions bind anymod button1 to script
exit&rsquo;. Note that this option may only be used with
config file attributes <br>
that are not context-sensitive; i.e., menus and imageclasses
cannot be specified using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --console <br>
Grab console messages. Depending on your system, Eterm may
need to be setuid root to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command, --exec command <br>
Execute command rather than a shell. Forces Eterm mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U URL, --url URL <br>
Pick up a &quot;screen&quot; session at URL rather than a
local (-U &quot;&quot;) one. URLs look like so
(screen://user@host.dom:port/screen_options), with all parts
optional, defaulting to <br>
&quot;screen://current_user@localhost:22/-RDD&quot;. Forces
Escreen mode, overrides --exec. Note that only
screen-options (see &quot;man screen&quot;) are allowed; do
not pass a command (with <br>
or without arguments) here: to pass a command to the
screen-session, use screen [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;command&gt;
[&lt;args&gt;] instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z lclport:fw:fwport,delay, --fw
lclport:fw:fwport,delay <br>
The URL given to -U is in an intranet behind firewall fw so
we&rsquo;ll build an SSH-tunnel to that firewall (to port
22/SSH, or fwport if given) from our local machine (using
<br>
any available port-number, or lclport if given). Then, after
delay seconds (or a sensible default if not given), we will
try to open a screen session on the host behind <br>
the firewall using ssh -p localport ... localhost screen cf.
ssh -L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEMES <br>
Eterm is built on the philosophy of Freedom of Choice. Each
user should be able to choose the environment in which he or
she wishes to exist, and the tools used should support <br>
that. In accordance with that philosophy, Eterm is extremely
configurable. Eterm supports a concept called
&quot;themes,&quot; which should be familiar to users of
Enlightenment, icewm, <br>
or Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT. The general concept of a
theme is a collection of resources that change as many
aspects of a programs look and feel as possible. For
example, an <br>
Enlightenment theme allows you to customize menus, window
borders, desktops, icons, iconbars, and everything else
about how E looks and feels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An Eterm theme consists of a
primary configuration file, always called
&quot;theme.cfg&quot;, residing in a directory bearing the
same name as the theme. This directory must be a child of
<br>
one of the directories specified by CONFIG_SEARCH_PATH in
src/feature.h. The theme may also contain additional
configuration files referenced by the primary theme.cfg
file, as <br>
well as pixmaps, menu files, documentation, etc., which are
allowable as extensions to the minimum requirement of an
Eterm theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By convention and default, Eterm
themes should be stored under
~/.Eterm/themes/&lt;theme_name&gt;/ or
/usr/share/Eterm/themes/&lt;theme_name&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eterm now supports the existence
of a user configuration file as a supplement to the theme
configuration file. The default name for this file is
user.cfg, and it follows the <br>
exact same syntax as any other configuration file. It is
searched for using the same algorithm used for the theme.cfg
file, and any settings in the user.cfg will override any
<br>
previous values for those settings defined by the theme.
Thus, it is recommended that any user.cfg files not be
complete config files, but rather only contain those values
which <br>
the user wishes to explicitly override.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If you have a user.cfg
file in the Eterm theme directory or in ~/.Eterm/, it will
override any previous settings, even if you are running a
different theme. For example, <br>
if you run the trans theme, but
~/.Eterm/themes/Eterm/user.cfg has a mode line which sets
the image mode to &quot;image&quot; rather than
&quot;trans,&quot; you will not get transparency. This is
<br>
why user.cfg files should be kept small and only override
settings that you know you want to enforce. If, on the other
hand, you were running the trans theme and had a user.cfg
<br>
file in the trans theme (or in ~/.Eterm/themes/trans/), that
user.cfg would be found before the one in the Eterm
theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Almost all command line options
can be enabled/disabled in the theme&rsquo;s configuration
file (the default is
/usr/share/Eterm/themes/Eterm/theme.cfg). The next section
contains <br>
details on the format and usage of the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Since Eterm 0.9.6 is based on the concept of themes, it is
vital that you have a thorough understanding of the previous
section before taking on this one. The previous section <br>
and this one were written by the same person who wrote the
Eterm code which handles options, config files, and themes,
so it&rsquo;s probably the most authoritative documentation
on <br>
the subject you&rsquo;re going to find.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From here on out, I will assume
you&rsquo;ve read the above text and know how to change the
default value for the theme. It is highly recommended that
you have a copy of the Eterm <br>
theme config file that comes with Eterm handy while you read
this documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Okay, first the general idea.
The theme.cfg file is composed of comments and non-comments.
Comments begin with a pound sign and continue to the end of
the line. Lines of <br>
whitespace are also ignored. The rest of the file is the
config stuff, which is divided into sections (called
&quot;contexts&quot;) and variables (called
&quot;attributes&quot;). There are several <br>
contexts which are listed below in sections. Each attribute
must be inside a certain context to be valid. For instance,
while the &quot;foreground&quot; attribute is perfectly
acceptable <br>
in the color context, it would be rejected if found in, say,
the toggles context. This allows for better organization of
the config file as well as for multiple contexts to have
<br>
attributes of the same name (like the scrollbar attributes
in the color and toggles section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each context must be enclosed in
a begin...end pair that specifies the type of section. The
statement &quot;begin toggles&quot; starts the toggles
context, and the next &quot;end&quot; statement <br>
would terminate it. (You&rsquo;ll notice that some
&quot;end&quot; statements have the context name after them.
This is for readability only; any text after the word
&quot;end&quot; is ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of this section will
contain a step-by-step analysis of the config file,
including what can go in each section. Note that some
attributes (and even entire contexts) may <br>
not be available depending on what support was compiled into
Eterm by the person who built it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAGIC NUMBER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of the config
file must contain a &quot;magic number&quot; type line that
lets Eterm verify that it&rsquo;s reading an Eterm config
file and not something else (like an <br>
Enlightenment 0.13 and earlier config file). The line should
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;Eterm-VERSION&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where VERSION is the Eterm
version for which the config file is intended. For example,
config files written for Eterm 0.9 should have
&quot;&lt;Eterm-0.9&gt;&quot; as their first line, <br>
followed immediately by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context contains color
specifications. With the exception of the terminal colors
0-15, all colors should be either a valid color name or an
RGB string as outlined in <br>
the X11(7) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foreground color <br>
Use color for the foreground (text) color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">background color <br>
Use color for the background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cursor color <br>
Use color for the cursor color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cursor_text color <br>
Use color for the cursor text color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointer color <br>
Use color for the mouse pointer color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">video { normal | reverse } <br>
normal will not reverse the foreground and background
colors. reverse (meaning reverse video) will.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color num color <br>
Set terminal color num (0-15) to the color name, string, or
set of 3 decimal/hex/octal RGB values specified by
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color { bd | ul } color <br>
Set terminal bold (bd) or underline (ul) color to the color
name, string, or set of 3 decimal/hex/octal RGB values
specified by color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTRIBUTES CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context contains X11
attributes. Most of these are dependent upon the cooperation
of the window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geometry geom <br>
Use the geometry string geom to specify the startup
geometry. geom should be in the format WxH+X+Y where W is
the width, H is the height, and +X and +Y are the X and <br>
Y offsets. If the signs on X and Y are positive, the
coordinates are offsets (in pixels) from the left and top,
respectively, of the screen. If the signs are nega&acirc;
<br>
tive, the offsets are relative to the right and bottom of
the screen, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title title <br>
Use title as the text in the title bar of the Eterm
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name name <br>
Use name as the resource name of the Eterm window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconname name <br>
Use name as the icon name of the Eterm window icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">desktop num <br>
Start Eterm on desktop num. NOTE: This requires a
GNOME-compliant Window Manager. Please see
http://www.gnome.org/devel/gnomewm/ for more information on
the <br>
_WIN_WORKSPACE property and how to support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollbar_type type <br>
Use a scrollbar with the type style. type can be any of
motif, xterm, or next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollbar_width num <br>
Use a scrollbar that is num pixels wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font num font <br>
font bold font <br>
Set the numth font, or the bold font, to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font default num <br>
Specifies that the numth font should be considered the
&quot;default&quot; font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font proportional boolean <br>
Specifies that the font in use is proportional and requests
standard deviation-based character cell spacing. Terminals
must use fixed-width character cells to maintain <br>
proper columnal alignment, even when proportionally-spaced
fonts are in use. Some proportionally-spaced fonts vary
greatly between the minimum and maximum character <br>
widths. This option chooses a character cell size which is
up to two standard deviations above the average character
width but will not exceed the maximum width of the <br>
largest glyph. Note that characters larger than the chosen
cell width will overwrite (or be overwritten by) other
characters and may tend to leave pixel droppings. <br>
This behavior is an expected side-effect of an imperfect
scenario. If you object to this behavior, do not use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font fx effects <br>
Specifies the effects to apply to the terminal window font.
The value of effects is a single string containing a series
of corner/color pairs. These pairs define <br>
toward which corner a drop shadow of each character should
be made, and what color that shadow will be. The corner is
specified first using the following keywords: <br>
top_left or tl, top_right or tr, bottom_left or bl, and
bottom_right or br. Each corner specifier is then followed
by a color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also several shortcuts
for doing common effects. You can get a single-color outline
by using the keyword outline followed by a color. A
single-color drop <br>
shadow is also available using the keyword shadow followed
by an optional corner specifier (bottom_right being the
default) and a color. For a 3-D embossed look, use <br>
emboss dark_color light_color. The opposite effect, a
carved-out look, can be obtained with carved dark_color
light_color. (Of course, with those last two, the 3-D <br>
look will only work if you choose the light and dark colors
wisely.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, for no font effects at
all, simply specify the keyword none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is
bottom_right black which yields a black drop shadow, greatly
improving the visibility of lightly-colored fonts on top of
light spots in a back&acirc; <br>
ground image. Note that font effects are not active in solid
color mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGECLASSES CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context contains global
image attributes. It also provides the parent context for
defining images via the &quot;image&quot; context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icon filename <br>
Use filename as the icon image for the Eterm window.
filename can be an absolute path, relative to the current
theme, or relative to one of the directories in the path
<br>
attribute listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache num <br>
Sets the Imlib2 cache size to num bytes. The default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path directory_list <br>
Specifies a colon-delimited list of directories relative to
which Eterm should search for image and menu files. The
syntax for directory_list is precisely the same as <br>
that of the $PATH environment variable in UNIX shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anim interval images ... <br>
Specifies an animation list to be use in cycling the
background pixmap. The interval defines the delay, in
seconds, between updates of the background. This should be
<br>
set to a reasonable value to insure that Eterm doesn&rsquo;t
spend all its time rendering backgrounds. All the images
specify background images and have the same syntax as <br>
the -P option above, including the optional geometry
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMAGE CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context defines all the
attributes of a particular image. There can be (and usually
are) several image contexts per theme, one for each class of
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type class <br>
Specifies the type, or class, of the image that is going to
be defined in that context. This MUST be the first attribute
defined in the image context. Valid classes <br>
are: background, trough, anchor, up_arrow, down_arrow,
left_arrow, right_arrow, menu, menuitem, submenu, button,
and buttonbar. Note that the left and right arrows, <br>
while valid, don&rsquo;t do anything just yet. All the
subsequent attributes up to the next type definition will be
applied to that image class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode initial_mode [ allow
allowed_modes ] <br>
Specifies the initial mode for this image class as well as
the modes which the image class is allowed to use.
initial_mode is the mode that the image will have on <br>
startup (unless overridden by command-line options.
allowed_modes is a list of one or more modes. The image will
be prevented from switching to any mode not listed in <br>
the allow section. If the allow section is omitted entirely,
the image will never be permitted to change from the
initial_mode. If no mode line is specified for an <br>
image class, the default is equivalent to mode solid allow
solid. Valid mode names are image (to use an image), trans
(for transparency), viewport (for viewport mode), <br>
auto (for auto mode, which requires Enlightenment 0.16 or
better), and solid (which is a solid color only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">state { normal | selected |
clicked | disabled } <br>
This sets the state of the image you are about to define. Up
until the next state attribute that is encountered (or until
you change types), all attributes will apply <br>
to that particular state of the image. You should at minimum
define the normal state of the image. It will be used as the
default if the attributes for the other <br>
states are not specified. However, each image state has
self-contained options. Therefore, if you define multiple
states for an image class, you must define ALL <br>
attributes needed by that state. The sample themes supplied
with Eterm demonstrate how to define 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-state
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above attributes affect the
image class as a whole. All remaining attributes in this
context affect only the current state of the image
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color fg bg <br>
Sets the foreground and background colors for this
imageclass. The foreground color is used for text, and the
background color is used for the object itself. If an <br>
invalid color is specified, the default value for fg is
white, and the default for bg is black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file filename <br>
Sets the filename from which to load the image file. This is
used for the image mode. If you allow the image mode for
your image, don&rsquo;t forget to supply an image <br>
file! Note that you can also supply an image geometry string
here by adding an @ symbol and the geometry string to the
end of the filename. See below for the syntax <br>
of the geometry string. filename must be an absolute path or
a path relative to one of the directories in the path
attribute. Note that the image is verified and <br>
loaded when this attribute is encountered during
parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geom image_geometry <br>
Specifies the geometry and geometry-related operations which
are to be applied to the image. This attribute only applies
to image classes using the image mode. Image <br>
geometry is specified as wxh+x+y:ops where w and h are the
horizontal/vertical scaling percentages, x and y are the
horizontal/vertical alignment percentages, and ops <br>
is a colon-delimited list of operations: tiled (to tile the
image), propscaled (for proportional scaling). Note that
these operations can be combined for various <br>
effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmod { image | red | green |
blue } brightness [ contrast [ gamma ] ] <br>
colormod { image | red | green | blue } brightness [
contrast [ gamma ] ] <br>
Specifies a color modifier to apply to the image. The second
keyword determines whether the modifier will be applied to
the image overall, the red values, the green <br>
values, or the blue values. Each of the three parameters is
a number greater than or equal to 0. The numbers can be
specified as decimal, octal (if preceded by &quot;0&quot;),
<br>
or hexadecimal (if preceded by &quot;0x&quot;). A value of
256 (0x100) represents 100%, or &quot;leave that value
unchanged.&quot; 0 represents 0%, 512 (0x200) is 200%, etc.
However, be <br>
aware that overflow can occur with excessively high values.
Only the brightness value is required for this option. Keep
in mind, though, that you must specify bright&acirc; <br>
ness with contrast, and both of these with gamma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">border left right top bottom
<br>
Specifies that the image has borders which should not be
scaled with the rest of the image. This is primarily used
for images that have a beveled look, so that the <br>
bevel will not end up getting scaled and lose the bevel
effect. All four parameter values are in pixels, just like
the equivalent options for E themes and Gtk+ pixmap <br>
themes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bevel { up | down } left right
top bottom <br>
Adds a bevel to an image class. This can be done to any
image class using the image or trans modes. The parameters
are pixel values which represent the width of each <br>
edge of the bevel. This is especially useful if you want to
use tiled images or transparency for the arrow or anchor
scrollbar widgets, or for menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">padding left right top bottom
<br>
This is used only for the submenu image class. It defines
the amount of pixels on each side to reserve so that the
text will not overwrite part of the image. Works <br>
just like the same option in Enlightenment themes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context is used to create a
menu. There is one instance of this context per menu, and
the menus should be defined in submenu-menu order; i.e., any
menu that refers <br>
to another menu (as its submenu) should be defined after the
submenu is defined. Within the menu context, there should be
a menuitem subcontext for each menu item (with <br>
the exception of the shorthand for separators).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title menu_title <br>
This specifies the title for the menu to be defined. This
MUST be the first attribute given after the &quot;begin
menu&quot;. The title must be unique amongst all the menus.
<br>
It may contain spaces, but don&rsquo;t forget to enclose it
in single or double quotes if it does. Any future references
to the menu will use the title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font font_name <br>
Tells Eterm to use font_name as the font for this menu. If
not given, the default terminal font is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sep or - <br>
These symbols can be used as shorthand to insert a separator
into the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUITEM CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a subcontext of the menu
context which creates a single item for a menu. There can be
(and usually are) several menuitem contexts per menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text label <br>
This is the text that is displayed for this menuitem. It is
left-justified in the menu window. It can have spaces, but
enclose label in quotes if it does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rtext label <br>
This is text which is right-justified next to the menuitem
text. This is generally used to show what keystrokes
correspond to a particular menu item, like &quot;C-x
C-c&quot; <br>
for the &quot;Exit&quot; menuitem in an Emacs menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">action { string | echo | submenu
| script } param <br>
action separator <br>
Specifies the action to occur when the menuitem is chosen.
If you specify separator, nothing else is needed. The other
action types require a parameter, param. <br>
string specifies a string to be sent to Eterm for handling
(escape codes, for example). echo specifies a string to be
sent to the client program (for sending commands <br>
to a shell, or keystrokes to an application like emacs or
mutt). If you use either of these action types, param will
be parsed for escape codes (, C-, and the like) <br>
before being sent. submenu specifies a submenu which should
be displayed when this item is selected, and param is the
title of the submenu to show. The submenu must <br>
have already been defined. The script action type executes
the Eterm-builtin script contained in param. See the section
below for more details on the builtin Eterm <br>
functions allowed for this action type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTION CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions are key or mouse button
bindings which activate certain behaviors. Any action that
can be triggered through an escape code can be bound to a
key or mouse button, <br>
with or without modifiers. You can also bind menus to
keystrokes or mouse buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind [ modifiers ] { keysym |
button } to { string | echo | menu | script } param <br>
Binds a keysym or a mouse button to an action. The action
syntax follows the keyword to and is identical to the syntax
used for menus (see above). There can be any <br>
number of modifiers (so long as the combination is
reasonable) but only one keysym or button. Valid modifiers
are ctrl, shift, lock, mod1 through mod5, alt, meta, and
<br>
anymod (which allows any modifier). If none are given, the
keypress must not have modifier keys in use or the action
will not be triggered. Use anymod to allow any <br>
arbitrary modifier key to be used. The keysym can be given
in text (case-sensitive) or as a hex number. buttons should
be specified as button1 through button5. Also <br>
note that alt and meta will be equivalent to one or more of
mod1 through mod5, as well as perhaps each other, based on
your modifier settings. You can view these set&acirc; <br>
tings using xmodmap -pm. See also the alt_mod and meta_mod
options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUTTON_BAR CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The buttonbar is an addition to
Eterm 0.9.1 which allows users to have a fully-customizeable
buttonbar at the top or bottom of each terminal window.
Buttons on the but&acirc; <br>
tonbar can be used just like menuitems; they can popup menus
(like a menubar), or they can activate any other action a
menuitem can.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font font <br>
Specifies the font in which button labels will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dock { top | bottom | no } <br>
Specify whether or not to dock the buttonbar, and if so,
whether to dock it at the top or the bottom of the Eterm
window. Note that only top and bottom are currently <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visible boolean <br>
Toggle whether or not this particular buttonbar will be
visible on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">button [ text ] [ icon filename
] action { string | echo | menu | script } param <br>
Binds an action to a button. The usage of param and the
action types work the same here as they do for menuitems.
Also note that you may specify some text or an icon <br>
or both, but you cannot omit both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTICHAR CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Behavior for multi-byte fonts
and encodings are defined here. This context does not exist
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding { eucj | sjis | euckr |
big5 | gb | iso-10646 } <br>
Specifies the encoding method. Patches to support other
encoding methods are encouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font num font <br>
Set the numth multichar font to font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XIM CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context controls
locale-based behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input_method input_method <br>
Specify your input method program of choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preedit_type { OverTheSpot |
OffTheSpot | Root } <br>
Specify your preedit type of choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCREEN CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context allows for
customizations specific to Escreen mode. See the Escreen
section below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">url
protocol://user@host:port/params <br>
Connect to (or create) a particular screen session via a
URL-type construct. Standard URL rules apply. The protocol
should be either screen (the default) or twin. If <br>
user, host, and/or port are specified, an ssh connection is
made to the remote server using the given login information.
The default is to create/attach to a local <br>
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any params that are given are
passed directly to the underlying protocol and are separated
from each other by a plus sign (+).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">firewall
localport:firewall:remoteport <br>
Bounce the connection through a firewall via ssh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delay secs <br>
Specify the amount of time to wait before sending the
screen/twin initialization sequence. This is required to
insure that the remote session has been established <br>
prior to sending the init sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bbar_font font <br>
Font to use for the Escreen buttonbar. The default is
-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--10-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bbar_dock { top | bottom | no }
<br>
Dock the Escreen buttonbar as specified. Note that only top
and bottom are currently enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOGGLES CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context contains boolean
variables which can be toggled on or off. Valid values for
the attributes in this section are &quot;yes&quot;,
&quot;on&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;true&quot; to turn
the <br>
option on, or &quot;no&quot;, &quot;off&quot;,
&quot;0&quot;, or &quot;false&quot; to turn the option off.
These values are denoted by boolean. They all default to
false unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map_alert boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will un-iconify itself when it receives a
beep (ASCII 0x07).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual_bell boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will flash rather than sending a beep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">login_shell boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will prepend &rsquo;-&rsquo; to the shell
name when calling it. Depending on your shell, this may
modify its startup behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollbar boolean <br>
This turns on and off the display of the scrollbar. Default
is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utmp_logging boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will attempt to make an entry in the utmp
file to record the login information. Eterm may need to run
privileged to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">meta8 boolean <br>
Toggles the interpretation of the Meta key setting the 8th
bit in a character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconic boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will launch as an icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home_on_output boolean <br>
Zoom to the bottom of the scrollback buffer on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home_on_input boolean <br>
Zoom to the bottom of the scrollback buffer on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_input boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will not accept any keyboard input and will
ask the window manager to not allow it to be focused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollbar_floating boolean <br>
If true, the scrollbar will have no trough.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollbar_right boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will put the scrollbar on the right of the
window (default is left).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scrollbar_popup boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will hide the scrollbar when the Eterm window
loses focus and restore it when focus is regained. Default
is to not change the scrollbar state based on <br>
focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">borderless boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will run with no window borders. This also
means that the window can not be moved or resized. You will
want to specify a geometry with this attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">double_buffer boolean <br>
Rather than drawing text directly onto the window, this
causes Eterm to allocate an additional pixmap the size of
the terminal window into which the background *and* <br>
the text are rendered. This pixmap is then set as the window
background. Double-buffering uses additional memory in the X
server, but it allows Eterm to ignore expose <br>
events so redraws are faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no_cursor boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will not display a text cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pause boolean <br>
After the child process terminates, Eterm will wait for a
keypress before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm_select boolean <br>
Duplicate&rsquo;s xterm&rsquo;s treatment of cutchars. The
only real difference is what happens when you double click
on a single cutchar between two words. If this option is on,
<br>
only that single character gets selected. If it is off, that
character is selected along with the two words. The latter
behavior is useful for double-clicking on the <br>
space between someone&rsquo;s first and last names, or the @
sign in an e-mail address, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select_line boolean <br>
If true, this attribute causes a triple click to select the
entire line from beginning to end. If false (default), a
triple-click selects from the current word to the <br>
end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select_trailing_spaces boolean
<br>
If true, this attribute causes spaces at the end of a line
to be included as part of the selection text when selecting.
The default is to strip these trailing spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">report_as_keysyms boolean <br>
Reports certain keystrokes as keysyms and modifiers rather
than escape sequences. NOTE: This option is intended for use
only with programs that support this special <br>
Eterm mode. Do not enable it unless you are executing a
program which uses this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">itrans boolean <br>
immotile_trans boolean <br>
Toggles the immotile transparency optimization for
transparent Eterm windows. Note that this does NOT activate
transparency; you must still activate &quot;trans&quot; mode
for <br>
the background image. This option should be used on
transparent windows which are shaded or tinted and which do
not move around on the desktop much. See the Mon Mar <br>
6 21:11:13 PST 2000 ChangeLog entry for a more detailed
explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buttonbar boolean <br>
Toggle the display of all buttonbars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize_gravity boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will automatically detect the nearest corner,
and font-change resizes will cause the Eterm window to
gravitate toward that corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overstrike_bold boolean <br>
If true (default), Eterm will simulate a bold font by
printing each character twice, offsetting the second pass by
one pixel. This makes the characters seem thicker <br>
without the need for a special font. You may wish to disable
this if you use a specific color for bold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bold_brightens_foreground
boolean <br>
If true (default), Eterm will use the &quot;bold&quot; ANSI
color attribute to brighten the foreground color by using
the high-intensity colors (8 through 15) rather than the
<br>
low-intensity colors (0 through 7). Note that having a
specific color selected for bold will override this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blink_brightens_background
boolean <br>
If true (default), Eterm will use the &quot;blink&quot; ANSI
color attribute to brighten the background color by using
the high-intensity colors (8 through 15) rather than the
<br>
low-intensity colors (0 through 7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colors_suppress_bold boolean
<br>
If true (default), any colored text (that is, any text not
rendered using the default foreground color) will not be
given any other special treatment for bolding (e.g., <br>
bold font or bold overstrike).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sticky boolean <br>
If true, Eterm will make its window sticky (shows on all
desktops).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context contains
keyboard-related configuration options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smallfont_key keysym <br>
Specify a keysym to decrease the font size. Default is Shift
and the - key on the keypad. Ctrl-&lt; or Meta-&lt; may also
work (if you #define one of the hotkeys in <br>
src/feature.h).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bigfont_key keysym <br>
Specify a keysym to increase the font size. Default is Shift
and the + key on the keypad. Ctrl-&gt; or Meta-&gt; may also
work (if you #define one of the hotkeys in <br>
src/feature.h).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keysym keysym string <br>
Define keysym keysym to send string instead of its default.
keysym must be between 0xff00 and 0xffff or Eterm will
complain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">meta_mod num <br>
Specify which X modifier (1-5) to treat as the Meta key. See
xmodmap(1) and the output of xmodmap -pm for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alt_mod num <br>
Same as meta_mod, but for the Alt key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numlock_mod num <br>
Same as meta_mod, but for the NumLock key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">greek boolean { iso | ibm } <br>
Turn on/off greek keyboard support, and set which greek mode
to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">app_keypad boolean <br>
Turn on/off application keypad mode on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">app_cursor boolean <br>
Turn on/off application cursor key mode on startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISC CONTEXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This context contains
miscellaneous attributes that really didn&rsquo;t belong
anywhere else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print_pipe command <br>
Set the command to which to pipe print requests
(printscreen) to command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save_lines num <br>
Set the number of lines in the scrollback buffer to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cut_chars string <br>
Define the characters used as word delimiters to the
characters contained in string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min_anchor_size num <br>
Sets the minimum size, in pixels, of the scrollbar anchor
(the part your mouse grabs onto and moves around) to
num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">border_width num <br>
Sets the width of the border between the text window and the
X window to num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line_space num <br>
Put num pixels&rsquo; worth of space between each row of the
terminal window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finished_title title <br>
Specifies that title should be displayed in the title bar of
a paused Eterm when the child process has completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">finished_text text <br>
Specifies that text should be displayed in the terminal
window of a paused Eterm when the child process has
completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term_name name <br>
Use name as the $TERM environment variable, which controls
which termcap/terminfo entry gets used. The default is
Eterm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec command <br>
Rather than executing a shell, this will cause Eterm to
spawn command as its child process. You can only have one of
these!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eterm has a set of built-in
functions which are available in config files. Each one
accepts zero or more parameters and outputs a series of zero
or more words. &quot;Words&quot; <br>
are defined in shell terms; i.e., words are separated by
whitespace, and single or double quotes can be used to
encapsulate words which contain whitespace themselves. You
<br>
also employ backquotes to execute a command whose output can
become part of the config file itself or can be passed to a
built-in function as its parameter list. Built-in <br>
functions and backquotes may be used anywhere their output
would be valid. Built-in functions are prefixed with the %
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%appname() <br>
Returns the application name, a hyphen, and the version
number. Currently this is the string Eterm-0.9.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%exec(command) <br>
Executes command and returns the result. Basically
it&rsquo;s exactly like using backquotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%get(variable) <br>
Retrieve the value of a config file variable. Refer to the
%put() function below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%put(variable value) <br>
Create a config variable named variable and assign it the
value of value. The value can then subsequently be retrieved
using %get(variable)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%random(params) <br>
This function randomly chooses one of the words which
compose params and returns that. The default themes that
come with Eterm use this function to choose random
back&acirc; <br>
grounds, but backgrounds aren&rsquo;t the only things that
can be randomized with this function. You can randomize
anything...colors, toggles, fonts, tinting, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%version() <br>
Returns the version number. Currently this is the string
0.9.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPROCESSING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eterm supports the %include file
directive to allow for separation of the configuration
information into multiple files. Eterm will load and parse
file just like any <br>
other config file, but will treat its contents as if they
replaced the directive itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also request that the
config file be run through an external preprocessor (such as
m4 or cpp) before Eterm reads it. This is done via the
%preproc command direc&acirc; <br>
tive. You may specify anything you like for command so long
as it accepts input on STDIN and sends output to STDOUT. See
the menus.cfg file in the default chooser theme <br>
for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT FUNCTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the action types which
can be bound to keypresses, mouse buttons, menuitems, or
buttonbar buttons is a script. The script must be a single
word (i.e., containing <br>
no spaces or enclosed in quotes) and consists of one or more
calls to the script functions below. Each call is separated
from the next by a semicolon (;). Function <br>
parameters are enclosed in parentheses; the parentheses are
optional if no parameters are to be passed. Commas and/or
whitespace separate parameters from each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy(buffer) <br>
Copies the current selection to the specified clipboard or
cut buffer. buffer is either a number 0-7, in which case the
selection is copied to the cut buffer speci&acirc; <br>
fied, or one of the words clipboard, primary, or secondary
(or any initial substring thereof), in which case the
selection is copied to the specified clipboard. You <br>
may omit buffer, in which case the default buffer is primary
(XA_PRIMARY in Xlib-speak).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo(string) <br>
Send the specified string to the subcommand. Exactly
equivalent to the echo action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">es_display(cmd, params) <br>
Aliases: es_disp <br>
This is a master function which permits manipulation of
Escreen displays through the use of a series of subcommands.
The specified cmd determines what, if any, params <br>
are permitted. Available subcommands are: <br>
goto - Switch to the specified display (0-9) <br>
prev - Switch to the previous display <br>
next - Switch to the next display <br>
toggle - Toggle display <br>
new - Create a new display. A name for the new display may
be passed as a parameter, or ask to prompt the user for the
name. <br>
rename - Change the name of the current display. A name for
the new display may be passed as a parameter, or ask to
prompt the user for the name. <br>
kill - Terminate the current (or specified) display. <br>
watch - Toggle monitoring of the current/specified display
for activity. <br>
scrollback - View the scrollback for the current/specified
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">es_region(cmd, params) <br>
Aliases: es_reg es_win es_window <br>
This is a master function which permits manipulation of
Escreen display regions through the use of a series of
subcommands. The specified cmd determines what, if any, <br>
params are permitted. Available subcommands are: <br>
goto - Switch to the specified region (0-9) <br>
prev - Switch to the previous region <br>
next - Switch to the next region <br>
toggle - Toggle region <br>
new - Create a new region. A name for the new region may be
passed as a parameter, or ask to prompt the user for the
name. <br>
rename - Change the name of the current region. A name for
the new region may be passed as a parameter, or ask to
prompt the user for the name. <br>
kill - Terminate the current (or specified) region. <br>
only - Maximize the current/specified region to the full
display. <br>
watch - Toggle monitoring of the current/specified region
for activity. <br>
scrollback - View the scrollback for the current/specified
region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">es_statement(statement) <br>
Execute an Escreen (screen/twin) command directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">es_reset() <br>
Aliases: es_rst <br>
Reset the Escreen session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec_dialog(command) <br>
The same as exec/spawn, but this function presents the user
with a dialog box in which she can edit/confirm the command
to be run and specify additional parameters if <br>
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit(message) <br>
exit(code) <br>
Aliases: die quit <br>
Exit Eterm with an optional message or an integer return
code. Either parameter may be specified, but not both. If
neither is specified, a code of 0 (zero) is the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill(signal) <br>
Sends the specified signal to Eterm&rsquo;s primary child
process (either your shell, or whatever you specify for
Eterm to execute). For the time being, signal must be <br>
numeric. SIGTERM is the default if signal is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msgbox(message) <br>
Displays a small dialog box containing message and waits for
a keypress before continuing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nop() <br>
Does absolutely nothing except waste time. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paste(buffer) <br>
Pastes the contents of the specified clipboard or cut buffer
into the terminal window. buffer is either a number 0-7, in
which case the selection is pasted from the <br>
cut buffer specified, or one of the words clipboard,
primary, or secondary (or any initial substring thereof), in
which case the contents of the specified clipboard are <br>
pasted. You may omit buffer, in which case the default
buffer is primary (XA_PRIMARY in Xlib-speak).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save(type, filename) <br>
Save the current theme/user configuration. type can be
either user or theme; the default is user. filename is the
file to which the settings should be saved. It may <br>
contain a path which is either absolute or relative to the
theme directory. The default filename for user is user.cfg,
and the default filename for theme is theme.cfg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save_buff(filename) <br>
Dumps the contents of the scrollback buffer to the specified
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scroll(n) <br>
Scrolls backward or forward in the scrollback buffer. n is a
floating point number followed by an optional unit
specifier. The unit specifier is one of: lines or l; <br>
pages or p; or buffers or b. The floating point number may
be separated from the unit specifier by whitespace or a
comma, but it is not required. The floating point <br>
number should be positive to scroll down (forward) and
negative to scroll up (backward). For example, the key
sequence Shift-PgUp is equivalent to scroll(-1p). You <br>
may also specify fractional quantities, such as scroll(0.5p)
to scroll down half a page. The default unit if not
specified is lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search(str) <br>
Presents a dialog box into which the user may enter a search
term. The default value is set to str. All occurrences of
the specified search string are highlighted in <br>
the scrollback buffer, and Eterm jumps back to the most
recent one. Searching again with the same keyword will clear
the previous highlighting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spawn(command) <br>
Aliases: exec <br>
Spawns a secondary child process to execute command, or
Eterm if no value is passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string(string) <br>
The specified string is parsed via Eterm. This is exactly
identical to the string action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCREEN <br>
Escreen is a screen/twin interface layer which allows Eterm
to interoperate with GNU screen and with Massimiliano
Ghilardi&rsquo;s twin software. This allows Eterm to support
multiple <br>
subshell sessions within a single window. On the surface,
this feature works similarly to the &quot;tabbed&quot;
sessions offered by programs like konsole and
multi-gnome-terminal. How&acirc; <br>
ever, Escreen has the advantage of being an interface to
existing software, thus providing additional capabilities
like multiple regions per display, detach/reattach
capability, <br>
seamless remote session support, firewall support, and
more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escreen support is still
somewhat experimental and is thus not compiled into Eterm by
default. To enable it, you must compile with
--enable-escreen and/or --enable-etwin <br>
(depending on whether you have screen, twin, or both). If
you installed from a package, you can use Eterm --version
and check for either +ESCREEN (enabled) or -ESCREEN
(dis&acirc; <br>
abled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results, if you wish to
use Escreen mode, do so by invoking Eterm with the Escreen
theme (Eterm -t Escreen). This theme supplies default key
bindings, the basic Escreen <br>
menu, color definitions, etc. for use by the Escreen engine.
Most importantly, it supplies the required url parameter in
order to invoke Escreen mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consult the README.Escreen file
for more in-depth discussion of Escreen mode.</p>
