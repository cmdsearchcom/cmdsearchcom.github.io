<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wcd - Wherever Change Directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chdir for DOS and Unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wcd [options] [directory]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Overview <br>
Wcd is a command-line program to change directory fast. It
saves time typing at the keyboard. One needs to type only a
part of a directory name and wcd will jump to it. Wcd has a
<br>
fast selection method in case of multiple matches and allows
aliasing and banning of directories. Wcd also includes a
full screen interactive directory tree browser with speed
<br>
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd was modeled after Norton
Change Directory (NCD). NCD appeared first in The Norton
Utilities, Release 4, for DOS in 1987, published by Peter
Norton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd has been ported to different
command-line shells: DOS command.com, Windows cmd.exe and
PowerShell, OS/2 cmd.exe, and Unix shells such as Bourne
(sh), Bourne Again (bash), <br>
Korn (ksh), Z (zsh), and C (csh) shell and others running on
any operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd supports 8 bit character
sets on all systems, and has optional support for Unicode.
See section LOCALIZATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See section INSTALLATION how to
setup wcd for personal use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic use <br>
By default (if no wildcards are used) wcd searches for a
directory with a name that begins with the typed name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance this command will
change to directory to the current user&rsquo;s
&quot;/home/user/Desktop&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd Desk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When there are multiple matches,
wcd will present the user a list of all matches. The user
can then make a selection with a few keystrokes (most of the
times only one).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards <br>
Wcd supports following wildcards:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* matches any sequence of
characters (zero or more) <br>
? matches any character <br>
[SET] matches any character in the specified set, <br>
[!SET] or [^SET] matches any character not in the specified
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A set is composed of characters
or ranges; a range looks like character hyphen character as
in &quot;0-9&quot; or &quot;A-Z&quot;. The
&quot;[0-9a-zA-Z_]&quot; is the minimal set of characters
allowed in the <br>
&quot;[..]&quot; pattern construct. International characters
(i.e. 8 bit characters) are allowed if the system supports
them. To suppress the special syntactic significance of any
of <br>
&quot;[]*?!^-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using wildcards makes powerful
searching possible. For instance this matches any directory
name that ends with &quot;top&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd *top</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Match directories that have
&quot;top&quot; anywhere in the name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd *top*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Match any directory name that
begins with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or
&quot;c&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd [a-c]*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to give a
part of a directory path. Here Wcd searches for directory
that begins with &quot;Desk&quot; and which path matches
*me/Desk*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd me/Desk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is allowed to type any kind
of expression with slashes and wildcards. E.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd src*/*1?/a*2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other uses <br>
If no wildcards are used and wcd finds a perfect match, wcd
will ignore all wild matches by default. This behaviour can
be changed with the -w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interactive directory tree
browser can be started by using option -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -g</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd generates a treedata file
where it searches the directory. On Unix and Windows systems
wcd does add symbolic links to the treedata file while
scanning the disk, but does not <br>
follow them. While following links wcd could end up scanning
infinite loops, or scan very large portions of a
network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd can also change to
directories that are not in the treedata file. E.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If wcd found a match but
can&rsquo;t change to the directory it tries to remove it
from the default treedata file. Not from the extra treedata
file. See also option -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd keeps a directory stack
which is stored on disk. The stack has a default size of 10
and is cyclic. See options -z, -, + and =.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In multi-user environments
option -u can be used to change to directories of other
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On DOS and Windows systems it
does not matter if you use a slash &quot;/&quot; or a
backslash &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible on DOS and
Windows systems to change drive and directory in one go by
preceding the directory name with the drive name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd d:games</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows UNC paths <br>
The Windows versions (Command Prompt, PowerShell, MSYS, zsh,
cygwin) support Windows SMB LAN UNC paths without drive
letter such as &quot;\servernamerename&quot;. Wcd for
Windows <br>
Command Prompt makes use of the &quot;pushd&quot; command to
automatically map a UNC path to a drive letter. In Windows
PowerShell, MSYS, zsh and Cygwin UNC paths are fully
supported. The <br>
current working directory can be a UNC path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interfaces <br>
Wcd has three different interfaces to choose from a list of
matches. The interface can be chosen at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first interface uses plain
stdin/stdout. A numbered list is printed in the terminal.
The user has to choose from the list by typing a number
followed by &lt;Enter&gt;. This <br>
interface does not provide scroll back functionality in case
of a long list. The scroll back capability of the
terminal/console has to be used. It is very small and
portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second interface is built
with the conio library. It provides a builtin scroll back
capability. The user is presented a list numbered with
letters. Choosing from a list can <br>
be done by pressing just one letter. This interface is fast
because it saves keystrokes. If possible the screen will be
restored after exiting. One who prefers to type numbers <br>
can use the -N option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third interface is built
with the curses library. It is similar to the conio
interface. The curses version of wcd has also an additional
&rsquo;graphical&rsquo; interface. It lets the <br>
user select a directory via a full screen interactive
directory tree browser. It has a vim(1) like navigation and
search method. It can be activated with option -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using the -o option one can
always fall back to the stdin/stdout interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Add current path to the default treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option to quickly add
the current path to the default treedata file. Re-scanning
the complete disk can take a long time in some cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aa Add current and all parent
paths to the default treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A PATH <br>
Scan directory tree from PATH and append to the default
treedata file. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -A . <br>
wcd -A /home -A /etc <br>
wcd -A d: -A e: -A \serverre</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows one can scan all
shared directories of a Windows LAN server by typing
something like: &quot;wcd -A \servername&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also option -S and -s and
-E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Ban current path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd places the current path in
the ban file. This means that wcd ignores all matches of
this directory and its sub directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ban file can be edited with
a text editor. Use of wildcards is supported and names are
matched against the absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Banned paths are not excluded
from scanning the disk. To do that use option -xf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --direct-cd <br>
Direct CD mode. By default wcd works as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Try to find a match in the
treedata file(s) <br>
2. If no match, try to open the directory you typed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In direct CD mode wcd works in
reversed order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Try to open the directory you
typed. <br>
2. If not, try to find a match in the treedata file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DRIVE <br>
Set drive for stack and go file (DOS only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stack file and the go-script
are by default stored on drive C: if environment variable
HOME is not set. Use this option if drive C: is a read-only
drive. This option must <br>
be used in front of the stack options -, + and =.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Add current path to the extra
treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option to quickly add
the current path to the extra treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ee Add current and all parent
paths to extra treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E PATH <br>
Scan directory tree from PATH and append to Extra treedata
file. See also options -A and -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILE <br>
Read treedata file FILE. Do not read the default treedata
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+f FILE <br>
Read treedata file FILE in addition to the default treedata
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Graphical interface (only in
version with curses interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd starts a textual curses
based &rsquo;graphical&rsquo; interface. The user can select
a directory via a full-screen interactive directory tree
browser. It has a vim(1) like navigation <br>
and search method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no search string is given wcd
presents the whole tree which is in the default treedata
file and the extra treedata files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a search string is given the
match list is presented as a directory tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default tree layout is
similar to the tree layout of the original NCD on DOS. The
difference in layout is that in NCD all directories of a
same depth level were <br>
vertically aligned over the whole tree. This was possible in
NCD, because the maximum width of a directory name in DOS
was 12 (8.3) characters. On modern operating systems <br>
directory names can be very long, so also the differences in
length can be large. Therefore folders with a same depth are
not vertically aligned over the whole tree in wcd, <br>
but only in sub-branches. So there is some sideways movement
when moving straight up and down from one sub-branch to
another sub-branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The navigation behaviour in Wcd
is exactly the same as in the original NCD. For instance if
you push the Down key you go down to the next directory with
the same depth level, <br>
jumping over branches. This enables fast navigation through
the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See options -Ta, -TC, and -Tc to
change the navigation behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gd Dump the treedata files as a
tree to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G PATH <br>
Write go-script in directory PATH. For instance on Unix,
&quot;wcd -G PATH&quot; will write a go-script
PATH/wcd.go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-GN, --no-go-script <br>
Do not create go-script. This option can be used in
combination with the option -j if one does not want wcd to
create a go-script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore case. Dos and Windows versions of wcd ignore case
default. Unix/Cygwin versions regard case by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+i, --no-ignore-case <br>
Regard case. See also option -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --ignore-diacritics <br>
Ignore diacritics for Latin-based scripts. Letters with
diacritical marks match their base letter without
diacritical mark. The following Latin encodings are
supported: <br>
CP437, CP850, CP852, CP1250, CP1252, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2,
and Unicode Latin-1, Latin Extended-A, and Latin Extended-B.
See also &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+I, --no-ignore-diacritics <br>
Regard diacritics (default). See also option -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j, --just-go <br>
Just go mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode wcd will not
present a list when there is more than one directory that
matches the given directory. Wcd will just change to the
first option. When wcd is invoked <br>
again with the same arguments it will change to the next
option, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd will print the directory to
go to to stdout. So a different installation method can be
used. One could make the following function for a POSIX
compatible shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
cd &quot;$($HOME/bin/wcd.exe -j $@)&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are using an old shell
that doesn&rsquo;t support &quot;$()&quot; command
substitution you have to use old style command substitution
with back-quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
cd &quot;&lsquo;$HOME/bin/wcd.exe -j $@&lsquo;&quot; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows systems, if one is
running 4NT shell, one could make the following alias:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias wcd &lsquo;cd
%@execstr[wcdwin32.exe -z 0 -j %1]&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This method eliminates the need
of the go-script, so one can use option -GN in combination
with -j.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --keep-paths <br>
Keep paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep paths in the treedata file
when wcd can&rsquo;t change to them. The default behaviour
of wcd is that it tries to remove paths from the treedata
when wcd can&rsquo;t change to them. <br>
With this option this behavior is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --color <br>
Use colors in graphical mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l ALIAS <br>
Name the current path with ALIAS. Wcd places the current
path with alias ALIAS in the alias file. Aliases are case
sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ls Show the name of the alias
file, and list all the aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m DIR <br>
Make directory and add to treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --license <br>
Print the distribution license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M DIR <br>
Make directory and add to extra treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n PATH <br>
Read relative treedata file from PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not read the default treedata
file. The relative treedata file should already have been
created using the wcd +S option. PATH may also point to a
file directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example. Suppose another
system has been mounted to mount point
&quot;/mnt/network&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -n /mnt/network src</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd opens the relative treedata
file in &quot;/mnt/network/&quot;. The file contains the
paths relative from that point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+n PATH <br>
Read relative treedata file in addition to the default
treedata file. See option -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --numbers <br>
Use numbers instead of letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd with a conio or curses based
interface (see section Interfaces) presents a match list by
default numbered with letters. When the -N option is used
the match list is <br>
numbered with numbers. Regardless of the -N option one can
type a letter or numbers to make a selection from the list
of matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Use stdin/stdout
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When for some kind of reason the
conio or curses interface of wcd does not work one can fall
back to the stdin/stdout interface of wcd by using the -o
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-od, --to-stdout <br>
Dump all matches to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Quieter operation. Printing of the final match is
suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r DIR <br>
Remove directory and remove from the treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the directory is empty, wcd
will remove it, and try to remove it from the treedata
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rmtree DIR <br>
Recursively remove directory and remove from the treedata
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd will remove the directory
and all its sub directories and files, and remove the
directories from the treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s (re)Scan disk from $HOME
directory. If HOME is not defined the disk is scanned from
root directory /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The existing default treedata
file is overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default scan directory can
be overruled with environment variable &quot;WCDSCAN&quot;.
See section ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S PATH <br>
Scan directory tree from PATH and overwrite the default
treedata file. See also options -A, -s and -E. E.g. with
option -A you can create a default treedata file of your
<br>
choice. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -S / <br>
wcd -S /home -A /etc -A /usr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS/Windows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -S c:/ <br>
wcd -S c: -A d: -A \serverre</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the Windows versions one
can scan all shared directories of a Windows LAN server by
typing something like: &quot;wcd -S \servername&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+S PATH <br>
Scan disk from PATH and place relative paths in a relative
treedata file. This file is used by the -n and +n options of
wcd. E.g. &quot;wcd -n PATH src&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Do not strip tmp mount dir
&quot;/tmp_mnt&quot; (Unix only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd strips by default
&quot;/tmp_mnt/&quot; from the match. Directory
&quot;/tmp_mnt&quot; is used by the auto-mounter. This
behaviour can be turned off with the -t option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --ascii-tree <br>
Draw tree with ASCII characters. Use this option if line
drawing characters are not displayed properly in your
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ta, --alt-tree-nav <br>
Alternative way of navigation in the graphical tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default NCD style tree
layout the -Ta option disables jumping to unrelated
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In compact tree mode the
alternative mode makes navigation similar to navigation in
GUI file managers such as Windows Explorer or Linux KDE
Konqueror. Pressing Up and Down <br>
moves the selected folder one line up or down. Pressing Left
first folds the sub-folders and the next move left moves
really left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can switch on-the-fly
between default and alternative navigation by pressing
&lt;Shift-A&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When alternative navigation mode
is on, you will see an &quot;A&quot; in the lower right
corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TC, --center-tree <br>
Centered view in the graphical tree. The selected directory
stays in the middle of the screen. The centered mode can
also be switched on and off with key &lt;t&gt; in the
graphical <br>
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard non-centered
behaviour, which minimises tree movement, is the same as in
the original NCD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tc, --compact-tree <br>
By default the &rsquo;graphical&rsquo; tree is drawn the
same way as the original NCD on DOS did it. On DOS a
directory path could only be 66 characters in total. With
the deep directory <br>
structures of today the tree can become very wide. To
overcome this wcd can draw the tree in a compact way,
similar to most GUI file managers, with only one folder per
line. <br>
Use option -Tc or switch on-the-fly with the &lt;m&gt;
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Td, --cjk-width <br>
Legacy East-Asian CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) fonts
have certain characters and line drawing symbols with a
column width of 2, while the normal Unicode width for <br>
these characters is 1 column. For instance the Chinese CP936
raster font on Windows and the Simsun font. Use this option
for a correct outlining of the graphical tree when a <br>
legacy CJK font is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When CJK mode is on, you will
see a &quot;C&quot; in the lower right corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u USER <br>
Scan treedata file of another user based on USER, do not
scan your own default treedata file. See also section
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES for WCDUSERSHOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix/Cygwin the base
directory for user home directories is assumed to be
&quot;/home&quot;. Wcd will look for
&quot;/home/USER/.treedata.wcd&quot; and
&quot;/home/USER/.wcd/.treedata.wcd&quot;, in <br>
that order, and read the first one that exists and is
readable. On DOS/Windows the base directory for user home
directories is assumed to be &quot;\users&quot;, so wcd
tries to read <br>
&quot;\usersUSERreedata.wcd&quot; and
&quot;\usersUSER.wcdreedata.wcd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+u USER <br>
Read default treedata file of USER in addition to your own
treedata file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Display verbose messages. With this option wcd prints all
filters, bans and excludes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wild-match-only <br>
Wild matching only. Treat all matches as wild matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x PATH <br>
Exclude PATH from scanning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is used wcd
will exclude PATH and all its subdirectories when wcd is
scanning a disk. Wildcards are supported and matched against
absolute paths. Option -x <br>
can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -x &lt;path1&gt; -x
&lt;path2&gt; -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -x must be used in front
of any scan option (-s, -S, +S, -A, -E).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On DOS/Windows systems one must
specify the drive letter depending on if environment
variable HOME or WCDHOME is set. If HOME or WCDHOME is set
one needs to specify the drive <br>
letter. An example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -x c:/temp -S c:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise do not specify drive
letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -x /temp -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xf FILE <br>
Exclude all paths listed in FILE from scanning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is used wcd
will exclude all paths listed in FILE and all their
subdirectories when wcd is scanning a disk. Wildcards are
supported and they are matched <br>
against absolute paths; one path per line. Be aware that wcd
will not ignore leading or trailing blanks on a line,
because they are legal characters in a directory name. <br>
Option -xf can be used multiple times. When one wants to
exclude all banned paths from scanning one can do the
following (example for wcd on unix):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -xf ~/.ban.wcd -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards are supported. For
instance to exclude all your Subversion directories with
administrative files add a line with &quot;*/.svn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -xf must be used in front
of any scan option (-s, -S, +S, -A, -E).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --assume-yes <br>
Assume Yes on all queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd will not prompt the user
with yes/no questions, but assumes the user answers yes on
all questions. This can be used in combination with option
-rmtree. This option must <br>
be used in front of options that can lead to yes/no
questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z NUMBER <br>
Set maximum stack size to NUMBER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default size of the stack is
10. Stack operation can be turned off by setting the size to
0. This option must be used in front of any other stack
operations (-,+,=). <br>
Otherwise the size of the stack will be set back to the
default 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A correct command is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -z 50 -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new stack size will be 50,
wcd will go one directory back. A wrong command is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd - -z 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd goes one directory back, the
stack gets the default size 10. The -z 50 is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add this option as the first
option to your wcd alias or function. E.g. for the a POSIX
compatible shell this would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
wcd.exe -z 50 &quot;$@&quot; <br>
. ${WCDHOME:-${HOME}}/bin/wcd.go <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-[NUMBER] <br>
Push dir NUMBER of times. Default is one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go back a directory. Command
&quot;wcd -&quot; goes one directory back. To go more
directories back add a number to it. E.g. command &quot;wcd

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[NUMBER] <br>
Pop dir NUMBER of times. Default is one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go forward a directory. Command
&quot;wcd +&quot; goes one directory forward. To go more
directories forward add a number to it. E.g. command
&quot;wcd +2&quot;. The stack is cyclic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= Show stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option if you do not
know anymore how many times to push or pop. The stack is
printed and you can choose a number. The current place in
the stack is marked with an <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
The current working directory of a Unix shell can only be
changed by the builtin cd(1) command. Therefore the program
is always called by a function or an alias. The function or
<br>
alias sources a shell script (go-script) which is generated
by the wcd program. Wcd can only work after the function or
alias is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another important influence on
your installation is the definition of environment variables
HOME and WCDHOME. See section ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Install for POSIX type shells
<br>
For a POSIX shell (ksh, bash, zsh, etc.) on Unix, Linux,
Cygwin, or native MSYS add the following function to the
shell startup file (e.g. Bash uses
&quot;$HOME/.bashrc&quot;):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
&lt;PATH&gt;/wcd.exe &quot;$@&quot; <br>
. ${WCDHOME:-${HOME}}/bin/wcd.go <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace PATH with the location
where the wcd executable has been installed. Reload the
shell initialization files or start new shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The location of the go-script
&quot;wcd.go&quot; differs per shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd for DJGPP DOS bash and OS/2
bash require a different function. The go script is not
written in a directory &quot;bin&quot;, and if WCDHOME and
HOME are both not defined the go-script <br>
is written on c:/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS bash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
&lt;PATH&gt;/wcdbash.exe &quot;$@&quot; <br>
. ${WCDHOME:-${HOME:-&quot;c:&quot;}}/wcd.go <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/2 bash:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
&lt;PATH&gt;/wcdos2bash.exe &quot;$@&quot; <br>
. ${WCDHOME:-${HOME:-&quot;c:&quot;}}/wcd.go <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The WinZsh version of wcd
requires a bit different function. The go-script will never
be written in c:/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd () <br>
{ <br>
&lt;PATH&gt;/wcdwin32zsh.exe &quot;$@&quot; <br>
. ${WCDHOME:-${HOME}}/wcd.go <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See section FILES for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Install for C-alike shells (csh,
tcsh) <br>
Add the following alias to the shell startup file
&quot;$HOME/.cshrc&quot; or &quot;$HOME/.tcshrc&quot; :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ( ${?WCDHOME} ) then <br>
alias wcd &quot;&lt;PATH&gt;/wcd.exe * ; source
$WCDHOME/bin/wcd.go&quot; <br>
else <br>
alias wcd &quot;&lt;PATH&gt;/wcd.exe * ; source
$HOME/bin/wcd.go&quot; <br>
endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace PATH with the location
where the wcd executable has been installed. Reload the
shell initialization files or start a new shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows Command Prompt version
<br>
Unpack the zip file and add directory &quot;bin&quot; to
your environment variable PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Windows Command Prompt a
Windows program cannot change the current work directory,
but a .bat file can. The batch scrip &quot;wcd.bat&quot;
runs the wcd program which generates a new <br>
batch script &quot;wcdgo.bat&quot;. Then &quot;wcd.bat&quot;
runs &quot;wcdgo.bat&quot; which actually changes the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows VISTA and higher <br>
In a Windows VISTA and higher Command Prompt you may have
limited access to directories. To get access to more
directories you need administrator rights. You can get a
Command <br>
Prompt with administrator rights if you right click on the
Command Prompt icon and select Run as administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows PowerShell version <br>
Add the following function to your PowerShell user profile.
The location of this profile is stored in the $profile
variable. It is required that one of the environment
variables <br>
HOME or WCDHOME is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function wcd <br>
{ <br>
&lt;PATH&gt;456 <br>
&amp; $env:HOME168 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replace PATH with the location
where the wcd executable has been installed. Start a new
PowerShell. Wcd for PowerShell supports only the file system
provider. No other <br>
providers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/2 Command Prompt version <br>
In an OS/2 Command Prompt (cmd.exe) an OS/2-program
can&rsquo;t change the current work directory. That is why
wcd generates a command script &quot;wcdgo.cmd&quot; which
must be executed in the <br>
current shell. The script &quot;wcd.cmd&quot; first executes
&quot;wcdos2.exe&quot;, which creates the
&quot;wcdgo.cmd&quot; script. Then &quot;wcd.cmd&quot;
executes the &quot;wcdgo.cmd&quot; script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALIZATION <br>
LANG <br>
The primary language is selected with the environment
variable LANG. The LANG variable consists out of several
parts. The first part is in small letters the language code.
<br>
The second one is optional and is the country code in
capital letters, preceded with an underscore. There is also
an optional third part: character encoding, preceded with a
<br>
dot. A few examples for POSIX standard type shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export LANG=nl Dutch <br>
export LANG=nl_NL Dutch, The Netherlands <br>
export LANG=nl_BE Dutch, Belgium <br>
export LANG=es_ES Spanish, Spain <br>
export LANG=es_MX Spanish, Mexico <br>
export LANG=en_US.iso88591 English, USA, Latin-1
encoding</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a complete list of language
and country codes see the gettext(1) manual:
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Language-Codes&gt;
On Unix systems you can <br>
use to command locale(1) to get locale specific
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANGUAGE <br>
With the LANGUAGE environment variable you can specify a
priority list of languages, separated by colons. Wcd gives
preference to LANGUAGE over LANG. For instance, first <br>
Dutch and then German: &quot;LANGUAGE=nl:de&quot;. You have
to first enable localization, by setting LANG or LC_ALL to a
value other than C, before you can use a language priority
list <br>
through the LANGUAGE variable. See also the gettext(1)
manual:
&lt;http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#The-LANGUAGE-variable&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you select a language which
is not available you will get the standard English
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDLOCALEDIR <br>
With the environment variable WCDLOCALEDIR the LOCALEDIR
used during compilation and installation of wcd can be
overruled. LOCALEDIR is used by wcd with native language
<br>
support to find the language files. The GNU default value is
&quot;/usr/local/share/locale&quot;. By typing &quot;wcd
-V&quot; wcd will print the LOCALEDIR that is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have installed wcd in a
different directory than the default directory you may need
to set the environment variable WCDLOCALEDIR to point to the
locale directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for Windows cmd:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set
WCDLOCALEDIR=c:/my_prefix/share/locale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for a POSIX
shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
WCDLOCALEDIR=$HOME/share/locale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
When there are multiple directory matches wcd presents a
sorted list. The sorting depends on the locale settings. If
the environment LANG has been set the matches are sorted
<br>
like dictionaries or phone books are sorted in that
language. For instance dots and dashes are ignored, or
letters e with and without accent are equal, or upper and
lower <br>
case is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sorting gives preference to
environment variable LC_COLLATE over LANG. If you make
LC_COLLATE equal to &quot;C&quot; or &quot;POSIX&quot;,
locale sorting is turned off. For instance if you <br>
want Dutch language, but not Dutch sorting, you can do
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export LANG=nl_NL <br>
export LC_COLLATE=C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE <br>
With regard to character encoding Wcd will give preference
to variable LC_CTYPE over LANG. For instance to set
character encoding to UTF-8 the following environment
setting <br>
can be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL <br>
All locale environment variables that start with LC_ are
overruled by the environment variable LC_ALL if it is
defined. Wcd gives preference to LC_ALL over LC_COLLATE and
<br>
LC_CTYPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS CODE PAGES <br>
There are two groups of code pages: DOS code pages (OEM) and
Windows code pages (ANSI). The default encoding for Windows,
when configured with Western regional settings, is ANSI <br>
CP1252. Windows programs, for instance notepad, use this
default system ANSI code page. The Windows console uses by
default an OEM code page (CP437 or CP850) for compatibility
<br>
with DOS programs. If you use a DOS version of wcd in a
Windows console it will work, because of the DOS code page.
But the DOS version of wcd lacks support for long directory
<br>
names and network drives on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Windows version of wcd is a
native Windows program and will use the Windows system ANSI
code page. So on a Western regional Windows it will use code
page CP1252 for directory <br>
names and messages. In order to get consistent output,
independent of the active code page, all Windows versions of
Wcd translate ANSI output to Unicode output in the Command
<br>
Prompt and PowerShell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The console raster font only
supports the original OEM code page installed with Windows,
so you have to change the console&rsquo;s font to true type
Lucida Console to make Unicode (and <br>
ANSI) letters appear correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Unicode versions of Wcd
prior to version 5.2.0 use plain ANSI output. For these
older versions the code page of the console has to be made
equal to the system code page <br>
(changed to 1252) to make wcd for Windows work properly with
special characters such as accented characters or the Euro
symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Windows system code page can
be changed via the Control Panel regional options. The
Windows console code page is changed with the
&quot;chcp&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you type &quot;wcd
-V&quot;, the actual character encoding used by wcd is
shown. Type the command &quot;chcp&quot; to display the
active code page of the Windows console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNICODE <br>
Wcd has optional support for Unicode. To see if wcd was
built with Unicode support type &quot;wcd -V&quot;. If your
terminal/console and font supports it, you should see the
Euro symbol <br>
and Chinese characters (meaning: &quot;Chinese&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd has been soft converted to
Unicode. In its core wcd handles all data as a stream of
bytes. Only the lines printed to screen are on the fly
converted to Unicode wide <br>
characters. Wcd fully relies on libc functions and has no
UTF-8 specific code. See also
&lt;http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd has optional support for
Unicode matching with normalisation. To find out whether Wcd
has normalisation support type &quot;wcd -V&quot;. Wcd with
Unicode normalization support will <br>
match Unicode names based on compatible equivalence. Without
Unicode normalization support, names are matched when they
are binary equivalent. See also <br>

&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_normalization&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 on Unix/Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to view UTF-8
characters your console/terminal also needs to support
UTF-8. The xterm version that comes with XFree86 4.0 or
higher includes UTF-8 support. To activate <br>
it, start xterm(1) in a UTF-8 locale and use a font with
iso10646-1 encoding, for instance with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8 xterm -u8
-fn
&rsquo;-Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modern distributions of
GNU/Linux support UTF-8 by default. Other multi-byte
character encodings should also work, but that has not been
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd assumes that the treedata
files are encoded in the locale character encoding. There
are no Byte Order Marks written to treedata files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-16 on Windows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows Unicode is supported
in all versions of PowerShell, and in Windows Command Prompt
on Windows 7 (or higher). Unicode also works in Take Command
or TCC/LE made by JP <br>
Software, which can be used on older Windows versions
(XP/Vista).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows all the directory
names on disk are encoded in UTF-16 Unicode. For non-Unicode
Windows programs the Unicode characters are translated to
the default ANSI code page. <br>
For characters that are not part of the regional setting
this translation is not possible and non-Unicode programs
print a question mark or a wrong character instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wcd with Unicode support will
read the UTF-16 encoded directory names and converts them
internally to UTF-8. All treedata files are encoded in UTF-8
and not compatible with the <br>
non-Unicode version of Wcd. Wcd will create a go-script
encoded in UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All versions of Windows
PowerShell are able to run scripts encoded in UTF-8,
provided there is an UTF-8 BOM in the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since Windows 7 it is possible
in Windows Command Prompt to change directory with a batch
script to a directory with Unicode letters in the name. The
directory name needs to be <br>
encoded in UTF-8, and the batch script must not have a BOM.
The active code page of the Command Prompt needs to be set
to 65001 (UTF-8) prior to the cd command. Wcd for Command
<br>
Prompt will create such a go script &quot;wcdgo.bat&quot;.
It first changes the code page to 65001, then changes
directory, and finally sets the code page back to the
original code page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You need to set the font to True
Type Lucida Console (not raster font) when letters
don&rsquo;t appear correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The non-Unicode Windows version
of Wcd can read Unicode treedata files since version 5.2.0,
provided there is a Byte Order Mark (BOM) in the file (see
<br>
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark&gt;), but
it can&rsquo;t change to directories with Unicode letters in
the name that are not part of the default system ANSI code
page. The <br>
Unicode Windows version of wcd writes a BOM in the UTF-8
encoded treedata files since version 5.2.0, which makes them
also readable by notepad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 on Cygwin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cygwin supports Unicode since
version 1.7. The Cygwin layer takes care that the Windows
UTF-16 Unicode names are converted to UTF-8. So programs,
like wcd, do not need to be <br>
aware of this and can operate using UTF-8 encoding as on
Unix/Linux. Set character encoding to UTF-8 with the LANG or
LC_CTYPE environment variable. You may need to rescan your
<br>
drives. You need to set the font to True Type Lucida Console
(not raster font) if you use the default Cygwin console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Cygwin version behaves
exactly as the Unix version of wcd. There is no BOM written
in the treedata files, and it is assumed they are encoded in
the Cygwin locale character <br>
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
If the environment variable WCDHOME is set wcd will use
WCDHOME instead of HOME. All &quot;*.wcd&quot; files are
text files. They can be edited with a text editor. The
Windows Command <br>
Prompt version of wcd behaves as the DOS version. The Cygwin
version of wcd behaves as the Unix version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd.exe <br>
The program. In Unix shells the program is always called by
a function or alias, because the current working directory
of a Unix shell can only be changed by the builtin cd <br>
command. See also section INSTALLATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default treedata file <br>
This is the default treedata file where wcd searches for
matches. If it is not readable wcd will create a new
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS: reedata.wcd or
%HOME%reedata.wcd <br>
Unix: $HOME/.treedata.wcd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extra treedata file <br>
An optional extra treedata file. If it exists and is
readable wcd will try to find matches in this file also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS: \xtra.wcd or
%HOME%\xtra.wcd <br>
Unix: $HOME/.extra.wcd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ban file <br>
In this optional file wcd places banned paths. See option

<br>
Unix: $HOME/.alias.wcd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stack file <br>
In this file wcd stores its stack. The drive letter can be
changed with the -d option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS: c:ck.wcd or %HOME%ck.wcd
<br>
Unix: $HOME/.stack.wcd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the stack file can
be changed with environment variable WCDSTACKFILE. See
section ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">go-script <br>
This is the shell script which wcd.exe creates each time. It
is sourced via a function or an alias. The drive letter can
be changed with the -d option. For history reasons <br>
it is placed by default in &quot;$HOME/bin&quot; on Unix
systems. The directory of this file can be changed with the
option -G.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS bash: c:/wcd.go or
$HOME/wcd.go <br>

OS/2 bash: c:/wcd.go or $HOME/wcd.go <br>
Unix: $HOME/bin/wcd.go</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relative treedata file <br>
Text file with relative paths from DIR. See options +S, -n
and +n. tdata.wcd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOS: &lt;path&gt; <br>
Unix: &lt;path&gt;/.rtdata.wcd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
HOME <br>
Wcd uses by default environment variable HOME to determine
where to store its files. See also section FILES. This can
be overruled with environment variable WCDHOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME also defines where to start
scanning the disk when option -s is used. This can be
overruled with the environment variable WCDSCAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the Unix, Cygwin, Windows
PowerShell, WinZsh and MSYS version it is required that HOME
or WCDHOME is set. For the other versions of wcd the use of
these variables is <br>
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If HOME is set on DOS/Windows,
wcd will place all its files (treedata.wcd, extra.wcd,
alias.wcd, ban.wcd, wcd.go) in directory HOME. The behaviour
of wcd is then equal to the <br>
Unix version of wcd. Wcd will scan the disk default from
HOME. Drives will not be automatically scanned by changing
to them. You need to tell wcd explicitly. E.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wcd -S c: -A d: -A e:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matching of directories is now
global over all scanned drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDHOME <br>
Environment variable WCDHOME can be used to change the
location of wcd&rsquo;s files. If both HOME and WCDHOME are
set, WCDHOME will be used instead of HOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In wcd versions prior to 5.1.5
WCDHOME also changed the default scan directory. This has
changed. Since version 5.1.5 WCDHOME does not change the
default scan directory. See <br>
option -s. From version 5.1.5, use environment WCDSCAN to
overrule the default scan directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example for DOS, Windows, OS/2
Command Prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set WCDHOME=C:Users\rwin24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for POSIX type
shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDSCAN <br>
Use environment variable WCDSCAN to overrule the default
scan directory HOME. Define a colon separated list (Unix) to
define more than one directory. On DOS/Windows make the <br>
list semi-colon separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples for DOS, Windows, OS/2

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for POSIX type
shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
WCDSCAN=&quot;$HOME:/projectdisk/projectX&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for Csh type
shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv WCDSCAN
&quot;$HOME:/projectdisk/projectX&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDFILTER <br>
Specify filters with environment variable WCDFILTER. All
directories that do not match the filter(s) are ignored. A
list can be specified by separating filters by the shell
<br>
path separator. Similar as specifying the PATH variable. The
case sensitivity is mandated by the Operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for DOS, Windows,
OS/2 Command Prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set WCDFILTER=projects;doc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for POSIX type

shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv WCDFILTER
&quot;projects:doc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDBAN <br>
The paths specified with environment WCDBAN will be banned
by wcd. See also option -b. Specify a list of paths
separated by shell PATH separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDEXCLUDE <br>
The paths specified with environment WCDEXCLUDE will be
excluded by wcd. See also options -x and -xf. Specify a list
of paths separated by shell PATH separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for DOS, Windows,
OS/2 Command Prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set
WCDEXCLUDE=*/windows;*/temp;*CVS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example for POSIX type

shells:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv WCDEXCLUDE
&quot;/dev:/tmp:*CVS&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDUSERSHOME <br>
Set the base of user&rsquo;s home directories. On
DOS/Windows the default value is &quot;\users&quot;. On
Unix/Cygwin the default value is &quot;/home&quot;. This
variable is used to scan treedata <br>
files of other users. See also options -u and +u. In verbose
mode wcd will print all filters, bans and excludes. See
option -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WCDSTACKFILE <br>
Wcd gives preference to WCDSTACKFILE over the default stack
file name (see section FILES). With this variable each shell
(or used terminal emulator) can have its private <br>
stack of used directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a unique time based
YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS file for each opened interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
WCDSTACKFILE=$HOME/.wcd/stack.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a stack per xterm(1), use
the xterm WINDOWID environment variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
WCDSTACKFILE=$HOME/.wcd/stack.$WINDOWID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For GNU screen(1), to use stack
per screen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
WCDSTACKFILE=$HOME/.wcd/stack.$WINDOW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINFO <br>
If the environment variable TERMINFO is defined, wcd with
ncurses interface checks for a local terminal definition
before checking in the standard place. This is useful if
<br>
terminal definitions are not on a standard place. Often used
standard places are &quot;/usr/lib/terminfo&quot; and
&quot;/usr/share/terminfo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDC_RESTORE_SCREEN <br>
Wcd with PDCurses interface recognizes the environment
variable PDC_RESTORE_SCREEN. If this environment variable is
set, PDCurses will take a copy of the contents of the <br>
screen at the time that wcd is started; when wcd exits, the
screen will be restored. An example for Windows Command
Prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set PDC_RESTORE_SCREEN=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows allows only a small
buffer to be saved. So it is not always possible to restore
everything. Some garbage data may be printed in the console
after wcd exists if you <br>
have set a large buffer width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL <br>
Printing of &quot;#!$SHELL&quot; on the first line of the
go-script for POSIX type shell or C shell is needed for 8
bit characters. Some shells otherwise think that the
go-script is a <br>
binary file and will not source it. In Cygwin Bash the
variable SHELL must be set in environment using the
&quot;export&quot; command, otherwise wcd can&rsquo;t read
the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASH <br>
Wcd for DOS bash uses $BASH instead of $SHELL, because
$SHELL points to the DOS command shell. One may need to
define $BASH with an &quot;export&quot; command, otherwise
wcd can&rsquo;t read <br>
the variable.</p>
