Impressive - presentation tool with eye candy
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>impressive</b> [OPTIONS...] FILES...
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Impressive is a simple presentation program that displays slideshows of image
  files (JPEG, PNG, TIFF and BMP) or PDF documents. Rendering is done via
  OpenGL, which allows for some &quot;eye candy&quot; effects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A somewhat-modern GPU (graphics processing unit) supporting OpenGL 2.0 or OpenGL
  ES 2.0 and appropriate drivers is required to run Impressive.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>-a </b><i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i> or <b>--auto </b><i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Automatically advance to the next page after
  the given number of seconds. Together with the <b>-w</b> option (described
  below), this can be used to create automatic slideshows.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-A </b><i>&lt;X&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;Y&gt;</i> or <b>--aspect
  </b><i>&lt;X&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;Y&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the display aspect ratio. Normally,
  Impressive assumes that the pixel aspect ratio is 1:1 (square pixels),
  regardless of the display resolution that has been set up. If a resolution has
  been selected that doesn't match the display's aspect ratio, the screen will
  be distorted. To overcome this, this option may be used to manually specify
  the display aspect ratio, e.g. &quot;-A 16:9&quot;. Note that this option has
  no effect if the MuPDF backend is used for rendering.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-b</b> or <b>--noback</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Disables background rendering. By default,
  Impressive will pre-render all pages in a separate background thread while the
  presentation runs. If this option is specified, it will instead render all
  pages immediately on startup. This option has no effect if caching is disabled
  ( <b>--cache none</b>, see below).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-B </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i> or <b>--boxfade </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of the
  highlight box fade-in/fade-out animation. Default value: 100 ms.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-c </b><i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> or <b>--cache </b><i>&lt;mode&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the page cache mode to use. Valid
  options are:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>none</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Disables page caching altogether, only the
  current and the following page will be kept in RAM. Jumping between pages will
  be very slow, because Impressive will need to render the requested pages on
  the fly. In addition, the overview page won't be complete until every page has
  been shown at least once.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>memory</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Caches all page images in memory. This is the
  fastest method, but it requires very large amounts of memory (about 3 MiB per
  page at 1024x768 resolution).</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>compressed</b> or <b>z</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Caches all page images in memory as well, but
  in compressed form. This will be a little slower than <b>memory</b> mode, but
  on pages with uniform backgrounds, this will easily reduce the required amount
  of RAM by a factor of 20.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>disk</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Like <b>memory</b>, but uses a temporary file
  rather than memory for storage. This is the default.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>persistent</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Uses a permanent cache file for caching. This
  file will not be deleted when Impressive quits and will be reused on
  subsequent invocations. The default name for the cache file is derived like
  the names for Info Scripts (see below for an explanation), but with a
  <b>.cache</b> file name extension instead of <b>.info</b>. This method is a
  little bit slower than <b>disk</b> mode, but the time span until the overview
  page is fully populated will be significantly decreased if Impressive is ran
  again with the same input files and options.</div>
The mode name may be abbreviated at will, down to one character. Thus,
  <b>--cache persistent</b>, <b>-c persist</b> and even <b>-cp</b> are all
  synonyms.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-C </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>[:<i>&lt;X&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;Y&gt;</i>] or
  <b>--cursor </b> <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>[:<i>&lt;X&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;Y&gt;</i>]
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option can be used to specify an image
  that shall be used as a (software) mouse cursor instead of the normal
  (hardware) one. It can either be a name of an image file (typically a
  transparent .png) or one of the special values &quot; <b>-</b>&quot; (dash) or
  &quot; <b>default</b>&quot;, both of which select a built-in cursor image. On
  platforms that do not support a hardware cursor, this default cursor will also
  be used as a default if this option is not used.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If the name of an external file is specified, the position of the hotspot (the
  pixel inside the cursor where the actual mouse position is located) can be
  specified as well, for example: <b>--cursor mycursor.png:2,4</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--clock</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is enabled, the current time
  will be shown instead of the elapsed time if time display is activated (with
  the <b>T</b> key in the default control configuration). Compatible with the
  <b>-M</b> option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--control-help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option will output a short help screen of
  how the control configuration (keyboard and mouse bindings) work, along with a
  list of all recognized events and actions and a dump of the current bindings
  (which is the default configuration if no other <b>-e</b>/<b>--bind</b> or
  <b>-E</b>/ <b>--controls</b> options precede this option). After that,
  Impressive will exit; no presentation will be started.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-d </b><i>&lt;time&gt;</i> or <b>--duration </b><i>&lt;time&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the expected run time of the
  presentation. The <i>time</i> parameter can be either a number of seconds or a
  human-readable time like <b>1:23</b> (1 minute and 23 seconds), <b>4:56h</b>
  (4 hours and 56 minutes), <b>3m45s</b> (3 minutes and 45 seconds), <b>5m</b>
  (5 minutes) or <b>1:23:45</b> (1 hour, 23 minutes and 45 seconds).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If an expected duration is specified, Impressive will show a semi-transparent
  green progress bar at the lower edge of the screen, indicating how much time
  has already passed. If the time is up, the bar will occupy the whole edge and
  fade to yellow (at 125% of the expected time) to red (at 150% or more).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-D </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i> or <b>--mousedelay </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the time (in milliseconds) the mouse
  cursor is shown in fullscreen mode if it is not moved. There are two special
  values: 0 (zero) shows the mouse cursor permanently, 1 (one) hides it
  completely. The default value is 3000 ms.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--darkness </b><i>&lt;percentage&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies how much the screen shall become
  darker when using highlight boxes or spotlight mode. The value is specified in
  percent, with 25 being the default. A value of zero would mean no darkening at
  all (the screen would just be blurred slightly, and desaturated if the
  graphics hardware supports it), and a value of 100 would make everything but
  the highlighted parts of the screen black.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-e </b><i>&lt;bindings&gt;</i> or <b>--bind </b><i>&lt;bindings&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Configures keyboard or mouse bindings. For the
  syntax of the argument, refer to the Control Configuration section of the
  manual.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-E </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> or <b>--controls </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Loads a configuration file for keyboard and
  mouse bindings. For the syntax of these files, refer to the Control
  Configuration section of the manual.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--evtest</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is specified, Impressive will
  not start a normal presentation, but instead enter the so-called &quot;Event
  Test Mode&quot; after the display has been initialized. In this mode,
  Impressive will simply capture all keyboard and mouse events and display the
  name of the last event on the screen. In addition, events will be logged to
  standard output. This mode helps with determining the event names for each key
  when creating a custom control configuration (see the Control Configuration
  section).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-f</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the window/fullscreen mode Impressive
  shall start up with. This option can be specified multiple times; each times
  it is found, the next of the three options is selected, in the follwing order:
  (1.)True <b>fullscreen mode</b>, including setting the video mode. This is the
  default mode. (2.) <b>Windowed</b> mode, where Impressive runs in a standard
  window. (3.)&quot; <b>Fake-fullscreen</b>&quot; mode, where fullscreen is
  emulated by uding a window without border that fills the whole screen. Setting
  the display resolution is not possible in this mode. Each of these modes has a
  corresponding long option that enables it directly ( <b>--fullscreen</b>,
  <b>--windowed</b> and <b>--fake-fullscreen</b>).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--fullscreen</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Starts Impressive in fullscreen mode (the
  default). See the discussion of the <b>-f</b> option for details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--fake-fullscreen</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Starts Impressive in &quot;fake
  fullscreen&quot; mode. See the discussion of the <b>-f</b> option for
  details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-F </b><i>&lt;file&gt;</i> or <b>--font </b><i>&lt;file&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Impressive uses some kind of text OSD to
  overlay the current page number and title (if available) on the overview page.
  This option can be used to specify a TrueType font file (.ttf) to use for the
  OSD. If the path specified doesn't directly point to a useable font file,
  Impressive will try to search the system font directories. It assumes that all
  fonts are stored below <b>/usr/share/fonts</b>, <b>/usr/local/share/fonts</b>
  or <b>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF</b> for this purpose (the latter one is
  useful for Mac OS X systems specifically). If this option is not specified,
  any of <b>DejaVuSans.ttf</b> or <b>Vera.ttf</b> (the typical file name of
  Bitstream Vera Sans) will be used as a default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-g
  </b><i>&lt;width&gt;</i>x<i>&lt;height&gt;</i>[+<i>&lt;posX&gt;</i>+<i>&lt;posY&gt;</i>]
  or <b>--geometry
  </b><i>&lt;width&gt;</i>x<i>&lt;height&gt;</i>[+<i>&lt;posX&gt;</i>+
  <i>&lt;posY&gt;</i>]
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the screen size or resolution Impressive
  shall use (in pixels). If <b>xrandr</b> is installed, the default screen size
  for fullscreen mode is the current screen resolution; on other platforms,
  Impressive uses the highest resolution available to the graphics system. If a
  standard resolution cannot be determined, the default is 1024x768 pixels. This
  is also the default for windowed mode.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Furthermore, if the additional parameters <i>posX</i> and <i>posY</i> are
  present, they specify the position of the upper-left corner of the window
  (relative to the upper-left corner of the desktop), in pixels, for windowed
  and fake-fullscreen mode. The values are ignored in &quot;true&quot;
  fullscreen mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-G </b><i>&lt;gamma&gt;</i>[:<i>&lt;blacklevel&gt;</i>] or <b>--gamma
  </b><i>&lt;gamma&gt;</i>[: <i>&lt;blacklevel&gt;</i>]
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets up the startup gamma and (optional) black
  level value. The black level is the original image's intensity level (0...254)
  that is to be mapped to black in Impressive's output. Note that gamma and
  black level adjustments may be unavailable or constrained on some
  systems.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h</b> or <b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is specified, Impressive writes
  a short command line help screen to standard output and does not start a
  presentation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-H</b> or <b>--half-screen</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option makes Impressive show the overview
  page and OSD elements on the right half of the screen only. The overview page
  will only show the left half of the slides as previews. Using a multi-monitor
  setup with a wide virtual screen and specially crafted slides (e.g. those that
  can be generated with LaTeX's <b>beamer</b> class), this makes it possible to
  have presenter's notes on the second screen.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Note that transitions and animations are still operating on the whole screen,
  making some of them (like <b>PagePeel</b>) look ugly. Impressive also disables
  the overview zoom animation in half-screen mode; it can be re-enabled by
  explicitly setting it to another value with a later command line option (
  <b>--zoomtime</b>).
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Another limitation is that the allocation of the screen halves (slides left,
  overview right) is fixed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-i </b><i>&lt;page&gt;</i> or <b>--initialpage </b><i>&lt;page&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the page number to start with. The
  default value is 1 (start with the first page). If another value is specified,
  the page shown by Impressive right after initialization is not the first one
  of the PDF or image list. Additionally, pre-rendering (if enabled) will also
  start at the specified page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-I </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> or <b>--script </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Overrides automatic derivation of the info
  script filename and specifies a script file directly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--invert</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option makes Impressive invert the colors
  of each page, turning black to white and vice-versa. Note that it is a full
  RGB inversion, so it will, for example, turn dark green to light purple (and
  vice-versa) too.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-k</b> or <b>--auto-progress</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option makes Impressive show a progress
  bar at the bottom of the screen, visualizing the timeout on pages that have
  one (either specified as a page property or using the <b>--auto</b>
  command-line option). Nothing is done on pages that don't have a timeout.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The progress bar shown by this option takes precedence over the
  <b>--duration</b> or <b>--page-progress</b> bars: If one of these options is
  specified as well, the timeout progress bar will be shown on pages with a
  timeout, and the other progress bar will be shown on pages without one.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-l</b> or <b>--listtrans</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is specified, Impressive writes
  a list of all available transition classes to standard output and does not
  start a presentation. Transitions that are enabled by default are marked with
  a star ( <b>*</b>) left of the class name.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-L </b><i>&lt;spec&gt;</i> or <b>--layout </b><i>&lt;spec&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the OSD layout. Read below for an
  explanation of this option</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--min-box-size </b><i>&lt;pixels&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option sets the minimum size of a
  highlight box, in pixels. Boxes that are not this many pixels wide and high
  are rejected in order to prevent accidental creation of highlight boxes. The
  default value for this is 30 pixels.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-M</b> or <b>--minutes</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is set, Impressive will show
  the on-screen timer (activated with the [T] key) only with 1 minute
  resolution. By default, it will show a timer with 1 second resolution.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--noblur</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default, Impressive uses a fragment shader
  to blur and desaturate the image when in highlight box or spotlight mode. This
  is usually the faster and nicer-looking method; however, some very old
  hardware implementations can't deal with that shader and fall back to an
  unusably slow software implementation. Impressive tries to detect scenarios
  where this would happen and automatically falls back to a different
  implementation.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
There might be situations where this machanism fails and Impressive tries to use
  the non-functional shader anyway. In these cases, the <b>--noblur</b> option
  can be used to enforce the fallback implementation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--noclicks</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is enabled, switching to the
  previous or next page with the left and right mouse buttons is deactivated.
  The keyboard shortcuts are unaffected from this.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this option only works as intended when the default controls are used.
  If the <b>-e</b>/<b>--bind</b> or <b>-E</b>/<b>--controls</b> options have
  been used, <b>--noclicks</b> might not have the intended effect.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--nologo</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option disables the Impressive logo and
  version number display. Instead, the loading screen will be just black or, if
  background rendering is disabled, only the progress bar will be visible.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-o </b><i>&lt;directory&gt;</i> or <b>--output </b><i>&lt;directory&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Do not display the presentation, but render it
  into a series of PNG image files inside the specified directory. The images
  will be generated in the current resolution as specified by the <b>-g</b>
  option. This option is useful if the presentation is to be given on on a
  foreign PC with an old, broken or otherwise problematic Xpdf installation: By
  generating images of the PDF pages, is is made sure that no rendering bugs
  will happen on the target system.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-O </b><i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> or <b>--autooverview </b><i>&lt;mode&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Enables or disables automatic derivation of
  whether a page shall or shall not be shown on the overview page. This feature
  is based on the fact that some LaTeX presentation packages tag all pages with
  a title (that can be read by Impressive with the help of <b>pdftk</b>), except
  those that contain multiple reveal steps.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The following modes are available:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>off</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Disables automatic overview mode. All pages
  will be shown on the overview page by default. This is also the default
  setting.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>first</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">All pages with a PDF title will be shown on
  the overview page. The purpose is to show the <b>initial</b> state of
  multi-step slides on the overview page.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>last</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">All pages <b>before</b> a page with a PDF
  title will be shown on the overview page. The purpose is to show the
  <b>final</b> state of multi-step slides on the overview page.</div>
Again, the mode may be abbreviated arbitrarily, down to one character, just like
  with the <b>-c</b> option above..</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p </b><i>&lt;start&gt;</i>-<i>&lt;end&gt;</i> or <b>--pages
  </b><i>&lt;start&gt;</i>- <i>&lt;end&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Using this option, the range of the page
  displayed can be narrowed down. The presentation will start at the first page
  in the range. All pages outside of the range will not be shown on the overview
  page and will not be cached. However, they can be entered manually when
  cycling through the presentation. Due to the fact that these pages are
  uncached, preparation of the display will take considerably longer.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-P </b><i>&lt;path&gt;</i> or <b>--gspath </b><i>&lt;path&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option can be used to override the Xpdf /
  GhostScript path autodetection. The full path to the executable of either
  GhostScript ( <b>gs</b> or <b>gs.exe</b>) or Xpdf's <b>pdftoppm</b> utility
  must be specified.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-q</b> or <b>--page-progress</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is enabled, Impressive will
  show a light-blue semi-transparent progress bar at the lower edge of the
  screen that shows the position inside the presentation, i.e. the relation
  between the current page number and the total number of pages. Note that this
  progress bar will not be shown if the duration progress bar ( <b>-d</b>
  option) is also enabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-Q</b> or <b>--autoquit</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is specified, Impressive quits
  automatically when trying to navigate to the page after the last page or the
  page before the first page.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This option does not have any effect if <b>--wrap</b> is used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-r </b><i>&lt;n&gt;</i> or <b>--rotate </b><i>&lt;n&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Display all pages rotated by <i>n</i>x90
  degrees clockwise. Try <b>-r 1</b> or <b>-r 3</b> if there are problems with
  PDFs generated by LaTeX on some Xpdf or GhostScript versions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s</b> or <b>--scale</b> <i>(image input only)</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If a directory with image files is used as
  input, Impressive will scale down images that are too big for the screen. But
  by default, it will not scale up smaller images to fit the screen; it will
  leave a black border instead. This option overrides this setting and enables
  upscaling of smaller images.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-s</b> or <b>--supersample</b> <i>(PDF input only)</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch enables antialiasing by 4x
  supersampling instead of the normal multisampling method used by Xpdf or
  GhostScript. While this usually degrades both visual quality and performance,
  it may be necessary for circumventing white strips or moire-like patterns in
  gradients.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-S </b><i>&lt;pixels&gt;</i> or <b>--fontsize </b><i>&lt;pixels&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option sets the size, in pixels, of the
  OSD font. The default value is 14.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--spot-radius </b><i>&lt;pixels&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option sets the initial radius of the
  spotlight, in pixels. The default value is 64.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-t </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i> or <b>--transition
  </b><i>&lt;trans1[,trans2...]&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Using this switch, the set of transitions
  Impressive will randomly draw at page changes can be specified. If only one
  transition class is specified, this class will be used for all pages that do
  not have another transition explicitly assigned in their page properties.
  Multiple transitions have to be separated by commas; they will be used in
  random order. The <b>-l</b> option can be used to get a list of available
  transitions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-T </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i> or <b>--transtime </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of page
  transitions. 0 (zero) disables transitions altogether. Default value: 1000
  ms.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--tracking</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option enables time tracking mode. In
  this mode, a report of all pages visited with their display duration, enter
  and leave times will be written to standard output. This can be very useful
  when preparing presentations.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-u </b><i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i> or <b>--poll </b><i>&lt;seconds&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is specified, the source file
  or directory will be checked for changes regularly. If a change in the input
  PDF file or any of the image files in the input image directory is detected,
  the page cache will be flushed and the current page as well as the info script
  will be reloaded. The current page's transition will be shown between the old
  and the new version of the page.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The new PDF file must have at least as much pages as the old one; also, it
  should have the same aspect ratio. If the input is a directory, image files
  must not have disappeared.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v</b> or <b>--verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option makes Impressive more verbose,
  i.e. it will print slightly more informational messages than usual.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-V </b><i>&lt;pixels&gt;</i> or <b>--overscan </b><i>&lt;pixels&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">PDF files often contain tiny amounts of white
  borders around the edges which look bad in screen presentations. To eliminate
  this problem, Impressive uses &quot;overscan&quot;: PDF files will not be
  rendered to fit the screen size exactly, but they will be rendered a bit
  larger so that the (possibly broken) borders can be cropped off. The amount of
  overscan, in screen pixels, can be set with this option. The default value is
  3 pixels, which should remove borders in most presentations at most common
  screen resolutions without cropping the pages too much.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-w</b> or <b>--wrap</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is set, Impressive will
  &quot;wrap&quot; over to the first page after the last page. In other words,
  advancing to the next page at the end of the presentation will restart the
  whole presentation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-W</b> or <b>--nowheel</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">By default, it is possible to change pages
  using the mouse wheel. This option disables this behavior, which can be useful
  to prevent spurious page changes if the mouse wheel is likely to be moved by
  accident.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Note that this option only works as intended when the default controls are used.
  If the <b>-e</b>/<b>--bind</b> or <b>-E</b>/<b>--controls</b> options have
  been used, <b>--noclicks</b> might not have the intended effect.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--windowed</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Starts Impressive in windowed mode. See the
  discussion of the <b>-f</b> option for details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-x</b> or <b>--fade</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option enables a smooth fade-in effect at
  the start of the presentation and a fade-out effect just before Impressive
  quits.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-X</b> or <b>--shuffle</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this option is enabled, the input files
  will be shuffled into random order before starting the presentation. The
  individual pages of PDF input files will stay in their original order, though,
  so this option is mainly useful for image presentations.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-y</b> or <b>--auto-auto</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This option can be used together with
  <b>--duration</b> to have Impressive compute a page timeout (as with the
  <b>--auto</b> option) automatically. This results in a presentation that runs
  automatically, displaying each slide for the same time, so that the desired
  total duration will be reached (almost) exactly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-z </b><i>&lt;factor&gt;</i> or <b>--zoom </b><i>&lt;factor&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the zoom factor that is used in zoom
  mode. It must be an integer value of at least 2. The default value is 2. Note
  that it might not be possible to get high-quality zooming for large zoom
  factors due to hardware restrictions. Also, note that if the hardware doesn't
  support non-power-of-two textures or if the <b>-e</b> option is used, the
  number must be a power of two.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-Z </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i> or <b>--zoomtime </b><i>&lt;ms&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of the
  overview page zoom-in/zoom-out effects. Default value: 250 ms.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--cachefile </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Activates persistent cache mode and specifies
  the name of the cache file to use.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
Following the options, the input file name(s) must be specified. Recognized file
  types are PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP and PGM/PPM. If the name of a directory is
  put on the command line, all recognized image files (no PDF files!) in this
  directory will be played in alphanumeric order (case-insensitive).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, Impressive can use a text file containing a list of files or
  directories to show: This text file must contain at most one file name per
  line; every character after a hash sign ( <b>#</b>) is treated as a comment
  and will be ignored. If such a comment is put on the same line as an image
  file name, it will be used as the page's title. List file names must be
  prefixed with an at sign ( <b>@</b>) on the command line, e.g. <b>impressive
  @my_list_file</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Impressive will also expand wild-card characters ( <b>*</b> and <b>?</b>) if
  this isn't already done by the shell, but apart from that, it will not reorder
  the arguments. Thus, it will show the documents in the order specified at the
  command line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LAYOUT_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LAYOUT_OPTIONS">
  LAYOUT OPTIONS</a></h1>
The OSD layout option ( <b>-L</b>/<b>--layout</b>) accepts a string with
  comma-separated <b></b><i>key</i>=<i>value</i> pairs. The following keywords
  are recognized:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>alpha</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The opacity of the OSD text, either as a
  floating-point value between 0 and 1 or a percentage between 2 and 100.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>margin</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The distance (in pixels) of the OSD text to
  the screen borders.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>time</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The position of the timer.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>title</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The position of the page title in overview
  mode.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>page</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The position of the page number in overview
  mode.</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>status</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The position of the status line.</div>
The position specifications are composed by one character that indicates whether
  the text shall be displayed at the top ( <b>T</b>) or bottom (<b>B</b>) edge
  of the screen and one character that indicates whether it shall appear on the
  left ( <b>L</b>), on the right (<b>R</b>) or centered (<b>C</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, the default OSD layout equals the following option string:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> -L margin=16,alpha=1,time=TR,title=BL,page=BR,status=TL</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">
  EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The following examples illustrate some typical command lines. They assume that
  Impressive can be run by simply typing &quot; <b>impressive</b>&quot; on the
  command line. Depending on how Impressive is installed, this has to be
  substituted with the actual way to run Impressive (e.g. &quot; <b>python
  ~/impressive/impressive_dev.py</b>&quot; for a fresh SVN checkout).
  Furthermore, the file &quot; <b>demo.pdf</b>&quot; is used as the document to
  show here; obviously this has to be replaced by the path to the actual PDF
  file too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the simplest case, Impressive is run directly with the name of the file to
  show and no further parameters. This will start a full-screen presentation
  with all settings at their defaults:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> impressive demo.pdf</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To just quickly check a slide deck, it might make sense to run Impressive in a
  small window and not full-screen. This can be done with something like
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> impressive -f -g 800x600 demo.pdf</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Impressive can also be used in digital signage scenarios, like displays in shop
  windows with a permanent slideshow. This can be achieved by having Impressive
  advance to the next page automatically after a specified time (e.g. 10
  seconds) and re-start the presentation from the start after the last slide:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> impressive -a 10 -w demo.pdf</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
On startup, Impressive will display a black screen with the program logo at the
  center. If caching is enabled, but background rendering is disabled, all pages
  of the presentation will then be rendered once. A bar in the lower half of the
  screen displays the progress of this operation. Any key or mouse click (except
  for those that quit Impressive, typically Q and Esc) skips this process, with
  the effect that Impressive will render the remaining pages on demand. Please
  note that the overview page will not be complete until every page has been
  rendered at least once. In other words, if the precaching process was skipped,
  placeholders will be displayed for all pages that have not been rendered yet.
  By default, Impressive will build up the cache in the background while the
  presentation runs. Thus, the progress bar will not appear and the preparation
  will only take the amount of time required to render the first two pages of
  the presentation. After this initialization process, Impressive will switch to
  the first page directly and without any transition.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEFAULT_CONTROLS"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFAULT_CONTROLS">DEFAULT
  CONTROLS</a></h1>
The keyboard and mouse controls used by Impressive are configurable (with very
  few exceptions). The default controls are as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Esc</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Return from the currently active special mode
  (zoom, overview, spotlight, highlight boxes); if no such special mode is
  active, quit Impressive altogether.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Q</b> key or <b>Alt</b>+<b>F4</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Quit Impressive immediately.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LMB</b> (left mouse button), mouse wheel down, <b>Page Down</b> key,
  <b>Cursor Down</b> key, <b>Cursor Right</b> key or <b>Spacebar</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Go to the next page (using a
  transition).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>RMB</b> (right mouse button), mouse wheel up, <b>Page Up</b> key, <b>Cursor
  Up</b> key, <b>Cursor Left</b> key or <b>Backspace</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Go to the previous page (using a
  transition).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Home</b> key / <b>End</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Go directly to the first or last page of the
  presentation.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Ctrl</b> key <i>(modifier)</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If one of the page navigation keys (Page
  Up/Down, Cursor keys, Space, Backspace, Home, End) is pressed while the Ctrl
  key is held down, the destination page will be entered immediately, without a
  transition.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>L</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Return to the last (most recently displayed)
  page. This can be used to toggle back and forth between two pages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>F</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle fullscreen mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Tab</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Zoom back to the overview page. While in
  overview mode, a page can be selected with the mouse and activated with the
  left mouse button. The right or middle mouse button or the Tab key leave
  overview mode <i>without</i> changing the current page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>MMB</b> (middle mouse button)
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">In normal display mode, this acts like the Tab
  key: it zooms back to the overview page. If the page is zoomed in, it will
  return to normal mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LMB</b> over a PDF hyperlink
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Jump to the page referenced by the hyperlink.
  Two types of hyperlinks are supported: Links that point to some other page of
  the same document, and URL hyperlinks like Web links and e-mail addresses.
  This feature is only available if <b>pdftk</b> is installed. Furthermore,
  <b>xdg-open</b> from the freedesktop.org Portland project is required for URL
  links to work. Please note that the hyperlink feature will not work properly
  when pages are rotated.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
click&amp;drag with <b>LMB</b> (left mouse button)
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Create a new highlight box. While at least one
  highlight box is defined on the current page, the page itself will be shown in
  a darker, blurry and (if supported by the graphics hardware) desaturated
  rendition. Only the highlight boxes will be displayed in their original
  lightness, sharpness and color saturation.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If a page with highlight boxes is left, the boxes will be saved and restored the
  next time this page is shown again.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>RMB</b> (right mouse button) over a highlight box
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If the right mouse button is clicked while the
  mouse cursor is above a highlight box, the box will be removed. If the last
  box on a page is removed, the page will turn bright and sharp again.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>S</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Save the info script associated with the
  current presentation. The main purpose for this is to permanently save
  highlight boxes or keyboard shortcuts, so they will be restored the next time
  this presentation is started.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>T</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Activate or deactivate the time display at the
  upper-right corner of the screen. If the timer is activated while the very
  first page of the presentation is shown, it activates time tracking mode, just
  as if the command-line option <b>--tracking</b> had been specified.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>R</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Reset the presentation timer.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>C</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Removes (&quot;clears&quot;) all highlight
  boxes from the current page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Return</b> key or <b>Enter</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle spotlight mode. In this mode, the page
  is darkened in the same way as if highlight boxes are present, but instead of
  (or in addition to) the boxes, a circular &quot;spotlight&quot; will be shown
  around the mouse cursor position, following every motion of the mouse
  cursor.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>+</b> / <b>-</b> key, <b>9</b> / <b>0</b> key or mouse wheel in spotlight
  mode
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Adjust the spotlight radius.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Ctrl</b>+<b>9</b> or <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>0</b> keys
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Resets the spotlight radius to the default
  value, i.e. the value that has been set up by the <b>radius</b> page property,
  the <b>--spot-radius</b> command-line option or Impressive's built-in
  default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>7</b> / <b>8</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Adjust the amount of darkening applied to the
  page in spotlight or highlight box mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Ctrl</b>+<b>7</b> or <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>8</b> keys
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Resets the amount of darkening in spotlight or
  highlight box mode to the default value, i.e. the value that has been set up
  by the <b>darkness</b> page property, the <b>--darkness</b> command-line
  option or Impressive's built-in default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Z</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle zoom mode. When this key is first
  pressed, the current page will zoom in. The page will be displayed at double
  size, but in its original resolution (i.e. it will be blurry). Impressive will
  re-render the page at the new resolution if the graphics hardware supports it.
  During this time, Impressive will <b>not</b> accept any input, so don't even
  think about clicking the mouse or pressing keys before the image gets crisp
  again.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
In zoom mode, all other functions will work as normal. Any operations that leave
  the current page, such as flipping the page or entering the overview screen,
  will leave zoom mode, too.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>[</b> / <b>]</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Adjust the gamma value of the display (might
  not be supported on every hardware).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>{</b> / <b>}</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Adjust the black level of the display (might
  not be supported on every hardware).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>\</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Revert gamma and black level back to
  normal.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>O</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This will toggle the &quot;visible on overview
  page&quot; flag of the current page. The result will not be visible
  immediately, but it can be saved to the info script (using the <b>S</b> key)
  and will be in effect the next time the presentation is started.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>I</b> key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This will toggle the skip flag of the current
  page. A page marked as skipped will not be reachable with the normal
  forward/backward navigation keys.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>B</b> / <b>W</b> key or <b>.</b> (dot) / <b>,</b> (comma) key
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Fade to black or white, respectively. This
  feature can be used if a whiteboard or blackboard in front of the projection
  area is to be used during the presentation. Using these two keys, the screen
  will fade into a solid color. On any keypress or mouse click, it will fade
  back to normal. These keys are not available in overview mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
click&amp;drag with <b>RMB</b> (right mouse button) in zoom mode
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Move the visible part of the page in zoom
  mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Cursor</b> keys in overview mode
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Navigate through pages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Alt</b>+<b>Tab</b> keys
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If Impressive is in fullscreen mode, the
  window will be minimized so that other applications can be used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any alphanumeric (A-z, 0-9) or function key (F1-F12) that is not bound to a
  specific action mentioned above or configured by the user (see below) can be
  used to assign shortcuts to pages that require quick access. If one of the
  keys is pressed together with <b>Shift</b>, the currently displayed page is
  associated with this key. To recall the page later, it is sufficient to press
  the shortcut key again. Shortcuts can be stored permanently with the <b>S</b>
  key.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONTROL_CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONTROL_CONFIGURATION">CONTROL
  CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
As already mentioned in the previous chapter, the keyboard and mouse bindings of
  Impressive can be widely configured. The only exceptions are the
  <b>Alt</b>+<b>F4</b> and <b>Alt</b>+<b>Tab</b> key combinations that will
  always quit or minimize Impressive, respectively. For everything else, there
  is a versatile configuration system in place; the controls described in the
  previous section are merely the defaults.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Impressive's control system works by associating <b>events</b> with
  <b>actions</b>. An <i>event</i> is a key on the keyboard, a mouse button or a
  mouse wheel movement. An <i>action</i> is something that is performed by
  Impressive as a result of an event, like going to the next page, switching to
  overview mode or quitting the program. The association of an event to an an
  action is called a <b>binding</b>. Multiple events can be bound to the same
  action (like the page down and space keys in the default setting, both of
  which go to the next page); furthermore, multiple actions can be bound to the
  same event. In fact, bindings do not associate events with single actions at
  all, but with <i>chains</i> of actions. Only the first action in the chain
  that <i>matches</i> (i.e. makes sense in) the current context will be executed
  if the event fires; all other actions will be ignored. If no action matches,
  no action will be performed and the event will be ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One example of such an action chain is the default binding for the left mouse
  button, which draws a highlight box if the mouse cursor moved, or visits a
  hyperlink if the mouse cursor hovers over one, or goes to the next page if
  none of the other conditions are met.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both events and actions have mnemonic names that are used in the command-line
  options and configuration files used for setting up bindings. Event and
  actions names are generally case-insensitive, though the canonical notation is
  lowercase.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
If an event or action specified on the command line or in a configuration file
  is not recognized by Impressive, an error message will be written to the
  console and the offending event or action will be ignored. Errors in control
  configuration are thus always non-fatal.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUPPORTED_EVENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#SUPPORTED_EVENTS">
  SUPPORTED EVENTS</a></h1>
Keyboard events are generally named after the keys they refer to. Consequently,
  the events <b>a</b> to <b>z</b> and <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> mean the respective
  letter and number keys on the main keyboard, <b>f1</b> to <b>f12</b> are the
  function keys and <b>kp0</b> to <b>kp9</b> are the number keys on the
  numerical keypad. All of these are raw scancodes, which has two implications:
  First, the key names are not internationalized and refer to the US keyboard
  layout (e.g. the <b>Z</b> key on a German or French keyboard will actually
  react to the event name <b>y</b> or <b>w</b>); second, modifiers will be
  ignored as well (e.g. the numerical keypad will always generate the
  <b>kp</b><i>X</i> scancodes, even if Num Lock is off).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mnemonic names for the other keyboard events are as follows (in alphabetic
  order): <b>ampersand</b>, <b>asterisk</b>, <b>at</b>, <b>backquote</b>,
  <b>backslash</b>, <b>backspace</b>, <b>break</b>, <b>capslock</b>,
  <b>caret</b>, <b>clear</b>, <b>comma</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>end</b>,
  <b>escape</b>, <b>euro</b>, <b>exclaim</b>, <b>greater</b>, <b>hash</b>,
  <b>help</b>, <b>home</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>kp_divide</b>, <b>kp_enter</b>,
  <b>kp_equals</b>, <b> kp_minus</b>, <b>kp_multiply</b>, <b>kp_plus</b>,
  <b>lalt</b>, <b>last</b>, <b>lctrl</b>, <b>left</b>, <b>leftbracket</b>,
  <b>leftparen</b>, <b>less</b>, <b>lmeta</b>, <b>lshift</b>, <b>lsuper</b>,
  <b>menu</b>, <b>minus</b>, <b>mode</b>, <b>numlock</b>, <b>pagedown</b>,
  <b>pageup</b>, <b>pause</b>, <b>period</b>, <b>plus</b>, <b>power</b>,
  <b>print</b>, <b>question</b>, <b>quote</b>, <b>quotedbl</b>, <b>ralt</b>,
  <b>rctrl</b>, <b>return</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>rightbracket</b>,
  <b>rightparen</b>, <b>rmeta</b>, <b>rshift</b>, <b>rsuper</b>,
  <b>scrollock</b>, <b>semicolon</b>, <b>slash</b>, <b>space</b>, <b>sysreq</b>,
  <b>tab</b>, <b>underscore</b>, <b>up</b>. The events prefixed with <b>kp_</b>
  refer to keys on the numerical keypad. Other than that, the names should be
  reasonably descriptive, so they will not be described futher at this point.
  Also note that not all keyboards and platforms support the full range of keys
  defined in this list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mouse event names are mapped as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lmb</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">the left mouse button</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>mmb</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">the middle mouse button</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rmb</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">the right mouse button</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>wheelup</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">scrolling the mouse wheel upwards</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>wheeldown</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">scrolling the mouse wheel downwards</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The event names can be prefixed with the three modifiers <b>ctrl+</b>,
  <b>alt+</b> and <b>shift+</b> to make the event valid only if the specified
  set of modifiers is pressed as well. This works for both keyboard and mouse
  events. Multiple modifiers can be combined, but the order must match the one
  mentioned in this paragraph. For example, <b>ctrl+shift+x</b> is a valid event
  name, while <b>shift+ctrl+x</b> is not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A simple way to determine the name associated with an event is using
  Impressive's &quot;Event Test Mode&quot; by invoking <b>impressive
  --evtest</b>. In this mode, the name of each incoming event will be displayed
  on the screen (and logged to standard output), which makes it possible to
  determine event names by experimentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUPPORTED_ACTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SUPPORTED_ACTIONS">
  SUPPORTED ACTIONS</a></h1>
The following list describes all actions supported by Impressive, together with
  the conditions under which they will match. Note that most actions will not
  match in overview mode and during video playback, unless mentioned otherwise
  in the description.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>box-add</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Draw a highlight box if the mouse has been
  moved since the button has been pressed down. This action must only be bound
  to a mouse button event without modifiers, otherwise it will not function
  properly.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>box-clear</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Removes all boxes from the current page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>box-remove</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Removes the highlight box under the mouse
  cursor, if there is any.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fade-less</b>, <b>fade-more</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease or increase the amount of darkening
  applied to the background in spotlight or highlight box mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fade-reset</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Resets the background darkness in spotlight or
  highlight box mode to its default value.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fade-to-black</b>, <b>fade-to-white</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Fades to a black or white screen. Once the
  screen is faded out, any event except those bound to the <b>quit</b> action
  will just leave fade mode and not perform its assigned action.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fullscreen</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Toggle fullscreen mode on platforms that
  support it.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>gamma-decrease</b>, <b>gamma-increase</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Decrease or increase the gamma level (i.e.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BINDING_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#BINDING_SYNTAX">
  BINDING SYNTAX</a></h1>
The arguments of the <b>-e</b>/<b>--bind</b> command-line option have the
  following basic syntax:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 <b></b><i>&lt;event&gt;</i> <i>[</i>,<i>&lt;event2&gt;...]</i>
  <i>&lt;operator&gt;</i> <i>&lt;action&gt;</i>
  <i>[</i>,<i>&lt;action2&gt;...]</i>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
In other words, it is a sequence of event names joined with commas, followed by
  an <i>operator</i> (see below) and a sequence of action names joined with
  commas. Multiple such binding statements can be combined into one argument by
  joining them with a semicolon ( <b>;</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The used operator defines in which way the action list shall modify the bindings
  of the referenced events:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>=</b> (equals sign), <b>+=</b> (plus sign and equals sign)
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The specified actions will be <i>added</i> to
  the bindings of the specified events. In other words,
  <b>event=action1,action2</b> does exactly the same as <b>event=action1;
  event=action2</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>:=</b> (colon and equals sign)
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The specified actions will <i>replace</i> the
  bindings of the specified events.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-=</b> (minus sign and equals sign)
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The specified actions will be <i>removed</i>
  from the bindings of the specified events. For example, to make the <b>Esc</b>
  key in the default bindings not clear highlight boxes, but otherwise preserve
  its original functionality, <b>escape -= box-clear</b> can be used.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other than bindings, a statement can also contain one of the following special
  commands:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>clearall</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Clears <i>all</i> current bindings.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>defaults</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Discards all current bindings and
  (re-)establishes the default bindings.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>include </b><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Loads and executes a control configuration
  file with a specified name.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The syntax for the configuration files used with the <b>-E</b>/<b>--controls</b>
  option or <b>include</b> statement is exactly the same as for the ad-hoc
  configuration option, except that individual bindings can be written on
  individual lines instead of joining them together to a single long line with
  semicolons. In addition, everything following a hash sign ( <b>#</b>) on a
  line will be ignored as a comment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One practical example for such a configuration file can be the following: The
  author of this program uses a cheap presentation remote control device that
  has four cursor keys, one &quot;enter&quot; key and a slider that switches
  between keyboard and mouse mode. Mouse mode works as expected, but what it
  does in keyboard mode is quite peculiar: the up and down keys act like Page-Up
  and Page-Down keys on a keyboard, the right arrow key sends the letter
  <b>B</b> to the computer, and the left key toggles between <b>Esc</b> and
  <b>F5</b> each time it's pressed. The following configuration file allows
  basic navigation and access to overview mode with this device:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
      clearall  # don't use the default bindings
      lmb = quit  # quit Impressive by clicking in mouse mode
      # everything else uses keyboard mode:
      return = overview-enter, overview-confirm  # toggle overview mode
      escape, f5 = overview-prev, goto-prev
      b = overview-next, goto-next
      pageup = overview-up, goto-prev
      pagedown = overview-down, goto-next
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get a better idea of how the control configuration system works in practice,
  it's recommended to study the output of <b>impressive --control-help</b> -
  this not only gives a concise overview of all events and actions, but also a
  full dump of Impressive's default bindings that can be used as a starting
  point for own customizations.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INFO_SCRIPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#INFO_SCRIPTS">INFO
  SCRIPTS</a></h1>
Impressive offers a powerful way to customize individual presentations using
  so-called info scripts. An info script is a text file having the same name and
  located in the same directory as the presentation file itself, except for the
  additional suffix <b>.info</b>. Thus, a presentation file called
  <b>BrandNewProduct.pdf</b> would have a info script with the name
  <b>BrandNewProduct.pdf.info</b>. If multiple arguments were specified on the
  command line, the info script will be called just <b>.info</b> (a dot file, so
  to speak). If a directory name was specified as the only argument, either a
  file called <b></b><i>DirectoryName</i>.info or a file called <b>.info</b>
  <i>inside</i> the directory will be used, depending on whether a path
  separator was specified at the end of the directory name or not - Impressive
  simply appends <b>.info</b> to whatever the input path name was.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
In any case, the default file name can be overridden by the <b>-I</b> command
  line option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Info scripts are actually Python scripts with full access to Impressive's global
  data structures and functions. (It is possible to write real interactive
  applications using info scripts.) Thus, they can modify a broad range of
  settings concerning Impressive. This manual will only cover the most basic
  ones.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PAGE_PROPERTIES"><a class="selflink" href="#PAGE_PROPERTIES">
  PAGE PROPERTIES</a></h1>
The main part of an info script defines the properties of each page. At the
  moment, the following properties are defined:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>title</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Each page can have a title that is displayed
  in the Impressive window's title bar. If there is no title explicitly
  specified in the info script, the title of the page will be extracted from PDF
  metadata if pdftk is installed, or the image file name will be used if the
  presentation is an image slideshow.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>transition</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">With this property, the transition class to be
  used for rendering the transition to this page (i.e. between the previous page
  and this page) can be specified. For pages lacking this property, random
  transitions will be chosen. A list of available transition classes can be
  obtained with <b>impressive -l</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>transtime</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property overrides the global transition
  time parameter ( <b>-T</b> at the command line). It contains the integer time
  (in milliseconds) the transition to this page shall take.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>overview</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property holds a boolean value
  (0/<b>False</b> or 1/ <b>True</b>) that specifies whether the page shall be
  included in the overview page. If this property isn't specified, it is assumed
  to be <b>True</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>skip</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This boolean property can be set to
  1/<b>True</b> if the page shall be skipped during the presentation.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Pages with <b>overview:True, skip:False</b> will be accessible both by cycling
  through the pages and using the overview page,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
pages with <b>overview:True, skip:True</b> will be silently skipped in the
  normal page cycle, but remain accessible from the overview page,
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
pages with <b>overview:False, skip:False</b> will appear in the normal cycle,
  but not on the overview page
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
and pages with <b>overview:False, skip:True</b> will not be accessible at
  all.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>boxes</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property stores a list of highlight box
  coordinates. Normally, there is no need to edit this by hand, as Impressive
  handles this automatically if the <b>S</b> key is pressed.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>timeout</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If a <b>timeout</b> property is present and
  the page is shown, Impressive will automatically switch to the next page after
  the specified number of milliseconds. Normally, the timeout will only be
  effective the first time the page is shown unless wrap mode is used
  (command-line option <b>-w</b> or <b>--wrap</b>). This restriction makes it
  possible to create self-running presentations with individual per-page
  timeouts.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>radius</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property takes an integer value that, if
  defined, will be used to set a new spotlight radius every time the page is
  entered. This overrides the current setting as defined by the
  <b>--spot-radius</b> command line option or run-time adjustments. Note that
  the value is <i>not</i> reset to the default value after the page has been
  left again.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>darkness</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property takes an integer or
  floating-point percentage value that, if defined, will be used to set the
  background darkness in spotlight or highlight box mode each time the page is
  entered. This overrides the current setting as defined by the
  <b>--darkness</b> command line option or run-time adjustments. Note that the
  value is <i>not</i> reset to the default value after the page has been left
  again.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>comment</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property can hold a string with a single
  line of text that will be displayed on screen while the page is shown. Display
  of this text can not be disabled.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>sound</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the file name of a sound file to be
  played (via MPlayer) when the page is first entered. Once started, the sound
  will be played until its end is reached, another sound or video is played, or
  Impressive is exited.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>video</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the file name of a video file to be
  played when the page is first entered. The video will be displayed
  full-screen. Any key or mouse click stops playback, except the cursor keys,
  which are used to seek in the video file, and space, which can be used to
  pause playback. Note that this function is highly experimental and might not
  work reliably on every system!</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>always</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this property is present and set to 1 or
  <b>True</b>, the media file specified in the <b>sound</b> or <b>video</b>
  properties will be played every time the page is entered, not just the first
  time.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>progress</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this property is set to zero, the
  presentation progress bar (which is usually set up with the
  <b>-d</b>/<b>--duration</b> command line switch) will not be shown on this
  page. In practice, it might be useful to hide the bar from the first page so
  that it is not visible during the introduction.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>reset</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">If this property is set to 1 or <b>True</b>,
  the timer will be reset each time this page is left, just as if the <b>R</b>
  has been pressed. If the special value 2 or <b>FirstTimeOnly</b> is used, the
  reset will only take place if the page was shown for the first time. Again,
  this is particularly useful on the first page: A combination of
  <b>progress:False, reset:FirstTimeOnly</b> makes it possible to set up the
  presentation long before it actually begins - the first page can be showed as
  long as desired, actual timing starts at the second page.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rotate</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property is a per-page override of the
  global <b>-r</b> command line option: It specifies how the page shall be
  rotated, in 90-degree steps clockwise.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>OnEnter</b>, <b>OnLeave</b>, <b>OnEnterOnce</b>, <b>OnLeaveOnce</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">These properties can contain a Python callable
  (i.e. a function reference or lambda expression) that is executed when the
  page is entered or left. The <b>~Once</b> variants will only be executed when
  the page is entered or left for the first time. The callable must not take any
  arguments. This feature can be used to associate arbitrary Python code with
  specific pages, for example to execute external programs.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Warning:</b> Lambda expressions cannot be properly processed by the Info
  Script save function ( <b>S</b> key). If Impressive encounters lambda
  expressions when saving, it will remove them. In addition, it will not
  overwrite the original info script, but generate an extra file that needs to
  be merged withe the original script by hand.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>keys</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property can be assigned a dictionary
  that maps alphanumerical keys to Python functions. For example, <b>'keys': {
  'x': SomeFunction }</b> will invoke <b>SomeFunction()</b> if the lowercase
  character 'x' is typed while the page is displayed. Regarding the functions,
  the same restrictions as for the <b>OnEnter</b>/<b>OnLeave</b> family apply:
  the function must not take any parameters and lambda functions can not be
  saved. Also note that it is not possible to overwrite Impressive's pre-defined
  key bindings with this method.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>invert</b>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This property specifies whether the colors of
  that page shall be inverted in the same way the <b>--invert</b> command-line
  switch does. It overrides the <b>--invert</b> setting on a per-page basis: If
  set to <b>True</b>, the page will always be inverted; if set to <b>False</b>,
  the page will never be inverted even if <b>--invert</b> has been specified on
  the command line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that in Impressive versions prior to 0.11.0, the <b>transition</b> and
  <b>transtime</b> properties defined the transition from the current page to
  the next, not from the previous page to the current one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The properties are stored together in a Python dictionary called
  <b>PageProps</b>. The syntax looks like in this example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  PageProps = {
    1: {
         'title': &quot;Title Page&quot;,
         'transition': PagePeel,
         'sound': &quot;background_music.mp3&quot;
       },
    2: {
         'title': &quot;Another Page&quot;,
         'timeout': 5000
       }
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PageProps definition (and <b>only</b> the PageProps definition) will be
  rewritten by Impressive if the <b>S</b> key is pressed. User-defined PageProps
  entries will also be left untouched, except for some pretty-printing.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GLOBAL_PRESENTATION_PROPERTIES"><a class="selflink" href="#GLOBAL_PRESENTATION_PROPERTIES">
  GLOBAL PRESENTATION PROPERTIES</a></h1>
The name of the presentation is shown in the title bar of the Impressive window
  (if not in fullscreen mode). By default, the file name or (if available) PDF
  metadata title will be used for this purpose, but the presentation title can
  also be explicitly set by overwriting the <b>DocumentTitle</b> variable:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> DocumentTitle = &quot;My Presentation&quot;</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another useful variable, <b>AvailableTransitions</b>, contains a list of all
  transition classes that may be used for randomly assigning transitions to
  pages lacking the <b>transition</b> property. Thus, if a certain transition is
  undesired (either because of personal dislike or because it shall be used
  exclusively on pages where it is manually assigned using <b>PageProps</b>),
  something like the following can be written:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> AvailableTransitions.remove(WipeBlobs)</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
On the other side, it's possible to activate transitions that are not enabled by
  default:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> AvailableTransitions += [SlideUp, SlideDown]</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Alternatively, <b>AvailableTransitions</b> can be completely overwritten to have
  the same transition (or set of transitions) assigned to all pages:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> AvailableTransitions = [Crossfade]</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTION_OVERRIDES"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTION_OVERRIDES">
  OPTION OVERRIDES</a></h1>
Another use of info scripts is overriding the default or command-line settings
  on a per-file basis. This can be done by simply overwriting one of the
  variables that are defined at the beginning of <b>impressive.py</b>. Each of
  these variables corresponds either to a command-line setting, or to some
  constant related to visual appearance or performance. So, for example, to
  force fullscreen mode for a presentation, write
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b> Fullscreen = True</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WORKING_DIRECTORIES"><a class="selflink" href="#WORKING_DIRECTORIES">
  WORKING DIRECTORIES</a></h1>
The working directory while executing the info scripts themselves is always the
  directory in which the info script is stored in.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The base directory for external actions that originate from Page Properties or
  PDF hyperlinks is always the directory of the PDF or image file this page
  belongs to. In other words, if e.g. <b>'sound': &quot;music.mp3&quot;</b> is
  written in the info script for one page of <b>presentation.pdf</b>, the file
  <b>music.mp3</b> is expected to be located in the same directory as
  <b>presentation.pdf</b>.
