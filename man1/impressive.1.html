<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Impressive - presentation tool with eye candy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
impressive [OPTIONS...] FILES...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Impressive is a simple presentation program that displays
slideshows of image files (JPEG, PNG, TIFF and BMP) or PDF
documents. Rendering is done via OpenGL, which allows for
<br>
some &quot;eye candy&quot; effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A somewhat-modern GPU (graphics
processing unit) supporting OpenGL 2.0 or OpenGL ES 2.0 and
appropriate drivers is required to run Impressive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a &lt;seconds&gt; or --auto &lt;seconds&gt; <br>
Automatically advance to the next page after the given
number of seconds. Together with the -w option (described
below), this can be used to create automatic slideshows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &lt;X&gt;:&lt;Y&gt; or
--aspect &lt;X&gt;:&lt;Y&gt; <br>
Specifies the display aspect ratio. Normally, Impressive
assumes that the pixel aspect ratio is 1:1 (square pixels),
regardless of the display resolution that has been set <br>
up. If a resolution has been selected that doesn&rsquo;t
match the display&rsquo;s aspect ratio, the screen will be
distorted. To overcome this, this option may be used to
manually <br>
specify the display aspect ratio, e.g. &quot;-A 16:9&quot;.
Note that this option has no effect if the MuPDF backend is
used for rendering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b or --noback <br>
Disables background rendering. By default, Impressive will
pre-render all pages in a separate background thread while
the presentation runs. If this option is specified, <br>
it will instead render all pages immediately on startup.
This option has no effect if caching is disabled (--cache
none, see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B &lt;ms&gt; or --boxfade
&lt;ms&gt; <br>
Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of the highlight box
fade-in/fade-out animation. Default value: 100 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;mode&gt; or --cache
&lt;mode&gt; <br>
Specifies the page cache mode to use. Valid options are:
<br>
none <br>
Disables page caching altogether, only the current and the
following page will be kept in RAM. Jumping between pages
will be very slow, because Impressive will need <br>
to render the requested pages on the fly. In addition, the
overview page won&rsquo;t be complete until every page has
been shown at least once. <br>
memory <br>
Caches all page images in memory. This is the fastest
method, but it requires very large amounts of memory (about
3 MiB per page at 1024x768 resolution). <br>
compressed or z <br>
Caches all page images in memory as well, but in compressed
form. This will be a little slower than memory mode, but on
pages with uniform backgrounds, this will <br>
easily reduce the required amount of RAM by a factor of 20.
<br>
disk <br>
Like memory, but uses a temporary file rather than memory
for storage. This is the default. <br>
persistent <br>
Uses a permanent cache file for caching. This file will not
be deleted when Impressive quits and will be reused on
subsequent invocations. The default name for the <br>
cache file is derived like the names for Info Scripts (see
below for an explanation), but with a .cache file name
extension instead of .info. This method is a lit&acirc; <br>
tle bit slower than disk mode, but the time span until the
overview page is fully populated will be significantly
decreased if Impressive is ran again with the same <br>
input files and options. <br>
The mode name may be abbreviated at will, down to one
character. Thus, --cache persistent, -c persist and even -cp
are all synonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C
&lt;filename&gt;[:&lt;X&gt;,&lt;Y&gt;] or --cursor
&lt;filename&gt;[:&lt;X&gt;,&lt;Y&gt;] <br>
This option can be used to specify an image that shall be
used as a (software) mouse cursor instead of the normal
(hardware) one. It can either be a name of an image file
<br>
(typically a transparent .png) or one of the special values
&quot;-&quot; (dash) or &quot;default&quot;, both of which
select a built-in cursor image. On platforms that do not
support a hard&acirc; <br>
ware cursor, this default cursor will also be used as a
default if this option is not used. <br>
If the name of an external file is specified, the position
of the hotspot (the pixel inside the cursor where the actual
mouse position is located) can be specified as <br>
well, for example: --cursor mycursor.png:2,4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clock <br>
If this option is enabled, the current time will be shown
instead of the elapsed time if time display is activated
(with the T key in the default control configuration). <br>
Compatible with the -M option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--control-help <br>
This option will output a short help screen of how the
control configuration (keyboard and mouse bindings) work,
along with a list of all recognized events and actions and
<br>
a dump of the current bindings (which is the default
configuration if no other -e/--bind or -E/--controls options
precede this option). After that, Impressive will exit; <br>
no presentation will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d &lt;time&gt; or --duration
&lt;time&gt; <br>
Specifies the expected run time of the presentation. The
time parameter can be either a number of seconds or a
human-readable time like 1:23 (1 minute and 23 seconds),
<br>
4:56h (4 hours and 56 minutes), 3m45s (3 minutes and 45
seconds), 5m (5 minutes) or 1:23:45 (1 hour, 23 minutes and
45 seconds). <br>
If an expected duration is specified, Impressive will show a
semi-transparent green progress bar at the lower edge of the
screen, indicating how much time has already <br>
passed. If the time is up, the bar will occupy the whole
edge and fade to yellow (at 125% of the expected time) to
red (at 150% or more).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D &lt;ms&gt; or --mousedelay
&lt;ms&gt; <br>
Sets the time (in milliseconds) the mouse cursor is shown in
fullscreen mode if it is not moved. There are two special
values: 0 (zero) shows the mouse cursor permanently, <br>
1 (one) hides it completely. The default value is 3000
ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--darkness &lt;percentage&gt;
<br>
Specifies how much the screen shall become darker when using
highlight boxes or spotlight mode. The value is specified in
percent, with 25 being the default. A value of <br>
zero would mean no darkening at all (the screen would just
be blurred slightly, and desaturated if the graphics
hardware supports it), and a value of 100 would make
every&acirc; <br>
thing but the highlighted parts of the screen black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;bindings&gt; or --bind
&lt;bindings&gt; <br>
Configures keyboard or mouse bindings. For the syntax of the
argument, refer to the Control Configuration section of the
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E &lt;filename&gt; or
--controls &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Loads a configuration file for keyboard and mouse bindings.
For the syntax of these files, refer to the Control
Configuration section of the manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--evtest <br>
If this option is specified, Impressive will not start a
normal presentation, but instead enter the so-called
&quot;Event Test Mode&quot; after the display has been
initialized. In <br>
this mode, Impressive will simply capture all keyboard and
mouse events and display the name of the last event on the
screen. In addition, events will be logged to stan&acirc;
<br>
dard output. This mode helps with determining the event
names for each key when creating a custom control
configuration (see the Control Configuration section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
Sets the window/fullscreen mode Impressive shall start up
with. This option can be specified multiple times; each
times it is found, the next of the three options is <br>
selected, in the follwing order: (1.)True fullscreen mode,
including setting the video mode. This is the default mode.
(2.)Windowed mode, where Impressive runs in a stan&acirc;
<br>
dard window. (3.)&quot;Fake-fullscreen&quot; mode, where
fullscreen is emulated by uding a window without border that
fills the whole screen. Setting the display resolution is
not <br>
possible in this mode. Each of these modes has a
corresponding long option that enables it directly
(--fullscreen, --windowed and --fake-fullscreen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fullscreen <br>
Starts Impressive in fullscreen mode (the default). See the
discussion of the -f option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fake-fullscreen <br>
Starts Impressive in &quot;fake fullscreen&quot; mode. See
the discussion of the -f option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;file&gt; or --font
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Impressive uses some kind of text OSD to overlay the current
page number and title (if available) on the overview page.
This option can be used to specify a TrueType font <br>
file (.ttf) to use for the OSD. If the path specified
doesn&rsquo;t directly point to a useable font file,
Impressive will try to search the system font directories.
It assumes <br>
that all fonts are stored below /usr/share/fonts,
/usr/local/share/fonts or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF for
this purpose (the latter one is useful for Mac OS X systems
<br>
specifically). If this option is not specified, any of
DejaVuSans.ttf or Vera.ttf (the typical file name of
Bitstream Vera Sans) will be used as a default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g
&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;[+&lt;posX&gt;+&lt;posY&gt;] or
--geometry
&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;[+&lt;posX&gt;+&lt;posY&gt;]
<br>
Sets the screen size or resolution Impressive shall use (in
pixels). If xrandr is installed, the default screen size for
fullscreen mode is the current screen resolution; <br>
on other platforms, Impressive uses the highest resolution
available to the graphics system. If a standard resolution
cannot be determined, the default is 1024x768 pixels. <br>
This is also the default for windowed mode. <br>
Furthermore, if the additional parameters posX and posY are
present, they specify the position of the upper-left corner
of the window (relative to the upper-left corner of <br>
the desktop), in pixels, for windowed and fake-fullscreen
mode. The values are ignored in &quot;true&quot; fullscreen
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G
&lt;gamma&gt;[:&lt;blacklevel&gt;] or --gamma
&lt;gamma&gt;[:&lt;blacklevel&gt;] <br>
Sets up the startup gamma and (optional) black level value.
The black level is the original image&rsquo;s intensity
level (0...254) that is to be mapped to black in
Impressive&rsquo;s <br>
output. Note that gamma and black level adjustments may be
unavailable or constrained on some systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or --help <br>
If this option is specified, Impressive writes a short
command line help screen to standard output and does not
start a presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H or --half-screen <br>
This option makes Impressive show the overview page and OSD
elements on the right half of the screen only. The overview
page will only show the left half of the slides as <br>
previews. Using a multi-monitor setup with a wide virtual
screen and specially crafted slides (e.g. those that can be
generated with LaTeX&rsquo;s beamer class), this makes it
<br>
possible to have presenter&rsquo;s notes on the second
screen. <br>
Note that transitions and animations are still operating on
the whole screen, making some of them (like PagePeel) look
ugly. Impressive also disables the overview zoom <br>
animation in half-screen mode; it can be re-enabled by
explicitly setting it to another value with a later command
line option (--zoomtime). <br>
Another limitation is that the allocation of the screen
halves (slides left, overview right) is fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;page&gt; or --initialpage
&lt;page&gt; <br>
Specifies the page number to start with. The default value
is 1 (start with the first page). If another value is
specified, the page shown by Impressive right after
ini&acirc; <br>
tialization is not the first one of the PDF or image list.
Additionally, pre-rendering (if enabled) will also start at
the specified page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I &lt;filename&gt; or --script
&lt;filename&gt; <br>
Overrides automatic derivation of the info script filename
and specifies a script file directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--invert <br>
This option makes Impressive invert the colors of each page,
turning black to white and vice-versa. Note that it is a
full RGB inversion, so it will, for example, turn <br>
dark green to light purple (and vice-versa) too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k or --auto-progress <br>
This option makes Impressive show a progress bar at the
bottom of the screen, visualizing the timeout on pages that
have one (either specified as a page property or using <br>
the --auto command-line option). Nothing is done on pages
that don&rsquo;t have a timeout. <br>
The progress bar shown by this option takes precedence over
the --duration or --page-progress bars: If one of these
options is specified as well, the timeout progress bar <br>
will be shown on pages with a timeout, and the other
progress bar will be shown on pages without one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l or --listtrans <br>
If this option is specified, Impressive writes a list of all
available transition classes to standard output and does not
start a presentation. Transitions that are <br>
enabled by default are marked with a star (*) left of the
class name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;spec&gt; or --layout
&lt;spec&gt; <br>
Specifies the OSD layout. Read below for an explanation of
this option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-box-size &lt;pixels&gt;
<br>
This option sets the minimum size of a highlight box, in
pixels. Boxes that are not this many pixels wide and high
are rejected in order to prevent accidental creation of <br>
highlight boxes. The default value for this is 30
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M or --minutes <br>
If this option is set, Impressive will show the on-screen
timer (activated with the [T] key) only with 1 minute
resolution. By default, it will show a timer with 1 second
<br>
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noblur <br>
By default, Impressive uses a fragment shader to blur and
desaturate the image when in highlight box or spotlight
mode. This is usually the faster and nicer-looking <br>
method; however, some very old hardware implementations
can&rsquo;t deal with that shader and fall back to an
unusably slow software implementation. Impressive tries to
detect <br>
scenarios where this would happen and automatically falls
back to a different implementation. <br>
There might be situations where this machanism fails and
Impressive tries to use the non-functional shader anyway. In
these cases, the --noblur option can be used to <br>
enforce the fallback implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noclicks <br>
If this option is enabled, switching to the previous or next
page with the left and right mouse buttons is deactivated.
The keyboard shortcuts are unaffected from this. <br>
Note that this option only works as intended when the
default controls are used. If the -e/--bind or -E/--controls
options have been used, --noclicks might not have the <br>
intended effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nologo <br>
This option disables the Impressive logo and version number
display. Instead, the loading screen will be just black or,
if background rendering is disabled, only the <br>
progress bar will be visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;directory&gt; or --output
&lt;directory&gt; <br>
Do not display the presentation, but render it into a series
of PNG image files inside the specified directory. The
images will be generated in the current resolution as <br>
specified by the -g option. This option is useful if the
presentation is to be given on on a foreign PC with an old,
broken or otherwise problematic Xpdf installation: By <br>
generating images of the PDF pages, is is made sure that no
rendering bugs will happen on the target system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O &lt;mode&gt; or
--autooverview &lt;mode&gt; <br>
Enables or disables automatic derivation of whether a page
shall or shall not be shown on the overview page. This
feature is based on the fact that some LaTeX presentation
<br>
packages tag all pages with a title (that can be read by
Impressive with the help of pdftk), except those that
contain multiple reveal steps. <br>
The following modes are available: <br>
off <br>
Disables automatic overview mode. All pages will be shown on
the overview page by default. This is also the default
setting. <br>
first <br>
All pages with a PDF title will be shown on the overview
page. The purpose is to show the initial state of multi-step
slides on the overview page. <br>
last <br>
All pages before a page with a PDF title will be shown on
the overview page. The purpose is to show the final state of
multi-step slides on the overview page. <br>
Again, the mode may be abbreviated arbitrarily, down to one
character, just like with the -c option above..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt; or
--pages &lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt; <br>
Using this option, the range of the page displayed can be
narrowed down. The presentation will start at the first page
in the range. All pages outside of the range will <br>
not be shown on the overview page and will not be cached.
However, they can be entered manually when cycling through
the presentation. Due to the fact that these pages are <br>
uncached, preparation of the display will take considerably
longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;path&gt; or --gspath
&lt;path&gt; <br>
This option can be used to override the Xpdf / GhostScript
path autodetection. The full path to the executable of
either GhostScript (gs or gs.exe) or Xpdf&rsquo;s pdftoppm
<br>
utility must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q or --page-progress <br>
If this option is enabled, Impressive will show a light-blue
semi-transparent progress bar at the lower edge of the
screen that shows the position inside the presentation, <br>
i.e. the relation between the current page number and the
total number of pages. Note that this progress bar will not
be shown if the duration progress bar (-d option) is <br>
also enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q or --autoquit <br>
If this option is specified, Impressive quits automatically
when trying to navigate to the page after the last page or
the page before the first page. <br>
This option does not have any effect if --wrap is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &lt;n&gt; or --rotate
&lt;n&gt; <br>
Display all pages rotated by nx90 degrees clockwise. Try -r
1 or -r 3 if there are problems with PDFs generated by LaTeX
on some Xpdf or GhostScript versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s or --scale (image input only)
<br>
If a directory with image files is used as input, Impressive
will scale down images that are too big for the screen. But
by default, it will not scale up smaller images to <br>
fit the screen; it will leave a black border instead. This
option overrides this setting and enables upscaling of
smaller images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s or --supersample (PDF input
only) <br>
This switch enables antialiasing by 4x supersampling instead
of the normal multisampling method used by Xpdf or
GhostScript. While this usually degrades both visual
qual&acirc; <br>
ity and performance, it may be necessary for circumventing
white strips or moire-like patterns in gradients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S &lt;pixels&gt; or --fontsize
&lt;pixels&gt; <br>
This option sets the size, in pixels, of the OSD font. The
default value is 14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spot-radius &lt;pixels&gt;
<br>
This option sets the initial radius of the spotlight, in
pixels. The default value is 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;ms&gt; or --transition
&lt;trans1[,trans2...]&gt; <br>
Using this switch, the set of transitions Impressive will
randomly draw at page changes can be specified. If only one
transition class is specified, this class will be <br>
used for all pages that do not have another transition
explicitly assigned in their page properties. Multiple
transitions have to be separated by commas; they will be
used <br>
in random order. The -l option can be used to get a list of
available transitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;ms&gt; or --transtime
&lt;ms&gt; <br>
Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of page transitions. 0
(zero) disables transitions altogether. Default value: 1000
ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tracking <br>
This option enables time tracking mode. In this mode, a
report of all pages visited with their display duration,
enter and leave times will be written to standard output.
<br>
This can be very useful when preparing presentations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;seconds&gt; or --poll
&lt;seconds&gt; <br>
If this option is specified, the source file or directory
will be checked for changes regularly. If a change in the
input PDF file or any of the image files in the input <br>
image directory is detected, the page cache will be flushed
and the current page as well as the info script will be
reloaded. The current page&rsquo;s transition will be shown
<br>
between the old and the new version of the page. <br>
The new PDF file must have at least as much pages as the old
one; also, it should have the same aspect ratio. If the
input is a directory, image files must not have disap&acirc;
<br>
peared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v or --verbose <br>
This option makes Impressive more verbose, i.e. it will
print slightly more informational messages than usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V &lt;pixels&gt; or --overscan
&lt;pixels&gt; <br>
PDF files often contain tiny amounts of white borders around
the edges which look bad in screen presentations. To
eliminate this problem, Impressive uses
&quot;overscan&quot;: PDF <br>
files will not be rendered to fit the screen size exactly,
but they will be rendered a bit larger so that the (possibly
broken) borders can be cropped off. The amount of <br>
overscan, in screen pixels, can be set with this option. The
default value is 3 pixels, which should remove borders in
most presentations at most common screen resolutions <br>
without cropping the pages too much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w or --wrap <br>
If this option is set, Impressive will &quot;wrap&quot; over
to the first page after the last page. In other words,
advancing to the next page at the end of the presentation
will <br>
restart the whole presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W or --nowheel <br>
By default, it is possible to change pages using the mouse
wheel. This option disables this behavior, which can be
useful to prevent spurious page changes if the mouse <br>
wheel is likely to be moved by accident. <br>
Note that this option only works as intended when the
default controls are used. If the -e/--bind or -E/--controls
options have been used, --noclicks might not have the <br>
intended effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--windowed <br>
Starts Impressive in windowed mode. See the discussion of
the -f option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x or --fade <br>
This option enables a smooth fade-in effect at the start of
the presentation and a fade-out effect just before
Impressive quits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X or --shuffle <br>
If this option is enabled, the input files will be shuffled
into random order before starting the presentation. The
individual pages of PDF input files will stay in their <br>
original order, though, so this option is mainly useful for
image presentations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y or --auto-auto <br>
This option can be used together with --duration to have
Impressive compute a page timeout (as with the --auto
option) automatically. This results in a presentation that
<br>
runs automatically, displaying each slide for the same time,
so that the desired total duration will be reached (almost)
exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z &lt;factor&gt; or --zoom
&lt;factor&gt; <br>
Sets the zoom factor that is used in zoom mode. It must be
an integer value of at least 2. The default value is 2. Note
that it might not be possible to get high-quality <br>
zooming for large zoom factors due to hardware restrictions.
Also, note that if the hardware doesn&rsquo;t support
non-power-of-two textures or if the -e option is used, the
<br>
number must be a power of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z &lt;ms&gt; or --zoomtime
&lt;ms&gt; <br>
Sets the duration (in milliseconds) of the overview page
zoom-in/zoom-out effects. Default value: 250 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cachefile &lt;filename&gt;
<br>
Activates persistent cache mode and specifies the name of
the cache file to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Following the options, the input file name(s) must be
specified. Recognized file types are PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF,
BMP and PGM/PPM. If the name of a directory is put on the
command <br>
line, all recognized image files (no PDF files!) in this
directory will be played in alphanumeric order
(case-insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, Impressive can use
a text file containing a list of files or directories to
show: This text file must contain at most one file name per
line; every character after a <br>
hash sign (#) is treated as a comment and will be ignored.
If such a comment is put on the same line as an image file
name, it will be used as the page&rsquo;s title. List file
names <br>
must be prefixed with an at sign (@) on the command line,
e.g. impressive @my_list_file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Impressive will also expand
wild-card characters (* and ?) if this isn&rsquo;t already
done by the shell, but apart from that, it will not reorder
the arguments. Thus, it will show the <br>
documents in the order specified at the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LAYOUT OPTIONS <br>
The OSD layout option (-L/--layout) accepts a string with
comma-separated key=value pairs. The following keywords are
recognized: <br>
alpha <br>
The opacity of the OSD text, either as a floating-point
value between 0 and 1 or a percentage between 2 and 100.
<br>
margin <br>
The distance (in pixels) of the OSD text to the screen
borders. <br>
time <br>
The position of the timer. <br>
title <br>
The position of the page title in overview mode. <br>
page <br>
The position of the page number in overview mode. <br>
status <br>
The position of the status line. <br>
The position specifications are composed by one character
that indicates whether the text shall be displayed at the
top (T) or bottom (B) edge of the screen and one character
<br>
that indicates whether it shall appear on the left (L), on
the right (R) or centered (C).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the default OSD
layout equals the following option string: <br>
-L margin=16,alpha=1,time=TR,title=BL,page=BR,status=TL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples illustrate some typical command
lines. They assume that Impressive can be run by simply
typing &quot;impressive&quot; on the command line. Depending
on how Impres&acirc; <br>
sive is installed, this has to be substituted with the
actual way to run Impressive (e.g. &quot;python
~/impressive/impressive_dev.py&quot; for a fresh SVN
checkout). Furthermore, the file <br>
&quot;demo.pdf&quot; is used as the document to show here;
obviously this has to be replaced by the path to the actual
PDF file too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the simplest case, Impressive
is run directly with the name of the file to show and no
further parameters. This will start a full-screen
presentation with all settings at <br>
their defaults: <br>
impressive demo.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To just quickly check a slide
deck, it might make sense to run Impressive in a small
window and not full-screen. This can be done with something
like <br>
impressive -f -g 800x600 demo.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Impressive can also be used in
digital signage scenarios, like displays in shop windows
with a permanent slideshow. This can be achieved by having
Impressive advance to the next <br>
page automatically after a specified time (e.g. 10 seconds)
and re-start the presentation from the start after the last
slide: <br>
impressive -a 10 -w demo.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
On startup, Impressive will display a black screen with the
program logo at the center. If caching is enabled, but
background rendering is disabled, all pages of the
presentation <br>
will then be rendered once. A bar in the lower half of the
screen displays the progress of this operation. Any key or
mouse click (except for those that quit Impressive,
typi&acirc; <br>
cally Q and Esc) skips this process, with the effect that
Impressive will render the remaining pages on demand. Please
note that the overview page will not be complete until <br>
every page has been rendered at least once. In other words,
if the precaching process was skipped, placeholders will be
displayed for all pages that have not been rendered yet.
<br>
By default, Impressive will build up the cache in the
background while the presentation runs. Thus, the progress
bar will not appear and the preparation will only take the
amount <br>
of time required to render the first two pages of the
presentation. After this initialization process, Impressive
will switch to the first page directly and without any
transi&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULT CONTROLS <br>
The keyboard and mouse controls used by Impressive are
configurable (with very few exceptions). The default
controls are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Esc key <br>
Return from the currently active special mode (zoom,
overview, spotlight, highlight boxes); if no such special
mode is active, quit Impressive altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q key or Alt+F4 <br>
Quit Impressive immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LMB (left mouse button), mouse
wheel down, Page Down key, Cursor Down key, Cursor Right key
or Spacebar <br>
Go to the next page (using a transition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMB (right mouse button), mouse
wheel up, Page Up key, Cursor Up key, Cursor Left key or
Backspace key <br>
Go to the previous page (using a transition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home key / End key <br>
Go directly to the first or last page of the
presentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl key (modifier) <br>
If one of the page navigation keys (Page Up/Down, Cursor
keys, Space, Backspace, Home, End) is pressed while the Ctrl
key is held down, the destination page will be <br>
entered immediately, without a transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L key <br>
Return to the last (most recently displayed) page. This can
be used to toggle back and forth between two pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F key <br>
Toggle fullscreen mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab key <br>
Zoom back to the overview page. While in overview mode, a
page can be selected with the mouse and activated with the
left mouse button. The right or middle mouse button or <br>
the Tab key leave overview mode without changing the current
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMB (middle mouse button) <br>
In normal display mode, this acts like the Tab key: it zooms
back to the overview page. If the page is zoomed in, it will
return to normal mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LMB over a PDF hyperlink <br>
Jump to the page referenced by the hyperlink. Two types of
hyperlinks are supported: Links that point to some other
page of the same document, and URL hyperlinks like Web <br>
links and e-mail addresses. This feature is only available
if pdftk is installed. Furthermore, xdg-open from the
freedesktop.org Portland project is required for URL links
<br>
to work. Please note that the hyperlink feature will not
work properly when pages are rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">click&amp;drag with LMB (left
mouse button) <br>
Create a new highlight box. While at least one highlight box
is defined on the current page, the page itself will be
shown in a darker, blurry and (if supported by the <br>
graphics hardware) desaturated rendition. Only the highlight
boxes will be displayed in their original lightness,
sharpness and color saturation. <br>
If a page with highlight boxes is left, the boxes will be
saved and restored the next time this page is shown
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RMB (right mouse button) over a
highlight box <br>
If the right mouse button is clicked while the mouse cursor
is above a highlight box, the box will be removed. If the
last box on a page is removed, the page will turn <br>
bright and sharp again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S key <br>
Save the info script associated with the current
presentation. The main purpose for this is to permanently
save highlight boxes or keyboard shortcuts, so they will be
<br>
restored the next time this presentation is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T key <br>
Activate or deactivate the time display at the upper-right
corner of the screen. If the timer is activated while the
very first page of the presentation is shown, it acti&acirc;
<br>
vates time tracking mode, just as if the command-line option
--tracking had been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R key <br>
Reset the presentation timer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C key <br>
Removes (&quot;clears&quot;) all highlight boxes from the
current page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return key or Enter key <br>
Toggle spotlight mode. In this mode, the page is darkened in
the same way as if highlight boxes are present, but instead
of (or in addition to) the boxes, a circular <br>
&quot;spotlight&quot; will be shown around the mouse cursor
position, following every motion of the mouse cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ / - key, 9 / 0 key or mouse
wheel in spotlight mode <br>
Adjust the spotlight radius.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+9 or Ctrl+0 keys <br>
Resets the spotlight radius to the default value, i.e. the
value that has been set up by the radius page property, the
--spot-radius command-line option or Impressive&rsquo;s <br>
built-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 / 8 key <br>
Adjust the amount of darkening applied to the page in
spotlight or highlight box mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl+7 or Ctrl+8 keys <br>
Resets the amount of darkening in spotlight or highlight box
mode to the default value, i.e. the value that has been set
up by the darkness page property, the --darkness <br>
command-line option or Impressive&rsquo;s built-in
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Z key <br>
Toggle zoom mode. When this key is first pressed, the
current page will zoom in. The page will be displayed at
double size, but in its original resolution (i.e. it will be
<br>
blurry). Impressive will re-render the page at the new
resolution if the graphics hardware supports it. During this
time, Impressive will not accept any input, so don&rsquo;t
<br>
even think about clicking the mouse or pressing keys before
the image gets crisp again. <br>
In zoom mode, all other functions will work as normal. Any
operations that leave the current page, such as flipping the
page or entering the overview screen, will leave <br>
zoom mode, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ / ] key <br>
Adjust the gamma value of the display (might not be
supported on every hardware).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ / } key <br>
Adjust the black level of the display (might not be
supported on every hardware). &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key <br>
Revert gamma and black level back to normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O key <br>
This will toggle the &quot;visible on overview page&quot;
flag of the current page. The result will not be visible
immediately, but it can be saved to the info script (using
the S <br>
key) and will be in effect the next time the presentation is
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I key <br>
This will toggle the skip flag of the current page. A page
marked as skipped will not be reachable with the normal
forward/backward navigation keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B / W key or . (dot) / , (comma)
key <br>
Fade to black or white, respectively. This feature can be
used if a whiteboard or blackboard in front of the
projection area is to be used during the presentation. Using
<br>
these two keys, the screen will fade into a solid color. On
any keypress or mouse click, it will fade back to normal.
These keys are not available in overview mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">click&amp;drag with RMB (right
mouse button) in zoom mode <br>
Move the visible part of the page in zoom mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursor keys in overview mode
<br>
Navigate through pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt+Tab keys <br>
If Impressive is in fullscreen mode, the window will be
minimized so that other applications can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any alphanumeric (A-z, 0-9) or
function key (F1-F12) that is not bound to a specific action
mentioned above or configured by the user (see below) can be
used to assign shortcuts <br>
to pages that require quick access. If one of the keys is
pressed together with Shift, the currently displayed page is
associated with this key. To recall the page later, it is
<br>
sufficient to press the shortcut key again. Shortcuts can be
stored permanently with the S key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROL CONFIGURATION <br>
As already mentioned in the previous chapter, the keyboard
and mouse bindings of Impressive can be widely configured.
The only exceptions are the Alt+F4 and Alt+Tab key
combina&acirc; <br>
tions that will always quit or minimize Impressive,
respectively. For everything else, there is a versatile
configuration system in place; the controls described in the
previous <br>
section are merely the defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Impressive&rsquo;s control
system works by associating events with actions. An event is
a key on the keyboard, a mouse button or a mouse wheel
movement. An action is something that is <br>
performed by Impressive as a result of an event, like going
to the next page, switching to overview mode or quitting the
program. The association of an event to an an action is <br>
called a binding. Multiple events can be bound to the same
action (like the page down and space keys in the default
setting, both of which go to the next page); furthermore,
mul&acirc; <br>
tiple actions can be bound to the same event. In fact,
bindings do not associate events with single actions at all,
but with chains of actions. Only the first action in the
chain <br>
that matches (i.e. makes sense in) the current context will
be executed if the event fires; all other actions will be
ignored. If no action matches, no action will be performed
<br>
and the event will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One example of such an action
chain is the default binding for the left mouse button,
which draws a highlight box if the mouse cursor moved, or
visits a hyperlink if the mouse <br>
cursor hovers over one, or goes to the next page if none of
the other conditions are met.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both events and actions have
mnemonic names that are used in the command-line options and
configuration files used for setting up bindings. Event and
actions names are generally <br>
case-insensitive, though the canonical notation is
lowercase. <br>
If an event or action specified on the command line or in a
configuration file is not recognized by Impressive, an error
message will be written to the console and the offending
<br>
event or action will be ignored. Errors in control
configuration are thus always non-fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED EVENTS <br>
Keyboard events are generally named after the keys they
refer to. Consequently, the events a to z and 0 to 9 mean
the respective letter and number keys on the main keyboard,
f1 <br>
to f12 are the function keys and kp0 to kp9 are the number
keys on the numerical keypad. All of these are raw
scancodes, which has two implications: First, the key names
are not <br>
internationalized and refer to the US keyboard layout (e.g.
the Z key on a German or French keyboard will actually react
to the event name y or w); second, modifiers will be <br>
ignored as well (e.g. the numerical keypad will always
generate the kpX scancodes, even if Num Lock is off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mnemonic names for the other
keyboard events are as follows (in alphabetic order):
ampersand, asterisk, at, backquote, backslash, backspace,
break, capslock, caret, clear, <br>
comma, down, end, escape, euro, exclaim, greater, hash,
help, home, insert, kp_divide, kp_enter, kp_equals,
kp_minus, kp_multiply, kp_plus, lalt, last, lctrl, left,
left&acirc; <br>
bracket, leftparen, less, lmeta, lshift, lsuper, menu,
minus, mode, numlock, pagedown, pageup, pause, period, plus,
power, print, question, quote, quotedbl, ralt, rctrl,
return, <br>
right, rightbracket, rightparen, rmeta, rshift, rsuper,
scrollock, semicolon, slash, space, sysreq, tab, underscore,
up. The events prefixed with kp_ refer to keys on the
numeri&acirc; <br>
cal keypad. Other than that, the names should be reasonably
descriptive, so they will not be described futher at this
point. Also note that not all keyboards and platforms
sup&acirc; <br>
port the full range of keys defined in this list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse event names are mapped as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lmb <br>
the left mouse button</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmb <br>
the middle mouse button</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmb <br>
the right mouse button</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wheelup <br>
scrolling the mouse wheel upwards</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wheeldown <br>
scrolling the mouse wheel downwards</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The event names can be prefixed
with the three modifiers ctrl+, alt+ and shift+ to make the
event valid only if the specified set of modifiers is
pressed as well. This works for <br>
both keyboard and mouse events. Multiple modifiers can be
combined, but the order must match the one mentioned in this
paragraph. For example, ctrl+shift+x is a valid event name,
<br>
while shift+ctrl+x is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple way to determine the
name associated with an event is using Impressive&rsquo;s
&quot;Event Test Mode&quot; by invoking impressive --evtest.
In this mode, the name of each incoming event <br>
will be displayed on the screen (and logged to standard
output), which makes it possible to determine event names by
experimentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED ACTIONS <br>
The following list describes all actions supported by
Impressive, together with the conditions under which they
will match. Note that most actions will not match in
overview mode <br>
and during video playback, unless mentioned otherwise in the
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">box-add <br>
Draw a highlight box if the mouse has been moved since the
button has been pressed down. This action must only be bound
to a mouse button event without modifiers, other&acirc; <br>
wise it will not function properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">box-clear <br>
Removes all boxes from the current page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">box-remove <br>
Removes the highlight box under the mouse cursor, if there
is any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fade-less, fade-more <br>
Decrease or increase the amount of darkening applied to the
background in spotlight or highlight box mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fade-reset <br>
Resets the background darkness in spotlight or highlight box
mode to its default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fade-to-black, fade-to-white
<br>
Fades to a black or white screen. Once the screen is faded
out, any event except those bound to the quit action will
just leave fade mode and not perform its assigned <br>
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fullscreen <br>
Toggle fullscreen mode on platforms that support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gamma-decrease, gamma-increase
<br>
Decrease or increase the gamma level (i.e. roughly the
brightness) of the display on platforms that support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gamma-bl-decrease,
gamma-bl-increase <br>
Decrease or increase the black level of the display on
platforms that support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gamma-reset <br>
Reset the gamma and black level settings to their
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto-end, goto-end-notrans <br>

transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto-last, goto-last-notrans
<br>
Go to the last (i.e. most recently) visited page, with or
without a transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto-next, goto-next-notrans
<br>
Go to the following page of the presentation, with or
without a transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto-prev, goto-prev-notrans
<br>
Go to the previous page of the presentation, with or without
a transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">goto-start, goto-start-notrans
<br>
Go to the first page of the presentation, with or without a
transition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hyperlink, hyperlink-notrans
<br>
Navigate to the hyperlink under the mouse cursor, if there
is one. If the hyperlink is a reference to another page of
the presentation, this page will be activated with or <br>
without a transition. If the hyperlink refers to an external
object (e.g. an URL), it will be opened externally, if
supported by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overview-confirm <br>
When in overview mode, confirm the selection and leave
overview mode, navigating to the selected page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overview-down, overview-up <br>
When in overview mode, select the page above or below the
currently selected one in the grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overview-enter <br>
When not in overview mode, zoom out of the current page,
entering overview mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overview-exit <br>

If spotlight mode is active, deactivate spotlight mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spotlight-grow, spotlight-shrink
<br>
When in spotlight mode, increase or decrease the radius of
the spotlight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spotlight-reset <br>
When in spotlight mode, reset the spotlight radius to the
default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time-reset <br>
Reset the presentation timer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time-toggle <br>
Toggle on-screen display of the current presentation time,
or wall-clock time if the --clock option is used. If this is
done at the start of the presentation, before the <br>
first page has been left, time tracking mode will be
enabled, like the --tracking option would have done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toggle-overview <br>
This toggles the &quot;page is visible on overview

In video playback mode, seek forward or backward by 1 or 10
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">video-step <br>
In video playback mode, if playback is paused, advance one
frame in the video.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">video-stop <br>
In video playback mode, stop playback and return to normal
page display mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zoom-enter <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zoom-exit <br>
If in zoom mode, leave zoom mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zoom-pan <br>
When in zoom mode, the visible area of the page can be moved
around with the mouse while the key or mouse button of the
associated event is held down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINDING SYNTAX <br>
The arguments of the -e/--bind command-line option have the
following basic syntax: <br>
&lt;event&gt; [,&lt;event2&gt;...] &lt;operator&gt;
&lt;action&gt; [,&lt;action2&gt;...] <br>
In other words, it is a sequence of event names joined with
commas, followed by an operator (see below) and a sequence
of action names joined with commas. Multiple such binding
<br>
statements can be combined into one argument by joining them
with a semicolon (;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The used operator defines in
which way the action list shall modify the bindings of the
referenced events:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= (equals sign), += (plus sign
and equals sign) <br>
The specified actions will be added to the bindings of the
specified events. In other words, event=action1,action2 does
exactly the same as event=action1; event=action2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:= (colon and equals sign) <br>
The specified actions will replace the bindings of the
specified events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-= (minus sign and equals sign)
<br>
The specified actions will be removed from the bindings of
the specified events. For example, to make the Esc key in
the default bindings not clear highlight boxes, but <br>
otherwise preserve its original functionality, escape -=
box-clear can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other than bindings, a statement
can also contain one of the following special commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clearall <br>
Clears all current bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defaults <br>
Discards all current bindings and (re-)establishes the
default bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Loads and executes a control configuration file with a
specified name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for the configuration
files used with the -E/--controls option or include
statement is exactly the same as for the ad-hoc
configuration option, except that individual <br>
bindings can be written on individual lines instead of
joining them together to a single long line with semicolons.
In addition, everything following a hash sign (#) on a line
<br>
will be ignored as a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One practical example for such a
configuration file can be the following: The author of this
program uses a cheap presentation remote control device that
has four cursor keys, <br>
one &quot;enter&quot; key and a slider that switches between
keyboard and mouse mode. Mouse mode works as expected, but
what it does in keyboard mode is quite peculiar: the up and
down <br>
keys act like Page-Up and Page-Down keys on a keyboard, the
right arrow key sends the letter B to the computer, and the
left key toggles between Esc and F5 each time it&rsquo;s
<br>
pressed. The following configuration file allows basic
navigation and access to overview mode with this device:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clearall # don&rsquo;t use the
default bindings <br>
lmb = quit # quit Impressive by clicking in mouse mode <br>
# everything else uses keyboard mode: <br>
return = overview-enter, overview-confirm # toggle overview
mode <br>
escape, f5 = overview-prev, goto-prev <br>
b = overview-next, goto-next <br>
pageup = overview-up, goto-prev <br>
pagedown = overview-down, goto-next</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get a better idea of how the
control configuration system works in practice, it&rsquo;s
recommended to study the output of impressive --control-help
- this not only gives a concise <br>
overview of all events and actions, but also a full dump of
Impressive&rsquo;s default bindings that can be used as a
starting point for own customizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INFO SCRIPTS <br>
Impressive offers a powerful way to customize individual
presentations using so-called info scripts. An info script
is a text file having the same name and located in the same
<br>
directory as the presentation file itself, except for the
additional suffix .info. Thus, a presentation file called
BrandNewProduct.pdf would have a info script with the name
<br>
BrandNewProduct.pdf.info. If multiple arguments were
specified on the command line, the info script will be
called just .info (a dot file, so to speak). If a directory
name was <br>
specified as the only argument, either a file called
DirectoryName.info or a file called .info inside the
directory will be used, depending on whether a path
separator was speci&acirc; <br>
fied at the end of the directory name or not - Impressive
simply appends .info to whatever the input path name was.
<br>
In any case, the default file name can be overridden by the
-I command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info scripts are actually Python
scripts with full access to Impressive&rsquo;s global data
structures and functions. (It is possible to write real
interactive applications using info <br>
scripts.) Thus, they can modify a broad range of settings
concerning Impressive. This manual will only cover the most
basic ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGE PROPERTIES <br>
The main part of an info script defines the properties of
each page. At the moment, the following properties are
defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title <br>
Each page can have a title that is displayed in the
Impressive window&rsquo;s title bar. If there is no title
explicitly specified in the info script, the title of the
page will <br>
be extracted from PDF metadata if pdftk is installed, or the
image file name will be used if the presentation is an image
slideshow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transition <br>
With this property, the transition class to be used for
rendering the transition to this page (i.e. between the
previous page and this page) can be specified. For pages
<br>
lacking this property, random transitions will be chosen. A
list of available transition classes can be obtained with
impressive -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transtime <br>
This property overrides the global transition time parameter
(-T at the command line). It contains the integer time (in
milliseconds) the transition to this page shall <br>
take.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overview <br>
This property holds a boolean value (0/False or 1/True) that
specifies whether the page shall be included in the overview
page. If this property isn&rsquo;t specified, it is <br>
assumed to be True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skip <br>
This boolean property can be set to 1/True if the page shall
be skipped during the presentation. <br>
Pages with overview:True, skip:False will be accessible both
by cycling through the pages and using the overview page,
<br>
pages with overview:True, skip:True will be silently skipped
in the normal page cycle, but remain accessible from the
overview page, <br>
pages with overview:False, skip:False will appear in the
normal cycle, but not on the overview page <br>
and pages with overview:False, skip:True will not be
accessible at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">boxes <br>
This property stores a list of highlight box coordinates.
Normally, there is no need to edit this by hand, as
Impressive handles this automatically if the S key is <br>
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout <br>
If a timeout property is present and the page is shown,
Impressive will automatically switch to the next page after
the specified number of milliseconds. Normally, the <br>
timeout will only be effective the first time the page is
shown unless wrap mode is used (command-line option -w or
--wrap). This restriction makes it possible to create <br>
self-running presentations with individual per-page
timeouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">radius <br>
This property takes an integer value that, if defined, will
be used to set a new spotlight radius every time the page is
entered. This overrides the current setting as <br>
defined by the --spot-radius command line option or run-time
adjustments. Note that the value is not reset to the default
value after the page has been left again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darkness <br>
This property takes an integer or floating-point percentage
value that, if defined, will be used to set the background
darkness in spotlight or highlight box mode each <br>
time the page is entered. This overrides the current setting
as defined by the --darkness command line option or run-time
adjustments. Note that the value is not reset to <br>
the default value after the page has been left again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comment <br>
This property can hold a string with a single line of text
that will be displayed on screen while the page is shown.
Display of this text can not be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sound <br>
Specifies the file name of a sound file to be played (via
MPlayer) when the page is first entered. Once started, the
sound will be played until its end is reached, another <br>
sound or video is played, or Impressive is exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">video <br>
Specifies the file name of a video file to be played when
the page is first entered. The video will be displayed
full-screen. Any key or mouse click stops playback, except
<br>
the cursor keys, which are used to seek in the video file,
and space, which can be used to pause playback. Note that
this function is highly experimental and might not <br>
work reliably on every system!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always <br>
If this property is present and set to 1 or True, the media
file specified in the sound or video properties will be
played every time the page is entered, not just the <br>
first time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">progress <br>
If this property is set to zero, the presentation progress
bar (which is usually set up with the -d/--duration command
line switch) will not be shown on this page. In <br>
practice, it might be useful to hide the bar from the first
page so that it is not visible during the introduction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset <br>
If this property is set to 1 or True, the timer will be
reset each time this page is left, just as if the R has been
pressed. If the special value 2 or FirstTimeOnly is <br>
used, the reset will only take place if the page was shown
for the first time. Again, this is particularly useful on
the first page: A combination of progress:False, <br>
reset:FirstTimeOnly makes it possible to set up the
presentation long before it actually begins - the first page
can be showed as long as desired, actual timing starts at
<br>
the second page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate <br>
This property is a per-page override of the global -r
command line option: It specifies how the page shall be
rotated, in 90-degree steps clockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OnEnter, OnLeave, OnEnterOnce,
OnLeaveOnce <br>
These properties can contain a Python callable (i.e. a
function reference or lambda expression) that is executed
when the page is entered or left. The ~Once variants will
<br>
only be executed when the page is entered or left for the
first time. The callable must not take any arguments. This
feature can be used to associate arbitrary Python code <br>
with specific pages, for example to execute external
programs. <br>
Warning: Lambda expressions cannot be properly processed by
the Info Script save function (S key). If Impressive
encounters lambda expressions when saving, it will remove
<br>
them. In addition, it will not overwrite the original info
script, but generate an extra file that needs to be merged
withe the original script by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys <br>
This property can be assigned a dictionary that maps
alphanumerical keys to Python functions. For example,
&rsquo;keys&rsquo;: { &rsquo;x&rsquo;: SomeFunction } will
invoke SomeFunction() if the <br>
lowercase character &rsquo;x&rsquo; is typed while the page
is displayed. Regarding the functions, the same restrictions
as for the OnEnter/OnLeave family apply: the function must
not <br>
take any parameters and lambda functions can not be saved.
Also note that it is not possible to overwrite
Impressive&rsquo;s pre-defined key bindings with this
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invert <br>
This property specifies whether the colors of that page
shall be inverted in the same way the --invert command-line
switch does. It overrides the --invert setting on a <br>
per-page basis: If set to True, the page will always be
inverted; if set to False, the page will never be inverted
even if --invert has been specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in Impressive versions
prior to 0.11.0, the transition and transtime properties
defined the transition from the current page to the next,
not from the previous page to <br>
the current one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The properties are stored
together in a Python dictionary called PageProps. The syntax
looks like in this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PageProps = { <br>
1: { <br>
&rsquo;title&rsquo;: &quot;Title Page&quot;, <br>
&rsquo;transition&rsquo;: PagePeel, <br>
&rsquo;sound&rsquo;: &quot;background_music.mp3&quot; <br>
}, <br>
2: { <br>
&rsquo;title&rsquo;: &quot;Another Page&quot;, <br>
&rsquo;timeout&rsquo;: 5000 <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PageProps definition (and
only the PageProps definition) will be rewritten by
Impressive if the S key is pressed. User-defined PageProps
entries will also be left untouched, <br>
except for some pretty-printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL PRESENTATION PROPERTIES
<br>
The name of the presentation is shown in the title bar of
the Impressive window (if not in fullscreen mode). By
default, the file name or (if available) PDF metadata title
will <br>
be used for this purpose, but the presentation title can
also be explicitly set by overwriting the DocumentTitle
variable: <br>
DocumentTitle = &quot;My Presentation&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another useful variable,
AvailableTransitions, contains a list of all transition
classes that may be used for randomly assigning transitions
to pages lacking the transition prop&acirc; <br>
erty. Thus, if a certain transition is undesired (either
because of personal dislike or because it shall be used
exclusively on pages where it is manually assigned using
Page&acirc; <br>
Props), something like the following can be written: <br>
AvailableTransitions.remove(WipeBlobs) <br>
On the other side, it&rsquo;s possible to activate
transitions that are not enabled by default: <br>
AvailableTransitions += [SlideUp, SlideDown] <br>
Alternatively, AvailableTransitions can be completely
overwritten to have the same transition (or set of
transitions) assigned to all pages: <br>
AvailableTransitions = [Crossfade]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION OVERRIDES <br>
Another use of info scripts is overriding the default or
command-line settings on a per-file basis. This can be done
by simply overwriting one of the variables that are defined
<br>
at the beginning of impressive.py. Each of these variables
corresponds either to a command-line setting, or to some
constant related to visual appearance or performance. So,
for <br>
example, to force fullscreen mode for a presentation, write
<br>
Fullscreen = True</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORKING DIRECTORIES <br>
The working directory while executing the info scripts
themselves is always the directory in which the info script
is stored in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The base directory for external
actions that originate from Page Properties or PDF
hyperlinks is always the directory of the PDF or image file
this page belongs to. In other <br>
words, if e.g. &rsquo;sound&rsquo;: &quot;music.mp3&quot; is
written in the info script for one page of presentation.pdf,
the file music.mp3 is expected to be located in the same
directory as presen&acirc; <br>
tation.pdf.</p>
