<p>rmic(1) Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Tools rmic(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rmic - Generates stub, skeleton, and tie classes for remote
objects that use the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) or
Internet Inter-Orb protocol (IIOP). Also generates Object
<br>
Management Group (OMG) Interface Definition Language
(IDL)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rmic [ options ] package-qualified-class-names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package-qualified-class-names
<br>
Class names that include their packages, for example,
java.awt.Color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Deprecation Note: Support for static generation of Java
Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) stubs and skeletons has been
deprecated. Oracle recommends that you use dynamically <br>
generated JRMP stubs instead, eliminating the need to use
this tool for JRMP-based applications. See the
java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject specification at <br>

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/rmi/server/UnicastRemoteObject.html
for further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmic compiler generates stub
and skeleton class files using the Java Remote Method
Protocol (JRMP) and stub and tie class files (IIOP protocol)
for remote objects. These <br>
class files are generated from compiled Java programming
language classes that are remote object implementation
classes. A remote implementation class is a class that
implements <br>
the interface java.rmi.Remote. The class names in the rmic
command must be for classes that were compiled successfully
with the javac command and must be fully package qualified.
<br>
For example, running the rmic command on the class file name
HelloImpl as shown here creates the HelloImpl_Stub.classfile
in the hello subdirectory (named for the class&rsquo;s <br>
package):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmic hello.HelloImpl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A skeleton for a remote object
is a JRMP protocol server-side entity that has a method that
dispatches calls to the remote object implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A tie for a remote object is a
server-side entity similar to a skeleton, but communicates
with the client with the IIOP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A stub is a client-side proxy
for a remote object that is responsible for communicating
method invocations on remote objects to the server where the
actual remote object <br>
implementation resides. A client&rsquo;s reference to a
remote object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local
stub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the rmic command
generates stub classes that use the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol
version only, as though the -v1.2 option was specified. The
-vcompat option was the <br>
default in releases before 5.0. Use the -iiop option to
generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP protocol. See
Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A stub implements only the
remote interfaces, and not any local interfaces that the
remote object also implements. Because a JRMP stub
implements the same set of remote <br>
interfaces as the remote object, a client can use the Java
programming language built-in operators for casting and type
checking. For IIOP, the PortableRemoteObject.narrow method
<br>
must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-bootclasspath path <br>
Overrides the location of bootstrap class files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath path <br>
Specifies the path the rmic command uses to look up classes.
This option overrides the default or the CLASSPATH
environment variable when it is set. Directories are <br>
separated by colons. The general format for path is:
.:&lt;your_path&gt;, for example:
.:/usr/local/java/classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
Specifies the root destination directory for the generated
class hierarchy. You can use this option to specify a
destination directory for the stub, skeleton, and tie <br>
files. For example, the following command places the stub
and skeleton classes derived from MyClass into the directory
/java/classes/exampleclass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmic -d /java/classes
exampleclass.MyClass</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -d option is not
specified, then the default behavior is as if -d . was
specified. The package hierarchy of the target class is
created in the current directory, <br>
and stub/tie/skeleton files are placed within it. In some
earlier releases of the rmic command, if the -d option was
not specified, then the package hierarchy was not <br>
created, and all of the output files were placed directly in
the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extdirs path <br>
Overrides the location of installed extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
Enables the generation of all debugging information,
including local variables. By default, only line number
information is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idl <br>
Causes the rmic command to generate OMG IDL for the classes
specified and any classes referenced. IDL provides a purely
declarative, programming language-independent way <br>
to specify an API for an object. The IDL is used as a
specification for methods and data that can be written in
and called from any language that provides CORBA bindings.
<br>
This includes Java and C++ among others. See Java IDL: IDL
to Java Language Mapping at
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/mapping/jidlMapping.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -idl option is used,
other options also include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -always or
-alwaysgenerate options force regeneration even when
existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than the input class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -factory
option uses the factory keyword in generated IDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -idlModule
from JavaPackage[.class]toIDLModule specifies IDLEntity
package mapping, for example: -idlModulemy.module
my::real::idlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
-idlFilefromJavaPackage[.class] toIDLFile specifies
IDLEntity file mapping, for example: -idlFile test.pkg.X
TEST16.idl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iiop <br>
Causes the rmic command to generate IIOP stub and tie
classes, rather than JRMP stub and skeleton classes. A stub
class is a local proxy for a remote object and is used by
<br>
clients to send calls to a server. Each remote interface
requires a stub class, which implements that remote
interface. A client reference to a remote object is a <br>
reference to a stub. Tie classes are used on the server side
to process incoming calls, and dispatch the calls to the
proper implementation class. Each implementation <br>
class requires a tie class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you call the rmic command
with the -iiop, then it generates stubs and ties that
conform to this naming convention:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">_&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
<br>
_&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When you use the
-iiop option, other options also include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -always or
-alwaysgenerate options force regeneration even when
existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than the input class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
-nolocalstubs option means do not create stubs optimized for
same-process clients and servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
-noValueMethods option must be used with the -idl option.
The -noValueMethods option prevents the addition of
valuetype methods and initializers to emitted IDL. <br>
These methods and initializers are optional for valuetypes,
and are generated unless the -noValueMethods option is
specified with the -idl option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The -poa option
changes the inheritance from
org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl to
org.omg.PortableServer.Servant. The PortableServer module
for the Portable Object <br>
Adapter (POA) defines the native Servant type. In the Java
programming language, the Servant type is mapped to the Java
org.omg.PortableServer.Servant class. It serves <br>
as the base class for all POA servant implementations and
provides a number of methods that can be called by the
application programmer, and methods that are called by <br>
the POA and that can be overridden by the user to control
aspects of servant behavior. Based on the OMG IDL to Java
Language Mapping Specification, CORBA V 2.3.1 <br>
ptc/00-01-08.pdf..RE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J <br>
Used with any Java command, the -J option passes the
argument that follows the -J (no spaces between the -Jand
the argument) to the Java interpreter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keep or -keepgenerated <br>
Retains the generated .java source files for the stub,
skeleton, and tie classes and writes them to the same
directory as the.class files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowarn <br>
Turns off warnings. When the -nowarn options is used. The
compiler does not print out any warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nowrite <br>
Does not write compiled classes to the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vcompat (deprecated) <br>
Generates stub and skeleton classes that are compatible with
both the 1.1 and 1.2 JRMP stub protocol versions. This
option was the default in releases before 5.0. The <br>
generated stub classes use the 1.1 stub protocol version
when loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine and use the 1.2
stub protocol version when loaded into a 1.2 (or later) <br>
virtual machine. The generated skeleton classes support both
1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol versions. The generated classes
are relatively large to support both modes of <br>
operation. Note: This option has been deprecated. See
Description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about
what classes are being compiled and what class files are
being loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v1.1 (deprecated) <br>
Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1 JRMP stub
protocol version only. The -v1.1 option is only useful for
generating stub classes that are serialization- <br>
compatible with preexisting, statically deployed stub
classes that were generated by the rmic command from JDK 1.1
and that cannot be upgraded (and dynamic class loading <br>
is not being used). Note: This option has been deprecated.
See Description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v1.2 (deprecated) <br>
(Default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP stub
protocol version only. No skeleton classes are generated
because skeleton classes are not used with the 1.2 stub <br>
protocol version. The generated stub classes do not work
when they are loaded into a JDK 1.1 virtual machine. Note:
This option has been deprecated. See Description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
CLASSPATH <br>
Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes.
Directories are separated by colons, for example:
.:/usr/local/java/classes.</p>
