<p>MYTOP(1) User Contributed Perl Documentation
MYTOP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mytop - display MySQL server performance info like
&lsquo;top&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mytop [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
The latest version of mytop is available from
http://jeremy.zawodny.com/mysql/mytop/ it might also be on
CPAN as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
In order for mytop to function properly, you must have the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Perl 5.005 or newer <br>
* Getopt::Long <br>
* DBI and DBD::mysql <br>
* Term::ReadKey from CPAN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most systems are likely to have
all of those installed--except for Term::ReadKey. You will
need to pick that up from the CPAN. You can pick up
Term::ReadKey here:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=TermReadKey</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And you obviously need access to
a MySQL server (version 3.22.x or 3.23.x) with the necessary
security to run the SHOW PROCESSLIST and SHOW GLOBAL STATUS
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are a Windows user, using
ActiveState&rsquo;s Perl, you can use PPM (the Perl Package
Manager) to install the MySQL and Term::ReadKey modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional Color Support <br>
In additon, if you want a color mytop (recommended), install
Term::ANSIColor from the CPAN:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=ANSIColor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you do, mytop will
automatically use it. However, color is not yet working on
Windows. Patches welcome. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional Hi-Res Timing <br>
If you want mytop to provide more accurate real-time
queries-per-second statistics, install the Time::HiRes
module from CPAN. mytop will automatically notice that you
have it <br>
and use it rather than the standard timing mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platforms <br>
mytop is known to work on:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Linux (2.2.x, 2.4.x) <br>
* FreeBSD (2.2, 3.x, 4.x) <br>
* Mac OS X <br>
* BSDI 4.x <br>
* Solaris 2.x <br>
* Windows NT 4.x (ActivePerl)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that it works on
another platform, please let me know. Given that it is all
Perl code, I expect it to be rather portable to Unix and
Unix-like systems. Heck, it might <br>
even work on Win32 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Help is always welcome in improving this software. Feel free
to contact the author (see &quot;AUTHOR&quot; below) with
bug reports, fixes, suggestions, and comments. Additionally
&quot;BUGS&quot; <br>
will provide a list of things this software is not able to
do yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having said that, here are the
details on how it works and what you can do with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Basics <br>
mytop was inspired by the system monitoring tool top. I
routinely use top on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. You are
likely to notice features from each of them here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mytop will connect to a MySQL
server and periodically run the SHOW PROCESSLIST and SHOW
GLOBAL STATUS commands and attempt to summarize the
information from them in a useful <br>
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Display <br>
The mytop display screen is really broken into two parts.
The top 4 lines (header) contain summary information about
your MySQL server. For example, you might see something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MySQL on localhost (4.0.13-log)
up 1+11:13:00 [23:29:11] <br>
Queries: 19.3M qps: 160 Slow: 1.0 Se/In/Up/De(%):
00/80/03/17 <br>
qps now: 219 Slow qps: 0.0 Threads: 1 ( 1/ 16) 00/74/00/25
<br>
Key Efficiency: 99.3% Bps in/out: 30.5k/162.8 Now in/out:
32.7k/ 3.3k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line identifies the
hostname of the server (localhost) and the version of MySQL
it is running. The right had side shows the uptime of the
MySQL server process in <br>
days+hours:minutes:seconds format (much like FreeBSD&rsquo;s
top) as well as the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second line displays the
total number of queries the server has processed, the
average number of queries per second, the number of slow
queries, and the percentage of Select, <br>
Insert, Update, and Delete queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third real-time values.
First is the number of queries per second, then the number
of slow queries, followed by query precentages (like on the
previous line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the fourth line displays key
buffer efficiency (how often keys are read from the buffer
rather than disk) and the number of bytes that MySQL has
sent and received, both over <br>
all and in the last cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can toggle the header by
hitting h when running mytop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second part of the display
lists as many threads as can fit on screen. By default they
are sorted according to their idle time (least idle first).
The display looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Id User Host Dbase Time Cmd
Query or State <br>
-- ---- ---- ----- ---- --- -------------- <br>
61 jzawodn localhost music 0 Query show processlist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you can see, the thread id,
username, host from which the user is connecting, database
to which the user is connected, number of seconds of idle
time, the command the thread <br>
is executing, and the query info are all displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Often times the query info is
what you are really interested in, so it is good to run
mytop in an xterm that is wider than the normal 80 columns
if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The thread display color-codes
the threads if you have installed color support. The current
color scheme only works well in a window with a dark (like
black) background. The <br>
colors are selected according to the &quot;Command&quot;
column of the display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Query - Yellow <br>
Sleep - White <br>
Connect - Green</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Those are purely arbitrary and
will be customizable in a future release. If they annoy you
just start mytop with the -nocolor flag or adjust your
config file appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments <br>
mytop handles long and short command-line arguments. Not all
options have both long and short formats, however. The long
arguments can start with one or two dashes &lsquo;-&rsquo;
or &lsquo;--&rsquo;. <br>
They are shown here with just one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u or -user username <br>
Username to use when logging in to the MySQL server.
Default: &lsquo;&lsquo;root&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p or -pass or -password
password <br>
Password to use when logging in to the MySQL server.
Default: none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h or -host hostname[:port] <br>
Hostname of the MySQL server. The hostname may be followed
by an option port number. Note that the port is specified
separate from the host when using a config file. Default:
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;localhost&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-port or -P port <br>
If you&rsquo;re running MySQL on a non-standard port, use
this to specify the port number. Default: 3306.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s or -delay seconds <br>
How long between display refreshes. Default: 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d or -db or -database database
<br>
Use if you&rsquo;d like mytop to connect to a specific
database by default. Default:
&lsquo;&lsquo;test&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b or -batch or -batchmode <br>
In batch mode, mytop runs only once, does not clear the
screen, and places no limit on the number of lines it will
print. This is suitable for running periodically (perhaps
<br>
from cron) to capture the information into a file for later
viewing. You might use batch mode in a CGI script to
occasionally display your MySQL server status on the
web.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S or -socket /path/to/socket
<br>
If you&rsquo;re running mytop on the same host as MySQL, you
may wish to have it use the MySQL socket directly rather
than a standard TCP/IP connection. If you do,just specify
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying a socket
will make mytop ignore any host and/or port that you might
have specified. If the socket does not exist (or the file
specified is not a socket), <br>
this option will be ignored and mytop will use the hostname
and port number instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-header or -noheader <br>
Sepcify if you want the header to display or not. You can
toggle this with the h key while mytop is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-color or -nocolor <br>
Specify if you want a color display. This has no effect if
you don&rsquo;t have color support available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: If you have color
support, mytop will try color unless you tell it not to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i or -idle or -noidle <br>
Specify if you want idle (sleeping) threads to appear in the
list. If sleeping threads are omitted, the default sorting
order is reversed so that the longest running queries <br>
appear at the top of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prompt or -noprompt <br>
Specify if you want to be prompted to type in your database
password. This provides a little bit more security since it
not only prevents the password from viewable in a <br>
process list, but also doesn&rsquo;t require the password to
be stored in plain text in your ~/.mytop config file. You
will only be prompted if a password has not been specified
<br>
in your config file or through another command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: noprompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-resolve <br>
If you have skip-resolve set on MySQL (to keep it from doing
a reverse DNS lookup on each inbound connection), mytop can
replace IP addresses with hostnames but toggling this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default: noresolve</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-line arguments will
always take precedence over config file options. That
happens because the config file is read BEFORE the
command-line arguments are applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Config File <br>
Instead of always using bulky command-line parameters, you
can also use a config file in your home directory
(&quot;~/.mytop&quot;). If present, mytop will read it
automatically. It is <br>
read before any of your command-line arguments are
processed, so your command-line arguments will override
directives in the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a sample config file
&quot;~/.mytop&quot; which implements the defaults described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user=root <br>
pass= <br>
host=localhost <br>
db=test <br>
delay=5 <br>
port=3306 <br>
socket= <br>
batchmode=0 <br>
header=1 <br>
color=1 <br>
idle=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a config file will help to
ensure that your database password isn&rsquo;t visible to
users on the command-line. Just make sure that the
permissions on &quot;~/.mytop&quot; are such that <br>
others cannot read it (unless you want them to, of
course).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may have white space on
either side of the &quot;=&quot; in lines of the config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shortcut Keys <br>
The following keys perform various actions while mytop is
running. Those which have not been implemented are listed as
such. They are included to give the user idea of what is
<br>
coming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Display help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Show &quot;command
counters&quot; based on the Com_* values in SHOW GLOBAL
STATUS. This is a new feature. Feedback welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Show only threads connected to
a particular database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Given a thread id, display the
entire query that thread was (and still may be) running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Disable all filtering (host,
user, and db).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Only show queries from a
particular host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H Toggle the header display. You
can also specify either &quot;header=0&quot; or
&quot;header=1&quot; in your config file to set the default
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Toggle the display of idle
(sleeping) threads. If sleeping threads are filtered, the
default sorting order is reversed so that the longest
running queries appear at the top <br>
of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Switch to InnoDB Status mode.
The output of &quot;SHOW INNODB STATUS&quot; will be
displayed every cycle. In a future version, this may
actually summarize that data rather than <br>
producing raw output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k Kill a thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Toggle modes. Currently this
switches from &lsquo;top&rsquo; mode to &lsquo;qps&rsquo;
(Queries Per Second Mode). In this mode, mytop will write
out one integer per second. The number written <br>
reflects the number of queries executed by the server in the
previous one second interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More modes may be added in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Reverse the default sort
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Pause display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit mytop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Reset the server&rsquo;s
status counters via a FLUSH STATUS command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Change the sleep time (number
of seconds between display refreshes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Show only threads owned by a
giver user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The s key has a command-line
counterpart: -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The h key has two command-line
counterparts: -header and -noheader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This is more of a BUGS + WishList.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some performance information is
not available when talking to a version 3.22.x MySQL server.
Additional information (about threads mostly) was added to
the output of SHOW STATUS <br>
in MySQL 3.23.x and mytop makes use of it. If the
information is not available, you will simply see zeros
where the real numbers should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simply running this program will
increase your overall counters (such as the number of
queries run). But you may or may not view that as a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mytop consumes too much CPU time
when running (verified on older versions of Linux and
FreeBSD). It&rsquo;s likely a problem related to
Term::ReadKey. I haven&rsquo;t had time to investigate <br>
yet, so mytop now automatically lowers its priority when you
run it. You may also think about running mytop on another
workstation instead of your database server. However, <br>
&quot;mytop&quot; on Solaris does not have this problem.
Newer versions of Linux and FreeBSD seem to have fixed
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can&rsquo;t specify the
maximum number of threads to list. If you have many threads
and a tall xterm, mytop will always try to display as many
as it can fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of most of the columns
in the display has a small maximum width. If you have fairly
long database/user/host names the display may appear odd. I
have no good idea as to <br>
how best to deal with that yet. Suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;d be nice if you could
just add mytop configuration directives in your
&quot;my.cnf&quot; file instead of having a separate config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be able to specify
the columns you&rsquo;d like to see in the display and the
order in which they appear. If you only have one username
that connects to your database, it&rsquo;s <br>
probably not worth having the User column appear, for
example.</p>
