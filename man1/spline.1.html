<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
spline - interpolate datasets using splines under
tension</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
spline [ options ] [ files ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
spline reads datasets from standard input or from one or
more files, and fits a smooth curve (a &quot;spline&quot;)
through each dataset. An interpolated version of each
dataset, consist&acirc; <br>
ing of points from the smooth curve, is written to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the -a or -A options are
used (see below), each dataset should be a sequence of
values for a vector-valued function of a single scalar
variable. That is, each dataset <br>
should be a sequence of data points, given as alternating t
and y values. t is a scalar independent variable, and y is a
vector-valued dependent variable. The dimensionality of <br>
y is specified with the -d option (the default
dimensionality is 1). Between each data point and the next,
t should increase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An input file may contain more
than a single dataset. If an input file is in ASCII format
(the default), its datasets should be separated by blank
lines. The t and y values of <br>
the data points in each dataset may be arranged arbitrarily,
so long as they are separated by white space. Besides
datasets, an input file may contain any number of comment
<br>
lines, which should begin with the comment character
&lsquo;#&rsquo;. Comment lines are ignored. They are not
treated as blank, i.e., they do not interrupt a dataset in
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and file names may be
interspersed on the command line, but the options are
processed before the file names are read. If -- is seen, it
is interpreted as the end of the <br>
options. If no file names are specified, or the file name -
is encountered, the standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of interpolation, and
the format of the input and output files, may be selected by
command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Interpolation-Related Options <br>
-f <br>
--filter <br>
Use a local interpolation algorithm (the cubic Bessel
algorithm), so that spline can be used as a real-time
filter. The slope of the interpolating curve at each point
in <br>
a dataset will be chosen by fitting a quadratic function
through that point and the two adjacent points in the
dataset. If -f is specified then the -t option, otherwise
<br>
optional, must be used as well. Also, if -f is specified
then the -k, -p, and -T options may not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -f is not specified, then the
default (global) interpolation algorithm will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k k <br>
--boundary-condition k <br>
Set the boundary condition parameter for each constructed
spline to be k. (The default value is 1.0.) In each of its
components, the spline will satisfy the two boundary <br>
conditions y&quot;[0]=ky&quot;[1] and
y&quot;[n]=ky&quot;[n-1]. Here y[0] and y[1] signify the
values of a specified component of the vector-valued
dependent variable y at the first two <br>
points of a dataset, and y[n-1] and y[n] the values at the
last two points. Setting k to zero will yield a
&quot;natural&quot; spline, i.e., one that has zero
curvature at the two <br>
ends of the dataset. The -k option may not be used if -f or
-p is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n n <br>
--number-of-intervals n <br>
Subdivide the interval over which interpolation occurs into
n subintervals. The number of data points computed, and
written to the output, will be n+1. The default value <br>
for n is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
--periodic <br>
Construct a periodic spline. If this option is specified,
the y values for the first and last points in each dataset
must be equal. The -f and -k options may not be used <br>
if -p is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T tension <br>
--tension tension <br>
Each interpolating curve will be a spline under tension.
This option sets the tension value (the default is 0.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If tension equals zero, the
curve will be a piecewise cubic spline. Increasing the
tension above zero makes the curve &quot;tighter&quot;, and
reduces the likelihood of spurious <br>
inflection points. That is because between each pair of
successive points in a dataset, the curve will satisfy the
fourth-order differential equation
y&quot;&quot;=sgn(ten&acirc; <br>
sion)*(tension^2)y&quot; in each of its components. As
tension increases to positive infinity, it will converge to
a polygonal line. The -T option may not be used if -f is
<br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tmin tmax [tspacing] <br>
--t-spacing tmin tmax [tspacing] <br>
For each dataset, set the interval over which interpolation
occurs to be the interval between tmin and tmax. If tspacing
is not specified, the interval will be divided <br>
into the number of subintervals specified by the -n
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -t option is not used,
the interval over which interpolation occurs will be the
entire range of the independent variable in the dataset. The
-t option must always <br>
be used if the -f option is used to request filter-like
behavior (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format-Related Options <br>
-d dimension <br>
--y-dimension dimension <br>
Set the dimensionality of the dependent variable y in the
input and output files to be dimension. The default
dimension is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I data-format <br>
--input-format data-format <br>
Set the data format for the input file(s) to be data-format,
which may be one of the following.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a ASCII format (the default).
Each file is a sequence of floating point numbers,
interpreted as the t and y coordinates of the successive
data points in a dataset. <br>
If y is d-dimensional, there will be d+1 numbers for each
point. The t and y coordinates of a point need not appear on
the same line, and points need not appear on <br>
different lines. But if a blank line occurs (i.e., two
newlines in succession are seen), it is interpreted as the
end of a dataset, and the beginning of the next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Single precision binary
format. Each file is a sequence of floating point numbers,
interpreted as the t and y coordinates of the successive
data points in a <br>
dataset. If y is d-dimensional, there will be d+1 numbers
for each point. Successive datasets are separated by a
single occurrence of the quantity FLT_MAX, which <br>
is the largest possible single precision floating point
number. On most machines this is approximately
3.4x10^38.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Double precision binary
format. Each file is a sequence of double precision floating
point numbers, interpreted as the t and y coordinates of the
successive data <br>
points in a dataset. If y is d-dimensional, there will be
d+1 numbers for each point. Successive datasets are
separated by a single occurrence of the quantity <br>
DBL_MAX, which is the largest possible double precision
floating point number. On most machines this is
approximately 1.8x10^308.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Integer binary format. Each
file is a sequence of integers, interpreted as the t and y
coordinates of the successive data points in a dataset. If y
is d-dimen&acirc; <br>
sional, there will be d+1 numbers for each point. Successive
datasets are separated by a single occurrence of the
quantity INT_MAX, which is the largest possible <br>
integer. On most machines this is 2^31-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a [step_size [lower_limit]]
<br>
--auto-abscissa [step_size [lower_limit]] <br>
Automatically generate values for t, the independent
variable (the default values of step_size and lower_limit
are 1.0 and 0.0, respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Irrespective of data format
(&lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;f&rsquo;, &lsquo;d&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;i&rsquo;), this option specifies that the values of t
are missing from the input file: the dataset(s) to be read
contain only <br>
values of y, the dependent variable. So if y is
d-dimensional, there will be only d numbers for each point.
The increment from each t value to the next will be <br>
step_size, and the first t value will be lower_limit. This
option is useful, e.g., when interpolating curves rather
than functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
--auto-dist-abscissa <br>
Automatically generate values for t, the independent
variable. This is a variant form of the -a option. The
increment from each t value to the next will be the distance
<br>
in d-dimensional space between the corresponding y values,
and the first t value will be 0.0. That is, t will be
&quot;polygonal arclength&quot;. This option is useful when
inter&acirc; <br>
polating curves rather than functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O data-format <br>
--output-format data-format <br>
Set the data format for the output file to be data-format.
The interpretation of data-format is the same as for the -I
option. The default is &lsquo;a&rsquo;, i.e., ASCII
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P significant-digits <br>
--precision significant-digits <br>
Set the numerical precision for the t and y values in the
output file to be significant-digits. This takes effect only
if the output file is written in &lsquo;a&rsquo; format,
i.e., <br>
in ASCII. significant-digits must be a positive integer (the
default is 6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--suppress-abscissa <br>
Omit the independent variable t from the output file; for
each point, supply only the dependent variable y. If y is
d-dimensional, there will be only d numbers for each <br>
point, not d+1. This option is useful when interpolating
curves rather than functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informational Options <br>
--help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number of spline and the plotting
utilities package, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo 0 0 1 1 2 0 | spline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce on standard output
an interpolated dataset consisting of 101 data points. If
graphed, this interpolated dataset will yield a
parabola.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is sometimes useful to
interpolate between a sequence of arbitrarily placed points
in d-dimensional space, i.e., to &quot;spline a curve&quot;
rather than a function. The -a and -s <br>
options are used for this. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 | spline -d
2 -a -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce on standard output
a 101-point dataset that interpolates between the four
points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1). The -d 2 option
specifies that the dependent vari&acirc; <br>
able y is two-dimensional. The -a option specifies that the
t values are missing from the input and should be
automatically generated. The -s option specifies that the t
values <br>
should be stripped from the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
spline was written by Robert S. Maier
(rsm@math.arizona.edu), starting with an earlier version by
Rich Murphey (rich@freebsd.org). The algorithms for
constructing splines under <br>
tension are similar to those used in the FITPACK subroutine
library, and are ultimately due to Alan K. Cline
(cline@cs.utexas.edu).</p>
