<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grdfft - Do mathematical operations on grids in the
wavenumber (or frequency) domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grdfft ingrid [ ingrid2 ] [ -Goutfile|table ] [ -Aazimuth ]
[ -Czlevel ] [ -D[scale|g] ] [ -E[r|x|y][w[k]][n] ] [
-F[r|x|y]params ] [ -I[scale|g] ] [ -Nparams ] [ <br>
-Sscale ] [ -V[level] ] [ -fg ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: No space is allowed
between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grdfft will take the 2-D forward Fast Fourier Transform and
perform one or more mathematical operations in the frequency
domain before transforming back to the space domain. An <br>
option is provided to scale the data before writing the new
values to an output file. The horizontal dimensions of the
grid are assumed to be in meters. Geographical grids may be
<br>
used by specifying the -fg option that scales degrees to
meters. If you have grids with dimensions in km, you could
change this to meters using grdedit or scale the output with
<br>
grdmath.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
ingrid 2-D binary grid file to be operated on. (See GRID
FILE FORMATS below). For cross-spectral operations, also
give the second grid file ingrd2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Goutfile <br>
Specify the name of the output grid file or the 1-D spectrum
table (see -E). (See GRID FILE FORMATS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-Aazimuth <br>
Take the directional derivative in the azimuth direction
measured in degrees CW from north.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Czlevel <br>
Upward (for zlevel &gt; 0) or downward (for zlevel &lt; 0)
continue the field zlevel meters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[scale|g] <br>
Differentiate the field, i.e., take d(field)/dz. This is
equivalent to multiplying by kr in the frequency domain (kr
is radial wave number). Append a scale to multiply by <br>
(kr * scale) instead. Alternatively, append g to indicate
that your data are geoid heights in meters and output should
be gravity anomalies in mGal. [Default is no <br>
scale].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E[r|x|y][w[k]][n] <br>
Estimate power spectrum in the radial direction [r]. Place x
or y immediately after -E to compute the spectrum in the x
or y direction instead. No grid file is created. If <br>
one grid is given then f (i.e., frequency or wave number),
power[f], and 1 standard deviation in power[f] are written
to the file set by -G [stdout]. If two grids are <br>
given we write f and 8 quantities: Xpower[f], Ypower[f],
coherent power[f], noise power[f], phase[f], admittance[f],
gain[f], coherency[f]. Each quantity is followed by <br>
its own 1-std dev error estimate, hence the output is 17
columns wide. Append w to write wavelength instead of
frequency. If your grid is geographic you may further <br>
append k to scale wavelengths from meter [Default] to km.
Finally, the spectrum is obtained by summing over several
frequencies. Append n to normalize so that the mean <br>
spectral values per frequency are reported instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F[r|x|y]params <br>
Filter the data. Place x or y immediately after -F to filter
x or y direction only; default is isotropic [r]. Choose
between a cosine-tapered band-pass, a Gaussian <br>
band-pass filter, or a Butterworth band-pass filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cosine-taper: <br>
Specify four wavelengths lc/lp/hp/hc in correct units (see
-fg) to design a bandpass filter: wavelengths greater than
lc or less than hc will be cut, wavelengths <br>
greater than lp and less than hp will be passed, and
wavelengths in between will be cosine-tapered. E.g.,
-F1000000/250000/50000/10000 -fg will bandpass, cutting <br>
wavelengths &gt; 1000 km and &lt; 10 km, passing wavelengths
between 250 km and 50 km. To make a highpass or lowpass
filter, give hyphens (-) for hp/hc or lc/lp. E.g., <br>
-Fx-/-/50/10 will lowpass x, passing wavelengths &gt; 50 and
rejecting wavelengths &lt; 10. -Fy1000/250/-/- will highpass
y, passing wavelengths &lt; 250 and rejecting wave&acirc;
<br>
lengths &gt; 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gaussian band-pass: <br>
Append lo/hi, the two wavelengths in correct units (see -fg)
to design a bandpass filter. At the given wavelengths the
Gaussian filter weights will be 0.5. To make <br>
a highpass or lowpass filter, give a hyphen (-) for the hi
or lo wavelength, respectively. E.g., -F-/30 will lowpass
the data using a Gaussian filter with <br>
half-weight at 30, while -F400/- will highpass the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Butterworth band-pass: <br>
Append lo/hi/order, the two wavelengths in correct units
(see -fg) and the filter order (an integer) to design a
bandpass filter. At the given cut-off wavelengths <br>
the Butterworth filter weights will be 0.707 (i.e., the
power spectrum will therefore be reduced by 0.5). To make a
highpass or lowpass filter, give a hyphen (-) <br>
for the hi or lo wavelength, respectively. E.g., -F-/30/2
will lowpass the data using a 2nd-order Butterworth filter,
with half-weight at 30, while -F400/-/2 will <br>
highpass the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Goutfile|table <br>
Filename for output netCDF grid file OR 1-D data table (see
-E). This is optional for -E (spectrum written to stdout)
but mandatory for all other options that require a <br>
grid output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[scale|g] <br>
Integrate the field, i.e., compute integral_over_z (field *
dz). This is equivalent to divide by kr in the frequency
domain (kr is radial wave number). Append a scale to <br>
divide by (kr * scale) instead. Alternatively, append g to
indicate that your data set is gravity anomalies in mGal and
output should be geoid heights in meters. [Default <br>
is no scale].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N[f|q|s|nx/ny][+a|[+d|h|l][+e|n|m][+twidth][+w[suffix]][+z[p]]
<br>
Choose or inquire about suitable grid dimensions for FFT and
set optional parameters. Control the FFT dimension: <br>
-Nf will force the FFT to use the actual dimensions of the
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nq will inQuire about more
suitable dimensions, report those, then continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ns will present a list of
optional dimensions, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nnx/ny will do FFT on array
size nx/ny (must be &gt;= grid file size). Default chooses
dimensions &gt;= data which optimize speed and accuracy of
FFT. If FFT dimensions &gt; <br>
grid file dimensions, data are extended and tapered to
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control detrending of data:
Append modifiers for removing a linear trend: <br>
+d: Detrend data, i.e. remove best-fitting linear trend
[Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+a: Only remove mean value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+h: Only remove mid value, i.e.
0.5 * (max + min).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+l: Leave data alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control extension and tapering
of data: Use modifiers to control how the extension and
tapering are to be performed: <br>
+e extends the grid by imposing edge-point symmetry
[Default],</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+m extends the grid by imposing
edge mirror symmetry</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+n turns off data extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tapering is performed from the
data edge to the FFT grid edge [100%]. Change this
percentage via +twidth. When +n is in effect, the tapering
is applied instead to the <br>
data margins as no extension is available [0%].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control writing of temporary
results: For detailed investigation you can write the
intermediate grid being passed to the forward FFT; this is
likely to have been <br>
detrended, extended by point-symmetry along all edges, and
tapered. Append +w[suffix] from which output file name(s)
will be created (i.e., ingrid_prefix.ext) [tapered], <br>
where ext is your file extension. Finally, you may save the
complex grid produced by the forward FFT by appending +z. By
default we write the real and imaginary components <br>
to ingrid_real.ext and ingrid_imag.ext. Append p to save
instead the polar form of magnitude and phase to files
ingrid_mag.ext and ingrid_phase.ext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sscale <br>
Multiply each element by scale in the space domain (after
the frequency domain operations). [Default is 1.0].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more ...) <br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg Geographic grids (dimensions
of longitude, latitude) will be converted to meters via a
&quot;Flat Earth&quot; approximation using the current
ellipsoid parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then
exits (NOTE: on Windows use just -).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+ or just + <br>
Print an extensive usage (help) message, including the
explanation of any module-specific option (but not the GMT
common options), then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? or no arguments <br>
Print a complete usage (help) message, including the
explanation of options, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID FILE FORMATS <br>
By default GMT writes out grid as single precision floats in
a COARDS-complaint netCDF file format. However, GMT is able
to produce grid files in many other commonly used grid <br>
file formats and also facilitates so called
&quot;packing&quot; of grids, writing out floating point
data as 1- or 2-byte integers. (more ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRID DISTANCE UNITS <br>
If the grid does not have meter as the horizontal unit,
append +uunit to the input file name to convert from the
specified unit to meter. If your grid is geographic, convert
<br>
distances to meters by supplying -fg instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSIDERATIONS <br>
netCDF COARDS grids will automatically be recognized as
geographic. For other grids geographical grids were you want
to convert degrees into meters, select -fg. If the data are
<br>
close to either pole, you should consider projecting the
grid file onto a rectangular coordinate system using
grdproject</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NORMALIZATION OF SPECTRUM <br>
By default, the power spectrum returned by -E simply sums
the contributions from frequencies that are part of the
output frequency. For x- or y-spectra this means summing the
<br>
power across the other frequency dimension, while for the
radial spectrum it means summing up power within each
annulus of width delta_q, the radial frequency (q) spacing.
A <br>
consequence of this summing is that the radial spectrum of a
white noise process will give a linear radial power spectrum
that is proportional to q. Appending n will instead <br>
compute the mean power per output frequency and in this case
the white noise process will have a white radial spectrum as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To upward continue the sea-level magnetic anomalies in the
file mag_0.nc to a level 800 m above sealevel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdfft mag_0.nc -C800 -V
-Gmag_800.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To transform geoid heights in m
(geoid.nc) on a geographical grid to free-air gravity
anomalies in mGal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdfft geoid.nc -Dg -V
-Ggrav.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To transform gravity anomalies
in mGal (faa.nc) to deflections of the vertical (in
micro-radians) in the 038 direction, we must first integrate
gravity to get geoid, then take <br>
the directional derivative, and finally scale radians to
micro-radians:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdfft faa.nc -Ig -A38 -S1e6
-V -Gdefl_38.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second vertical derivatives of
gravity anomalies are related to the curvature of the field.
We can compute these as mGal/m^2 by differentiating
twice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdfft gravity.nc -D -D -V
-Ggrav_2nd_derivative.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compute cross-spectral
estimates for co-registered bathymetry and gravity grids,
and report result as functions of wavelengths in km, try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdfft bathymetry.nc
gravity.grd -Ewk -fg -V &gt; cross_spectra.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To examine the pre-FFT grid
after detrending, point-symmetry reflection, and tapering
has been applied, as well as saving the real and imaginary
components of the raw spectrum of <br>
the data in topo.nc, try</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt grdfft topo.nc -N+w+z -fg
-V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can now make plots of the
data in topo_taper.nc, topo_real.nc, and topo_imag.nc.</p>
