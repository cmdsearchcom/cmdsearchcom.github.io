<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pinentry-kwallet &acirc; kwallet-based pass-phrase dialog
for use with GnuPG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pinentry-kwallet [-q] [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pinentry-kwallet is a kwallet- and pinentry-based
pass-phrase dialog for use with GnuPG. It is intended to be
called from the gpg-agent(1) daemon and not invoked
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pinentry-kwallet replaces the
regular pinentry-program stanza set in
~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf and looks up the passphrases
requested in the KWallet first, falling back to pinentry
<br>
only if not found. The user is given the option to store it
in the KWallet afterwards. Negative answers to this are also
stored in the KWallet to avoid asking each time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pinentry-kwallet (like other
pinentry variants) talks a simplified subset of the regular
Assuan protocol on stdio; all commands, even unknown ones,
are passed through to a pinentry <br>
co-process during run-time, even if the latter is never
used. It accepts the same options as pinentry, even unknown
ones, because it is designed to plug in. As an exception, -q
<br>
makes pinentry-kwallet more quiet (suppress warnings on
stderr), and -V displays the version on stderr (unless
-q).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pinentry-kwallet attempts
sophisticated error handling: if an error dialogue is
displayed, an internal counter is increased. If the counter
reaches 2, the value stored in the <br>
KWallet is ignored, and the user is asked anew. The counter
is stored in the KWallet, which is suboptimal but necessary,
because gpg2(1) does not re-use the Assuan sessions, <br>
instead spawning a new pinentry-kwallet each time a
passphrase is required (rather stupid). Error counters are
valid for 15 seconds since their last increasement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUES <br>
pinentry-kwallet exits 1 if it is called recursively, 0 if
help or version information are requested, and return codes
do not matter in any other cases because errors are
signalled <br>
in-band. It will exit 0 after the Assuan session is
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY The X11 display to use for child processes. If not
set, pinentry-kwallet will immediately replace itself with
the slave PINENTRY programme to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPG_TERM Terminal type of the
current tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPG_TTY The current
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PINENTRY The pinentry programme
to use. Default: &acirc;pinentry&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
pinentry-kwallet was written by mirabilos
&lt;m@mirbsd.org&gt; mostly for tarent solutions GmbH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Some newer pinentry features, such as three-button
operation, are not supported yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some commands, such as version
inquiry, as passed through to the pinentry coprocess
indiscriminately, which may lead to strange results, should
the protocol change or extend.</p>
