<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dbus-launch - Utility to start a message bus from a shell
script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dbus-launch [--version] [--help] [--sh-syntax]
[--csh-syntax] [--auto-syntax] [--binary-syntax]
[--close-stderr] [--exit-with-session]
[--autolaunch=MACHINEID] [--con&acirc; <br>
fig-file=FILENAME] [PROGRAM] [ARGS...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The dbus-launch command is used to start a session bus
instance of dbus-daemon from a shell script. It would
normally be called from a user&rsquo;s login scripts. Unlike
the daemon <br>
itself, dbus-launch exits, so backticks or the $() construct
can be used to read information from dbus-launch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments, dbus-launch
will launch a session bus instance and print the address and
PID of that instance to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may specify a program to be
run; in this case, dbus-launch will launch a session bus
instance, set the appropriate environment variables so the
specified program can find the <br>
bus, and then execute the specified program, with the
specified arguments. See below for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you launch a program,
dbus-launch will not print the information about the new bus
to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dbus-launch prints bus
information to standard output, by default it is in a simple
key-value pairs format. However, you may request several
alternate syntaxes using the <br>
--sh-syntax, --csh-syntax, --binary-syntax, or --auto-syntax
options. Several of these cause dbus-launch to emit shell
code to set up the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the --auto-syntax option,
dbus-launch looks at the value of the SHELL environment
variable to determine which shell syntax should be used. If
SHELL ends in &quot;csh&quot;, then <br>
csh-compatible code is emitted; otherwise Bourne shell code
is emitted. Instead of passing --auto-syntax, you may
explicitly specify a particular one by using --sh-syntax for
<br>
Bourne syntax, or --csh-syntax for csh syntax. In scripts,
it&rsquo;s more robust to avoid --auto-syntax and you
hopefully know which shell your script is written in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more
information about D-Bus. See also the man page for
dbus-daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Distributions running dbus-launch as part of a standard X
session should run dbus-launch --exit-with-session after the
X server has started and become available, as a wrapper <br>
around the &quot;main&quot; X client (typically a session
manager or window manager), as in these examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbus-launch --exit-with-session
gnome-session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbus-launch --exit-with-session
openbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbus-launch --exit-with-session
~/.xsession</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your distribution does not do
this, you can achieve similar results by running your
session or window manager in the same way in a script run by
your X session, such as <br>
~/.xsession, ~/.xinitrc or ~/.Xclients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start a D-Bus session within
a text-mode session, you can run dbus-launch in the
background. For instance, in a sh-compatible shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">## test for an existing bus
daemon, just to be safe <br>
if test -z &quot;$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS&quot; ; then <br>
## if not found, launch a new one <br>
eval &lsquo;dbus-launch --sh-syntax&lsquo; <br>
echo &quot;D-Bus per-session daemon address is:
$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS&quot; <br>
fi <br>
Note that in this case, dbus-launch will exit, and
dbus-daemon will not be terminated automatically on
logout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATIC LAUNCHING <br>
If DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is not set for a process that
tries to use D-Bus, by default the process will attempt to
invoke dbus-launch with the --autolaunch option to start up
a <br>
new session bus or find the existing bus address on the X
display or in a file in ~/.dbus/session-bus/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever an autolaunch occurs,
the application that had to start a new bus will be in its
own little world; it can effectively end up starting a whole
new session if it tries to <br>
use a lot of bus services. This can be suboptimal or even
totally broken, depending on the app and what it tries to
do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two common reasons for
autolaunch. One is ssh to a remote machine. The ideal fix
for that would be forwarding of DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in
the same way that DISPLAY <br>
is forwarded. In the meantime, you can edit the session.conf
config file to have your session bus listen on TCP, and
manually set DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, if you like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second common reason for
autolaunch is an su to another user, and display of X
applications running as the second user on the display
belonging to the first user. Perhaps the <br>
ideal fix in this case would be to allow the second user to
connect to the session bus of the first user, just as they
can connect to the first user&rsquo;s display. However, a
mecha&acirc; <br>
nism for that has not been coded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can always avoid autolaunch
by manually setting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS. Autolaunch
happens because the default address if none is set is
&quot;autolaunch:&quot;, so if any other <br>
address is set there will be no autolaunch. You can however
include autolaunch in an explicit session bus address as a
fallback, for example
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=&quot;some&acirc; <br>
thing:,autolaunch:&quot; - in that case if the first address
doesn&rsquo;t work, processes will autolaunch. (The bus
address variable contains a comma-separated list of
addresses to try.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --autolaunch option is
considered an internal implementation detail of libdbus, and
in fact there are plans to change it. There&rsquo;s no real
reason to use it outside of the lib&acirc; <br>
dbus implementation anyhow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-syntax <br>
Choose --csh-syntax or --sh-syntax based on the SHELL
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary-syntax Write to stdout
a nul-terminated bus address, then the bus PID as a binary
integer of size sizeof(pid_t), then the bus X window ID as a
binary integer of <br>
size sizeof(long). Integers are in the machine&rsquo;s byte
order, not network byte order or any other canonical byte
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--close-stderr <br>
Close the standard error output stream before starting the
D-Bus daemon. This is useful if you want to capture
dbus-launch error messages but you don&rsquo;t want
dbus-daemon to <br>
keep the stream open to your application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config-file=FILENAME <br>
Pass --config-file=FILENAME to the bus daemon, instead of
passing it the --session argument. See the man page for
dbus-daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--csh-syntax <br>
Emit csh compatible code to set up environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exit-with-session <br>
If this option is provided, a persistent
&quot;babysitter&quot; process will be created that watches
stdin for HUP and tries to connect to the X server. If this
process gets a HUP <br>
on stdin or loses its X connection, it kills the message bus
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--autolaunch=MACHINEID <br>
This option implies that dbus-launch should scan for a
previously-started session and reuse the values found there.
If no session is found, it will start a new session. <br>
The --exit-with-session option is implied if --autolaunch is
given. This option is for the exclusive use of libdbus, you
do not want to use it manually. It may change in <br>
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sh-syntax <br>
Emit Bourne-shell compatible code to set up environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version of dbus-launch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print the help info of
dbus-launch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If you run dbus-launch myapp (with any other options),
dbus-daemon will not exit when myapp terminates: this is
because myapp is assumed to be part of a larger session,
rather <br>
than a session in its own right.</p>
