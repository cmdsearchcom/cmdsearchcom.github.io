<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Qsub submits batch jobs to the Sun Grid Engine queuing
system. Sun Grid Engine supports single- and multiple-node
jobs. Command can be a path to a binary or a script (see -b
<br>
below) which contains the commands to be run by the job
using a shell (for example, sh(1) or csh(1)). Arguments to
the command are given as command_args to qsub . If command
is <br>
handled as a script then it is possible to embed flags in
the script. If the first two characters of a script line
either match &rsquo;#$&rsquo; or are equal to the prefix
string defined <br>
with the -C option described below, the line is parsed for
embedded command flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qsh submits an interactive
X-windows session to Sun Grid Engine. An xterm(1) is brought
up from the executing machine with the display directed
either to the X-server indicated <br>
by the DISPLAY environment variable or as specified with the
-display qsh option. Interactive jobs are not spooled if no
resource is available to execute them. They are either <br>
dispatched to a suitable machine for execution immediately
or the user submitting the job is notified by qsh that
appropriate resources to execute the job are not available.
<br>
xterm_args are passed to the xterm(1) executable. Note,
however, that the -e and -ls xterm options do not work with
qsh .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qlogin is similar to qsh in that
it submits an interactive job to the queuing system. It does
not open an xterm(1) window on the X display, but uses the
current terminal for user <br>
I/O. Usually, qlogin establishes a telnet(1) connection with
the remote host, using standard client- and server-side
commands. These commands can be configured with the
qlo&acirc; <br>
gin_daemon (server-side, Sun Grid Engine telnetd if not set,
otherwise something like /usr/sbin/in.telnetd) and
qlogin_command (client-side, Sun Grid Engine telnet if not
set, <br>
otherwise something like /usr/bin/telnet) parameters in the
global and local configuration settings of sge_conf(5). The
client side command is automatically parameterized with <br>
the remote host name and port number to which to connect,
resulting in an invocation like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/bin/telnet my_exec_host
2442</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for example. Qlogin is invoked
exactly like qsh and its jobs can only run on INTERACTIVE
queues. Qlogin jobs can only be used if the sge_execd(8) is
running under the root <br>
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qrsh is similar to qlogin in
that it submits an interactive job to the queuing system. It
uses the current terminal for user I/O. Usually, qrsh
establishes a rsh(1) connection <br>
with the remote host. If no command is given to qrsh, an
rlogin(1) session is established. The server-side commands
used can be configured with the rsh_daemon and rlogin_daemon
<br>
parameters in the global and local configuration settings of
sge_conf(5). An Sun Grid Engine rshd or rlogind is used if
the parameters are not set. If the parameters are set, <br>
they should be set to something like /usr/sbin/in.rshd or
/usr/sbin/in.rlogind. On the client-side, the rsh_command
and rlogin_command parameters can be set in the global and
<br>
local configuration settings of sge_conf(5). If they are not
set, special Sun Grid Engine rsh(1) and rlogin(1) binaries
delivered with Sun Grid Engine are used. Use the cluster
<br>
configuration parameters to integrate mechanisms like ssh or
the rsh(1) and rlogin(1) facilities supplied with the
operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qrsh jobs can only run in
INTERACTIVE queues unless the option -now no is used (see
below). They can also only be run, if the sge_execd(8) is
running under the root account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qrsh provides an additional
useful feature for integrating with interactive tools
providing a specific command shell. If the environment
variable QRSH_WRAPPER is set when qrsh is <br>
invoked, the command interpreter pointed to by QRSH_WRAPPER
will be executed to run qrsh commands instead of the users
login shell or any shell specified in the qrsh command- <br>
line. The options -cwd, -v, -V, and -display only apply to
batch jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter can be used to change the
attributes of pending jobs. For array jobs with a mix of
running and pending tasks (see the -t option below),
modification with qalter only <br>
affects the pending tasks. Qalter can change most of the
characteristics of a job (see the corresponding statements
in the OPTIONS section below), including those which were
<br>
defined as embedded flags in the script file (see above).
Some submit options, such as the job script, cannot be
changed with I. qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qresub allows the user to create
jobs as copies of existing pending or running jobs. The
copied jobs will have exactly the same attributes as the
ones from which they were <br>
copied, except with a new job ID and with a cleared hold
state. The only modification to the copied jobs supported by
qresub is assignment of a new hold state with the -h option.
<br>
This option can be used to first copy a job and then change
its attributes via qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only a manager can use qresub on
jobs submitted by another user. Regular users can only use
qresub on their own jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For qsub, qsh, qrsh, and qlogin
the administrator and the user may define default request
files (see sge_request(5)) which can contain any of the
options described below. If an <br>
option in a default request file is understood by qsub and
qlogin but not by qsh the option is silently ignored if qsh
is invoked. Thus you can maintain shared default request
<br>
files for both qsub and qsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A cluster wide default request
file may be placed under
$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request. User private default
request files are processed under the locations <br>
$HOME/.sge_request and $cwd/.sge_request. The working
directory local default request file has the highest
precedence, then the home directory located file and then
the cluster <br>
global file. The option arguments, the embedded script flags
and the options in the default request files are processed
in the following order:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left to right in the script
line, <br>
left to right in the default request files, <br>
from top to bottom of the script file (qsub only), <br>
from top to bottom of default request files, <br>
from left to right of the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, the command line
can be used to override the embedded flags and the default
request settings. The embedded flags, however, will override
the default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that the -clear option can
be used to discard any previous settings at any time in a
default request file, in the embedded script flags, or in a
command-line option. It is, <br>
however, not available with qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options described below can
be requested either hard or soft. By default, all requests
are considered hard until the -soft option (see below) is
encountered. The hard/soft <br>
status remains in effect until its counterpart is
encountered again. If all the hard requests for a job cannot
be met, the job will not be scheduled. Jobs which cannot be
run <br>
at the present time remain spooled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-@ optionfile <br>
Forces qsub, qrsh, qsh, or qlogin to use the options
contained in optionfile. The indicated file may contain all
valid options. Comment lines must start with a &quot;#&quot;
sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a date_time <br>
Available for qsub and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines or redefines the time
and date at which a job is eligible for execution. Date_time
conforms to [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS], for the details, please
see Date_time in: <br>
sge_types(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used with qsub
or if a corresponding value is specified in qmon then a
parameter named a and the value in the format
CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS will be passed to <br>
the defined JSV instances (see -jsv option below or find
more information concerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ac variable[=value],... <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds the given name/value
pair(s) to the job&rsquo;s context. Value may be omitted.
Sun Grid Engine appends the given argument to the list of
context variables for the job. <br>
Multiple -ac, -dc, and -sc options may be given. The order
is important here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The outcome of the evaluation of
all -ac, -dc, and -sc options or corresponding values in
qmon is passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name ac. (see -jsv <br>
option below or find more information concerning JSV in
jsv(1)) QALTER allows changing this option even while the
job executes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ar ar_id <br>
Available for qsub, qalter, qrsh, qsh, or qlogin only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assigns the submitted job to be
a part of an existing Advance Reservation. The complete list
of existing Advance Reservations can be obtained using the
qrstat(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the -ar option adds
implicitly the -w e option if not otherwise requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes. The modified parameter
will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name ar. (see -jsv option below <br>
or find more information concerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A account_string <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Identifies the account to which
the resource consumption of the job should be charged. The
account_string should conform to the name definition in M
sge_types 1 . In the <br>
absence of this parameter Sun Grid Engine will place the
default account string &quot;sge&quot; in the accounting
record of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name A. (see -jsv option below <br>
or find more information concerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-binding [ binding_instance ]
binding_strategy <br>
A job can request a specific processor core binding
(processor affinity) with this parameter. This request is
neither a hard nor a soft request, it is a hint for the
exe&acirc; <br>
cution host to do this if possible. Please note that the
requested binding strategy is not used for resource
selection within Sun Grid Engine. As a result an
execu&acirc; <br>
tion host might be selected where Sun Grid Engine does not
even know the hardware topology and therefore is not able to
apply the requested binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enforce Sun Grid Engine to
select hardware on which the binding can be applied please
use the -l switch in combination with the complex attribute
m_topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binding_instance is an optional
parameter. It might either be env, pe or set depending on
which instance should accomplish the job to core binding. If
the value for bind&acirc; <br>
ing_instance is not specified then set will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">env means that the environment
variable SGE_BINDING will be exported to the job environment
of the job. This variable contains the selected operating
system internal pro&acirc; <br>
cessor numbers. They might be more than selected cores in
presence of SMT or CMT because each core could be
represented by multiple processor identifiers. The processor
<br>
numbers are space separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pe means that the information
about the selected cores appears in the fourth column of the
pe_hostfile. Here the logical core and socket numbers are
printed (they start at <br>
0 and have no holes) in colon separated pairs (i.e. 0,0:1,0
which means core 0 on socket 0 and core 0 on socket 1). For
more information about the $pe_hostfile check <br>
sge_pe(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set (default if nothing else is
specified). The binding strategy is applied by Sun Grid
Engine. How this is achieved depends on the underlying
hardware architecture of the <br>
execution host where the submitted job will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Solaris 10 hosts a processor
set will be created where the job can exclusively run in.
Because of operating system limitations at least one core
must remain unbound. <br>
This resource could of course used by an unbound job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux hosts a processor
affinity mask will be set to restrict the job to run
exclusively on the selected cores. The operating system
allows other unbound processes to <br>
use these cores. Please note that on Linux the binding
requires a Linux kernel version of 2.6.16 or greater. It
might be even possible to use a kernel with lower version
<br>
number but in that case additional kernel patches have to be
applied. The loadcheck tool in the utilbin directory can be
used to check if the hosts capabilities. You can <br>
also use the -sep in combination with -cb of qconf(5)
command to identify if Sun Grid Engine is able to recognize
the hardware topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible values for
binding_strategy are as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">linear:&lt;amount&gt;[:&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;]
<br>

striding:&lt;amount&gt;:&lt;n&gt;[:&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;]
<br>

explicit:[&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;;...]&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the binding strategy linear
and striding there is an optional socket and core pair
attached. These denotes the mandatory starting point for the
first core to bind on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linear means that Sun Grid
Engine tries to bind the job on amount successive cores. If
socket and core is omitted then Sun Grid Engine first
allocates successive cores on <br>
the first empty socket found. Empty means that there are no
jobs bound to the socket by Sun Grid Engine. If this is not
possible or is not sufficient Sun Grid Engine <br>
tries to find (further) cores on the socket with the most
unbound cores and so on. If the amount of allocated cores is
lower than requested cores, no binding is done for <br>
the job. If socket and core is specified then Sun Grid
Engine tries to find amount of empty cores beginning with
this starting point. If this is not possible then binding
<br>
is not done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">striding means that Sun Grid
Engine tries to find cores with a certain offset. It will
select amount of empty cores with a offset of n -1 cores in
between. Start point <br>
for the search algorithm is socket 0 core 0. As soon as
amount cores are found they will be used to do the job
binding. If there are not enough empty cores or if correct
<br>
offset cannot be achieved then there will be no binding
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">explicit binds the specified
sockets and cores that are mentioned in the provided
socket/core list. Each socket/core pair has to be specified
only once. If a socket/core <br>
pair is already in use by a different job the whole binding
request will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes. The modified parameter
will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then these values
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameters with
the names binding_strategy, bind&acirc; <br>
ing_type, binding_amount, binding_step, binding_socket,
binding_core, binding_exp_n, binding_exp_socket&lt;id&gt;,
binding_exp_core&lt;id&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the length of
the socket/core value list of the explicit binding is
reported as binding_exp_n. &lt;id&gt; will be replaced by
the position of the socket/core <br>
pair within the explicit list (0 &lt;= id &lt;
binding_exp_n). The first socket/core pair of the explicit
binding will be reported with the parameter names
binding_exp_socket0 <br>
and binding_exp_core0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values that do not apply for the
specified binding will not be reported to JSV. E.g.
binding_step will only be reported for the striding binding
and all binding_exp_* <br>
values will passed to JSV if explicit binding was specified.
(see -jsv option below or find more information concerning
JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b y[es]|n[o] <br>
Available for qsub, qrsh only. Qalter does not allow
changing this option. This option cannot be embedded in the
script file itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gives the user the possibility
to indicate explicitly whether command should be treated as
binary or script. If the value of -b is &rsquo;y&rsquo;,
then command may be a binary or <br>
script. The command might not be accessible from the
submission host. Nothing except the path of the command will
be transferred from the submission host to the execu&acirc;
<br>
tion host. Path aliasing will be applied to the path of
command before command will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of -b is
&rsquo;n&rsquo; then command needs to be a script and it
will be handled as script. The script file has to be
accessible by the submission host. It will be <br>
transferred to the execution host. qsub/qrsh will search
directive prefixes within script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsub will implicitly use -b n
whereas qrsh will apply the -b y option if nothing else is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value specified with this
option or the corresponding value specified in qmon will
only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is yes.
The name of the param&acirc; <br>
eter will be b. The value will be y also when then long form
yes was specified during submission. (see -jsv option below
or find more information concerning JSV in <br>
jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that submission of
command as script (-b n) can have a significant performance
impact, especially for short running jobs and big job
scripts. Script submis&acirc; <br>
sion adds a number of operations to the submission process:
The job script needs to be <br>
- parsed at client side (for special comments) <br>
- transferred from submit client to qmaster <br>
- spooled in qmaster <br>
- transferred to execd at job execution <br>
- spooled in execd <br>
- removed from spooling both in execd and qmaster once the
job is done <br>
If job scripts are available on the execution nodes, e.g.
via NFS, binary submission can be the better choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c occasion_specifier <br>
Available for qsub and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines or redefines whether the
job should be checkpointed, and if so, under what
circumstances. The specification of the checkpointing
occasions with this option over&acirc; <br>
writes the definitions of the when parameter in the
checkpointing environment (see checkpoint(5)) referenced by
the qsub -ckpt switch. Possible values for
occasion_speci&acirc; <br>
fier are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n no checkpoint is performed.
<br>
s checkpoint when batch server is shut down. <br>
m checkpoint at minimum CPU interval. <br>
x checkpoint when job gets suspended. <br>
&lt;interval&gt; checkpoint in the specified time
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The minimum CPU interval is
defined in the queue configuration (see queue_conf(5) for
details). &lt;interval&gt; has to be specified in the format
hh:mm:ss. The maximum of <br>
&lt;interval&gt; and the queue&rsquo;s minimum CPU interval
is used if &lt;interval&gt; is specified. This is done to
ensure that a machine is not overloaded by checkpoints being
generated <br>
too frequently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value specified with this
option or the corresponding value specified in qmon will be
passed to defined JSV instances. The &lt;interval&gt; will
be available as parameter <br>
with the name c_interval. The character sequence specified
will be available as parameter with the name c_occasion.
Please note that if you change c_occasion via JSV then <br>
the last setting of c_interval will be overwritten and vice
versa. (see -jsv option below or find more information
concerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ckpt ckpt_name <br>
Available for qsub and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selects the checkpointing
environment (see checkpoint(5)) to be used for checkpointing
the job. Also declares the job to be a checkpointing
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name ckpt. (see -jsv option <br>
below or find more information concerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clear Available for qsub, qsh,
qrsh, and qlogin only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes all elements of the job
to be reset to the initial default status prior to applying
any modifications (if any) appearing in this specific
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cwd Available for qsub, qsh,
qrsh and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute the job from the current
working directory. This switch will activate Sun Grid
Engine&rsquo;s path aliasing facility, if the corresponding
configuration files are <br>
present (see sge_aliases(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of qalter, the
previous definition of the current working directory will be
overwritten if qalter is executed from a different directory
than the preceding <br>
qsub or qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes. The modified parameter
will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name cwd. The value of this <br>
parameter will be the absolute path to the current working
directory. JSV scripts can remove the path from jobs during
the verification process by setting the value of <br>
this parameter to an empty string. As a result the job
behaves as if -cwd was not specified during job submission.
(see -jsv option below or find more information con&acirc;
<br>
cerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C prefix_string <br>
Available for qsub and qrsh with script submission (-b
n).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prefix_string defines the prefix
that declares a directive in the job&rsquo;s command. The
prefix is not a job attribute, but affects the behavior of
qsub and qrsh. If prefix is <br>
a null string, the command will not be scanned for embedded
directives. <br>
The directive prefix consists of two ASCII characters which,
when appearing in the first two bytes of a script line,
indicate that what follows is an Sun Grid Engine com&acirc;
<br>
mand. The default is &quot;#$&quot;. <br>
The user should be aware that changing the first delimiting
character can produce unforeseen side effects. If the script
file contains anything other than a &quot;#&quot; character
<br>
in the first byte position of the line, the shell processor
for the job will reject the line and may exit the job
prematurely. <br>
If the -C option is present in the script file, it is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dc variable,... <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removes the given variable(s)
from the job&rsquo;s context. Multiple -ac, -dc, and -sc
options may be given. The order is important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The outcome of the evaluation of
all -ac, -dc, and -sc options or corresponding values in
qmon is passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name ac. (see -jsv <br>
option below or find more information concerning JSV in
jsv(1))</p>

Available for qsh and qrsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directs xterm(1) to use
display_specifier in order to contact the X server. The
display_specifier has to contain the hostname part of the
display name (e.g. myhost:1). <br>
Local display names (e.g. :0) cannot be used in grid
environments. Values set with the -display option overwrite
settings from the submission environment and from -v

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with

which a deadline job has to reach <br>
top priority to be able to complete within a given deadline.
Before the deadline initiation time the priority of a
deadline job will be raised steadily until it reaches <br>
the maximum as configured by the Sun Grid Engine

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e [[hostname]:]path,... <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines or redefines the path
used for the standard error stream of the job. For qsh, qrsh
and qlogin only the standard error stream of prolog and
epilog is redirected. <br>
If the path constitutes an absolute path name, the
error-path attribute of the job is set to path, including
the hostname. If the path name is relative, Sun Grid Engine
<br>
expands path either with the current working directory path
(if the -cwd switch (see above) is also specified) or with
the home directory path. If hostname is present, the <br>
standard error stream will be placed in the corresponding
location only if the job runs on the specified host. If the
path contains a &quot;:&quot; without a hostname, a leading
&quot;:&quot; <br>
has to be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the file name for
interactive jobs is /dev/null. For batch jobs the default
file name has the form job_name.ejob_id and
job_name.ejob_id.task_id for array job <br>
tasks (see -t option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If path is a directory, the
standard error stream of the job will be put in this
directory under the default file name. If the pathname
contains certain pseudo environ&acirc; <br>
ment variables, their value will be expanded at runtime of
the job and will be used to constitute the standard error
stream path name. The following pseudo environment <br>
variables are supported currently:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME home directory on
execution machine <br>
$USER user ID of job owner <br>
$JOB_ID current job ID <br>
$JOB_NAME current job name (see -N option) <br>
$HOSTNAME name of the execution host <br>
$TASK_ID array job task index number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively to $HOME the tilde
sign &quot;~&quot; can be used as common in csh(1) or
ksh(1). Note, that the &quot;~&quot; sign also works in
combination with user names, so that
&quot;~&lt;user&gt;&quot; <br>
expands to the home directory of &lt;user&gt;. Using another
user ID than that of the job owner requires corresponding
permissions, of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes. The modified parameter
will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signifies that all -q and -l
resource requirements following in the command line will be
hard requirements and must be satisfied in full before a job
can be scheduled. <br>
As Sun Grid Engine scans the command line and script file
for Sun Grid Engine options and parameters it builds a list
of resources required by a job. All such resource <br>
requests are considered as absolutely essential for the job
to commence. If the -soft option (see below) is encountered
during the scan then all following resources are <br>
designated as &quot;soft requirements&quot; for execution,
or &quot;nice-to-have, but not essential&quot;. If the -hard
flag is encountered at a later stage of the scan, all
resource requests <br>
following it once again become &quot;essential&quot;. The
-hard and -soft options in effect act as &quot;toggles&quot;
during the scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then the
corresponding -q and -l resource requirements will be passed
to defined JSV instances as parameter <br>

the -h switch:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;U&rsquo; removes a user
hold. <br>
&lsquo;S&rsquo; removes a system hold. <br>
&lsquo;O&rsquo; removes a operator hold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun Grid Engine managers can
assign and remove all hold types, Sun Grid Engine operators
can assign and remove user and operator holds, and users can
only assign or remove <br>
user holds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of qsub only user
holds can be placed on a job and thus only the first form of
the option with the -h switch alone is allowed. As opposed
to this, qalter <br>
requires the second form described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternate means to assign
hold is provided by the qhold(1) facility.</p>

interpreted. As a replacement <br>
to option -cwd please use -v PWD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually a task should have the

supported by Sun Grid Engine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of the Share Tree
Policy, users can distribute the tickets to which they are
currently entitled among their jobs using different shares
assigned via -js. If all <br>

given to qrsh in a user&rsquo;s login shell, i.e. execute it
without the wrapping shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to speed
up execution as some overhead, like the shell startup and
sourcing the shell resource files, is avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can only be used if
no shell-specific command line parsing is required. If the
command line contains shell syntax like environment variable
substitution or <br>
(back) quoting, a shell must be started. In this case,
either do not use the -noshell option or include the shell
call in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: <br>
qrsh echo &rsquo;$HOSTNAME&rsquo; <br>
Alternative call with the -noshell option <br>
qrsh -noshell /bin/tcsh -f -c &rsquo;echo
$HOSTNAME&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdin <br>
Available only for qrsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress the input stream STDIN
- qrsh will pass the option -n to the rsh(1) command. This
is especially useful, if multiple tasks are executed in
parallel using qrsh, <br>
e.g. in a make(1) process - it would be undefined, which
process would get the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o [[hostname]:]path,... <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path used for the standard
output stream of the job. The path is handled as described
in the -e option for the standard error stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the file name for
standard output has the form job_name.ojob_id and
job_name.ojob_id.task_id for array job tasks (see -t option
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes. The modified parameter
will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p priority <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines or redefines the
priority of the job relative to other jobs. Priority is an
integer in the range -1023 to 1024. The default priority
value for jobs is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Users may only decrease the
priority of their jobs. Sun Grid Engine managers and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pty y[es]|n[o] <br>
Available for qrsh and qlogin only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pty yes enforces the job to be
started in a pseudo terminal (pty). If no pty is available,
the job start fails. -pty no enforces the job to be started
without a pty. By <br>
default, qrsh without a command and qlogin start the job in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R y[es]|n[o] <br>
Available for qsub, qrsh, qsh, qlogin and qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indicates whether a reservation

immediate jobs, i.e. jobs submitted using the -now yes
option. Please note that <br>
regardless of the reservation request, job reservation might
be disabled using max_reservation in sched_conf(5) and might
be limited only to a certain number of high pri&acirc; <br>

the job will be rerun if the job was aborted without leaving
a consistent exit state. <br>
(This is typically the case if the node on which the job is
running crashes). If -r is &rsquo;no&rsquo;, the job will

Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the given name/value pairs
as the job&rsquo;s context. Value may be omitted. Sun Grid
Engine replaces the job&rsquo;s previously defined context
with the one given as the argu&acirc; <br>
ment. Multiple -ac, -dc, and -sc options may be given. The
order is important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contexts provide a way to
dynamically attach and remove meta-information to and from a
job. The context variables are not passed to the job&rsquo;s
execution context in its <br>

jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shell y[es]|n[o] <br>
Available only for qsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shell n causes qsub to execute
the command line directly, as if by exec(2). No command
shell will be executed for the job. This option only applies
when -b y is also <br>
used. Without -b y, -shell n has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used to speed
up execution as some overhead, like the shell startup and
sourcing the shell resource files is avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can only be used if
no shell-specific command line parsing is required. If the
command line contains shell syntax, like environment
variable substitution or <br>
(back) quoting, a shell must be started. In this case either
do not use the -shell n option or execute the shell as the
command line and pass the path to the executable <br>
as a parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a job executed with the
-shell n option fails due to a user error, such as an
invalid path to the executable, the job will enter the error
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shell y cancels the effect of a
previous -shell n. Otherwise, it has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See -b and -noshell for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value specified with this

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-soft Available for qsub, qsh,
qrsh, qlogin and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signifies that all resource
requirements following in the command line will be soft
requirements and are to be filled on an &quot;as
available&quot; basis. <br>
As Sun Grid Engine scans the command line and script file
for Sun Grid Engine options and parameters, it builds a list
of resources required by the job. All such resource <br>
requests are considered as absolutely essential for the job
to commence. If the -soft option is encountered during the
scan then all following resources are designated as <br>
&quot;soft requirements&quot; for execution, or
&quot;nice-to-have, but not essential&quot;. If the -hard
flag (see above) is encountered at a later stage of the
scan, all resource requests <br>
following it once again become &quot;essential&quot;. The
-hard and -soft options in effect act as &quot;toggles&quot;
during the scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then the
corresponding -q and -l resource requirements will be passed
to defined JSV instances as parameter <br>
with the names q_soft and l_soft. Find for information in
the sections describing -q and -l. (see -jsv option above or
find more information concerning JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sync y[es]|n[o] <br>
Available for qsub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sync y causes qsub to wait for
the job to complete before exiting. If the job completes
successfully, qsub&rsquo;s exit code will be that of the
completed job. If the job <br>
fails to complete successfully, qsub will print out a error
message indicating why the job failed and will have an exit
code of 1. If qsub is interrupted, e.g. with CTRL- <br>
C, before the job completes, the job will be canceled. <br>
With the -sync n option, qsub will exit with an exit code of
0 as soon as the job is submitted successfully. -sync n is
default for qsub. <br>
If -sync y is used in conjunction with -now y, qsub will
behave as though only -now y were given until the job has
been successfully scheduled, after which time qsub will <br>
behave as though only -sync y were given. <br>
If -sync y is used in conjunction with -t n[-m[:i]], qsub
will wait for all the job&rsquo;s tasks to complete before
exiting. If all the job&rsquo;s tasks complete successfully,
<br>
qsub&rsquo;s exit code will be that of the first completed
job tasks with a non-zero exit code, or 0 if all job tasks
exited with an exit code of 0. If any of the job&rsquo;s
tasks <br>
fail to complete successfully, qsub will print out an error
message indicating why the job task(s) failed and will have
an exit code of 1. If qsub is interrupted, e.g. <br>
with CTRL-C, before the job completes, all of the
job&rsquo;s tasks will be canceled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information that this switch was

jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S [[hostname]:]pathname,...
<br>
Available for qsub, qsh and qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies the interpreting shell
for the job. Only one pathname component without a host
specifier is valid and only one path name for a given host
is allowed. Shell paths <br>
with host assignments define the interpreting shell for the
job if the host is the execution host. The shell path
without host specification is used if the execution host
<br>
matches none of the hosts in the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, the pathname can be
constructed with pseudo environment variables as described
for the -e option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of qsh the specified
shell path is used to execute the corresponding command
interpreter in the xterm(1) (via its -e option) started on
behalf of the interac&acirc; <br>
tive job. Qalter allows changing this option even while the
job executes. The modified parameter will only be in effect
after a restart or migration of the job, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with
the name S. (see -jsv option above <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t n[-m[:s]] <br>
Available for qsub and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submits a so called Array Job,
i.e. an array of identical tasks being differentiated only
by an index number and being treated by Sun Grid Engine
almost like a series of <br>
jobs. The option argument to -t specifies the number of
array job tasks and the index number which will be
associated with the tasks. The index numbers will be
exported to <br>
the job tasks via the environment variable SGE_TASK_ID. The
option arguments n, m and s will be available through the
environment variables SGE_TASK_FIRST, SGE_TASK_LAST <br>
and SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following restrictions apply to
the values n and m:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 &lt;= n &lt;= MIN(2^31-1,
max_aj_tasks) <br>
1 &lt;= m &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks) <br>
n &lt;= m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_aj_tasks is defined in the
cluster configuration (see sge_conf(5))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The task id range specified in
the option argument may be a single number, a simple range
of the form n-m or a range with a step size. Hence, the task
id range specified <br>
by 2-10:2 would result in the task id indexes 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 10, for a total of 5 identical tasks, each with the
environment variable SGE_TASK_ID containing one of the 5
<br>
index numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All array job tasks inherit the
same resource requests and attribute definitions as
specified in the qsub or qalter command line, except for the
-t option. The tasks are <br>
scheduled independently and, provided enough resources
exist, concurrently, very much like separate jobs. However,
an array job or a sub-array there of can be accessed as <br>
a single unit by commands like qmod(1) or qdel(1). See the
corresponding manual pages for further detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Array jobs are commonly used to
execute the same type of operation on varying input data
sets correlated with the task index number. The number of
tasks in a array job is <br>
unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT and STDERR of array job
tasks will be written into different files with the default
location</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;jobname&gt;.[&rsquo;e&rsquo;|&rsquo;o&rsquo;]&lt;job_id&gt;&rsquo;.&rsquo;&lt;task_id&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to change this default,
the -e and -o options (see above) can be used together with
the pseudo environment variables $HOME, $USER, $JOB_ID,
$JOB_NAME, $HOSTNAME, <br>
and $SGE_TASK_ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that you can use the
output redirection to divert the output of all tasks into
the same file, but the result of this is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option or a
corresponding value in qmon is specified then this value
will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameters with
the name t_min, t_max and t_step <br>
(see -jsv option above or find more information concerning
JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tc max_running_tasks <br>
-allow users to limit concurrent array job task execution.
Parameter max_running_tasks specifies maximum number of
simultaneously running tasks. For example we have run&acirc;
<br>
ning SGE with 10 free slots. We call qsub -t 1-100 -tc 2
jobscript. Then only 2 tasks will be scheduled to run even
when 8 slots are free.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-terse Available for qsub
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-terse causes the qsub to
display only the job-id of the job being submitted rather
than the regular &quot;Your job ...&quot; string. In case of
an error the error is reported on <br>
stderr as usual. <br>
This can be helpful for scripts which need to parse qsub
output to get the job-id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information that this switch was

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u username,... <br>
Available for qalter only. Changes are only made on those
jobs which were submitted by users specified in the list of
usernames. For managers it is possible to use the <br>
qalter -u &rsquo;*&rsquo; command to modify all jobs of all
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the -u switch it is
not permitted to specify an additional
wc_job_range_list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v variable[=value],... <br>
Available for qsub, qrsh (with command argument) and
qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines or redefines the
environment variables to be exported to the execution
context of the job. If the -v option is present Sun Grid
Engine will add the environment <br>
variables defined as arguments to the switch and,
optionally, values of specified variables, to the execution
context of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Qalter allows changing this
option even while the job executes. The modified parameter
will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All environment variables
specified with -v, -V or the DISPLAY variable provided with
-display will be exported to the defined JSV instances only
optionally when this is <br>
requested explicitly during the job submission verification.
(see -jsv option above or find more information concerning
JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Available only for qrsh and qmake(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike qsh and qlogin, qrsh does
not output any informational messages while establishing the
session, compliant with the standard rsh(1) and rlogin(1)
system calls. If <br>
the option -verbose is set, qrsh behaves like the qsh and
qlogin commands, printing information about the process of
establishing the rsh(1) or rlogin(1) session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verify <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of submitting a job,
prints detailed information about the would-be job as though
qstat(1) -j were used, including the effects of command-line
parameters and the <br>
external environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh
with command and qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies that all environment
variables active within the qsub utility be exported to the
context of the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All environment variables
specified with -v, -V or the DISPLAY variable provided with
-display will be exported to the defined JSV instances only
optionally when this is <br>

(see -jsv option above or find more information concerning
JSV in jsv(1))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w e|w|n|p|v <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh, qlogin and qalter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a validation level
applied to the job to be submitted (qsub, qlogin, and qsh)
or the specified queued job (qalter). The information
displayed indicates whether <br>
the job can possibly be scheduled assuming an empty system
with no other jobs. Resource requests exceeding the
configured maximal thresholds or requesting unavailable <br>
resource attributes are possible causes for jobs to fail
this validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specifiers e, w, n and v
define the following validation modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;e&rsquo; error - jobs
with invalid requests will be <br>
rejected. <br>
&lsquo;w&rsquo; warning - only a warning will be displayed
<br>
for invalid requests. <br>
&lsquo;n&rsquo; none - switches off validation; the default
for <br>
qsub, qalter, qrsh, qsh <br>
and qlogin. <br>
&lsquo;p&rsquo; poke - does not submit the job but prints a
<br>
validation report based on a cluster as is with <br>
all resource utilizations in place. <br>
&lsquo;v&rsquo; verify - does not submit the job but prints
a <br>
validation report based on an empty cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that the necessary checks
are performance consuming and hence the checking is switched
off by default. It should also be noted that load values are
not taken into <br>
account with the verification since they are assumed to be
too volatile. To cause -w e verification to be passed at
submission time, it is possible to specify non-volatile <br>
values (non-consumables) or maximum values (consumables) in
complex_values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wd working_dir <br>
Available for qsub, qsh, qrsh and qalter only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute the job from the
