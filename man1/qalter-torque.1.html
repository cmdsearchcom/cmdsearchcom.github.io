<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qalter - alter pbs batch job</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qalter [-a date_time] [-A account_string] [-c interval] [-e
path] [-h hold_list] [-j join] [-k keep] [-l resource_list]
[-m mail_options] [-M user_list] [-n node exclusive] [-N
<br>
name] [-o path] [-p priority] [-r c] [-S path] [-t
array_range] [-u user_list] [-W additional_attributes]
job_identifier...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The qalter command modifies the attributes of the job or
jobs specified by job_identifier on the command line. Only
those attributes listed as options on the command will be
<br>
modified. If any of the specified attributes cannot be
modified for a job for any reason, none of that job&rsquo;s
attributes will be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qalter command accomplishes
the modifications by sending a Modify Job batch request to
the batch server which owns each job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a date_time <br>
Replaces the time at which the job becomes eligible for
execution. The date_time argument syntax is:
[[[[CC]YY]MM]DD]hhmm[.SS].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the month, MM, is not
specified, it will default to the current month if the
specified day DD, is in the future. Otherwise, the month
will be set to next month. <br>
Likewise, if the day, DD, is not specified, it will default
to today if the time hhmm is in the future. Otherwise, the
day will be set to tomorrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute can be altered
once the job has begun execution, but it will not take
affect until the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A account_string <br>
Replaces the account string associated with the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute cannot be altered
once the job has begun execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c interval <br>
Replaces the the interval at which the job will be
checkpointed. If the job executes upon a host which does not
support checkpoint, this option will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interval argument is
specified as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n No checkpointing is to be
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Checkpointing is to be
performed only when the server executing the job is
shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Checkpointing is to be
performed at the default minimum cpu time for the queue from
which the job is executing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c=minutes <br>
Checkpointing is to be performed at an interval of minutes,
which is the integer number of minutes of CPU time used by
the job. This value must be greater than zero. <br>
If the number is less than the default checkpoint time, the
default time will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute can be altered
once the job has begun execution, but the new value does not
take affect until the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e path Replaces the path to be
used for the standard error stream of the batch job. The
path argument is of the form: <br>
[hostname:]path_name <br>
where hostname is the name of a host to which the file will
be returned and path_name is the path name on that host in
the syntax recognized by POSIX 1003.1. The argu&acirc; <br>
ment will be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the
qalter command will expand the path name relative to the
current working directory of the command. The com&acirc;
<br>
mand will supply the name of the host upon which it is
executing for the hostname component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the
qalter command will not expand the path name. The execution
server will expand it relative to the home <br>
directory of the user on the system specified by
hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, then qalter
will supply the name of the host on which it is executing
for the hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, the path
will be used as specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute can be altered
once the job has begun execution, but it will not take
affect until the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hold_list <br>
Updates the types of holds on the job. The hold_list
argument is a string of one or more of the following
characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Add the USER type hold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Add the SYSTEM type hold if
the user has the appropriate level of privilege. [Typically
reserved to the batch administrator.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Add the OTHER (or OPERATOR )
type hold if the user has the appropriate level of
privilege. [Typically reserved to the batch administrator
and batch operator.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Set to none; that is clear the
hold types which could be applied with the users level of
privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repetition of characters is
permitted, but &quot;n&quot; may not appear in the same
option argument with the other three characters. This
attribute can be altered once the job has <br>
begun execution, but the hold will not take affect until the
job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j join Declares which standard
streams of the job will be merged together. The join
argument value may be the characters &quot;oe&quot; and
&quot;eo&quot;, or the single character &quot;n&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A argument value of oe directs
that the standard output and standard error streams of the
job will be merged, intermixed, and returned as the standard
output. A argument <br>
value of eo directs that the standard output and standard
error streams of the job will be merged, intermixed, and
returned as the standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A value of n directs that the
two streams will be two separate files. This attribute can
be altered once the job has begun execution, but it will not
take affect until <br>
the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k keep Defines which if either
of standard output or standard error of the job will be
retained on the execution host. If set for a stream, this
option overrides the path name <br>
for that stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument is either the
single letter &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, or
&quot;n&quot;, or one or more of the letters &quot;e&quot;
and &quot;o&quot; combined in either order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n No streams are to be
retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e The standard error stream is
to retained on the execution host. The stream will be placed
in the home directory of the user under whose user id the
job executed. <br>
The file name will be the default file name given by:
job_name.esequence where job_name is the name specified for
the job, and sequence is the sequence number compo&acirc;
<br>
nent of the job identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The standard output stream is
to be retained on the execution host. The stream will be
placed in the home directory of the user under whose user id
the job exe&acirc; <br>
cuted. The file name will be the default file name given by:
job_name.osequence where job_name is the name specified for
the job, and sequence is the sequence num&acirc; <br>
ber component of the job identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eo Both the standard output and
standard error streams will be retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oe Both the standard output and
standard error streams will be retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute cannot be altered
once the job has begun execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l resource_list <br>
Modifies the list of resources that are required by the job.
The Resource_List argument is in the following syntax: <br>
resource_name[=[value]][,resource_name[=[value]],...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a requested modification to a
resource would exceed the resource limits for jobs in the
current queue, the server will reject the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the job is running, only
certain, resources can be altered. Which resources can be
altered in the run state is system dependent. A user may
only lower the limit for <br>
those resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mail_options <br>
Replaces the set of conditions under which the execution
server will send a mail message about the job. The
mail_options argument is a string which consists of the
sin&acirc; <br>
gle character &quot;n&quot;, or one or more of the
characters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and
&quot;e&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the character &quot;n&quot;
is specified, no mail will be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the letters &quot;a&quot;,
&quot;b&quot;, and &quot;e&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a mail is sent when the job is
aborted by the batch system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b mail is sent when the job
begins execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e mail is sent when the job
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M user_list <br>
Replaces the list of users to whom mail is sent by the
execution server when it sends mail about the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user_list argument is of the
form: <br>
user[@host][,user[@host],...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n node exclusive <br>
Sets whether or not the job has node exclusive access. To
specify node exclusive access, just use the single character
&rsquo;y&rsquo;. To specify that the job should not have
node <br>
exclusive access, just use the single character
&rsquo;n&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N name Renames the job. The
name specified may be up to and including 15 characters in
length. It must consist of printable, non white space
characters with the first charac&acirc; <br>
ter alphabetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o path Replaces the path to be
used for the standard output stream of the batch job. The
path argument is of the form: <br>
[hostname:]path_name <br>
where hostname is the name of a host to which the file will
be returned and path_name is the path name on that host in
the syntax recognized by POSIX. The argument will <br>
be interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the
qalter command will expand the path name relative to the
current working directory of the command. The com&acirc;
<br>
mand will supply the name of the host upon which it is
executing for the hostname component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name is not an absolute path name, then the
qalter command will not expand the path name. The execution
server will expand it relative to the home <br>
directory of the user on the system specified by
hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, then the
qalter will supply the name of the host on which it is
executing for the hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname:path_name <br>
Where path_name specifies an absolute path name, the path
will be used as specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute can be altered
once the job has begun execution, but it will not take
affect until the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p priority <br>
Replaces the priority of the job. The priority argument must
be a integer between -1024 and +1023 inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute can be altered
once the job has begun execution, but it will not take
affect until the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r c Declares whether the job is
rerunable. See the qrerun command. The option argument c is
a single character. PBS recognizes the following characters:
y and n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the argument is
&quot;y&quot;, the job is marked rerunable. If the argument
is &quot;n&quot;, the job is marked as not rerunable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S path Declares the shell that
interprets the job script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option argument path_list is
in the form: <br>
path[@host][,path[@host],...] <br>
Only one path may be specified for any host named. Only one
path may be specified without the corresponding host name.
The path selected will be the one with the host <br>
name that matched the name of the execution host. If no
matching host is found, then if present the path specified
without a host will be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -S option is not
specified, the option argument is the null string, or no
entry from the path_list is selected, the execution will use
the login shell of the user <br>
on the execution host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute can be altered
once the job has begun execution, but it will not take
affect until the job is rerun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t array_range <br>
The array_range argument is an integer id or a range of
integers. Multiple ids or id ranges can be combined in a
comma delimted list. Examples : -t 1-100 or -t <br>
1,10,50-100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an array range isn&rsquo;t
specified, the command tries to operate on the entire array.
The command acts on the array (or specified range of the
array) just as it would on <br>
an individual job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional slot limit can be
specified to limit the amount of jobs that can run
concurrently in the job array. The default value is
unlimited. The slot limit must be the <br>
last thing specified in the array_request and is delimited
from the array by a percent sign (%).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qalter weatherSimulationArray[]
-t %20</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, the array
weatherSimulationArray[] is configured to allow a maximum of
20 concurrently running jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Slot limits can be applied
at job submit time with qsub, or can be set in a global
server parameter policy with max_slot_limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user_list <br>
Replaces the user name under which the job is to run on the
execution system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user_list argument is of the
form: <br>
user[@host][,user[@host],...] <br>
Only one user name may be given for per specified host. Only
one of the user specifications may be supplied without the
corresponding host specification. That user name <br>
will be used for execution on any host not named in the
argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This attribute cannot be altered
once the job has begun execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W additional_attributes <br>
The -W option allows for the modification of additional job
attributes. The general syntax of the -W is in the form:
<br>
-W attr_name=value[,attr_name=value...] <br>
Note if white space occurs anywhere within the option
argument string or the equal sign, &quot;=&quot;, occurs
within an attribute_value string, then the string must be
enclosed <br>
with either single or double quote marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PBS currently supports the
following attributes within the -W option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">depend=dependency_list <br>
Redefines the dependencies between this and other jobs. The
dependency_list is in the form:
type[:argument[:argument...][,type:argument...]. <br>
The argument is either a numeric count or a PBS job id
according to type . If argument is a count, it must be
greater than 0. If it is a job id and is not fully
speci&acirc; <br>
fied in the form: seq_number.server.name, it will be
expanded according to the default server rules. If argument
is null (the preceding colon need not be specified), the
<br>
dependency of the corresponding type is cleared (unset).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">synccount:count <br>
This job is the first in a set of jobs to be executed at the
same time. Count is the number of additional jobs in the
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syncwith:jobid <br>
This job is an additional member of a set of jobs to be
executed at the same time. Jobid is the job identifier of
the first job in the set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">after:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution at any point after
jobs jobid have started execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afterok:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution only after jobs
jobid have terminated with no errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">afternotok:jobid[:jobid...] <br>

This job may be scheduled for execution after jobs jobid
have terminated, with or without errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">on:count <br>
This job may be scheduled for execution after count
dependencies on other jobs have been satisfied. This form is
used in conjunction with one of the before <br>
forms, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
When this job has begun execution, then jobs jobid... may
begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beforeok:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
If this job terminates execution without errors, then jobs
jobid... may begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beforenotok:jobid[:jobid...]
<br>
If this job terminates execution with errors, then jobs
jobid... may begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beforeany:jobid[:jobid...] <br>
When this job terminates execution, jobs jobid... may
begin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the before forms are
used, the job referenced by jobid must have been submitted
with a dependency type of on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The job specified in any of the
before forms must have the same owner as the job being
altered.. Otherwise, the dependency will not take
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error processing of the
existence, state, or condition of the job on which the newly
submitted job is a deferred service, i.e. the check is
performed after the job is <br>
queued. If an error is detected, the new job will be deleted
by the server. Mail will be sent to the job submitter
stating the error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group_list=g_list <br>
Alters the group name under which the job is to run on the
execution system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The g_list argument is of the
form: group[@host][,group[@host],...] <br>
Only one group name may be given per specified host. Only
one of the group specifications may be supplied without the
corresponding host specification. That group name <br>
will used for execution on any host not named in the
argument list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stagein=file_list <br>
stageout=file_list <br>
Alters which files are staged (copied) in before job start
or staged out after the job completes execution. The
file_list is in the form: local_file@host&acirc; <br>
name:remote_file[,...] <br>
The name local_file is the name on the system where the job
executes. It may be an absolute path or a path relative to
the home directory of the user. The name <br>
remote_file is the destination name on the host specified by
hostname. The name may be absolute or relative to the
user&rsquo;s home directory on the destination host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The qalter command accepts one or more job_identifier
operands of the form: <br>
sequence_number[.server_name][@server]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD ERROR <br>
Any error condition, either in processing the options or the
operands, or any error received in reply to the batch
requests will result in a error message being written to
stan&acirc; <br>
dard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to
the qalter command, the exit status will be a value of
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the qalter command fails to
process any operand, the command exits with a value greater
than zero.</p>
