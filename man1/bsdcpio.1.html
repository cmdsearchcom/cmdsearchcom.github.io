<p>CPIO(1) BSD General Commands Manual CPIO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpio &acirc; copy files to and from archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpio {-i} [options] [pattern ...] [&lt; archive] <br>
cpio {-o} [options] &lt; name-list [&gt; archive] <br>
cpio {-p} [options] dest-dir &lt; name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cpio copies files between archives and directories. This
implementation can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar,
ar, and ISO 9660 cdrom images and can create tar, pax, cpio,
ar, <br>
and shar archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first option to cpio is a
mode indicator from the following list: <br>
-i Input. Read an archive from standard input (unless
overridden) and extract the contents to disk or (if the -t
option is specified) list the contents to standard output.
<br>
If one or more file patterns are specified, only files
matching one of the patterns will be extracted. <br>
-o Output. Read a list of filenames from standard input and
produce a new archive on standard output (unless overridden)
containing the specified items. <br>
-p Pass-through. Read a list of filenames from standard
input and copy the files to the specified directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable
in all operating modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0, --null <br>
Read filenames separated by NUL characters instead of
newlines. This is necessary if any of the filenames being
read might contain newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A (o mode only) Append to the
specified archive. (Not yet implemented.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a (o and p modes) Reset access
times on files after they are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B (o mode only) Block output to
records of 5120 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C size <br>
(o mode only) Block output to records of size bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c (o mode only) Use the old
POSIX portable character format. Equivalent to --format
odc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --make-directories <br>
(i and p modes) Create directories as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E file <br>
(i mode only) Read list of file name patterns from file to
list and extract.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F file, --file file <br>
Read archive from or write archive to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f pattern <br>
(i mode only) Ignore files that match pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H format, --format format <br>
(o mode only) Produce the output archive in the specified
format. Supported formats include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpio Synonym for odc. <br>
newc The SVR4 portable cpio format. <br>
odc The old POSIX.1 portable octet-oriented cpio format.
<br>
pax The POSIX.1 pax format, an extension of the ustar
format. <br>
ustar The POSIX.1 tar format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format is odc. See
libarchive-formats(5) for more complete information about
the formats currently supported by the underlying
libarchive(3) library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
Read archive from file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --extract <br>
Input mode. See above for description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--insecure <br>
(i and p mode only) Disable security checks during
extraction or copying. This allows extraction via symbolic
links and path names containing &acirc;..&acirc; in the
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J, --xz <br>
(o mode only) Compress the file with xz-compatible
compression before writing it. In input mode, this option is
ignored; xz compression is recognized automatically on <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Synonym for -y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L (o and p modes) All symbolic
links will be followed. Normally, symbolic links are
archived and copied as symbolic links. With this option, the
target of the link will be <br>
archived or copied instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --link <br>
(p mode only) Create links from the target directory to the
original files, instead of copying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lrzip <br>
(o mode only) Compress the resulting archive with lrzip(1).
In input mode, this option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lzma (o mode only) Compress
the file with lzma-compatible compression before writing it.
In input mode, this option is ignored; lzma compression is
recognized automatically on <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lzop (o mode only) Compress
the resulting archive with lzop(1). In input mode, this
option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --preserve-modification-time
<br>
(i and p modes) Set file modification time on created files
to match those in the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numeric-uid-gid <br>
(i mode, only with -t) Display numeric uid and gid. By
default, cpio displays the user and group names when they
are provided in the archive, or looks up the user and <br>
group names in the system password database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-preserve-owner <br>
(i mode only) Do not attempt to restore file ownership. This
is the default when run by non-root users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O file <br>
Write archive to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --create <br>
Output mode. See above for description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pass-through <br>
Pass-through mode. See above for description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-owner <br>
(i mode only) Restore file ownership. This is the default
when run by the root user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Suppress unnecessary messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R [user][:][group], --owner
[user][:][group] <br>
Set the owner and/or group on files in the output. If group
is specified with no user (for example, -R :wheel) then the
group will be set but not the user. If the user is <br>
specified with a trailing colon and no group (for example,
-R root:) then the group will be set to the user&rsquo;s
default group. If the user is specified with no trailing
<br>
colon, then the user will be set but not the group. In -i
and -p modes, this option can only be used by the
super-user. (For compatibility, a period can be used in
place <br>
of the colon.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r (All modes.) Rename files
interactively. For each file, a prompt is written to
/dev/tty containing the name of the file and a line is read
from /dev/tty. If the line <br>
read is blank, the file is skipped. If the line contains a
single period, the file is processed normally. Otherwise,
the line is taken to be the new name of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --list <br>
(i mode only) List the contents of the archive to stdout; do
not restore the contents to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unconditional <br>
(i and p modes) Unconditionally overwrite existing files.
Ordinarily, an older file will not overwrite a newer file on
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --dot <br>
Print a dot to stderr for each file as it is processed.
Superseded by -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print the name of each file to stderr as it is processed.
With -t, provide a detailed listing of each file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the program version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y (o mode only) Compress the
archive with bzip2-compatible compression before writing it.
In input mode, this option is ignored; bzip2 compression is
recognized automati&acirc; <br>
cally on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z (o mode only) Compress the
archive with compress-compatible compression before writing
it. In input mode, this option is ignored; compression is
recognized automatically <br>
on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z (o mode only) Compress the
archive with gzip-compatible compression before writing it.
In input mode, this option is ignored; gzip compression is
recognized automatically <br>
on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The cpio utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The following environment variables affect the execution of
cpio:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG The locale to use. See
environ(7) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ The timezone to use when
displaying dates. See environ(7) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The cpio command is traditionally used to copy file
hierarchies in conjunction with the find(1) command. The
first example here simply copies all files from src to dest:
<br>
find src | cpio -pmud dest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By carefully selecting options
to the find(1) command and combining it with other standard
utilities, it is possible to exercise very fine control over
which files are copied. <br>
This next example copies files from src to dest that are
more than 2 days old and whose names match a particular
pattern: <br>
find src -mtime +2 | grep foo[bar] | cpio -pdmu dest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example copies files from
src to dest that are more than 2 days old and which contain
the word &acirc;foobar&acirc;: <br>
find src -mtime +2 | xargs grep -l foobar | cpio -pdmu
dest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The mode options i, o, and p and the options a, B, c, d, f,
l, m, r, t, u, and v comply with SUSv2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old POSIX.1 standard
specified that only -i, -o, and -p were interpreted as
command-line options. Each took a single argument of a list
of modifier characters. For example, <br>
the standard syntax allows -imu but does not support -miu or
-i -m -u, since m and u are only modifiers to -i, they are
not command-line options in their own right. The syntax <br>
supported by this implementation is backwards-compatible
with the standard. For best compatibility, scripts should
limit themselves to the standard syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
bzip2(1), tar(1), gzip(1), mt(1), pax(1), libarchive(3),
cpio(5), libarchive-formats(5), tar(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
There is no current POSIX standard for the cpio command; it
appeared in ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) but
was dropped from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cpio, ustar, and pax
interchange file formats are defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
(&acirc;POSIX.1&acirc;) for the pax command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The original cpio and find utilities were written by Dick
Haight while working in AT&amp;T&rsquo;s Unix Support Group.
They first appeared in 1977 in PWB/UNIX 1.0, the
&acirc;Programmer&rsquo;s Work <br>
Bench&acirc; system developed for use within AT&amp;T. They
were first released outside of AT&amp;T as part of System
III Unix in 1981. As a result, cpio actually predates tar,
even though it <br>
was not well-known outside of AT&amp;T until some time
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a complete
re-implementation based on the libarchive(3) library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The cpio archive format has several basic limitations: It
does not store user and group names, only numbers. As a
result, it cannot be reliably used to transfer files between
sys&acirc; <br>
tems with dissimilar user and group numbering. Older cpio
formats limit the user and group numbers to 16 or 18 bits,
which is insufficient for modern systems. The cpio archive
<br>
formats cannot support files over 4 gigabytes, except for
the &acirc;odc&acirc; variant, which can support files up to
8 gigabytes.</p>
