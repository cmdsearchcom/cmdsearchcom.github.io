diagnostics, splain - produce verbose warning diagnostics
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Using the &quot;diagnostics&quot; pragma:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use diagnostics;
    use diagnostics -verbose;
    enable  diagnostics;
    disable diagnostics;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the &quot;splain&quot; standalone filter program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl program 2&gt;diag.out
    splain [-v] [-p] diag.out
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using diagnostics to get stack traces from a misbehaving script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -Mdiagnostics=-traceonly my_script.pl
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_&quot;diagnostics&quot;_Pragma"><a class="selflink" href="#The_&quot;diagnostics&quot;_Pragma">The
  &quot;diagnostics&quot; Pragma</a></h2>
This module extends the terse diagnostics normally emitted by both the perl
  compiler and the perl interpreter (from running perl with a -w switch or
  &quot;use warnings&quot;), augmenting them with the more explicative and
  endearing descriptions found in perldiag. Like the other pragmata, it affects
  the compilation phase of your program rather than merely the execution phase.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use in your program as a pragma, merely invoke
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use diagnostics;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
at the start (or near the start) of your program. (Note that this <i>does</i>
  enable perl's <b>-w</b> flag.) Your whole compilation will then be subject(ed
  :-) to the enhanced diagnostics. These still go out <b>STDERR</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Due to the interaction between runtime and compiletime issues, and because it's
  probably not a very good idea anyway, you may not use &quot;no
  diagnostics&quot; to turn them off at compiletime. However, you may control
  their behaviour at runtime using the <i>disable()</i> and <i>enable()</i>
  methods to turn them off and on respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-verbose</b> flag first prints out the perldiag introduction before any
  other diagnostics. The $diagnostics::PRETTY variable can generate nicer escape
  sequences for pagers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Warnings dispatched from perl itself (or more accurately, those that match
  descriptions found in perldiag) are only displayed once (no duplicate
  descriptions). User code generated warnings a la <i>warn()</i> are unaffected,
  allowing duplicate user messages to be displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This module also adds a stack trace to the error message when perl dies. This is
  useful for pinpointing what caused the death. The <b>-traceonly</b> (or just
  <b>-t</b>) flag turns off the explanations of warning messages leaving just
  the stack traces. So if your script is dieing, run it again with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  perl -Mdiagnostics=-traceonly my_bad_script
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to see the call stack at the time of death. By supplying the <b>-warntrace</b>
  (or just <b>-w</b>) flag, any warnings emitted will also come with a stack
  trace.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_splain_Program"><a class="selflink" href="#The_splain_Program">The
  <i>splain</i> Program</a></h2>
While apparently a whole nuther program, <i>splain</i> is actually nothing more
  than a link to the (executable) <i>diagnostics.pm</i> module, as well as a
  link to the <i>diagnostics.pod</i> documentation. The <b>-v</b> flag is like
  the &quot;use diagnostics -verbose&quot; directive. The <b>-p</b> flag is like
  the $diagnostics::PRETTY variable. Since you're post-processing with
  <i>splain</i>, there's no sense in being able to <i>enable()</i> or
  <i>disable()</i> processing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Output from <i>splain</i> is directed to <b>STDOUT</b>, unlike the pragma.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The following file is certain to trigger a few errors at both runtime and
  compiletime:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use diagnostics;
    print NOWHERE &quot;nothing\n&quot;;
    print STDERR &quot;\n\tThis message should be unadorned.\n&quot;;
    warn &quot;\tThis is a user warning&quot;;
    print &quot;\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTER: Please enter a &lt;CR&gt; here: &quot;;
    my $a, $b = scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;;
    print &quot;\n&quot;;
    print $x/$y;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you prefer to run your program first and look at its problem afterwards, do
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    perl -w test.pl 2&gt;test.out
    ./splain &lt; test.out
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this is not in general possible in shells of more dubious heritage, as
  the theoretical
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    (perl -w test.pl &gt;/dev/tty) &gt;&amp; test.out
    ./splain &lt; test.out
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because you just moved the existing <b>stdout</b> to somewhere else.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't want to modify your source code, but still have on-the-fly
  warnings, do this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    exec 3&gt;&amp;1; perl -w test.pl 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;- | splain 1&gt;&amp;2 3&gt;&amp;-
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Nifty, eh?
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to control warnings on the fly, do something like this. Make sure
  you do the &quot;use&quot; first, or you won't be able to get at the
  <i>enable()</i> or <i>disable()</i> methods.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use diagnostics; # checks entire compilation phase 
        print &quot;\ntime for 1st bogus diags: SQUAWKINGS\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS1 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 1st bogus\n&quot;;
    disable diagnostics; # only turns off runtime warnings
        print &quot;\ntime for 2nd bogus: (squelched)\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS2 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 2nd bogus\n&quot;;
    enable diagnostics; # turns back on runtime warnings
        print &quot;\ntime for 3rd bogus: SQUAWKINGS\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS3 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 3rd bogus\n&quot;;
    disable diagnostics;
        print &quot;\ntime for 4th bogus: (squelched)\n&quot;;
        print BOGUS4 'nada';
        print &quot;done with 4th bogus\n&quot;;
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERNALS">INTERNALS</a></h1>
Diagnostic messages derive from the <i>perldiag.pod</i> file when available at
  runtime. Otherwise, they may be embedded in the file itself when the splain
  package is built. See the <i>Makefile</i> for details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an extant $SIG{__WARN__} handler is discovered, it will continue to be
  honored, but only after the <i>diagnostics::splainthis()</i> function (the
  module's $SIG{__WARN__} interceptor) has had its way with your warnings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a $diagnostics::DEBUG variable you may set if you're desperately
  curious what sorts of things are being intercepted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN { $diagnostics::DEBUG = 1 }
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Not being able to say &quot;no diagnostics&quot; is annoying, but may not be
  insurmountable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-pretty&quot; directive is called too late to affect matters. You have
  to do this instead, and <i>before</i> you load the module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN { $diagnostics::PRETTY = 1 }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I could start up faster by delaying compilation until it should be needed, but
  this gets a &quot;panic: top_level&quot; when using the pragma form in Perl
  5.001e.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While it's true that this documentation is somewhat subserious, if you use a
  program named <i>splain</i>, you should expect a bit of whimsy.
