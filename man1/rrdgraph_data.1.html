<p>RRDGRAPH_DATA(1) rrdtool RRDGRAPH_DATA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rrdgraph_data - preparing data for graphing in rrdtool
graph</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

DEF:&lt;vname&gt;=&lt;rrdfile&gt;:&lt;ds-name&gt;:&lt;CF&gt;[:step=&lt;step&gt;][:start=&lt;time&gt;][:end=&lt;time&gt;][:reduce=&lt;CF&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VDEF:vname=RPN expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDEF:vname=RPN expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
These three instructions extract data values out of the RRD
files, optionally altering them (think, for example, of a
bytes to bits conversion). If so desired, you can also <br>
define variables containing useful information such as
maximum, minimum etcetera. Two of the instructions use a
language called RPN which is described in its own manual
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable names (vname) must be
made up strings of the following characters &quot;A-Z, a-z,
0-9, -,_&quot; and a maximum length of 255 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When picking variable names,
make sure you do not choose a name that is already taken by
an RPN operator. A safe bet it to use lowercase or mixed
case names for variables since <br>
operators will always be in uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEF <br>

DEF:&lt;vname&gt;=&lt;rrdfile&gt;:&lt;ds-name&gt;:&lt;CF&gt;[:step=&lt;step&gt;][:start=&lt;time&gt;][:end=&lt;time&gt;][:reduce=&lt;CF&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command fetches data from
an RRD file. The virtual name vname can then be used
throughout the rest of the script. By default, an RRA which
contains the correct consolidated <br>
data at an appropriate resolution will be chosen. The
resolution can be overridden with the --step option. The
resolution can again be overridden by specifying the step
size. <br>
The time span of this data is the same as for the graph by
default, you can override this by specifying start and end.
Remember to escape colons in the time specification!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the resolution of the data is
higher than the resolution of the graph, the data will be
further consolidated. This may result in a graph that spans
slightly more time than <br>
requested. Ideally each point in the graph should correspond
with one CDP from an RRA. For instance, if your RRD has an
RRA with a resolution of 1800 seconds per CDP, you <br>
should create an image with width 400 and time span 400*1800
seconds (use appropriate start and end times, such as
&quot;--start end-8days8hours&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If consolidation needs to be
done, the CF of the RRA specified in the DEF itself will be
used to reduce the data density. This behavior can be
changed using &quot;:reduce=&lt;CF&gt;&quot;. This <br>
optional parameter specifies the CF to use during the data
reduction phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEF:ds0=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE
<br>
DEF:ds0weekly=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:step=7200 <br>
DEF:ds0weekly=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:start=end-1h <br>
DEF:ds0weekly=router.rrd:ds0:AVERAGE:start=11
00:end=start+1h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VDEF <br>
VDEF:vname=RPN expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command returns a value
and/or a time according to the RPN statements used. The
resulting vname will, depending on the functions used, have
a value and a time component. <br>
When you use this vname in another RPN expression, you are
effectively inserting its value just as if you had put a
number at that place. The variable can also be used in the
<br>
various graph and print elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:
&quot;VDEF:avg=mydata,AVERAGE&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that currently only
aggregation functions work in VDEF rpn expressions. Patches
to change this are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDEF <br>
CDEF:vname=RPN expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command creates a new set
of data points (in memory only, not in the RRD file) out of
one or more other data series. The RPN instructions are used
to evaluate a mathematical <br>
function on each data point. The resulting vname can then be
used further on in the script, just as if it were generated
by a DEF instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:
&quot;CDEF:mydatabits=mydata,8,*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About CDEF versus VDEF <br>
At some point in processing, RRDtool has gathered an array
of rates ready to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDEF works on such an array. For
example, CDEF:new=ds0,8,* would multiply each of the array
members by eight (probably transforming bytes into bits).
The result is an array <br>
containing the new values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VDEF also works on such an array
but in a different way. For example, VDEF:max=ds0,MAXIMUM
would scan each of the array members and store the maximum
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When do you use VDEF versus
CDEF? <br>
Use CDEF to transform your data prior to graphing. In the
above example, we&rsquo;d use a CDEF to transform bytes to
bits before graphing the bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You use a VDEF if you want
max(1,5,3,2,4) to return five which would be displayed in
the graph&rsquo;s legend (to answer, what was the maximum
value during the graph period).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to apply
&rsquo;complex&rsquo; operations to the result of a VDEF you
have to use a CDEF again since VDEFs only look like RPN
expressions, they aren&rsquo;t really.</p>
