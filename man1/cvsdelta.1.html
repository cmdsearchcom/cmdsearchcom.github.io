<p>CVSDELTA(1) cvsdelta 1.7.0 CVSDELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvsdelta - Manage and summarize the differences between a
CVS project and local files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvsdelta [options] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Manages and summarizes the differences between a CVS project
and local files, showing the changes of the files themselves
and of their contents. Added, changed, and deleted files
<br>
are denoted with &lsquo;+&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;-&rsquo; respectively. The number of lines are
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --adds <br>
Display the files that were added. This is done by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --no-adds <br>
Do not display the files that were added. The default is to
show the added files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--banner, --no-banner <br>
Whether to show the banner, i.e., the header and footer of
the output table. By default, the banner is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --changes <br>
Display the files that were changed. This is done by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --no-changes, --nodiff <br>
Do not compare files that exist locally and in CVS. This
executes significantly faster, and is useful for when one
only wants to add and remove files, without getting the <br>
summary of the changes. It is also helpful for dealing with
situations where CVS seems to hang after producing diff
output, although changing the compression level can help
<br>
with this. The default is to show the changed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --deletes <br>
Display the files that were deleted. This is done by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --no-deletes <br>
Do not display the files that were deleted. The default is
to show the files that were deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --execute <br>
Execute the associated CVS commands (&quot;add&quot; and
&quot;remove&quot;) for the added and deleted files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f DATE, --from-date DATE <br>
Compare the files to their version as of the given date,
rather than their current version in CVS. The date is
expected to be in CVS format, for example, 2002/12/31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F REVISION, --from-revision
REVISION <br>
Compare the files to their version as of the given revision,
rather than their current version in CVS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --confirm <br>
Interactively confirm deleted files with the user before
removing them from CVS. The default is simply to execute the
remove command for relevant files. This option is valid <br>
only with the --execute option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progress, --no-progress <br>
Whether to show the progress meter as the program is working
with CVS. By default, this is not shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Run with minimum output. In quiet mode, the progress meter
is not displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --skip-unknown-directories
<br>
Skip directories that are not in CVS. The default behavior
is to process all subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t DATE, --to-date DATE <br>
Compare the files to their version as of the given date,
rather than to the local files. The date is expected to be
in CVS format, for example, 2001/08/21. This option is <br>
valid only with the --from-date or --from-revision
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T REVISION, --to-revision
REVISION <br>
Compare the files to their version as of the given revision,
rather than to the local files. This is valid only with the
--from-date or --from-revision options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Display the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --verbose <br>
Run with maximum output, which is written to standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z [LEVEL], ---compression
[LEVEL] <br>
Set the compression to the given level for net traffic. This
can be useful if the CVS server seems to hang. The default
level is 3; 0 and 9 work well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
Arguments may be either files or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File <br>
If a file is provided, it is compared against the equivalent
in CVS, if any. The .cvsignore files are applied, so that
although the file was explicitly provided, it may be <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory <br>
Directories are processed recursively for files that are not
filtered out by .cvsignore files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
% cvsdelta</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists the changed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% cvsdelta --execute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists the changed files, and
executes the associated add and remove commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% cvsdelta --compression 9
--execute --confirm --no-changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run with the maximum compression
level. Add and remove the appropriate files, but get
confirmation from the user before removing any files. Do not
compare files that exist both <br>
locally and in CVS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
$HOME/.cvsdeltarc, .../project/.cvsdeltarc <br>
Resource files containing name/value pairs, separated by
either &rsquo;:&rsquo; or &rsquo;=&rsquo;. The valid fields
of a .cvsdeltarc file are as follows, with their default
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet: false <br>
verbose: false <br>
execute: false <br>
confirm: false <br>
diff: true <br>
compression: 3 <br>
adds: true <br>
changes: true <br>
deletes: true <br>
skip-unknown-directories: false <br>
banner: true</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;yes&quot; and
&quot;on&quot; are synonymnous with &quot;true&quot;.
&quot;no&quot; and &quot;off&quot; signify
&quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values in the project
.cvsdeltarc file will override those in the user&rsquo;s
.cvsdeltarc file. The project .cvsdeltarc is assumed to be
at the topmost directory in the local <br>
file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSDELTAOPTS <br>
A string of whitespace-delimited options, the same as listed
above. These values override those of the resource
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If a file exists in the CVS project but not locally, it is
assumed that the file has been deleted, not that it may have
been recently added by another user. The --confirm option
<br>
can be used to deal with this situation.</p>
