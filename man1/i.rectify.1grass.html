<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
i.rectify uses the control points included in the source
data or identified with the Ground Control Points Manager to
calculate a transformation matrix and then converts x,y cell
<br>
coordinates to standard map coordinates for each pixel in
the image. The result is a planimetric image with a
transformed coordinate system (i.e., a different coordinate
system <br>
than before it was rectified). Supported transformation
methods are first, second, and third order polynomial and
thin plate spline. Thin plate spline is recommended for
ungeo&acirc; <br>
referenced satellite imagery where ground control points
(GCPs) are included. Examples are NOAA/AVHRR and ENVISAT
imagery which include throusands of GCPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no ground control points are
available, the Ground Control Points Manager must be run
before i.rectify. An image must be georeferences before it
can reside in a standard coor&acirc; <br>
dinate LOCATION, and therefore be analyzed with the other
map layers in the standard coordinate LOCATION. Upon
completion of i.rectify, the rectified image is deposited in
the <br>
target standard coordinate LOCATION. This LOCATION is
selected using i.target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More than one raster map may be
rectified at a time. Each cell file should be given a unique
output file name. The rectified image or rectified raster
maps will be located in the <br>
target LOCATION when the program is completed. The original
unrectified files are not modified or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c flag is used,
i.rectify will only rectify that portion of the image or
raster map that occurs within the chosen window region in
the target location, and only that por&acirc; <br>
tion of the cell file will be relocated in the target
database. It is important therefore, to check the current
mapset window in the target LOCATION if the -c flag is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are rectifying a file
with plans to patch it to another file using the GRASS
program r.patch, choose option number one, the current
window in the target location. This <br>
window, however, must be the default window for the target
LOCATION. When a file being rectified is smaller than the
default window in which it is being rectified, NULLs are
<br>
added to the rectified file. Patching files of the same size
that contain NULL data, eliminates the possibility of a
no-data line in the patched result. This is because, when
the <br>
images are patched, the NULLs in the image are
&quot;covered&quot; with non-NULL pixel values. When
rectifying files that are going to be patched, rectify all
of the files using the same <br>
default window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coordinate transformation <br>
The desired order of transformation (1, 2, or 3) is selected
with the order option. The program will calculate the RMSE
and check the required number of points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linear affine transformation
(1st order transformation) <br>
x&acirc; = ax + by +c <br>
y&acirc; = Ax + Bt +C The a,b,c,A,B,C are determined by
least squares regression based on the control points
entered. This transformation applies scaling, translation
and rotation. It <br>
is NOT a general purpose rubber-sheeting, nor is it
ortho-photo rectification using a DEM, not second order
polynomial, etc. It can be used if (1) you have
geometrically correct <br>
images, and (2) the terrain or camera distortion effect can
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polynomial Transformation Matrix
(2nd, 3d order transformation) <br>
i.rectify uses a first, second, or third order
transformation matrix to calculate the registration
coefficients. The number of control points required for a
selected order of <br>
transformation (represented by n) is <br>
((n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2) or 3, 6, and 10 respectively. It is
strongly recommended that one or more additional points be
identified to allow for an overly-determined transformation
<br>
calculation which will generate the Root Mean Square (RMS)
error values for each included point. The RMS error values
for all the included control points are immediately
recalcu&acirc; <br>
lated when the user selects a different transformation order
from the menu bar. The polynomial equations are performed
using a modified Gaussian elimination method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thin plate spline (TPS)
transformation <br>
TPS transformation is selected with the -t flag. This method
of coordinate transformation is recommended for satellite
imagery where hundreds or thousands of GCPs are included,
<br>
and for historical printed or scanned maps with unknown
georeferencing and/or known localized distortions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TPS combines a linear affine
transformation with individual transformation coefficients
for each GCP, using the radial basis kernel function with
the distance dist between any <br>
two points: <br>
dist2 * log(dist) As a consequence, localized distortions
can be removed with TPS transformation. For example, scan
line sensors will have due to the changing viewing angle
<br>
larger distortions towards the end points of the scan line
than at the center of the scan line. Even higher order
polynomial transformations are not able to remove these
locally <br>
different distortions, but TPS transformation can. For best
results, TPS requires an even and, for localized
distortions, dense spacing of GCPs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resampling method <br>
The rectified data is resampled with one of seven different
methods: nearest, bilinear, cubic, lanczos, bilinear_f,
cubic_f, or lanczos_f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method=nearest method, which
performs a nearest neighbor assignment, is the fastest of
the resampling methods. It is primarily used for categorical
data such as a land use <br>
classification, since it will not change the values of the
data cells. The method=bilinear method determines the new
value of the cell based on a weighted distance average of
the <br>
4 surrounding cells in the input map. The method=cubic
method determines the new value of the cell based on a
weighted distance average of the 16 surrounding cells in the
input <br>
map. The method=lanczos method determines the new value of
the cell based on a weighted distance average of the 25
surrounding cells in the input map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bilinear, cubic and lanczos
interpolation methods are most appropriate for continuous
data and cause some smoothing. These options should not be
used with categorical data, <br>
since the cell values will be altered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the bilinear, cubic and
lanczos methods, if any of the surrounding cells used to
interpolate the new cell value are NULL, the resulting cell
will be NULL, even if the nearest <br>
cell is not NULL. This will cause some thinning along NULL
borders, such as the coasts of land areas in a DEM. The
bilinear_f, cubic_f and lanczos_f interpolation methods can
be <br>
used if thinning along NULL edges is not desired. These
methods &quot;fall back&quot; to simpler interpolation
methods along NULL borders. That is, from lanczos to cubic
to bilinear to <br>
nearest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If nearest neighbor assignment
is used, the output map has the same raster format as the
input map. If any of the other interpolations is used, the
output map is written as <br>
floating point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If i.rectify starts normally but after some time the
following text is seen: <br>
ERROR: Error writing segment file <br>
the user may try the -c flag or the module needs more free
space on the hard drive.</p>
