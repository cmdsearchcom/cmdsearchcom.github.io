<p>AUTOEXPECT(1) General Commands Manual AUTOEXPECT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
autoexpect - generate an Expect script from watching a
session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
autoexpect [ args ] [ program args... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
autoexpect watches you interacting with another program and
creates an Expect script that reproduces your interactions.
For straightline scripts, autoexpect saves substantial <br>
time over writing scripts by hand. Even if you are an Expect
expert, you will find it convenient to use autoexpect to
automate the more mindless parts of interactions. It is <br>
much easier to cut/paste hunks of autoexpect scripts
together than to write them from scratch. And if you are a
beginner, you may be able to get away with learning nothing
more <br>
about Expect than how to call autoexpect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest way to use
autoexpect is to call it from the command line with no
arguments. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% autoexpect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, autoexpect spawns a
shell for you. Given a program name and arguments,
autoexpect spawns that program. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% autoexpect ftp
ftp.cme.nist.gov</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once your spawned program is
running, interact normally. When you have exited the shell
(or program that you specified), autoexpect will create a
new script for you. By <br>
default, autoexpect writes the new script to
&quot;script.exp&quot;. You can override this with the -f
flag followed by a new script name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example runs
&quot;ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov&quot; and stores the resulting
Expect script in the file &quot;nist&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% autoexpect -f nist ftp
ftp.cme.nist.gov</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to understand
that autoexpect does not guarantee a working script because
it necessarily has to guess about certain things - and
occasionally it guesses wrong. <br>
However, it is usually very easy to identify and fix these
problems. The typical problems are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Timing. A
surprisingly large number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, telnet,
etc.) and devices (e.g., modems) ignore keystrokes that
arrive &quot;too quickly&quot; after prompts. If <br>
you find your new script hanging up at one spot, try adding
a short sleep just before the previous send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can force this behavior
throughout by overriding the variable
&quot;force_conservative&quot; near the beginning of the
generated script. This &quot;conservative&quot; mode makes
<br>
autoexpect automatically pause briefly (one tenth of a
second) before sending each character. This pacifies every
program I know of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This conservative mode is useful
if you just want to quickly reassure yourself that the
problem is a timing one (or if you really don&rsquo;t care
about how fast the script <br>
runs). This same mode can be forced before script generation
by using the -c flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, these timing spots
are rare. For example, telnet ignores characters only after
entering its escape sequence. Modems only ignore characters
immediately <br>
after connecting to them for the first time. A few programs
exhibit this behavior all the time but typically have a
switch to disable it. For example, rn&rsquo;s -T flag <br>
disables this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example starts
autoexpect in conservative mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -C flag defines a key to
toggle conservative mode. The following example starts
autoexpect (in non-conservative mode) with ^L as the toggle.
(Note that the ^L is <br>
entered literally - i.e., enter a real control-L).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -C ^L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example starts
autoexpect in conservative mode with ^L as the toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -c -C ^L</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Echoing. Many
program echo characters. For example, if you type
&quot;more&quot; to a shell, what autoexpect actually sees
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you typed &rsquo;m&rsquo;, <br>
computer typed &rsquo;m&rsquo;, <br>
you typed &rsquo;o&rsquo;, <br>
computer typed &rsquo;o&rsquo;, <br>
you typed &rsquo;r&rsquo;, <br>
computer typed &rsquo;r&rsquo;, <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without specific knowledge of
the program, it is impossible to know if you are waiting to
see each character echoed before typing the next. If
autoexpect sees charac&acirc; <br>
ters being echoed, it assumes that it can send them all as a
group rather than interleaving them the way they originally
appeared. This makes the script more pleasant <br>
to read. However, it could conceivably be incorrect if you
really had to wait to see each character echoed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Change.
Autoexpect records every character from the interaction in
the script. This is desirable because it gives you the
ability to make judgements about what is <br>
important and what can be replaced with a pattern match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, if you use
commands whose output differs from run to run, the generated
scripts are not going to be correct. For example, the
&quot;date&quot; command always <br>
produces different output. So using the date command while
running autoexpect is a sure way to produce a script that
will require editing in order for it to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p flag puts autoexpect into
&quot;prompt mode&quot;. In this mode, autoexpect will only
look for the the last line of program output - which is
usually the prompt. This <br>
handles the date problem (see above) and most others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example starts
autoexpect in prompt mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P flag defines a key to
toggle prompt mode. The following example starts autoexpect
(in non-prompt mode) with ^P as the toggle. Note that the ^P
is entered lit&acirc; <br>
erally - i.e., enter a real control-P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -P ^P</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example starts
autoexpect in prompt mode with ^P as the toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -p -P ^P</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER FLAGS <br>
The -quiet flag disables informational messages produced by
autoexpect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Q flag names a quote
character which can be used to enter characters that
autoexpect would otherwise consume because they are used as
toggles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example shows a
number of flags with quote used to provide a way of entering
the toggles literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoexpect -P ^P -C ^L -Q ^Q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STYLE <br>
I don&rsquo;t know if there is a &quot;style&quot; for
Expect programs but autoexpect should definitely not be held
up as any model of style. For example, autoexpect uses
features of Expect <br>
that are intended specifically for computer-generated
scripting. So don&rsquo;t try to faithfully write scripts
that appear as if they were generated by autoexpect. This is
not use&acirc; <br>
ful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, autoexpect
scripts do show some worthwhile things. For example, you can
see how any string must be quoted in order to use it in a
Tcl script simply by running <br>
the strings through autoexpect.</p>
