<p>tracker-info(1) User Commands tracker-info(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tracker-info - Retrieve all information available for a
certain file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tracker-info [OPTION...] FILE...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tracker-info asks for all the known metadata available for
the given FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple FILE arguments can be
provided to retrieve information about multiple files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FILE argument can be either
a local path or a URI. It also does not have to be an
absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help <br>
Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --full-namespaces <br>
By default, all keys and values reported about any given
FILE are returned in shortened form, for example, nie:title
is shown instead of http://www.semanticdesk&acirc; <br>
top.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie#title. This makes things
much easier to see generally and the output is less
cluttered. This option reverses that so FULL namespaces are
<br>
shown instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --plain-text-content <br>
If the resource being displayed has nie:PlainTextContent
(i.e. information about the content of the resource, which
could be the contents of a file on the disk), then <br>
this option displays that in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --resource-is-iri <br>
In most cases, the FILE argument supplied points to a URL or
PATH which is queried for according to the resource
associated with it by nie:url. However, in cases where the
<br>
FILE specified turns out to be the actual URN itself, this
argument is required to tell tracker-info not to do the
extra step of looking up the URN related by nie:url.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, consider that you
store URNs by the actual URL itself and use the unique
nie:url in another resource (which is quite reasonable when
using containers and <br>
multi-resource conditions), you would need this argument to
tell tracker-info that the FILE supplied is actually a URN
not URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --turtle <br>
Output results as Turtle RDF. If -f is enabled, full URIs
are shown for subjects, predicates and objects; otherwise,
shortened URIs are used, and all the prefixes Tracker <br>
knows about are printed at the top of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TRACKER_SPARQL_BACKEND <br>
This option allows you to choose which backend you use for
connecting to the database. This choice can limit your
functionality. There are three settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &quot;direct&quot; the
connection to the database is made directly to the file
itself on the disk, there is no intermediary daemon or
process. The &quot;direct&quot; approach is purely <br>
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &quot;bus&quot; the
tracker-store process is used to liase with the database
queuing all requests and managing the connections via an IPC
/ D-Bus. This adds a small overhead <br>
BUT this is the only approach you can use if you want to
write to the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &quot;auto&quot; the
backend is decided for you, much like it would be if this
environment variable was undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_PRAGMAS_FILE <br>
Tracker has a fixed set of PRAGMA settings for creating its
SQLite connection. With this environment variable pointing
to a text file you can override these settings. The <br>
file is a separated list of SQLite queries to execute on any
newly created SQLite connection in tracker-store.</p>

tracker-store(1), tracker-sparql(1).</p>
