<p>PIC(1) General Commands Manual PIC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pic - compile pictures for troff or TeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pic [ -nvCSU ] [ filename ... ] <br>
pic -t [ -cvzCSU ] [ filename ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page describes the GNU version of pic, which is
part of the groff document formatting system. pic compiles
descriptions of pictures embedded within troff or TeX <br>
input files into commands that are understood by TeX or
troff. Each picture starts with a line beginning with .PS
and ends with a line beginning with .PE. Anything outside of
<br>
.PS and .PE is passed through without change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is the user&rsquo;s
responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the PS
and PE macros. When the macro package being used does not
supply such definitions (for example, old <br>
versions of -ms), appropriate definitions can be obtained
with -mpic: These will center each picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options that do not take arguments may be grouped behind a
single -. The special option -- can be used to mark the end
of the options. A filename of - refers to the standard <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Recognize .PS and .PE even
when followed by a character other than space or
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Safer mode; do not execute sh
commands. This can be useful when operating on untrustworthy
input. (enabled by default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Unsafe mode; revert the
default option -S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Don&rsquo;t use the groff
extensions to the troff drawing commands. You should use
this if you are using a postprocessor that doesn&rsquo;t
support these extensions. The extensions <br>
are described in groff_out(5). The -n option also causes pic
not to use zero-length lines to draw dots in troff mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t TeX mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Be more compatible with tpic.
Implies -t. Lines beginning with &nbsp;are not passed
through transparently. Lines beginning with . are passed
through with the initial . <br>
changed to . A line beginning with .ps is given special
treatment: it takes an optional integer argument specifying
the line thickness (pen size) in milliinches; a miss&acirc;
<br>
ing argument restores the previous line thickness; the
default line thickness is 8 milliinches. The line thickness
thus specified takes effect only when a non-negative <br>
line thickness has not been specified by use of the
thickness attribute or by setting the linethick
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z In TeX mode draw dots using
zero-length lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options supported
by other versions of pic are ignored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Draw all lines using the
sequence. pic always does this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T dev Generate output for the
troff device dev. This is unnecessary because the troff
output generated by pic is device-independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
This section describes only the differences between GNU pic
and the original version of pic. Many of these differences
also apply to newer versions of Unix pic. A complete
doc&acirc; <br>
umentation is available in the file</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/doc/groff-1.22.2/pic.ms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TeX mode <br>
TeX mode is enabled by the -t option. In TeX mode, pic will
define a vbox called aph for each picture. Use the figname
command to change the name of the vbox. You must <br>
yourself print that vbox using, for example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actually, since the vbox has a
height of zero (it is defined with p) this will produce
slightly more vertical space above the picture than below
it;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would avoid this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make the vbox having a
positive height and a depth of zero (as used e.g. by
LaTeX&rsquo;s graphics.sty), define the following macro in
your document:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eficbox#1{% <br>
x{nvbox x a <br>
Now you can simply say icbox{graph} instead of p h .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must use a TeX driver that
supports the tpic specials, version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines beginning with &nbsp; are
passed through transparently; a % is added to the end of the
line to avoid unwanted spaces. You can safely use this
feature to change fonts or to s e l i n e s k i p . A <br>
change the value of ny well produce undesirable results; y t
h i n g e l s e m use at your own risk. Lines beginning with
a period are not given any special treatment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
for variable = expr1 to expr2 [by [*]expr3] do X body X <br>
Set variable to expr1. While the value of variable is less
than or equal to expr2, do body and increment variable by
expr3; if by is not given, increment variable by 1. <br>
If expr3 is prefixed by * then variable will instead be
multiplied by expr3. The value of expr3 can be negative for
the additive case; variable is then tested whether it <br>
is greater than or equal to expr2. For the multiplicative
case, expr3 must be greater than zero. If the constraints
aren&rsquo;t met, the loop isn&rsquo;t executed. X can be
any <br>
character not occurring in body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if expr then X if-true X [else Y
if-false Y] <br>
Evaluate expr; if it is non-zero then do if-true, otherwise
do if-false. X can be any character not occurring in
if-true. Y can be any character not occurring in if- <br>
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print arg... <br>
Concatenate the arguments and print as a line on stderr.
Each arg must be an expression, a position, or text. This is
useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command arg... <br>
Concatenate the arguments and pass them through as a line to
troff or TeX. Each arg must be an expression, a position, or
text. This has a similar effect to a line <br>
beginning with . or but allows the values of variables to be
passed through. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS <br>
x = 14 <br>
command &quot;.ds string x is &quot; x &quot;.&quot; <br>
.PE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x is 14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh X command X <br>
Pass command to a shell. X can be any character not
occurring in command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy &quot;filename&quot; <br>
Include filename at this point in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy [&quot;filename&quot;] thru
X body X [until &quot;word&quot;] <br>
copy [&quot;filename&quot;] thru macro [until
&quot;word&quot;] <br>
This construct does body once for each line of filename; the
line is split into blank-delimited words, and occurrences of
$i in body, for i between 1 and 9, are replaced <br>
by the i-th word of the line. If filename is not given,
lines are taken from the current input up to .PE. If an
until clause is specified, lines will be read only until
<br>
a line the first word of which is word; that line will then
be discarded. X can be any character not occurring in body.
For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS <br>
copy thru % circle at ($1,$2) % until &quot;END&quot; <br>
1 2 <br>
3 4 <br>
5 6 <br>
END <br>
box <br>
.PE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS <br>
circle at (1,2) <br>
circle at (3,4) <br>
circle at (5,6) <br>
box <br>
.PE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands to be performed for
each line can also be taken from a macro defined earlier by
giving the name of the macro as the argument to thru.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset <br>
reset variable1[,] variable2 ... <br>
Reset pre-defined variables variable1, variable2 ... to
their default values. If no arguments are given, reset all
pre-defined variables to their default values. Note <br>
that assigning a value to scale also causes all pre-defined
variables that control dimensions to be reset to their
default values times the new value of scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot expr [&quot;text&quot;]
<br>
This is a text object which is constructed by using text as
a format string for sprintf with an argument of expr. If
text is omitted a format string of &quot;%g&quot; is used.
<br>
Attributes can be specified in the same way as for a normal
text object. Be very careful that you specify an appropriate
format string; pic does only very limited check&acirc; <br>
ing of the string. This is deprecated in favour of
sprintf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable := expr <br>
This is similar to = except variable must already be
defined, and expr will be assigned to variable without
creating a variable local to the current block. (By
contrast, <br>
= defines the variable in the current block if it is not
already defined there, and then changes the value in the
current block only.) For example, the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS <br>
x = 3 <br>
y = 3 <br>
[ <br>
x := 5 <br>
y = 5 <br>
] <br>
print x &quot; &quot; y <br>
.PE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X anything X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are also allowed to be of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ anything }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case anything can
contain balanced occurrences of { and }. Strings may contain
X or imbalanced occurrences of { and }.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expressions <br>
The syntax for expressions has been significantly
extended:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x ^ y (exponentiation) <br>
sin(x) <br>
cos(x) <br>
atan2(y, x) <br>
log(x) (base 10) <br>
exp(x) (base 10, ie 10^x) <br>
sqrt(x) <br>
int(x) <br>
rand() (return a random number between 0 and 1) <br>
rand(x) (return a random number between 1 and x; deprecated)
<br>
srand(x) (set the random number seed) <br>
max(e1, e2) <br>
min(e1, e2) <br>
!e <br>
e1 &amp;&amp; e2 <br>
e1 || e2 <br>
e1 == e2 <br>
e1 != e2 <br>
e1 &gt;= e2 <br>
e1 &gt; e2 <br>
e1 &lt;= e2 <br>
e1 &lt; e2 <br>
&quot;str1&quot; == &quot;str2&quot; <br>
&quot;str1&quot; != &quot;str2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String comparison expressions
must be parenthesised in some contexts to avoid
ambiguity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Changes <br>
A bare expression, expr, is acceptable as an attribute; it
is equivalent to dir expr, where dir is the current
direction. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line 2i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means draw a line 2 inches long
in the current direction. The &lsquo;i&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;I&rsquo;) character is ignored; to use another
measurement unit, set the scale variable to an appropriate
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum width and height of
the picture are taken from the variables maxpswid and
maxpsht. Initially these have values 8.5 and 11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Scientific notation is allowed
for numbers. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x = 5e-2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text attributes can be
compounded. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;foo&quot; above ljust</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no limit to the depth
to which blocks can be examined. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[A: [B: [C: box ]]] with
.A.B.C.sw at 1,2 <br>
circle at last [].A.B.C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arcs now have compass points
determined by the circle of which the arc is a part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Circles, ellipses, and arcs can
be dotted or dashed. In TeX mode splines can be dotted or
dashed also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boxes can have rounded corners.
The rad attribute specifies the radius of the
quarter-circles at each corner. If no rad or diam attribute
is given, a radius of boxrad is used. <br>
Initially, boxrad has a value of 0. A box with rounded
corners can be dotted or dashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boxes can have slanted sides.
This effectively changes the shape of a box from a rectangle
to an arbitrary parallelogram. The xslanted and yslanted
attributes specify the x and <br>
y offset of the box&rsquo;s upper right corner from its
default position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .PS line can have a second
argument specifying a maximum height for the picture. If the
width of zero is specified the width will be ignored in
computing the scaling factor <br>
for the picture. Note that GNU pic will always scale a
picture by the same amount vertically as well as
horizontally. This is different from the DWB 2.0 pic which
may scale a <br>
picture by a different amount vertically than horizontally
if a height is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each text object has an
invisible box associated with it. The compass points of a
text object are determined by this box. The implicit motion
associated with the object is also <br>
determined by this box. The dimensions of this box are taken
from the width and height attributes; if the width attribute
is not supplied then the width will be taken to be
tex&acirc; <br>
twid; if the height attribute is not supplied then the
height will be taken to be the number of text strings
associated with the object times textht. Initially textwid
and tex&acirc; <br>
tht have a value of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In (almost all) places where a
quoted text string can be used, an expression of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sprintf(&quot;format&quot;,
arg,...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">can also be used; this will
produce the arguments formatted according to format, which
should be a string as described in printf(3) appropriate for
the number of arguments sup&acirc; <br>
plied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The thickness of the lines used
to draw objects is controlled by the linethick variable.
This gives the thickness of lines in points. A negative
value means use the default <br>
thickness: in TeX output mode, this means use a thickness of
8 milliinches; in TeX output mode with the -c option, this
means use the line thickness specified by .ps lines; in <br>
troff output mode, this means use a thickness proportional
to the pointsize. A zero value means draw the thinnest
possible line supported by the output device. Initially it
has <br>
a value of -1. There is also a thick[ness] attribute. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">circle thickness 1.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would draw a circle using a line
with a thickness of 1.5 points. The thickness of lines is
not affected by the value of the scale variable, nor by the
width or height given in <br>
the .PS line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boxes (including boxes with
rounded corners or slanted sides), circles and ellipses can
be filled by giving them an attribute of fill[ed]. This
takes an optional argument of an <br>
expression with a value between 0 and 1; 0 will fill it with
white, 1 with black, values in between with a proportionally
gray shade. A value greater than 1 can also be used: <br>
this means fill with the shade of gray that is currently
being used for text and lines. Normally this will be black,
but output devices may provide a mechanism for changing <br>
this. Without an argument, then the value of the variable
fillval will be used. Initially this has a value of 0.5. The
invisible attribute does not affect the filling of <br>
objects. Any text associated with a filled object will be
added after the object has been filled, so that the text
will not be obscured by the filling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Three additional modifiers are
available to specify colored objects: outline[d] sets the
color of the outline, shaded the fill color, and
colo[u]r[ed] sets both. All three key&acirc; <br>
words expect a suffix specifying the color, for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">circle shaded &quot;green&quot;
outline &quot;black&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, color support
isn&rsquo;t available in TeX mode. Predefined color names
for groff are in the device macro files, for example
ps.tmac; additional colors can be defined with <br>
the .defcolor request (see the manual page of troff(1) for
more details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change the name of the vbox
in TeX mode, set the pseudo-variable figname (which is
actually a specially parsed command) within a picture.
Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.PS <br>
figname = foobar; <br>
... <br>
.PE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The picture is then available in
the box obar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pic assumes that at the
beginning of a picture both glyph and fill color are set to
the default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrow heads will be drawn as
solid triangles if the variable arrowhead is non-zero and
either TeX mode is enabled or the -n option has not been
given. Initially arrowhead has a <br>
value of 1. Note that solid arrow heads are always filled
with the current outline color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The troff output of pic is
device-independent. The -T option is therefore redundant.
All numbers are taken to be in inches; numbers are never
interpreted to be in troff machine <br>
units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Objects can have an aligned
attribute. This will only work if the postprocessor is
grops, or gropdf. Any text associated with an object having
the aligned attribute will be <br>
rotated about the center of the object so that it is aligned
in the direction from the start point to the end point of
the object. Note that this attribute will have no effect
<br>
for objects whose start and end points are coincident.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In places where nth is allowed
&lsquo;expr&rsquo;th is also allowed. Note that &rsquo;th is
a single token: no space is allowed between the &rsquo; and
the th. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for i = 1 to 4 do { <br>
line from &lsquo;i&rsquo;th box.nw to &lsquo;i+1&rsquo;th
box.se <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERSION <br>
To obtain a stand-alone picture from a pic file, enclose
your pic code with .PS and .PE requests; roff configuration
commands may be added at the beginning of the file, but no
<br>
roff text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is necessary to feed this
file into groff without adding any page information, so you
must check which .PS and .PE requests are actually called.
For example, the mm macro <br>
package adds a page number, which is very annoying. At the
moment, calling standard groff without any macro package
works. Alternatively, you can define your own requests, e.g.
<br>
to do nothing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.de PS <br>
.. <br>
.de PE <br>
..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">groff itself does not provide
direct conversion into other graphics file formats. But
there are lots of possibilities if you first transform your
picture into PostScript&Acirc;&reg; format <br>
using the groff option -Tps. Since this ps-file lacks
BoundingBox information it is not very useful by itself, but
it may be fed into other conversion programs, usually named
<br>
ps2other or pstoother or the like. Moreover, the PostScript
interpreter ghostscript (gs) has built-in graphics
conversion devices that are called with the option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gs -sDEVICE=&lt;devname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Call</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gs --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for a list of the available
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative may be to use the
-Tpdf option to convert your picture directly into PDF
format. The MediaBox of the file produced can be controlled
by passing a -P-p papersize <br>
to groff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the Encapsulated PostScript
File Format EPS is getting more and more important, and the
conversion wasn&rsquo;t regarded trivial in the past you
might be interested to know that <br>
there is a conversion tool named ps2eps which does the right
job. It is much better than the tool ps2epsi packaged with
gs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For bitmapped graphic formats,
you should use pstopnm; the resulting (intermediate) PNM
file can be then converted to virtually any graphics format
using the tools of the netpbm <br>
package .</p>
