<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fax2ps - convert a TIFF facsimile to compressed
PostScript&acirc;&cent;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fax2ps [ options ] [ file ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fax2ps reads one or more TIFF facsimile image files and
prints a compressed form of PostScript on the standard
output that is suitable for printing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, each page is scaled
to reflect the image dimensions and resolutions stored in
the file. The -x and -y options can be used to specify the
horizontal and vertical <br>
image resolutions (lines/inch), respectively. If the -S
option is specified, each page is scaled to fill an output
page. The default output page is 8.5 by 11 inches. Alternate
<br>
page dimensions can be specified in inches with the -W and
-H options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default fax2ps generates
PostScript for all pages in the file. The -p option can be
used to select one or more pages from a multi-page
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fax2ps generates a compressed
form of PostScript that is optimized for sending pages of
text to a PostScript printer attached to a host through a
low-speed link (such as a serial <br>
line). Each output page is filled with white and then only
the black areas are drawn. The PostScript specification of
the black drawing operations is optimized by using a
spe&acirc; <br>
cial font that encodes the move-draw operations required to
fill the black regions on the page. This compression scheme
typically results in a substantially reduced PostScript <br>
description, relative to the straightforward imaging of the
page with a PostScript image operator. This algorithm can,
however, be ineffective for continuous-tone and white-on-
<br>
black images. For these images, it sometimes is more
efficient to send the raster bitmap image directly; see
tiff2ps(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-p number Print only the indicated page. Multiple pages may
be printed by specifying this option more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x resolution <br>
Use resolution as the horizontal resolution, in dots/inch,
of the image data. By default this value is taken from the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y resolution <br>
Use resolution as the vertical resolution, in lines/inch, of
the image data. By default this value is taken from the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Scale each page of image data
to fill the output page dimensions. By default images are
presented according to the dimension information recorded in
the TIFF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W width Use width as the width,
in inches, of the output page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H height Use height as the
height, in inches, of the output page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Some messages about malformed TIFF images come from the TIFF
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various messages about badly
formatted facsimile images may be generated due to
transmission errors in received facsimile. fax2ps attempts
to recover from such data errors by <br>
resynchronizing decoding at the end of the current scanline.
This can result in long horizontal black lines in the
resultant PostScript image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
If the destination printer supports PostScript Level II then
it is always faster to just send the encoded bitmap
generated by the tiff2ps(1) program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
fax2ps should probably figure out when it is doing a poor
job of compressing the output and just generate PostScript
to image the bitmap raster instead.</p>
