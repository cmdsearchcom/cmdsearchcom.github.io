perlmacosx - Perl under Mac OS X
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
This document briefly describes Perl under Mac OS X.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  curl http://www.cpan.org/src/perl-5.12.3.tar.gz &gt; perl-5.12.3.tar.gz 
  tar -xzf perl-5.12.3.tar.gz 
  cd perl-5.12.3
  ./Configure -des -Dprefix=/usr/local/
  make
  make test
  sudo make install
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The latest Perl release (5.12.3 as of this writing) builds without changes under
  all versions of Mac OS X from 10.3 &quot;Panther&quot; onwards.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to build your own version of Perl you will need 'make' this is part of
  the Apples developer tools (you only need the 'unix tools'), usually supplied
  with Mac OS install DVDs. You do not need the latest version of Xcode (which
  is now charged for) in order to install make.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier Mac OS X releases (10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; and older) did not include a
  completely thread-safe libc, so threading is not fully supported. Also,
  earlier releases included a buggy libdb, so some of the DB_File tests are
  known to fail on those releases.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Installation_Prefix"><a class="selflink" href="#Installation_Prefix">Installation
  Prefix</a></h2>
The default installation location for this release uses the traditional UNIX
  directory layout under /usr/local. This is the recommended location for most
  users, and will leave the Apple-supplied Perl and its modules undisturbed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using an installation prefix of '/usr' will result in a directory layout that
  mirrors that of Apple's default Perl, with core modules stored in
  '/System/Library/Perl/${version}', CPAN modules stored in
  '/Library/Perl/${version}', and the addition of
  '/Network/Library/Perl/${version}' to @INC for modules that are stored on a
  file server and used by many Macs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SDK_support"><a class="selflink" href="#SDK_support">SDK
  support</a></h2>
First, export the path to the SDK into the build environment:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use an SDK by exporting some additions to Perl's 'ccflags' and '..flags' config
  variables:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ./Configure -Accflags=&quot;-nostdinc -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \
                           -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include \
                           -F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; \
                -Aldflags=&quot;-Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK&quot; \
                -de
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Universal_Binary_support"><a class="selflink" href="#Universal_Binary_support">Universal
  Binary support</a></h2>
To compile perl as a universal binary (built for both ppc and intel), export the
  SDK variable as above, selecting the 10.4u SDK:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the compiler flags used to select the SDK, also add the flags for
  creating a universal binary:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    ./Configure -Accflags=&quot;-arch i686 -arch ppc -nostdinc -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \
                           -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include \
                           -F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; \
                -Aldflags=&quot;-arch i686 -arch ppc -Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK&quot; \
                -de
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Leopard (MacOSX 10.5.6 at the time of this writing) you must use the 10.5
  SDK:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the same compiler flags you would use with the 10.4u SDK.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Keep in mind that these compiler and linker settings will also be used when
  building CPAN modules. For XS modules to be compiled as a universal binary,
  any libraries it links to must also be universal binaries. The system
  libraries that Apple includes with the 10.4u SDK are all universal, but
  user-installed libraries may need to be re-installed as universal binaries.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="64-bit_PPC_support"><a class="selflink" href="#64-bit_PPC_support">64-bit
  PPC support</a></h2>
Follow the instructions in <i>INSTALL</i> to build perl with support for 64-bit
  integers (&quot;use64bitint&quot;) or both 64-bit integers and 64-bit
  addressing (&quot;use64bitall&quot;). In the latter case, the resulting binary
  will run only on G5-based hosts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Support for 64-bit addressing is experimental: some aspects of Perl may be
  omitted or buggy. Note the messages output by <i>Configure</i> for further
  information. Please use &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit a problem report in the
  event that you encounter difficulties.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When building 64-bit modules, it is your responsibility to ensure that linked
  external libraries and frameworks provide 64-bit support: if they do not,
  module building may appear to succeed, but attempts to use the module will
  result in run-time dynamic linking errors, and subsequent test failures. You
  can use &quot;file&quot; to discover the architectures supported by a library:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $ file libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib 
    libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
    libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc):      Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
    libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc64):    Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library ppc64
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this issue precludes the building of many Macintosh-specific CPAN
  modules (&quot;Mac::*&quot;), as the required Apple frameworks do not provide
  PPC64 support. Similarly, downloads from Fink or Darwinports are unlikely to
  provide 64-bit support; the libraries must be rebuilt from source with the
  appropriate compiler and linker flags. For further information, see Apple's
  <i>64-Bit Transition Guide</i> at
  &lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/index.html&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="libperl_and_Prebinding"><a class="selflink" href="#libperl_and_Prebinding">libperl
  and Prebinding</a></h2>
Mac OS X ships with a dynamically-loaded libperl, but the default for this
  release is to compile a static libperl. The reason for this is pre-binding.
  Dynamic libraries can be pre-bound to a specific address in memory in order to
  decrease load time. To do this, one needs to be aware of the location and size
  of all previously-loaded libraries. Apple collects this information as part of
  their overall OS build process, and thus has easy access to it when building
  Perl, but ordinary users would need to go to a great deal of effort to obtain
  the information needed for pre-binding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can override the default and build a shared libperl if you wish
  (Configure&#x00A0;...&#x00A0;-Duseshrplib), but the load time on pre-10.4 OS
  releases will be greater than either the static library, or Apple's pre-bound
  dynamic library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; and newer, Apple has all but eliminated the
  performance penalty for non-prebound libraries.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Updating_Apple's_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Updating_Apple's_Perl">Updating
  Apple's Perl</a></h2>
In a word - don't, at least without a *very* good reason. Your scripts can just
  as easily begin with &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot; as with
  &quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;. Scripts supplied by Apple and other third parties
  as part of installation packages and such have generally only been tested with
  the /usr/bin/perl that's installed by Apple.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find that you do need to update the system Perl, one issue worth keeping
  in mind is the question of static vs. dynamic libraries. If you upgrade using
  the default static libperl, you will find that the dynamic libperl supplied by
  Apple will not be deleted. If both libraries are present when an application
  that links against libperl is built, ld will link against the dynamic library
  by default. So, if you need to replace Apple's dynamic libperl with a static
  libperl, you need to be sure to delete the older dynamic library after you've
  installed the update.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Known_problems"><a class="selflink" href="#Known_problems">Known
  problems</a></h2>
If you have installed extra libraries such as GDBM through Fink (in other words,
  you have libraries under <i>/sw/lib</i>), or libdlcompat to
  <i>/usr/local/lib</i>, you may need to be extra careful when running Configure
  to not to confuse Configure and Perl about which libraries to use. Being
  confused will show up for example as &quot;dyld&quot; errors about symbol
  problems, for example during &quot;make test&quot;. The safest bet is to run
  Configure as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Configure ... -Uloclibpth -Dlibpth=/usr/lib
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to make Configure look only into the system libraries. If you have some extra
  library directories that you really want to use (such as newer Berkeley DB
  libraries in pre-Panther systems), add those to the libpth:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Configure ... -Uloclibpth -Dlibpth='/usr/lib /opt/lib'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default of building Perl statically may cause problems with complex
  applications like Tk: in that case consider building shared Perl
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    Configure ... -Duseshrplib
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but remember that there's a startup cost to pay in that case (see above
  &quot;libperl and Prebinding&quot;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Starting with Tiger (Mac OS X 10.4), Apple shipped broken locale files for the
  eu_ES locale (Basque-Spain). In previous releases of Perl, this resulted in
  failures in the <i>lib/locale</i> test. These failures have been suppressed in
  the current release of Perl by making the test ignore the broken locale. If
  you need to use the eu_ES locale, you should contact Apple support.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cocoa"><a class="selflink" href="#Cocoa">Cocoa</a></h2>
There are two ways to use Cocoa from Perl. Apple's PerlObjCBridge module,
  included with Mac OS X, can be used by standalone scripts to access Foundation
  (i.e. non-GUI) classes and objects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An alternative is CamelBones, a framework that allows access to both Foundation
  and AppKit classes and objects, so that full GUI applications can be built in
  Perl. CamelBones can be found on SourceForge, at
  &lt;http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/camelbones/&gt;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Starting_From_Scratch"><a class="selflink" href="#Starting_From_Scratch">Starting
  From Scratch</a></h1>
Unfortunately it is not that difficult somehow manage to break one's Mac OS X
  Perl rather severely. If all else fails and you want to really, <b>REALLY</b>,
  start from scratch and remove even your Apple Perl installation (which has
  become corrupted somehow), the following instructions should do it. <b>Please
  think twice before following</b> <b>these instructions: they are much like
  conducting brain surgery to</b> <b>yourself. Without anesthesia.</b> We will
  <b>not</b> come to fix your system if you do this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, get rid of the libperl.dylib:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # cd /System/Library/Perl/darwin/CORE
    # rm libperl.dylib
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then delete every .bundle file found anywhere in the folders:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /System/Library/Perl
    /Library/Perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can find them for example by
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # find /System/Library/Perl /Library/Perl -name '*.bundle' -print
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After this you can either copy Perl from your operating system media (you will
  need at least the /System/Library/Perl and /usr/bin/perl), or rebuild Perl
  from the source code with &quot;Configure -Dprefix=/usr -Duseshrplib&quot;
  NOTE: the &quot;-Dprefix=/usr&quot; to replace the system Perl works much
  better with Perl 5.8.1 and later, in Perl 5.8.0 the settings were not quite
  right.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Pacifist&quot; from CharlesSoft (&lt;http://www.charlessoft.com/&gt;) is a
  nice way to extract the Perl binaries from the OS media, without having to
  reinstall the entire OS.
