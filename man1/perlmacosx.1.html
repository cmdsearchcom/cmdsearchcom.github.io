<p>PERLMACOSX(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLMACOSX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlmacosx - Perl under Mac OS X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
This document briefly describes Perl under Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">curl
http://www.cpan.org/src/perl-5.12.3.tar.gz &gt;
perl-5.12.3.tar.gz <br>
tar -xzf perl-5.12.3.tar.gz <br>
cd perl-5.12.3 <br>
./Configure -des -Dprefix=/usr/local/ <br>
make <br>
make test <br>
sudo make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The latest Perl release (5.12.3 as of this writing) builds
without changes under all versions of Mac OS X from 10.3
&quot;Panther&quot; onwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to build your own
version of Perl you will need &rsquo;make&rsquo; this is
part of the Apples developer tools (you only need the
&rsquo;unix tools&rsquo;), usually supplied with Mac OS
install <br>
DVDs. You do not need the latest version of Xcode (which is
now charged for) in order to install make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier Mac OS X releases (10.2
&quot;Jaguar&quot; and older) did not include a completely
thread-safe libc, so threading is not fully supported. Also,
earlier releases included a buggy <br>
libdb, so some of the DB_File tests are known to fail on
those releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation Prefix <br>
The default installation location for this release uses the
traditional UNIX directory layout under /usr/local. This is
the recommended location for most users, and will leave <br>
the Apple-supplied Perl and its modules undisturbed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using an installation prefix of
&rsquo;/usr&rsquo; will result in a directory layout that
mirrors that of Apple&rsquo;s default Perl, with core
modules stored in
&rsquo;/System/Library/Perl/${version}&rsquo;, <br>
CPAN modules stored in
&rsquo;/Library/Perl/${version}&rsquo;, and the addition of
&rsquo;/Network/Library/Perl/${version}&rsquo; to @INC for
modules that are stored on a file server and used by many
<br>
Macs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SDK support <br>
First, export the path to the SDK into the build
environment:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use an SDK by exporting some
additions to Perl&rsquo;s &rsquo;ccflags&rsquo; and
&rsquo;..flags&rsquo; config variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./Configure
-Accflags=&quot;-nostdinc -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc
-B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include
-F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot;
-Aldflags=&quot;-Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK&quot; -de</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Universal Binary support <br>
To compile perl as a universal binary (built for both ppc
and intel), export the SDK variable as above, selecting the
10.4u SDK:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the compiler
flags used to select the SDK, also add the flags for
creating a universal binary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./Configure
-Accflags=&quot;-arch i686 -arch ppc -nostdinc
-B$SDK/usr/include/gcc -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc
-isystem$SDK/usr/include
-F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; -Aldflags=&quot;-arch
i686 -arch ppc -Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK&quot; -de</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Leopard (MacOSX 10.5.6 at the
time of this writing) you must use the 10.5 SDK:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the same compiler
flags you would use with the 10.4u SDK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind that these compiler
and linker settings will also be used when building CPAN
modules. For XS modules to be compiled as a universal
binary, any libraries it links to <br>
must also be universal binaries. The system libraries that
Apple includes with the 10.4u SDK are all universal, but
user-installed libraries may need to be re-installed as <br>
universal binaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64-bit PPC support <br>
Follow the instructions in INSTALL to build perl with
support for 64-bit integers (&quot;use64bitint&quot;) or
both 64-bit integers and 64-bit addressing
(&quot;use64bitall&quot;). In the latter <br>
case, the resulting binary will run only on G5-based
hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for 64-bit addressing is
experimental: some aspects of Perl may be omitted or buggy.
Note the messages output by Configure for further
information. Please use &quot;perlbug&quot; <br>
to submit a problem report in the event that you encounter
difficulties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When building 64-bit modules, it
is your responsibility to ensure that linked external
libraries and frameworks provide 64-bit support: if they do
not, module building may appear <br>
to succeed, but attempts to use the module will result in
run-time dynamic linking errors, and subsequent test
failures. You can use &quot;file&quot; to discover the
architectures <br>
supported by a library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ file libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib <br>
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
<br>
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc): Mach-O
dynamically linked shared library ppc <br>
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc64): Mach-O 64-bit
dynamically linked shared library ppc64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this issue precludes
the building of many Macintosh-specific CPAN modules
(&quot;Mac::*&quot;), as the required Apple frameworks do
not provide PPC64 support. Similarly, <br>
downloads from Fink or Darwinports are unlikely to provide
64-bit support; the libraries must be rebuilt from source
with the appropriate compiler and linker flags. For further
<br>
information, see Apple&rsquo;s 64-Bit Transition Guide at
&lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/index.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libperl and Prebinding <br>
Mac OS X ships with a dynamically-loaded libperl, but the
default for this release is to compile a static libperl. The
reason for this is pre-binding. Dynamic libraries can be
<br>
pre-bound to a specific address in memory in order to
decrease load time. To do this, one needs to be aware of the
location and size of all previously-loaded libraries. Apple
<br>
collects this information as part of their overall OS build
process, and thus has easy access to it when building Perl,
but ordinary users would need to go to a great deal of <br>
effort to obtain the information needed for pre-binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can override the default and
build a shared libperl if you wish (Configure ...
-Duseshrplib), but the load time on pre-10.4 OS releases
will be greater than either the static <br>
library, or Apple&rsquo;s pre-bound dynamic library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With 10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot; and
newer, Apple has all but eliminated the performance penalty
for non-prebound libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updating Apple&rsquo;s Perl <br>
In a word - don&rsquo;t, at least without a *very* good
reason. Your scripts can just as easily begin with
&quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot; as with
&quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;. Scripts supplied by Apple <br>
and other third parties as part of installation packages and
such have generally only been tested with the /usr/bin/perl
that&rsquo;s installed by Apple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that you do need to
update the system Perl, one issue worth keeping in mind is
the question of static vs. dynamic libraries. If you upgrade
using the default static <br>
libperl, you will find that the dynamic libperl supplied by
Apple will not be deleted. If both libraries are present
when an application that links against libperl is built, ld
<br>
will link against the dynamic library by default. So, if you
need to replace Apple&rsquo;s dynamic libperl with a static
libperl, you need to be sure to delete the older dynamic
<br>
library after you&rsquo;ve installed the update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known problems <br>
If you have installed extra libraries such as GDBM through
Fink (in other words, you have libraries under /sw/lib), or
libdlcompat to /usr/local/lib, you may need to be extra <br>
careful when running Configure to not to confuse Configure
and Perl about which libraries to use. Being confused will
show up for example as &quot;dyld&quot; errors about symbol
problems, <br>
for example during &quot;make test&quot;. The safest bet is
to run Configure as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure ... -Uloclibpth
-Dlibpth=/usr/lib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to make Configure look only into
the system libraries. If you have some extra library
directories that you really want to use (such as newer
Berkeley DB libraries in pre-Panther <br>
systems), add those to the libpth:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure ... -Uloclibpth
-Dlibpth=&rsquo;/usr/lib /opt/lib&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default of building Perl
statically may cause problems with complex applications like
Tk: in that case consider building shared Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure ... -Duseshrplib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but remember that there&rsquo;s
a startup cost to pay in that case (see above &quot;libperl
and Prebinding&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with Tiger (Mac OS X
10.4), Apple shipped broken locale files for the eu_ES
locale (Basque-Spain). In previous releases of Perl, this
resulted in failures in the <br>
lib/locale test. These failures have been suppressed in the
current release of Perl by making the test ignore the broken
locale. If you need to use the eu_ES locale, you should <br>
contact Apple support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cocoa <br>
There are two ways to use Cocoa from Perl. Apple&rsquo;s
PerlObjCBridge module, included with Mac OS X, can be used
by standalone scripts to access Foundation (i.e. non-GUI)
classes <br>
and objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative is CamelBones, a
framework that allows access to both Foundation and AppKit
classes and objects, so that full GUI applications can be
built in Perl. CamelBones can <br>
be found on SourceForge, at
&lt;http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/camelbones/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting From Scratch <br>
Unfortunately it is not that difficult somehow manage to
break one&rsquo;s Mac OS X Perl rather severely. If all else
fails and you want to really, REALLY, start from scratch and
<br>
remove even your Apple Perl installation (which has become
corrupted somehow), the following instructions should do it.
Please think twice before following these instructions: <br>
they are much like conducting brain surgery to yourself.
Without anesthesia. We will not come to fix your system if
you do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, get rid of the
libperl.dylib:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd
/System/Library/Perl/darwin/CORE <br>
# rm libperl.dylib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then delete every .bundle file
found anywhere in the folders:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/System/Library/Perl <br>
/Library/Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can find them for example
by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># find /System/Library/Perl
/Library/Perl -name &rsquo;*.bundle&rsquo; -print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this you can either copy
Perl from your operating system media (you will need at
least the /System/Library/Perl and /usr/bin/perl), or
rebuild Perl from the source code <br>
with &quot;Configure -Dprefix=/usr -Duseshrplib&quot; NOTE:
the &quot;-Dprefix=/usr&quot; to replace the system Perl
works much better with Perl 5.8.1 and later, in Perl 5.8.0
the settings were not <br>
quite right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Pacifist&quot; from
CharlesSoft (&lt;http://www.charlessoft.com/&gt;) is a nice
way to extract the Perl binaries from the OS media, without
having to reinstall the entire OS.</p>
