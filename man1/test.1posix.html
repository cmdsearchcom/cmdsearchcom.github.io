<p>TEST(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
TEST(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
test &acirc; evaluate expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
test [expression]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ [expression] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The test utility shall evaluate the expression and indicate
the result of the evaluation by its exit status. An exit
status of zero indicates that the expression evaluated as
<br>
true and an exit status of 1 indicates that the expression
evaluated as false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second form of the
utility, which uses &quot;[]&quot; rather than test, the
application shall ensure that the square brackets are
separate arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The test utility shall not recognize the
&quot;&acirc;&acirc;&quot; argument in the manner specified
by Guideline 10 in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guide&acirc; <br>
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No options shall be
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The application shall ensure that all operators and elements
of primaries are presented as separate arguments to the test
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following primaries can be
used to construct expression:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;b pathname <br>
True if pathname resolves to en existing directory entry for

an existing directory entry for a file that does not have
its set-group-ID flag set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;h pathname <br>
True if pathname resolves to an existing directory entry for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t file_descriptor <br>
True if file descriptor number file_descriptor is open and
is associated with a terminal. False if file_descriptor is
not a valid file descriptor number, or if file <br>
descriptor number file_descriptor is not open, or if it is
open but is not associated with a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;u pathname <br>
True if pathname resolves to an existing directory entry for
a file that has its set-user-ID flag set. False if pathname

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression1 &acirc;a expression2
<br>
True if both expression1 and expression2 are true;
otherwise, false. The &acirc;a binary primary is left
associative. It has a higher precedence than &acirc;o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression1 &acirc;o expression2
<br>
True if either expression1 or expression2 is true;
otherwise, false. The &acirc;o binary primary is left
associative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the exception of the
&acirc;h pathname and &acirc;L pathname primaries, if a
pathname argument is a symbolic link, test shall evaluate
the expression by resolving the symbolic link and <br>
using the file referenced by the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These primaries can be combined
with the following operators:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! expression <br>
True if expression is false. False if expression is
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( expression ) <br>
True if expression is true. False if expression is false.
The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence
and associativity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primaries with two elements
of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;primary_operator
primary_operand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are known as unary primaries.
The primaries with three elements in either of the two
forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary_operand
&acirc;primary_operator primary_operand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary_operand primary_operator
primary_operand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are known as binary primaries.
Additional implementation-defined operators and
primary_operators may be provided by implementations. They
shall be of the form &acirc;operator where <br>
the first character of operator is not a digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm for determining
the precedence of the operators and the return value that
shall be generated is based on the number of arguments
presented to test. (However, when <br>
using the &quot;[...]&quot; form, the
&lt;right-square-bracket&gt; final argument shall not be
counted in this algorithm.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following list, $1, $2,
$3, and $4 represent the arguments presented to test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 arguments: <br>
Exit false (1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 argument: Exit true (0) if $1
is not null; otherwise, exit false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 arguments: <br>
* If $1 is &rsquo;!&rsquo;, exit true if $2 is null, false
if $2 is not null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If $1 is a unary primary, exit
true if the unary test is true, false if the unary test is
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Otherwise, produce unspecified
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 arguments: <br>
* If $2 is a binary primary, perform the binary test of $1
and $3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If $1 is &rsquo;!&rsquo;,
negate the two-argument test of $2 and $3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If $1 is &rsquo;(&rsquo; and
$3 is &rsquo;)&rsquo;, perform the unary test of $2. On
systems that do not support the XSI option, the results are
unspecified if $1 is &rsquo;(&rsquo; and $3 is
&rsquo;)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Otherwise, produce unspecified
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 arguments: <br>
* If $1 is &rsquo;!&rsquo;, negate the three-argument test
of $2, $3, and $4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If $1 is &rsquo;(&rsquo; and
$4 is &rsquo;)&rsquo;, perform the two-argument test of $2

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Otherwise, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;4 arguments: <br>
The results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On XSI-conformant systems,
combinations of primaries and operators shall be evaluated
using the precedence and associativity rules described
previously. In addition, <br>
the string comparison binary primaries &rsquo;=&rsquo; and

primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>

variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The XSI extensions specifying the &acirc;a and &acirc;o
binary primaries and the &rsquo;(&rsquo; and &rsquo;)&rsquo;
operators have been marked obsolescent. (Many expressions
using them are ambiguously defined by <br>
the grammar depending on the specific expressions being
evaluated.) Scripts using these expressions should be
converted to the forms given below. Even though many
implementations <br>
will continue to support these obsolescent forms, scripts
should be extremely careful when dealing with user-supplied
input that could be confused with these and other primaries
<br>
and operators. Unless the application developer knows all
the cases that produce input to the script, invocations
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;$1&quot; &acirc;a
&quot;$2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should be written as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&amp;
test &quot;$2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to avoid problems if a user
supplied values such as $1 set to &rsquo;!&rsquo; and $2 set
to the null string. That is, in cases where maximal
portability is of concern, replace:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test expr1 &acirc;a expr2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test expr1 &amp;&amp; test
expr2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and replace:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test expr1 &acirc;o expr2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test expr1 || test expr2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but note that, in test, &acirc;a
has higher precedence than &acirc;o while
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; and &quot;||&quot; have equal
precedence in the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parentheses or braces can be
used in the shell command language to effect grouping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parentheses must be escaped when
using sh; for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test expr1 &acirc;a expr2
&acirc;o expr3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is not always
portable even on XSI-conformant systems depending on the
expressions specified by expr1, expr2, and expr3. The
following form can be used instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( test expr1 &amp;&amp; test
expr2 ) || test expr3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;$1&quot; <br>
test ! &quot;$1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">could not be used reliably on
some historical systems. Unexpected results would occur if
such a string expression were used and $1 expanded to
&rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;(&rsquo;, or a known unary primary.
<br>
Better constructs are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &acirc;n &quot;$1&quot;
<br>
test &acirc;z &quot;$1&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical systems have also
been unreliable given the common construct:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;$response&quot; =
&quot;expected string&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the following is a more
reliable form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;X$response&quot; =
&quot;Xexpected string&quot; <br>
test &quot;expected string&quot; = &quot;$response&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the second form
assumes that expected string could not be confused with any
unary primary. If expected string starts with
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, &rsquo;(&rsquo;, &rsquo;!&rsquo;, or
even &rsquo;=&rsquo;, the first form <br>
should be used instead. Using the preceding rules without
the XSI marked extensions, any of the three comparison forms
is reliable, given any input. (However, note that the <br>
strings are quoted in all cases.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the string comparison
binary primaries, &rsquo;=&rsquo; and &quot;!=&quot;, have a
higher precedence than any unary primary in the greater than
4 argument case, unexpected results can occur if <br>
arguments are not properly prepared. For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &acirc;d $1 &acirc;o
&acirc;d $2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $1 evaluates to a possible
directory name of &rsquo;=&rsquo;, the first three arguments
are considered a string comparison, which shall cause a
syntax error when the second &acirc;d is encoun&acirc; <br>
tered. One of the following forms prevents this; the second
is preferred:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &acirc;d &quot;$1&quot;
&acirc;o &acirc;d &quot;$2&quot; <br>
test &acirc;d &quot;$1&quot; || test &acirc;d
&quot;$2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also in the greater than 4
argument case:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;$1&quot; =
&quot;bat&quot; &acirc;a &quot;$2&quot; =
&quot;ball&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax errors occur if $1
evaluates to &rsquo;(&rsquo; or &rsquo;!&rsquo;. One of the
following forms prevents this; the third is preferred:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &quot;X$1&quot; =
&quot;Xbat&quot; &acirc;a &quot;X$2&quot; =
&quot;Xball&quot; <br>
test &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;bat&quot; &amp;&amp; test
&quot;$2&quot; = &quot;ball&quot; <br>
test &quot;X$1&quot; = &quot;Xbat&quot; &amp;&amp; test
&quot;X$2&quot; = &quot;Xball&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. Exit if there are not two or three arguments (two
variations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ $# &acirc;ne 2 ] &amp;&amp;
[ $# &acirc;ne 3 ]; then exit 1; fi <br>
if [ $# &acirc;lt 2 ] || [ $# &acirc;gt 3 ]; then exit 1;
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Perform a mkdir if a
directory does not exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test ! &acirc;d tempdir
&amp;&amp; mkdir tempdir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Wait for a file to become
non-readable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while test &acirc;r thefile <br>
do <br>
sleep 30 <br>
done <br>
echo &rsquo;&quot;thefile&quot; is no longer
readable&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Perform a command if the
argument is one of three strings (two variations):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ &quot;$1&quot; =
&quot;pear&quot; ] || [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;grape&quot; ]
|| [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;apple&quot; ] <br>
then <br>
command <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case &quot;$1&quot; in <br>
pear|grape|apple) command ;; <br>
esac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The KornShell-derived conditional command (double bracket
[[]]) was removed from the shell command language
description in an early proposal. Objections were raised
that the real <br>
problem is misuse of the test command ([), and putting it
into the shell is the wrong way to fix the problem. Instead,
proper documentation and a new shell reserved word (!) <br>
are sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tests that require multiple test
operations can be done at the shell level using individual
invocations of the test command and shell logicals, rather
than using the error-prone <br>
&acirc;o flag of test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSI-conformant systems support
more than four arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSI-conformant systems support
the combining of primaries with the following
constructs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression1 &acirc;a expression2
<br>
True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression1 &acirc;o expression2
<br>
True if at least one of expression1 and expression2 are
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( expression ) <br>
True if expression is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In evaluating these more complex
combined expressions, the following precedence rules are
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The unary primaries have
higher precedence than the algebraic binary primaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The unary primaries have lower
precedence than the string binary primaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The unary and binary primaries
have higher precedence than the unary string primary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The ! operator has higher
precedence than the &acirc;a operator, and the &acirc;a
operator has higher precedence than the &acirc;o
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The &acirc;a and &acirc;o
operators are left associative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The parentheses can be used to
alter the normal precedence and associativity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BSD and System V versions of
&acirc;f are not the same. The BSD definition was:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f file True if file
exists and is not a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SVID version (true if the
file exists and is a regular file) was chosen for this
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 because its use is consistent
with the &acirc;b, &acirc;c, &acirc;d, and &acirc;p operands
<br>
(file exists and is a specific file type).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;e primary, possessing
similar functionality to that provided by the C shell, was
added because it provides the only way for a shell script to
find out if a file exists with&acirc; <br>
out trying to open the file. Since implementations are
allowed to add additional file types, a portable script
cannot use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &acirc;b foo &acirc;o
&acirc;c foo &acirc;o &acirc;d foo &acirc;o &acirc;f foo
&acirc;o &acirc;p foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to find out if foo is an
existing file. On historical BSD systems, the existence of a
file could be determined by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test &acirc;f foo &acirc;o
&acirc;d foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but there was no easy way to
determine that an existing file was a regular file. An early
proposal used the KornShell &acirc;a primary (with the same
meaning), but this was changed to <br>
&acirc;e because there were concerns about the high
probability of humans confusing the &acirc;a primary with
the &acirc;a binary operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options were not
included in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, although they
are provided by some implementations. These operands should
not be used by new implementa&acirc; <br>
tions for other purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k file True if file
exists and its sticky bit is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;C file True if file is a
contiguous file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;V file True if file is a
version file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option was not
included because it was undocumented in most
implementations, has been removed from some implementations
(including System V), and the functionality <br>
is provided by the shell (see Section 2.6.2, Parameter
Expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;l string The length of
the string string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;b, &acirc;c,
&acirc;g, &acirc;p, &acirc;u, and &acirc;x operands are
derived from the SVID; historical BSD does not provide them.
The &acirc;k operand is derived from System V; historical
BSD does not provide <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On historical BSD systems, test
&acirc;w directory always returned false because test tried
to open the directory for writing, which always fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some additional primaries newly
invented or from the KornShell appeared in an early proposal
as part of the conditional command ([[]]): s1 &gt; s2, s1
&lt; s2, str = pattern, str != <br>
pattern, f1 &acirc;nt f2, f1 &acirc;ot f2, and f1 &acirc;ef
f2. They were not carried forward into the test utility when
the conditional command was removed from the shell because
they have not <br>
been included in the test utility built into historical
implementations of the sh utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;t file_descriptor
primary is shown with a mandatory argument because the
grammar is ambiguous if it can be omitted. Historical
implementations have allowed it to be omitted, <br>
providing a default of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is noted that &rsquo;[&rsquo;
is not part of the portable filename character set; however,
since it is required to be encoded by a single byte, and is
part of the portable character set, <br>
the name of this utility forms a character string across all
supported locales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
