<p>newaliases(1) General Commands Manual newaliases(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
newaliases - create a forwarding database from
/etc/aliases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
newaliases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
newaliases reads a table of sendmail-style forwarding
instructions from /etc/aliases and converts them into a
forwarding database in /etc/aliases.cdb. The forwarding
database <br>
can be used by fastforward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For safety, newaliases writes
the forwarding database to /etc/aliases.tmp and then moves
/etc/aliases.tmp to /etc/aliases.cdb. If there is a problem
creating /etc/aliases.tmp, <br>
newaliases complains and leaves /etc/aliases.cdb alone.
Deliveries can continue using /etc/aliases.cdb in the
meantime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newaliases always creates
/etc/aliases.cdb world-readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newaliases makes no attempt to
protect against simultaneous updates of
/etc/aliases.cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTRUCTION FORMAT <br>
newaliases imitates sendmail&rsquo;s handling of
/etc/aliases. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root: alice, bill</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">says that mail for root should
be forwarded to alice and bill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
newaliases does not support file deliveries. You can use the
file delivery mechanism described in dot-qmail(5)
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE ALIASES <br>
The simplest type of forwarding instruction is a line of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias: recip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any message sent to alias will
be forwarded to the recipient address recip. Addresses are
compared to alias without regard to case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forwarding instructions are
cumulative. If recip is itself an alias, messages to alias
will be forwarded the same way as messages to recip. For
example, with the following <br>
instructions, messages to postmaster@heaven.af.mil or
root@heaven.af.mil will be delivered to Bob:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">postmaster@heaven.af.mil:
bob@heaven.af.mil <br>
root@heaven.af.mil: postmaster@heaven.af.mil</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: With
sendmail, entries in /etc/aliases can override usernames.
With qmail, if you install fastforward in
~alias/.qmail-default, it will not see addresses <br>
that are controlled by other users. See qmail-getpw(8). To
change this, see qmail-users(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Various
versions of sendmail do various strange things with circular
alias definitions. See setforward(1) for details on
fastforward&rsquo;s behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: If there
are several forwarding instructions for a single alias,
sendmail will complain; fastforward will silently use the
first instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WILDCARDS <br>
alias can have the form user@host.dom for one user at one
host, @host.dom for all users at one host, or user for one
user at all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: sendmail
supports only user; it does not support per-host aliases. It
accepts user@host.dom if host.dom is a local host, but it
then treats it the same <br>
way as user, applying to all local hosts and virtual
domains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDRESS FORMATS <br>
Addresses in /etc/aliases are parsed the same way as
addresses in RFC 822 message headers. Parenthesized comments
and bracketed addresses are permitted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root: bob (Bob, the postmaster)
<br>
joe: Joe Shmoe &lt;shmoe@heaven.af.mil&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses with special
characters must be quoted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fred: &quot;spaced out
mailbox&quot;@heaven.af.mil</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address groups are not
permitted, since colons have a different use in
/etc/aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any recipient address without a
fully qualified domain name is fed through the defaulthost,
defaultdomain, and plusdomain mechanisms described in
qmail-header(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
sendmail&rsquo;s handling of quotes and backslashes violates
RFC 821 and RFC 822, and is not supported by newaliases. The
qmail-local delivery mechanism lets <br>
each user manage several addresses, so there is no need for
a special syntax to get around forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS <br>
An instruction may list more than one recipient address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias: recip1, recip2,
recip3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any message sent to alias will
be forwarded to all of the addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A forwarding instruction may be
split across several lines. Each line past the first must
either (1) begin with space or tab or (2) be empty:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostmaster: <br>
fred, <br>
joe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: sendmail
requires the colon to be on the first line of a multi-line
forwarding instruction. newaliases doesn&rsquo;t care
whether the colon is present at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: sendmail
does not permit blank lines in the middle of continuations.
This has the undesirable effect that a blank line behaves
differently from a line <br>
containing a single space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMENTS <br>
Any line in /etc/aliases that begins with # is ignored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># this is a comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A comment may be split across
several lines. Each line past the first must either (1)
begin with space or tab or (2) be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: sendmail
does not permit continuations of comment lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAMS <br>
If a recipient address does not contain a domain name, and
begins with a vertical bar, newaliases takes the rest of the
address as a program to run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">weather:
&quot;|weather-server&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fastforward will run
weather-server when a message arrives for weather.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Internet
addresses can legitimately start with a slash or vertical
bar. newaliases treats anything with an unquoted @ as an
address. sendmail appears to <br>
have various problems coping with these addresses, and with
commands that contain @ signs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
newaliases does not allow a vertical bar before double
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE FILES <br>
A recipient address of the form :include:file means
&lsquo;&lsquo;every address listed in file.&rsquo;&rsquo;
(Actually fastforward reads file.bin; see newinclude(1) for
further details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that file is read by
fastforward, not newaliases, so the system administrator
does not have to run newaliases every time file changes.
file must be world-readable and <br>
accessible to fastforward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: If an
:include: file is unreadable or nonexistent, sendmail skips
it; fastforward defers delivery of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: sendmail
does not permit spaces inside the literal text :include:.
newaliases does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Versions
of sendmail before V8 did not strip quotes from :include:
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALIAS OWNERS <br>
If there is an alias for owner-list, any message forwarded
through list will have its envelope sender set to
owner-list, so that bounces go back to owner-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: When an
alias includes the same recipient both inside and outside a
mailing list, fastforward sends the message twice, once with
each envelope sender. <br>
sendmail sends the message only once; its choice of envelope
sender for that recipient depends on the phase of the
moon.</p>
