  It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
  likely to abort. There are many reasons that a parallel process can fail
  during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or environment
  problems. This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
  additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI developer):
