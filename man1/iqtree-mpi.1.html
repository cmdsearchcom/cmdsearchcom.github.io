It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your
parallel process is likely to <br>
abort. There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orte_init; some of which are due to
configuration or environment problems. This failure appears
to be an <br>
internal failure; here&rsquo;s some additional information
(which may only be relevant to an Open MPI developer):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">orte_ess_init failed --&gt;
Returned value A system-required executable either could not
be found or was not executable by this user (-126) instead
of ORTE_SUCCESS</p>
