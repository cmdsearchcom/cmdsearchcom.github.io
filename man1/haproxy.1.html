<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
HAProxy - fast and reliable http reverse proxy and load
balancer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
haproxy -f &lt;configuration file&gt; [-L &lt;name&gt;] [-n
maxconn] [-N maxconn] [-C &lt;dir&gt;] [-v|-vv] [-d] [-D]
[-q] [-V] [-c] [-p &lt;pidfile&gt;] [-dk] [-ds] [-de] [-dp]
[-db] [-dM[&lt;byte&gt;]] <br>
[-m &lt;megs&gt;] [{-sf|-st} pidlist...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy which is particularly
suited for high availability environments. Indeed, it can:
<br>
- route HTTP requests depending on statically assigned
cookies ; <br>
- spread the load among several servers while assuring
server <br>
persistence through the use of HTTP cookies ; <br>
- switch to backup servers in the event a main one fails ;
<br>
- accept connections to special ports dedicated to service
<br>
monitoring ; <br>
- stop accepting connections without breaking existing ones
; <br>
- add/modify/delete HTTP headers both ways ; <br>
- block requests matching a particular pattern ; <br>
- hold clients to the right application server depending on
<br>
application cookies <br>
- report detailed status as HTML pages to authenticated
users from an <br>
URI intercepted from the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It needs very little resource.
Its event-driven architecture allows it to easily handle
thousands of simultaneous connections on hundreds of
instances without risking the sys&acirc; <br>
tem&rsquo;s stability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f &lt;configuration file&gt; <br>
Specify configuration file path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;name&gt; <br>
Set the local instance&rsquo;s peer name. Peers are defined
in the peers configuration section and used for syncing
stick tables between different instances. If this option is
<br>
not specified, the local hostname is used as peer name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n &lt;maxconn&gt; <br>
Set the high limit for the total number of simultaneous
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N &lt;maxconn&gt; <br>
Set the high limit for the per-listener number of
simultaneous connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;dir&gt; <br>
Change directory to &lt;dir&gt; before loading any
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display HAProxy&rsquo;s
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Display HAProxy&rsquo;s
version and all build options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Start in foreground with
debugging mode enabled. When the proxy runs in this mode, it
dumps every connections, disconnections, timestamps, and
HTTP headers to stdout. <br>
This should NEVER be used in an init script since it will
prevent the system from starting up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Start in daemon mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ds Start in systemd daemon
mode, keeping a process in foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Disable messages on
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Displays messages on output
even when -q or &rsquo;quiet&rsquo; are specified. Some
information about pollers and config file are displayed
during startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Only checks config file and
exits with code 0 if no error was found, or exits with code
1 if a syntax error was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;pidfile&gt; <br>
Ask the process to write down each of its children&rsquo;s
pids to this file in daemon mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dk Disable use of kqueue(2).
kqueue(2) is available only on BSD systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ds Disable use of speculative
epoll(7). epoll(7) is available only on Linux 2.6 and some
custom Linux 2.4 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-de Disable use of epoll(7).
epoll(7) is available only on Linux 2.6 and some custom
Linux 2.4 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dp Disables use of poll(2).
select(2) might be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dS Disables use of splice(2),
which is broken on older kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-db Disables background mode
(stays in foreground, useful for debugging). For debugging,
the &rsquo;-db&rsquo; option is very useful as it
temporarily disables daemon mode and multi- <br>
process mode. The service can then be stopped by simply
pressing Ctrl-C, without having to edit the config nor run
full debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dM[&lt;byte&gt;] <br>
Initializes all allocated memory areas with the given
&lt;byte&gt;. This makes it easier to detect bugs resulting
from uninitialized memory accesses, at the expense of
touching <br>
all allocated memory once. If &lt;byte&gt; is not specified,
it defaults to 0x50 (ASCII &rsquo;P&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;megs&gt; <br>
Enforce a memory usage limit to a maximum of &lt;megs&gt;
megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sf &lt;pidlist&gt; <br>
Send FINISH signal to the pids in pidlist after startup. The
processes which receive this signal will wait for all
sessions to finish before exiting. This option must be <br>
specified last, followed by any number of PIDs. Technically
speaking, SIGTTOU and SIGUSR1 are sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-st &lt;pidlist&gt; <br>
Send TERMINATE signal to the pids in pidlist after startup.
The processes which receive this signal will wait
immediately terminate, closing all active sessions. This
<br>
option must be specified last, followed by any number of
PIDs. Technically speaking, SIGTTOU and SIGTERM are
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
Since HAProxy can run inside a chroot, it cannot reliably
access /dev/log. For this reason, it uses the UDP protocol
to send its logs to the server, even if it is the local <br>
server. People who experience trouble receiving logs should
ensure that their syslog daemon listens to the UDP socket.
Several Linux distributions which ship with syslogd from
<br>
the sysklogd package have UDP disabled by default. The -r
option must be passed to the daemon in order to enable
UDP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Some signals have a special meaning for the haproxy daemon.
Generally, they are used between daemons and need not be
used by the administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGUSR1 <br>
Tells the daemon to stop all proxies and exit once all
sessions are closed. It is often referred to as the
&quot;soft-stop&quot; signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGTTOU <br>
Tells the daemon to stop listening to all sockets. Used
internally by -sf and -st.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGTTIN <br>
Tells the daemon to restart listening to all sockets after a
SIGTTOU. Used internally when there was a problem during hot
reconfiguration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGINT and SIGTERM <br>
Both signals can be used to quickly stop the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGHUP <br>
Dumps the status of all proxies and servers into the logs.
Mostly used for trouble-shooting purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGQUIT <br>
Dumps information about memory pools on stderr. Mostly used
for debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- SIGPIPE <br>
This signal is intercepted and ignored on systems without
MSG_NOSIGNAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
A much better documentation can be found in
configuration.txt. On Debian systems, you can find this file
in /usr/share/doc/haproxy/configuration.txt.gz.</p>
