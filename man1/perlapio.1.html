<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Perl&rsquo;s source code, and extensions that want maximum
portability, should use the above functions instead of those
defined in ANSI C&rsquo;s stdio.h. The perl headers (in
particular <br>
&quot;perlio.h&quot;) will &quot;#define&quot; them to the
I/O mechanism selected at Configure time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functions are modeled on
those in stdio.h, but parameter order has been &quot;tidied
up a little&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;PerlIO *&quot; takes the
place of FILE *. Like FILE * it should be treated as opaque
(it is probably safe to assume it is a pointer to
something).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are currently three
implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. USE_STDIO <br>
All above are #define&rsquo;d to stdio functions or are
trivial wrapper functions which call stdio. In this case
only PerlIO * is a FILE *. This has been the default <br>
implementation since the abstraction was introduced in
perl5.003_02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. USE_SFIO <br>
A &quot;legacy&quot; implementation in terms of the
&quot;sfio&quot; library. Used for some specialist
applications on Unix machines (&quot;sfio&quot; is not
widely ported away from Unix). Most of above <br>
are #define&rsquo;d to the sfio functions. PerlIO * is in
this case Sfio_t *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. USE_PERLIO <br>
Introduced just after perl5.7.0, this is a re-implementation
of the above abstraction which allows perl more control over
how IO is done as it decouples IO from the way the <br>
operating system and C library choose to do things. For
USE_PERLIO PerlIO * has an extra layer of indirection - it
is a pointer-to-a-pointer. This allows the PerlIO * to <br>
remain with a known value while swapping the implementation
around underneath at run time. In this case all the above
are true (but very simple) functions which call the <br>
underlying implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the only implementation
for which &quot;PerlIO_apply_layers()&quot; does anything
&quot;interesting&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The USE_PERLIO implementation is
described in perliol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because &quot;perlio.h&quot; is
a thin layer (for efficiency) the semantics of these
functions are somewhat dependent on the underlying
implementation. Where these variations are <br>
understood they are noted below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless otherwise noted,
functions return 0 on success, or a negative value (usually
&quot;EOF&quot; which is usually -1) and set
&quot;errno&quot; on error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_stdin(), PerlIO_stdout(),
PerlIO_stderr() <br>
Use these rather than &quot;stdin&quot;, &quot;stdout&quot;,
&quot;stderr&quot;. They are written to look like
&quot;function calls&quot; rather than variables because
this makes it easier to make them function <br>
calls if platform cannot export data to loaded modules, or
if (say) different &quot;threads&quot; might have different
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_open(path, mode),
PerlIO_fdopen(fd,mode) <br>
These correspond to fopen()/fdopen() and the arguments are
the same. Return &quot;NULL&quot; and set &quot;errno&quot;
if there is an error. There may be an implementation limit
on the number <br>
of open handles, which may be lower than the limit on the
number of open files - &quot;errno&quot; may not be set when
&quot;NULL&quot; is returned if this limit is exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_reopen(path,mode,f) <br>
While this currently exists in all three implementations
perl itself does not use it. As perl does not use it, it is
not well tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl prefers to &quot;dup&quot;
the new low-level descriptor to the descriptor used by the
existing PerlIO. This may become the behaviour of this
function in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_printf(f,fmt,...),
PerlIO_vprintf(f,fmt,a) <br>
These are fprintf()/vfprintf() equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_stdoutf(fmt,...) <br>
This is printf() equivalent. printf is #defined to this
function, so it is (currently) legal to use
&quot;printf(fmt,...)&quot; in perl sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_read(f,buf,count),
PerlIO_write(f,buf,count) <br>
These correspond functionally to fread() and fwrite() but
the arguments and return values are different. The
PerlIO_read() and PerlIO_write() signatures have been
modeled on <br>
the more sane low level read() and write() functions
instead: The &quot;file&quot; argument is passed first,
there is only one &quot;count&quot;, and the return value
can distinguish between <br>
error and &quot;EOF&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns a byte count if
successful (which may be zero or positive), returns negative
value and sets &quot;errno&quot; on error. Depending on
implementation &quot;errno&quot; may be &quot;EINTR&quot; if
<br>
operation was interrupted by a signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_close(f) <br>
Depending on implementation &quot;errno&quot; may be
&quot;EINTR&quot; if operation was interrupted by a
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_puts(f,s),
PerlIO_putc(f,c) <br>
These correspond to fputs() and fputc(). Note that arguments
have been revised to have &quot;file&quot; first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_ungetc(f,c) <br>
This corresponds to ungetc(). Note that arguments have been
revised to have &quot;file&quot; first. Arranges that next
read operation will return the byte c. Despite the implied
<br>
&quot;character&quot; in the name only values in the range
0..0xFF are defined. Returns the byte c on success or -1
(&quot;EOF&quot;) on error. The number of bytes that can be
&quot;pushed back&quot; may <br>
vary, only 1 character is certain, and then only if it is
the last character that was read from the handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_getc(f) <br>
This corresponds to getc(). Despite the c in the name only
byte range 0..0xFF is supported. Returns the character read
or -1 (&quot;EOF&quot;) on error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_eof(f) <br>
This corresponds to feof(). Returns a true/false indication
of whether the handle is at end of file. For terminal
devices this may or may not be &quot;sticky&quot; depending
on the <br>
implementation. The flag is cleared by PerlIO_seek(), or
PerlIO_rewind().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_error(f) <br>
This corresponds to ferror(). Returns a true/false
indication of whether there has been an IO error on the
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_fileno(f) <br>
This corresponds to fileno(), note that on some platforms,
the meaning of &quot;fileno&quot; may not match Unix.
Returns -1 if the handle has no open descriptor associated
with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_clearerr(f) <br>
This corresponds to clearerr(), i.e., clears
&rsquo;error&rsquo; and (usually) &rsquo;eof&rsquo; flags
for the &quot;stream&quot;. Does not return a value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_flush(f) <br>
This corresponds to fflush(). Sends any buffered write data
to the underlying file. If called with &quot;NULL&quot; this
may flush all open streams (or core dump with some USE_STDIO
<br>
implementations). Calling on a handle open for read only, or
on which last operation was a read of some kind may lead to
undefined behaviour on some USE_STDIO <br>
implementations. The USE_PERLIO (layers) implementation
tries to behave better: it flushes all open streams when
passed &quot;NULL&quot;, and attempts to retain data on read
streams <br>
either in the buffer or by seeking the handle to the current
logical position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_seek(f,offset,whence)
<br>
This corresponds to fseek(). Sends buffered write data to
the underlying file, or discards any buffered read data,
then positions the file descriptor as specified by offset
<br>
and whence (sic). This is the correct thing to do when
switching between read and write on the same handle (see
issues with PerlIO_flush() above). Offset is of type
&quot;Off_t&quot; <br>
which is a perl Configure value which may not be same as
stdio&rsquo;s &quot;off_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_tell(f) <br>
This corresponds to ftell(). Returns the current file
position, or (Off_t) -1 on error. May just return value
system &quot;knows&quot; without making a system call or
checking the <br>
underlying file descriptor (so use on shared file
descriptors is not safe without a PerlIO_seek()). Return
value is of type &quot;Off_t&quot; which is a perl Configure
value which may <br>
not be same as stdio&rsquo;s &quot;off_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_getpos(f,p),
PerlIO_setpos(f,p) <br>
These correspond (loosely) to fgetpos() and fsetpos().
Rather than stdio&rsquo;s Fpos_t they expect a &quot;Perl
Scalar Value&quot; to be passed. What is stored there should
be considered <br>
opaque. The layout of the data may vary from handle to
handle. When not using stdio or if platform does not have
the stdio calls then they are implemented in terms of <br>
PerlIO_tell() and PerlIO_seek().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_rewind(f) <br>
This corresponds to rewind(). It is usually defined as
being</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_seek(f,(Off_t)0L,
SEEK_SET); <br>
PerlIO_clearerr(f);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_tmpfile() <br>
This corresponds to tmpfile(), i.e., returns an anonymous
PerlIO or NULL on error. The system will attempt to
automatically delete the file when closed. On Unix the file
is <br>
usually &quot;unlink&quot;-ed just after it is created so it
does not matter how it gets closed. On other systems the
file may only be deleted if closed via PerlIO_close() and/or
the <br>
program exits via &quot;exit&quot;. Depending on the
implementation there may be &quot;race conditions&quot;
which allow other processes access to the file, though in
general it will be safer <br>
in this regard than ad. hoc. schemes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_setlinebuf(f) <br>
This corresponds to setlinebuf(). Does not return a value.
What constitutes a &quot;line&quot; is implementation
dependent but usually means that writing &quot;0 flushes the
buffer. <br>
What happens with things like &quot;this0hat&quot; is
uncertain. (Perl core uses it only when &quot;dumping&quot;;
it has nothing to do with $| auto-flush.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Co-existence with stdio <br>
There is outline support for co-existence of PerlIO with
stdio. Obviously if PerlIO is implemented in terms of stdio
there is no problem. However in other cases then mechanisms
<br>
must exist to create a FILE * which can be passed to library
code which is going to use stdio calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first step is to add this
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define PERLIO_NOT_STDIO 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">before including any perl header
files. (This will probably become the default at some
point). That prevents &quot;perlio.h&quot; from attempting
to #define stdio functions onto PerlIO <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XS code is probably better using
&quot;typemap&quot; if it expects FILE * arguments. The
standard typemap will be adjusted to comprehend any changes
in this area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_importFILE(f,mode) <br>
Used to get a PerlIO * from a FILE *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mode argument should be a
string as would be passed to fopen/PerlIO_open. If it is
NULL then - for legacy support - the code will (depending
upon the platform and the <br>
implementation) either attempt to empirically determine the
mode in which f is open, or use &quot;r+&quot; to indicate a
read/write stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once called the FILE * should
ONLY be closed by calling &quot;PerlIO_close()&quot; on the
returned PerlIO *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PerlIO is set to textmode.
Use PerlIO_binmode if this is not the desired mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is not the reverse of
PerlIO_exportFILE().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_exportFILE(f,mode) <br>
Given a PerlIO * create a &rsquo;native&rsquo; FILE *
suitable for passing to code expecting to be compiled and
linked with ANSI C stdio.h. The mode argument should be a
string as would <br>
be passed to fopen/PerlIO_open. If it is NULL then - for
legacy support - the FILE * is opened in same mode as the
PerlIO *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fact that such a FILE * has
been &rsquo;exported&rsquo; is recorded, (normally by
pushing a new :stdio &quot;layer&quot; onto the PerlIO *),
which may affect future PerlIO operations on the <br>
original PerlIO *. You should not call &quot;fclose()&quot;
on the file unless you call &quot;PerlIO_releaseFILE()&quot;
to disassociate it from the PerlIO *. (Do not use
PerlIO_importFILE() <br>
for doing the disassociation.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling this function repeatedly
will create a FILE * on each call (and will push an :stdio
layer each time as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_releaseFILE(p,f) <br>
Calling PerlIO_releaseFILE informs PerlIO that all use of
FILE * is complete. It is removed from the list of
&rsquo;exported&rsquo; FILE *s, and the associated PerlIO *
should revert to <br>
its original behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this to disassociate a file
from a PerlIO * that was associated using
PerlIO_exportFILE().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_findFILE(f) <br>
Returns a native FILE * used by a stdio layer. If there is
none, it will create one with PerlIO_exportFILE. In either
case the FILE * should be considered as belonging to <br>
PerlIO subsystem and should only be closed by calling
&quot;PerlIO_close()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Fast gets&quot; Functions
<br>
In addition to standard-like API defined so far above there
is an &quot;implementation&quot; interface which allows perl
to get at internals of PerlIO. The following calls
correspond to <br>
the various FILE_xxx macros determined by Configure - or
their equivalent in other implementations. This section is
really of interest to only those concerned with detailed
perl- <br>
core behaviour, implementing a PerlIO mapping or writing
code which can make use of the &quot;read ahead&quot; that
has been done by the IO system in the same way perl does.
Note that any <br>
code that uses these interfaces must be prepared to do
things the traditional way if a handle does not support
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_fast_gets(f) <br>
Returns true if implementation has all the interfaces
required to allow perl&rsquo;s &quot;sv_gets&quot; to
&quot;bypass&quot; normal IO mechanism. This can vary from
handle to handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_fast_gets(f) =
PerlIO_has_cntptr(f) &amp;&amp; PerlIO_canset_cnt(f)
&amp;&amp; &rsquo;Can set pointer into buffer&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_has_cntptr(f) <br>
Implementation can return pointer to current position in the
&quot;buffer&quot; and a count of bytes available in the
buffer. Do not use this - use PerlIO_fast_gets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_get_cnt(f) <br>
Return count of readable bytes in the buffer. Zero or
negative return means no more bytes available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_get_ptr(f) <br>
Return pointer to next readable byte in buffer, accessing
via the pointer (dereferencing) is only safe if
PerlIO_get_cnt() has returned a positive value. Only
positive <br>
offsets up to value returned by PerlIO_get_cnt() are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_set_ptrcnt(f,p,c) <br>
Set pointer into buffer, and a count of bytes still in the
buffer. Should be used only to set pointer to within range
implied by previous calls to &quot;PerlIO_get_ptr&quot; and
<br>
&quot;PerlIO_get_cnt&quot;. The two values must be
consistent with each other (implementation may only use one
or the other or may require both).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_canset_cnt(f) <br>
Implementation can adjust its idea of number of bytes in the
buffer. Do not use this - use PerlIO_fast_gets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_set_cnt(f,c) <br>
Obscure - set count of bytes in the buffer. Deprecated. Only
usable if PerlIO_canset_cnt() returns true. Currently used
in only doio.c to force count less than -1 to -1. <br>
Perhaps should be PerlIO_set_empty or similar. This call may
actually do nothing if &quot;count&quot; is deduced from
pointer and a &quot;limit&quot;. Do not use this - use <br>
PerlIO_set_ptrcnt().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_has_base(f) <br>
Returns true if implementation has a buffer, and can return
pointer to whole buffer and its size. Used by perl for -T /
-B tests. Other uses would be very obscure...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_get_base(f) <br>
Return start of buffer. Access only positive offsets in the
buffer up to the value returned by PerlIO_get_bufsiz().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_get_bufsiz(f) <br>
Return the total number of bytes in the buffer, this is
neither the number that can be read, nor the amount of
memory allocated to the buffer. Rather it is what the
operating <br>
system and/or implementation happened to &quot;read()&quot;
(or whatever) last time IO was requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Functions <br>
PerlIO_apply_layers(f,mode,layers) <br>
The new interface to the USE_PERLIO implementation. The
layers &quot;:crlf&quot; and &quot;:raw&quot; are only ones
allowed for other implementations and those are silently
ignored. (As of <br>
perl5.8 &quot;:raw&quot; is deprecated.) Use
PerlIO_binmode() below for the portable case.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_binmode(f,ptype,imode,layers)
<br>
The hook used by perl&rsquo;s &quot;binmode&quot; operator.
ptype is perl&rsquo;s character for the kind of IO:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; read <br>
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; write <br>
&rsquo;+&rsquo; read/write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">imode is &quot;O_BINARY&quot; or
&quot;O_TEXT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">layers is a string of layers to
apply, only &quot;:crlf&quot; makes sense in the non
USE_PERLIO case. (As of perl5.8 &quot;:raw&quot; is
deprecated in favour of passing NULL.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portable cases are:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_binmode(f,ptype,O_BINARY,NULL);
<br>
and <br>
PerlIO_binmode(f,ptype,O_TEXT,&quot;:crlf&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix these calls probably
have no effect whatsoever. Elsewhere they alter &quot;0 to
CR,LF translation and possibly cause a special text
&quot;end of file&quot; indicator to be <br>
written or honoured on read. The effect of making the call
after doing any IO to the handle depends on the
implementation. (It may be ignored, affect any data which is
<br>
already buffered as well, or only apply to subsequent
data.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_debug(fmt,...) <br>
PerlIO_debug is a printf()-like function which can be used
for debugging. No return value. Its main use is inside
PerlIO where using real printf, warn() etc. would <br>
recursively call PerlIO and be a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PerlIO_debug writes to the file
named by $ENV{&rsquo;PERLIO_DEBUG&rsquo;} typical use might
be</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bourne shells (sh, ksh, bash,
