<p>ASP(1) User Manual ASP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
asp - find an host IP address by its name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
asp [-uv] [-f | [-d dir] [-e ext]] [-a addresses] [-r
repetitions] [-s send_delay] [-w wait_time] [-p port]
hostname <br>
asp -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Asp finds the IP address of an Internet connected host. In
order to find it, the peer hostname (not the FQDN), and the
range of its possible IP addresses need to be specified.
<br>
Those IP addresses could be simple IP addresses as 127.0.0.1
or &quot;metaip&quot; addresses as 127.0.0.1-20 or
127.0.0.*: the former is a simple way to avoid to type a lot
of consecutive <br>
addresses, the latter is short for 127.0.0.1-254.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to simplify the
management of the associations between hostnames and
addresses, asp searches in a specified directory a text file
containing the possible IP addresses of <br>
the looked for host. The name of the text file has to be
formed by the hostname followed by an optional extension of
your choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example to find the
author&rsquo;s dynamic IP address, obviously if I am on
line, you can provide my metaip address on standard input
with the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;195.31.186.1-62 <br>
194.166.58.2-18&quot; | asp -f atomic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or you can put my metaip address
in a file called atomic in your ~/.asp directory, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;195.31.186.1-62 <br>
194.166.58.2-18&quot; &gt; ~/.asp/atomic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then you can simply do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asp atomic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-u Update the file /etc/hosts with the IP address of
hostname or delete the possible old entry if the address is
not found. Obviously the file have to by writable by the
<br>
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Include more verbiage to make
output readable by humans. Default consists only of dotted
quad IP address, which is intended for output substitution
in scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force the reading of
addresses from standard input instead that from the
hostname&rsquo;s file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dir <br>
Set the directory containing the addresses file referred by
hostname to dir. Default is ~/.asp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e ext <br>
Set addresses files extension to ext. Default is no
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a addresses <br>
Set the number of queries to send before make a pause of
send_delay seconds. Default is 12 queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r repetitions <br>
Set the number of times to try the same address. Default is
3 times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s send_delay <br>
Delay the sending of the next group of addresses send_delay
seconds. Default is 2 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w wait_time <br>
Wait the peer reply for wait_time seconds. Default is 5
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Specify an alternative port number. For default the port
number is obtained searching the asp entry in
/etc/services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
ASPCMD This variable could be used to store your preferred
settings. An option set in this environment variable could
be overridden or toggled from command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
UDP is an unreliable protocol, therefore there is a chance
you will not find the host even if it is on line. Anyway, if
you are sure that the peer is on line and asp aware, you
<br>
could adjust the various parameters until you get a reply.
At last you will find the correct settings for your
particular needs. This until the RDM communication style
will be <br>
implemented under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously the hostname has to be
unique among the possible IP addresses: asp will hook to the
first correct reply.</p>
