<p>SSH-AGENT(1) BSD General Commands Manual
SSH-AGENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ssh-agent &acirc; authentication agent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ssh-agent [-c | -s] [-d] [-a bind_address] [-t life]
[command [arg ...]] <br>
ssh-agent [-c | -s] -k</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public
key authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ED25519). The idea is
that ssh-agent is started in the beginning of an X-session
<br>
or a login session, and all other windows or programs are
started as clients to the ssh-agent program. Through use of
environment variables the agent can be located and
automati&acirc; <br>
cally used for authentication when logging in to other
machines using ssh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a bind_address <br>
Bind the agent to the UNIX-domain socket bind_address. The
default is $TMPDIR/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.&lt;ppid&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Generate C-shell commands on
stdout. This is the default if SHELL looks like it&rsquo;s a
csh style of shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug mode. When this option
is specified ssh-agent will not fork.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Kill the current agent (given
by the SSH_AGENT_PID environment variable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Generate Bourne shell
commands on stdout. This is the default if SHELL does not
look like it&rsquo;s a csh style of shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t life <br>
Set a default value for the maximum lifetime of identities
added to the agent. The lifetime may be specified in seconds
or in a time format specified in sshd_config(5). A <br>
lifetime specified for an identity with ssh-add(1) overrides
this value. Without this option the default maximum lifetime
is forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a commandline is given, this
is executed as a subprocess of the agent. When the command
dies, so does the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The agent initially does not
have any private keys. Keys are added using ssh-add(1). When
executed without arguments, ssh-add(1) adds the files
~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, <br>
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/identity. If
the identity has a passphrase, ssh-add(1) asks for the
passphrase on the terminal if it has one or from a small X11
pro&acirc; <br>
gram if running under X11. If neither of these is the case
then the authentication will fail. It then sends the
identity to the agent. Several identities can be stored in
the <br>
agent; the agent can automatically use any of these
identities. ssh-add -l displays the identities currently
held by the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea is that the agent is
run in the user&rsquo;s local PC, laptop, or terminal.
Authentication data need not be stored on any other machine,
and authentication passphrases never go <br>
over the network. However, the connection to the agent is
forwarded over SSH remote logins, and the user can thus use
the privileges given by the identities anywhere in the
net&acirc; <br>
work in a secure way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two main ways to get
an agent set up: The first is that the agent starts a new
subcommand into which some environment variables are
exported, eg ssh-agent xterm &amp;. The <br>
second is that the agent prints the needed shell commands
(either sh(1) or csh(1) syntax can be generated) which can
be evaluated in the calling shell, eg eval &lsquo;ssh-agent
-s&lsquo; for <br>
Bourne-type shells such as sh(1) or ksh(1) and eval
&lsquo;ssh-agent -c&lsquo; for csh(1) and derivatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Later ssh(1) looks at these
variables and uses them to establish a connection to the
agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The agent will never send a
private key over its request channel. Instead, operations
that require a private key will be performed by the agent,
and the result will be returned to <br>
the requester. This way, private keys are not exposed to
clients using the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A UNIX-domain socket is created
and the name of this socket is stored in the SSH_AUTH_SOCK
environment variable. The socket is made accessible only to
the current user. This <br>
method is easily abused by root or another instance of the
same user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SSH_AGENT_PID environment
variable holds the agent&rsquo;s process ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The agent exits automatically
when the command given on the command line terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.ssh/identity <br>
Contains the protocol version 1 RSA authentication identity
of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/id_dsa <br>
Contains the protocol version 2 DSA authentication identity
of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa <br>
Contains the protocol version 2 ECDSA authentication
identity of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <br>
Contains the protocol version 2 ED25519 authentication
identity of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/id_rsa <br>
Contains the protocol version 2 RSA authentication identity
of the user.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$TMPDIR/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.&lt;ppid&gt;
<br>
UNIX-domain sockets used to contain the connection to the
authentication agent. These sockets should only be readable
by the owner. The sockets should get automatically <br>
removed when the agent exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG <br>
The reseeding of the OpenSSL random generator is usually
done from /dev/urandom. If the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG
environment variable is set to value other than 0 the
OpenSSL <br>
random generator is reseeded from /dev/random. The number of
bytes read is defined by the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG value.
Minimum is 14 bytes. This setting is not recommended <br>
on the computers without the hardware random generator
because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be
blocked until enough entropy is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12
release by Tatu Ylonen. Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus
Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed
many <br>
bugs, re-added newer features and created OpenSSH. Markus
Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5
and 2.0.</p>
