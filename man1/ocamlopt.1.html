<p>OCAMLOPT(1) General Commands Manual OCAMLOPT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ocamlopt - The OCaml native-code compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ocamlopt [ options ] filename ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocamlopt.opt (same options)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The OCaml high-performance native-code compiler ocamlopt(1)
compiles OCaml source files to native code object files and
link these object files to produce standalone
executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ocamlopt(1) command has a
command-line interface very close to that of ocamlc(1). It
accepts the same types of arguments and processes them
sequentially:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .mli are
taken to be source files for compilation unit interfaces.
Interfaces specify the names exported by compilation units:
they declare value names with <br>
their types, define public data types, declare abstract data
types, and so on. From the file x.mli, the ocamlopt(1)
compiler produces a compiled interface in the file x.cmi.
The <br>
interface produced is identical to that produced by the
bytecode compiler ocamlc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .ml are
taken to be source files for compilation unit
implementations. Implementations provide definitions for the
names exported by the unit, and also con&acirc; <br>
tain expressions to be evaluated for their side-effects.
From the file x.ml, the ocamlopt(1) compiler produces two
files: x.o, containing native object code, and x.cmx,
contain&acirc; <br>
ing extra information for linking and optimization of the
clients of the unit. The compiled implementation should
always be referred to under the name x.cmx (when given a .o
<br>
file, ocamlopt(1) assumes that it contains code compiled
from C, not from OCaml).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation is checked
against the interface file x.mli (if it exists) as described
in the manual for ocamlc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .cmx are
taken to be compiled object code. These files are linked
together, along with the object files obtained by compiling
.ml arguments (if any), and the <br>
OCaml standard library, to produce a native-code executable
program. The order in which .cmx and .ml arguments are
presented on the command line is relevant: compilation units
<br>
are initialized in that order at run-time, and it is a
link-time error to use a component of a unit before having
initialized it. Hence, a given x.cmx file must come before
all <br>
.cmx files that refer to the unit x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .cmxa are
taken to be libraries of object code. Such a library packs
in two files lib.cmxa and lib.a a set of object files
(.cmx/.o files). Libraries are <br>
build with ocamlopt -a (see the description of the -a option
below). The object files contained in the library are linked
as regular .cmx files (see above), in the order speci&acirc;
<br>
fied when the library was built. The only difference is that
if an object file contained in a library is not referenced
anywhere in the program, then it is not linked in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .c are
passed to the C compiler, which generates a .o object file.
This object file is linked with the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments ending in .o or .a are
assumed to be C object files and libraries. They are linked
with the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the linking phase
is a regular Unix executable file. It does not need
ocamlrun(1) to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocamlopt.opt is the same
compiler as ocamlopt, but compiled with itself instead of
with the bytecode compiler ocamlc(1). Thus, it behaves
exactly like ocamlopt, but compiles <br>
faster. ocamlopt.opt is not available in all installations
of OCaml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options are recognized by
ocamlopt(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Build a library (.cmxa/.a
file) with the object files (.cmx/.o files) given on the
command line, instead of linking them into an executable
file. The name of the library <br>
must be set with the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -cclib or -ccopt options are
passed on the command line, these options are stored in the
resulting .cmxa library. Then, linking with this library
automatically adds <br>
back the -cclib and -ccopt options as if they had been
provided on the command line, unless the -noautolink option
is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-absname <br>
Show absolute filenames in error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-annot Dump detailed information
about the compilation (types, bindings, tail-calls, etc).
The information for file src.ml is put into file src.annot.
In case of a type error, <br>
dump all the information inferred by the type-checker before
the error. The src.annot file can be used with the emacs
commands given in emacs/caml-types.el to display <br>
types and other annotations interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bin-annot <br>
Dump detailed information about the compilation (types,
bindings, tail-calls, etc) in binary format. The information
for file src.ml is put into file src.cmt. In case of <br>
a type error, dump all the information inferred by the
type-checker before the error. The annotation files produced
by -bin-annot contain more information and are much <br>
more compact than the files produced by -annot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Compile only. Suppress the
linking phase of the compilation. Source code files are
turned into compiled files, but no executable file is
produced. This option is useful to <br>
compile modules separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc ccomp <br>
Use ccomp as the C linker called to build the final
executable and as the C compiler for compiling .c source
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cclib -llibname <br>
Pass the -llibname option to the linker. This causes the
given C library to be linked with the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ccopt option <br>
Pass the given option to the C compiler and linker. For
instance, -ccopt -Ldir causes the C linker to search for C
libraries in directory dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compact <br>
Optimize the produced code for space rather than for time.
This results in smaller but slightly slower programs. The
default is to optimize for speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-config <br>
Print the version number of ocamlopt(1) and a detailed
summary of its configuration, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-for-pack module-path <br>
Generate an object file (.cmx and .o files) that can later
be included as a sub-module (with the given access path) of
a compilation unit constructed with -pack. For <br>
instance, ocamlopt -for-pack P -c A.ml will generate a.cmx
and a.o files that can later be used with ocamlopt -pack -o
P.cmx a.cmx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Add debugging information
while compiling and linking. This option is required in
order to produce stack backtraces when the program
terminates on an uncaught exception <br>
(see ocamlrun(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Cause the compiler to print
all defined names (with their inferred types or their
definitions) when compiling an implementation (.ml file). No
compiled files (.cmo and <br>
.cmi files) are produced. This can be useful to check the
types inferred by the compiler. Also, since the output
follows the syntax of interfaces, it can help in writing
<br>
an explicit interface (.mli file) for a file: just redirect
the standard output of the compiler to a .mli file, and edit
that file to remove all declarations of unexported <br>
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
Add the given directory to the list of directories searched
for compiled interface files (.cmi), compiled object code
files (.cmx), and libraries (.cmxa). By default, the <br>
current directory is searched first, then the standard
library directory. Directories added with -I are searched
after the current directory, in the order in which they <br>
were given on the command line, but before the standard
library directory. See also option -nostdlib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the given directory starts
with +, it is taken relative to the standard library
directory. For instance, -I +labltk adds the subdirectory
labltk of the standard library <br>
to the search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-impl filename <br>
Compile the file filename as an implementation file, even if
its extension is not .ml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inline n <br>
Set aggressiveness of inlining to n, where n is a positive
integer. Specifying -inline 0 prevents all functions from
being inlined, except those whose body is smaller than <br>
the call site. Thus, inlining causes no expansion in code
size. The default aggressiveness, -inline 1, allows slightly
larger functions to be inlined, resulting in a <br>
slight expansion in code size. Higher values for the -inline
option cause larger and larger functions to become candidate
for inlining, but can result in a serious <br>
increase in code size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-intf filename <br>
Compile the file filename as an interface file, even if its
extension is not .mli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-intf-suffix string <br>
Recognize file names ending with string as interface files
(instead of the default .mli).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-labels <br>
Labels are not ignored in types, labels may be used in
applications, and labelled parameters can be given in any
order. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linkall <br>
Force all modules contained in libraries to be linked in. If
this flag is not given, unreferenced modules are not linked
in. When building a library (-a flag), setting the <br>
-linkall flag forces all subsequent links of programs
involving that library to link all the modules contained in
the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-app-funct <br>
Deactivates the applicative behaviour of functors. With this
option, each functor application generates new types in its
result and applying the same functor twice to the <br>
same argument yields two incompatible structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noassert <br>
Do not compile assertion checks. Note that the special form
assert false is always compiled because it is typed
specially. This flag has no effect when linking already-
<br>
compiled files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noautolink <br>
When linking .cmxa libraries, ignore -cclib and -ccopt
options potentially contained in the libraries (if these
options were given when building the libraries). This can
<br>
be useful if a library contains incorrect specifications of
C libraries or C options; in this case, during linking, set
-noautolink and pass the correct C libraries and <br>
options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodynlink <br>
Allow the compiler to use some optimizations that are valid
only for code that is never dynlinked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdlib <br>
Do not automatically add the standard library directory the
list of directories searched for compiled interface files
(.cmi), compiled object code files (.cmx), and <br>
libraries (.cmxa). See also option -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolabels <br>
Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used
in applications, and parameter order becomes strict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o exec-file <br>
Specify the name of the output file produced by the linker.
The default output name is a.out, in keeping with the Unix
tradition. If the -a option is given, specify the <br>
name of the library produced. If the -pack option is given,
specify the name of the packed object file produced. If the
-output-obj option is given, specify the name of <br>
the output file produced. If the -shared option is given,
specify the name of plugin file produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-obj <br>
Cause the linker to produce a C object file instead of an
executable file. This is useful to wrap OCaml code as a C
library, callable from any C program. The name of the <br>
output object file must be set with the -o option. This
option can also be used to produce a compiled shared/dynamic
library (.so extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Generate extra code to write
profile information when the program is executed. The
profile information can then be examined with the analysis
program gprof(1). The -p <br>
option must be given both at compile-time and at link-time.
Linking object files not compiled with -p is possible, but
results in less precise profiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the gprof(1) man page for
more information about the profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full support for gprof(1) is
only available for certain platforms (currently: Intel
x86/Linux and Alpha/Digital Unix). On other platforms, the
-p option will result in a <br>
less precise profile (no call graph information, only a time
profile).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pack Build an object file (.cmx
and .o files) and its associated compiled interface (.cmi)
that combines the .cmx object files given on the command
line, making them appear as <br>
sub-modules of the output .cmx file. The name of the output
.cmx file must be given with the -o option. For instance,
ocamlopt -pack -o P.cmx A.cmx B.cmx C.cmx generates <br>
compiled files P.cmx, P.o and P.cmi describing a compilation
unit having three sub-modules A, B and C, corresponding to
the contents of the object files A.cmx, B.cmx and <br>
C.cmx. These contents can be referenced as P.A, P.B and P.C
in the remainder of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .cmx object files being
combined must have been compiled with the appropriate
-for-pack option. In the example above, A.cmx, B.cmx and
C.cmx must have been compiled <br>
with ocamlopt -for-pack P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple levels of packing can
be achieved by combining -pack with -for-pack. See The OCaml
user&rsquo;s manual, chapter &quot;Native-code
compilation&quot; for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pp command <br>
Cause the compiler to call the given command as a
preprocessor for each source file. The output of command is
redirected to an intermediate file, which is compiled. If
<br>
there are no compilation errors, the intermediate file is
deleted afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppx command <br>
After parsing, pipe the abstract syntax tree through the
preprocessor command. The format of the input and ouput of
the preprocessor are not yet documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-principal <br>
Check information path during type-checking, to make sure
that all types are derived in a principal way. All programs
accepted in -principal mode are also accepted in <br>
default mode with equivalent types, but different binary
signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rectypes <br>
Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking. By
default, only recursive types where the recursion goes
through an object type are supported. Note that once you
<br>
have created an interface using this flag, you must use it
again for all dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-runtime-variant suffix <br>
Add suffix to the name of the runtime library that will be
used by the program. If OCaml was configured with option
-with-debug-runtime, then the d suffix is supported <br>
and gives a debug version of the runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Keep the assembly code
produced during the compilation. The assembly code for the
source file x.ml is saved in the file x.s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared <br>
Build a plugin (usually .cmxs) that can be dynamically
loaded with the Dynlink module. The name of the plugin must
be set with the -o option. A plugin can include a number
<br>
of OCaml modules and libraries, and extra native objects
(.o, .a files). Building native plugins is only supported
for some operating system. Under some systems (cur&acirc;
<br>
rently, only Linux AMD 64), all the OCaml code linked in a
plugin must have been compiled without the -nodynlink flag.
Some constraints might also apply to the way the <br>
extra native objects have been compiled (under Linux AMD 64,
they must contain only position-independent code).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-short-paths <br>
When a type is visible under several module-paths, use the
shortest one when printing the type&rsquo;s name in inferred
interfaces and error and warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strict-sequence <br>
The left-hand part of a sequence must have type unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-thread <br>
Compile or link multithreaded programs, in combination with
the system threads library described in The OCaml
user&rsquo;s manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-unsafe <br>
Turn bound checking off for array and string accesses (the
v.(i)ands.[i] constructs). Programs compiled with -unsafe
are therefore faster, but unsafe: anything can happen <br>
if the program accesses an array or string outside of its
bounds. Additionally, turn off the check for zero divisor in
integer division and modulus operations. With <br>
-unsafe, an integer division (or modulus) by zero can halt
the program or continue with an unspecified result instead
of raising a Division_by_zero exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number of
the compiler and the location of the standard library
directory, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print all external commands before they are executed, in
particular invocations of the assembler, C compiler, and
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version or -vnum <br>
Print the version number of the compiler in short form (e.g.
&quot;3.11.0&quot;), then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w warning-list <br>
Enable, disable, or mark as fatal the warnings specified by
the argument warning-list. See ocamlc(1) for the syntax of
warning-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn-error warning-list <br>
Mark as fatal the warnings specified in the argument
warning-list. The compiler will stop with an error when one
of these warnings is emitted. The warning-list has the <br>
same meaning as for the -w option: a + sign (or an uppercase
letter) marks the corresponding warnings as fatal, a - sign
(or a lowercase letter) turns them back into non- <br>
fatal warnings, and a @ sign both enables and marks as fatal
the corresponding warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: it is not recommended to
use the -warn-error option in production code, because it
will almost certainly prevent compiling your program with
later versions of OCaml <br>
when they add new warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default setting is
-warn-error -a (all warnings are non-fatal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-warn-help <br>
Show the description of all available warning numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-where Print the location of the
standard library, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- file Process file as a file
name, even if it starts with a dash (-) character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help or --help <br>
Display a short usage summary and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE IA32
ARCHITECTURE <br>
The IA32 code generator (Intel Pentium, AMD Athlon) supports
the following additional option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffast-math <br>
Use the IA32 instructions to compute trigonometric and
exponential functions, instead of calling the corresponding
library routines. The functions affected are: atan, <br>
atan2, cos, log, log10, sin, sqrt and tan. The resulting
code runs faster, but the range of supported arguments and
the precision of the result can be reduced. In par&acirc;
<br>
ticular, trigonometric operations cos, sin, tan have their
range reduced to [-2^64, 2^64].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE AMD64
ARCHITECTURE <br>
The AMD64 code generator (64-bit versions of Intel Pentium
and AMD Athlon) supports the following additional
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fPIC Generate
position-independent machine code. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-PIC <br>
Generate position-dependent machine code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR THE SPARC
ARCHITECTURE <br>
The Sparc code generator supports the following additional
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=v8 <br>
Generate SPARC version 8 code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=v9 <br>
Generate SPARC version 9 code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to generate code
for SPARC version 7, which runs on all SPARC processors.</p>
