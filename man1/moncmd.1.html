<p>moncmd(1) moncmd moncmd(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
moncmd - send commands to mon daemon and show the
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
moncmd [-a] [-d] [-l username] [-f file] [-s server] [-p
port] [command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
moncmd sends commands to the mon server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Authenticate with the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d enable debugging, which is
the same as -s localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Read and execute commands from file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l username <br>
Supply username as the username while authenticating to the
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server <br>
Connect to server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Use TCP port port when connecting to the server, instead of
the default of 32777.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONITOR HOST <br>
moncmd will use the host specified by the -s parameter as
the server. If there is no -s parameter it will use the host
specified in the MONHOST environment variable. If there <br>
is no host in either of these locations it will exit with an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BATCH OPERATION <br>
If no commands are supplied to moncmd on the command line,
then commands will be taken from either standard input, or
from the file specified by the -f parameter. If standard
<br>
input is connected to a TTY and the -a option is supplied,
then it will prompt for a password. If the -a option is
supplied without the -f option and standard input is not a
<br>
TTY, then the username and password are read from standard
input using the syntax &quot;USER=username&quot; and
&quot;PASS=password&quot;. The remaining input lines are
interpreted as commands to <br>
send to the server. moncmd will not take usernames or
passwords from a file, for obvious security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the username is neither
supplied by the -l parameter or through standard input, it
is taken from the effective user ID of the current
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
The following is a list of the commands that the server
understands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable | disable service group
servicename <br>
Enables/disables alerts for group and servicename. All
disabled states are automatically saved to the state file,
which may optionally be re-loaded upon restarting or <br>
initial startup of the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ack group service comment <br>
Acknowledge a failure condition. This will store comment in
the state of service (queryable by doing a list opstatus
command), and will surppress further alerts for the <br>
service. Once the service returns to a non-failure state,
then the acknowledgement is reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Displays the protocol version in the form of &quot;version
num&quot; where num is the protocol version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list aliases <br>
Lists aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list aliasgroups <br>
Lists alias groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">savestate <br>
Save the state of the server. Currently, the only state
which is saved is the host/watches/services which are
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadstate <br>
Load the state of the server. Currently, the only state
which is loaded is the host/watches/services which are
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable | disable host hostname
<br>
Enables/disables host hostname in all groups. When the
monitor is called, this hostname will not be included in the
list of hostnames sent to the monitor. If a group has <br>
only one hostname in it, then the enable | disable watch
command should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable | disable watch
watchgroup <br>
Enables/disables an entire watch for watchgroup, as defined
in the configuration file. Disabling a watch not only stops
alerts from happening, but it stops the actual mon&acirc;
<br>
itor processes from being scheduled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset Resets the server, forcing
it to re-read the configuration file, kill off currently
running monitors, restart all monitoring, and reset all
counters. This command is only <br>
accessible if moncmd connects from the host which is running
the mon server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset stopped <br>
Resets the server and immediately stops the scheduler. This
is an atomic version of the commands reset and stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reload auth <br>
Reloads the auth.cf file in order to incorporate any new
changes. The auth table is completely re-generated; it is
not merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset keepstate <br>
If the word &quot;keepstate&quot; comes after the reset
command, the server will do a &quot;loadstate&quot; right
after the reset, before the scheduler kicks back in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop Stops the scheduler, but
continues to allow client connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start Re-starts the scheduler
after it has been stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test monitor group servicename
<br>
Triggers a test for group and service immediately by setting
the service&rsquo;s countdown timer to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test (alert | upalert |
startupalert) group servicename retval period <br>
Triggers a test alert, upalert, or startupalert for group
and servicename. retval is the integer exit value to pass to
the alert via the MON_RETVAL environment variable. <br>
You must also specify the period as it appears in the
configuration file. All alerts of the given type in that
period will be triggered, but the alert will not be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">servertime <br>
Returns the current time of the server as seconds since Jan
1, 1970.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list group groupname <br>
Lists the members of group groupname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list descriptions <br>
List the descriptions of each service, as defined in the
configuration file. If a service description is undefined,
then it is not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list alerthist <br>
Lists the last alarms triggered for each service of each
watch group, in addition to the summary output. The number
of alerts to keep in memory is bounded by the maxkeep <br>
variable, configurable on the mon command line at startup,
and expandable with the set command during runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list failurehist <br>
Lists the last failures, in addition to the summary output.
This is also limited by the maxkeep variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list opstatus <br>
Lists operational status of all services. Reports whether
the last time a service group was tested resulted in success
or failure. The output is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group service untested <br>
group service time timeleft succeeded <br>
group service time timeleft failed output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where output is the first line
of output from the monitor script which failed, time is the
time that the condition was last noticed in time(2) format,
and timeleft is the <br>
number of seconds left until the service is tested
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list successes <br>
Generates the same output as the list opstatus command, but
only shows the services that have succeeded the last time
they were tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list failures <br>
Generates the same output as the list opstatus command, but
only shows the services that have failed the last time they
were tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list disabled <br>
Lists all hosts and services which have been disabled by the
disable host|service command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list pids <br>
Shows the currently active watch groups/services along with
their process IDs, and it process ID of the server
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list watch <br>
Lists all watches and services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list state <br>
Lists the state of the scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set group service variable value
<br>
Sets a variable to value. Useful for temporarily changing an
interval or alertevery value. Be careful, because this can
just set any value in the %watch hash, and some <br>
values that are specified in the configuration file like
&quot;10m&quot; or &quot;35s&quot; are converted and stored
as just plain integer seconds (e.g.
&quot;alertevery&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get group service variable <br>
Displays the value of group service variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set variable value <br>
Assigns value to the global variable variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set opstatus group service value
<br>
Sets the opstatus value for group and service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get variable <br>
Shows the value of global variable variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term Terminates the server. This
command is only accessible if moncmd connects from the host
which is running the mon server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
MONSERVER <br>
The hostname of the server which runs the mon process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MONPORT <br>
The port number to connect to.</p>
