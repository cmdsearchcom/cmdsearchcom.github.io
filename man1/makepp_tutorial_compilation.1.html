makepp_tutorial_compilation -- Unix compilation commands
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Skip this this manual page if you have a good grasp on what the compilation
  commands do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I find that distressingly few people seem to be taught in their programming
  classes is how to go about compiling programs once they've written them.
  Novices rely either on a single memorized command, or else on the builtin
  rules in make. I have been surprised by extremely computer literate people who
  learned to compile without optimization because they simply never were told
  how important it is. Rudimentary knowledge of how compilation commands work
  may make your programs run twice as fast or more, so it's worth at least five
  minutes. This page describes just about everything you'll need to know to
  compile C or C++ programs on just about any variant of Unix.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The examples will be mostly for C, since C++ compilation is identical except
  that the name of the compiler is different. Suppose you're compiling source
  code in a file called &quot;xyz.c&quot; and you want to build a program called
  &quot;xyz&quot;. What must happen?
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may know that you can build your program in one step, using a command like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g xyz.c -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will work, but it conceals a two-step process that you must understand if
  you are writing makefiles. (Actually, there are more than two steps, but you
  only have to understand two of them.) For a program of more than one module,
  the two steps are usually explicitly separated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compilation"><a class="selflink" href="#Compilation">Compilation</a></h2>
The first step is the translation of your C or C++ source code into a binary
  file called an object file. Object files usually have an extension of
  &quot;.o&quot;. (For some more recent projects, &quot;.lo&quot; is also used
  for a slightly different kind of object file.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command to produce an object file on Unix looks something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;cc&quot; is the C compiler. Sometimes alternate C compilers are used; a
  very common one is called &quot;gcc&quot;. A common C++ compiler is the GNU
  compiler, usually called &quot;g++&quot;. Virtually all C and C++ compilers on
  Unix have the same syntax for the rest of the command (at least for basic
  operations), so the only difference would be the first word.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We'll explain what the &quot;-g&quot; option does later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-c&quot; option tells the C compiler to produce a &quot;.o&quot; file
  as output. (If you don't specify &quot;-c&quot;, then it performs the second
  compilation step automatically.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;-o&#x00A0;xyz.o&quot; option tells the compiler what the name of the
  object file is. You can omit this, as long as the name of the object file is
  the same as the name of the source file except for the &quot;.o&quot;
  extension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the most part, the order of the options and the file names does not matter.
  One important exception is that the output file must immediately follow
  &quot;-o&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Linking"><a class="selflink" href="#Linking">Linking</a></h2>
The second step of building a program is called <i>linking</i>. An object file
  cannot be run directly; it's an intermediate form that must be <i>linked</i>
  to other components in order to produce a program. Other components might
  include:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Libraries. A <i>library</i>, roughly speaking, is a
      collection of object modules that are included as necessary. For example,
      if your program calls the &quot;printf&quot; function, then the definition
      of the &quot;printf&quot; function must be included from the system C
      library. Some libraries are automatically linked into your program (e.g.,
      the one containing &quot;printf&quot;) so you never need to worry about
      them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Object files derived from other source files in your
      program. If you write your program so that it actually has several source
      files, normally you would compile each source file to a separate object
      file and then link them all together.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>linker</i> is the program responsible for taking a collection of object
  files and libraries and linking them together to produce an executable file.
  The executable file is the program you actually run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command to link the program looks something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g xyz.o -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It may seem odd, but we usually run the same program (&quot;cc&quot;) to perform
  the linking. What happens under the surface is that the &quot;cc&quot; program
  immediately passes off control to a different program (the linker, sometimes
  called the loader, or &quot;ld&quot;) after adding a number of complex pieces
  of information to the command line. For example, &quot;cc&quot; tells
  &quot;ld&quot; where the system library is that includes the definition of
  functions like &quot;printf&quot;. Until you start writing shared libraries,
  you usually do not need to deal directly with &quot;ld&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do not specify &quot;-o&#x00A0;xyz&quot;, then the output file will be
  called &quot;a.out&quot;, which seems to me to be a completely useless and
  confusing convention. So always specify &quot;-o&quot; on the linking step.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If your program has more than one object file, you should specify all the object
  files on the link command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_you_need_to_separate_the_steps"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_you_need_to_separate_the_steps">Why
  you need to separate the steps</a></h2>
Why not just use the simple, one-step command, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g xyz.c -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
instead of the more complicated two-stage compilation
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
    cc -g xyz.o -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
if internally the first is converted into the second? The difference is
  important only if there is more than one module in your program. Suppose we
  have an additional module, &quot;abc.c&quot;. Now our compilation looks like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # One-stage command.
    cc -g xyz.c abc.c -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # Two-stage command.
    cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
    cc -g -c abc.c -o abc.o
    cc -g xyz.o abc.o -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first method, of course, is converted internally into the second method.
  This means that both &quot;xyz.c&quot; and &quot;abc.c&quot; are recompiled
  each time the command is run. But if you only changed &quot;xyz.c&quot;,
  there's no need to recompile &quot;abc.c&quot;, so the second line of the
  two-stage commands does not need to be done. This can make a huge difference
  in compilation time, especially if you have many modules. For this reason,
  virtually all makefiles keep the two compilation steps separate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's pretty much the basics, but there are a few more little details you
  really should know about.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Debugging_vs._optimization"><a class="selflink" href="#Debugging_vs._optimization">Debugging
  vs. optimization</a></h2>
Usually programmers compile a program either either for debug or for speed.
  Compilation for speed is called <i>optimization</i>; compiling with
  optimization can make your code run up to 5 times faster or more, depending on
  your code, your processor, and your compiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With such dramatic gains possible, why would you ever not want to optimize? The
  most important answer is that optimization makes use of a debugger much more
  difficult (sometimes impossible). (If you don't know anything about a
  debugger, it's time to learn. The half hour or hour you'll spend learning the
  basics will be repaid many many times over in the time you'll save later when
  debugging. I'd recommend starting with a GUI debugger like &quot;kdbg&quot;,
  &quot;ddd&quot;, or &quot;gdb&quot; run from within emacs (see the info pages
  on gdb for instructions on how to do this).) Optimization reorders and
  combines statements, removes unnecessary temporary variables, and generally
  rearranges your code so that it's very tough to follow inside a debugger. The
  usual procedure is to write your code, compile it without optimization, debug
  it, and then turn on optimization.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order for the debugger to work, the compiler has to cooperate not only by not
  optimizing, but also by putting information about the names of the symbols
  into the object file so the debugger knows what things are called. This is
  what the &quot;-g&quot; compilation option does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're done debugging, and you want to optimize your code, simply replace
  &quot;-g&quot; with &quot;-O&quot;. For many compilers, you can specify
  increasing levels of optimization by appending a number after &quot;-O&quot;.
  You may also be able to specify other options that increase the speed under
  some circumstances (possibly trading off with increased memory usage). See
  your compiler's man page for details. For example, here is an optimizing
  compile command that I use frequently with the &quot;gcc&quot; compiler:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    gcc -O6 -malign-double -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may have to experiment with different optimization options for the absolute
  best performance. You may need different options for different pieces of code.
  Generally speaking, a simple optimization flag like &quot;-O6&quot; works with
  many compilers and usually produces pretty good results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Warning: on rare occasions, your program doesn't actually do exactly the same
  thing when it is compiled with optimization. This may be due to (1) an invalid
  assumption you made in your code that was harmless without optimization, but
  causes problems because the compiler takes the liberty of rearranging things
  when you optimize; or (2) sadly, compilers have bugs too, including bugs in
  their optimizers. For a stable compiler like &quot;gcc&quot; on a common
  platform like an Pentium, optimization bugs are seldom a problem (as of the
  year 2000--there were problems a few years ago).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you don't specify either &quot;-g&quot; or &quot;-O&quot; in your compilation
  command, the resulting object file is suitable neither for debugging nor for
  running fast. For some reason, this is the default. So always specify either
  &quot;-g&quot; or &quot;-O&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On some systems, you must supply &quot;-g&quot; on both the compilation and
  linking steps; on others (e.g. Linux), it needs to be supplied only on the
  compilation step. On some systems, &quot;-O&quot; actually does something
  different in the linking phase, while on others, it has no effect. In any
  case, it's always harmless to supply &quot;-g&quot; or &quot;-O&quot; for both
  commands.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Warnings"><a class="selflink" href="#Warnings">Warnings</a></h2>
Most compilers are capable of catching a number of common programming errors
  (e.g., forgetting to return a value from a function that's supposed to return
  a value). Usually, you'll want to turn on warnings. How you do this depends on
  your compiler (see the man page), but with the &quot;gcc&quot; compiler, I
  usually use something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    gcc -g -Wall -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Sometimes I also add &quot;-Wno-uninitialized&quot; after &quot;-Wall&quot;
  because of a warning that is usually wrong that crops up when optimizing.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
These warnings have saved me many many hours of debugging.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_useful_compilation_options"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_useful_compilation_options">Other
  useful compilation options</a></h2>
Often, necessary include files are stored in some directory other than the
  current directory or the system include directory ( <i>/usr/include</i>). This
  frequently happens when you are using a library that comes with include files
  to define the functions or classes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Suppose, for example, you are writing an application that uses the Qt libraries.
  You've installed a local copy of the Qt library in <i>/home/users/joe/qt</i>,
  which means that the include files are stored in the directory
  <i>/home/users/joe/qt/include</i>. In your code, you want to be able to do
  things like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #include &lt;qwidget.h&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
instead of
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #include &quot;/home/users/joe/qt/include/qwidget.h&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can tell the compiler to look for include files in a different directory by
  using the &quot;-I&quot; compilation option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    g++ -I/home/users/joe/qt/include -g -c mywidget.cpp -o mywidget.o
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is usually no space between the &quot;-I&quot; and the directory name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the C++ compiler is looking for the file <i>qwidget.h</i>, it will look in
  <i>/home/users/joe/qt/include</i> before looking in the system include
  directory. You can specify as many &quot;-I&quot; options as you want.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_libraries"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_libraries">Using
  libraries</a></h2>
You will often have to tell the linker to link with specific external libraries,
  if you are calling any functions that aren't part of the standard C library.
  The &quot;-l&quot; (lowercase L) option says to link with a specific library:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g xyz.o -o xyz -lm
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;-lm&quot; says to link with the system math library, which you will need
  if you are using functions like &quot;sqrt&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Beware:</b> if you specify more than one &quot;-l&quot; option, the order can
  make a difference on some systems. If you are getting undefined variables when
  you know you have included the library that defines them, you might try moving
  that library to the end of the command line, or even including it a second
  time at the end of the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes the libraries you will need are not stored in the default place for
  system libraries. &quot;-labc&quot; searches for a file called <i>libabc.a</i>
  or <i>libabc.so</i> or <i>libabc.sa</i> in the system library directories
  (<i>/usr/lib</i> and usually a few other places too, depending on what kind of
  Unix you're running). The &quot;-L&quot; option specifies an additional
  directory to search for libraries. To take the above example again, suppose
  you've installed the Qt libraries in <i>/home/users/joe/qt</i>, which means
  that the library files are in <i>/home/users/joe/qt/lib</i>. Your link step
  for your program might look something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    g++ -g test_mywidget.o mywidget.o -o test_mywidget -L/home/users/joe/qt/lib -lqt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(On some systems, if you link in Qt you will need to add other libraries as well
  (e.g., &quot;-L/usr/X11R6/lib&#x00A0;-lX11&#x00A0;-lXext&quot;). What you need
  to do will depend on your system.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there is no space between &quot;-L&quot; and the directory name. The
  &quot;-L&quot; option usually goes before any &quot;-l&quot; options it's
  supposed to affect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
How do you know which libraries you need? In general, this is a hard question,
  and varies depending on what kind of Unix you are running. The documentation
  for the functions or classes you are using should say what libraries you need
  to link with. If you are using functions or classes from an external package,
  there is usually a library you need to link with; the library will usually be
  a file called &quot;libabc.a&quot; or &quot;libabc.so&quot; or
  &quot;libabc.sa&quot; if you need to add a &quot;-labc&quot; option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Some_other_confusing_things"><a class="selflink" href="#Some_other_confusing_things">Some
  other confusing things</a></h2>
You may have noticed that it is possible to specify options which normally apply
  to compilation on the linking step, and options which normally apply to
  linking on the compilation step. For example, the following commands are
  valid:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g -L/usr/X11R6/lib -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
    cc -g -I/somewhere/include xyz.o -o xyz
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The irrelevant options are ignored; the above commands are exactly equivalent to
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o
    cc -g xyz.o -o xyz
</pre>
