<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_tutorial_compilation -- Unix compilation commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Skip this this manual page if you have a good grasp on what
the compilation commands do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I find that distressingly few
people seem to be taught in their programming classes is how
to go about compiling programs once they&rsquo;ve written
them. Novices rely either on a <br>
single memorized command, or else on the builtin rules in
make. I have been surprised by extremely computer literate
people who learned to compile without optimization because
<br>
they simply never were told how important it is. Rudimentary
knowledge of how compilation commands work may make your
programs run twice as fast or more, so it&rsquo;s worth at
least <br>
five minutes. This page describes just about everything
you&rsquo;ll need to know to compile C or C++ programs on
just about any variant of Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The examples will be mostly for
C, since C++ compilation is identical except that the name
of the compiler is different. Suppose you&rsquo;re compiling
source code in a file called <br>
&quot;xyz.c&quot; and you want to build a program called
&quot;xyz&quot;. What must happen?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may know that you can build
your program in one step, using a command like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g xyz.c -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will work, but it conceals
a two-step process that you must understand if you are
writing makefiles. (Actually, there are more than two steps,
but you only have to <br>
understand two of them.) For a program of more than one
module, the two steps are usually explicitly separated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation <br>
The first step is the translation of your C or C++ source
code into a binary file called an object file. Object files
usually have an extension of &quot;.o&quot;. (For some more
recent <br>
projects, &quot;.lo&quot; is also used for a slightly
different kind of object file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command to produce an object
file on Unix looks something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cc&quot; is the C
compiler. Sometimes alternate C compilers are used; a very
common one is called &quot;gcc&quot;. A common C++ compiler
is the GNU compiler, usually called &quot;g++&quot;.
Virtually <br>
all C and C++ compilers on Unix have the same syntax for the
rest of the command (at least for basic operations), so the
only difference would be the first word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll explain what the
&quot;-g&quot; option does later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-c&quot; option tells
the C compiler to produce a &quot;.o&quot; file as output.
(If you don&rsquo;t specify &quot;-c&quot;, then it performs
the second compilation step automatically.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;-o xyz.o&quot; option
tells the compiler what the name of the object file is. You
can omit this, as long as the name of the object file is the
same as the name of the source <br>
file except for the &quot;.o&quot; extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the most part, the order of
the options and the file names does not matter. One
important exception is that the output file must immediately
follow &quot;-o&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linking <br>
The second step of building a program is called linking. An
object file cannot be run directly; it&rsquo;s an
intermediate form that must be linked to other components in
order to <br>
produce a program. Other components might include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Libraries. A
library, roughly speaking, is a collection of object modules
that are included as necessary. For example, if your program
calls the &quot;printf&quot; function, then the <br>
definition of the &quot;printf&quot; function must be
included from the system C library. Some libraries are
automatically linked into your program (e.g., the one
containing &quot;printf&quot;) <br>
so you never need to worry about them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Object files
derived from other source files in your program. If you
write your program so that it actually has several source
files, normally you would compile each source <br>
file to a separate object file and then link them all
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The linker is the program
responsible for taking a collection of object files and
libraries and linking them together to produce an executable
file. The executable file is the <br>
program you actually run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command to link the program
looks something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g xyz.o -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may seem odd, but we usually
run the same program (&quot;cc&quot;) to perform the
linking. What happens under the surface is that the
&quot;cc&quot; program immediately passes off control to a
<br>
different program (the linker, sometimes called the loader,
or &quot;ld&quot;) after adding a number of complex pieces
of information to the command line. For example,
&quot;cc&quot; tells &quot;ld&quot; <br>
where the system library is that includes the definition of
functions like &quot;printf&quot;. Until you start writing
shared libraries, you usually do not need to deal directly
with <br>
&quot;ld&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify &quot;-o
xyz&quot;, then the output file will be called
&quot;a.out&quot;, which seems to me to be a completely
useless and confusing convention. So always specify
&quot;-o&quot; on the <br>
linking step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your program has more than
one object file, you should specify all the object files on
the link command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why you need to separate the
steps <br>
Why not just use the simple, one-step command, like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g xyz.c -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of the more complicated
two-stage compilation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o <br>
cc -g xyz.o -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if internally the first is
converted into the second? The difference is important only
if there is more than one module in your program. Suppose we
have an additional module, <br>
&quot;abc.c&quot;. Now our compilation looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># One-stage command. <br>
cc -g xyz.c abc.c -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Two-stage command. <br>
cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o <br>
cc -g -c abc.c -o abc.o <br>
cc -g xyz.o abc.o -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first method, of course, is
converted internally into the second method. This means that
both &quot;xyz.c&quot; and &quot;abc.c&quot; are recompiled
each time the command is run. But if you <br>
only changed &quot;xyz.c&quot;, there&rsquo;s no need to
recompile &quot;abc.c&quot;, so the second line of the
two-stage commands does not need to be done. This can make a
huge difference in compilation <br>
time, especially if you have many modules. For this reason,
virtually all makefiles keep the two compilation steps
separate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s pretty much the
basics, but there are a few more little details you really
should know about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging vs. optimization <br>
Usually programmers compile a program either either for
debug or for speed. Compilation for speed is called
optimization; compiling with optimization can make your code
run up <br>
to 5 times faster or more, depending on your code, your
processor, and your compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With such dramatic gains
possible, why would you ever not want to optimize? The most
important answer is that optimization makes use of a
debugger much more difficult (sometimes <br>
impossible). (If you don&rsquo;t know anything about a
debugger, it&rsquo;s time to learn. The half hour or hour
you&rsquo;ll spend learning the basics will be repaid many
many times over in the <br>
time you&rsquo;ll save later when debugging. I&rsquo;d
recommend starting with a GUI debugger like
&quot;kdbg&quot;, &quot;ddd&quot;, or &quot;gdb&quot; run
from within emacs (see the info pages on gdb for
instructions <br>
on how to do this).) Optimization reorders and combines
statements, removes unnecessary temporary variables, and
generally rearranges your code so that it&rsquo;s very tough
to follow <br>
inside a debugger. The usual procedure is to write your
code, compile it without optimization, debug it, and then
turn on optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for the debugger to
work, the compiler has to cooperate not only by not
optimizing, but also by putting information about the names
of the symbols into the object file <br>
so the debugger knows what things are called. This is what
the &quot;-g&quot; compilation option does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re done debugging,
and you want to optimize your code, simply replace
&quot;-g&quot; with &quot;-O&quot;. For many compilers, you
can specify increasing levels of optimization by appending a
<br>
number after &quot;-O&quot;. You may also be able to specify
other options that increase the speed under some
circumstances (possibly trading off with increased memory
usage). See your <br>
compiler&rsquo;s man page for details. For example, here is
an optimizing compile command that I use frequently with the
&quot;gcc&quot; compiler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -O6 -malign-double -c xyz.c
-o xyz.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may have to experiment with
different optimization options for the absolute best
performance. You may need different options for different
pieces of code. Generally <br>
speaking, a simple optimization flag like &quot;-O6&quot;
works with many compilers and usually produces pretty good
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: on rare occasions, your
program doesn&rsquo;t actually do exactly the same thing
when it is compiled with optimization. This may be due to
(1) an invalid assumption you made <br>
in your code that was harmless without optimization, but
causes problems because the compiler takes the liberty of
rearranging things when you optimize; or (2) sadly,
compilers <br>
have bugs too, including bugs in their optimizers. For a
stable compiler like &quot;gcc&quot; on a common platform
like an Pentium, optimization bugs are seldom a problem (as
of the year <br>
2000--there were problems a few years ago).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify
either &quot;-g&quot; or &quot;-O&quot; in your compilation
command, the resulting object file is suitable neither for
debugging nor for running fast. For some reason, this is
<br>
the default. So always specify either &quot;-g&quot; or
&quot;-O&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, you must supply
&quot;-g&quot; on both the compilation and linking steps; on
others (e.g. Linux), it needs to be supplied only on the
compilation step. On some systems, <br>
&quot;-O&quot; actually does something different in the
linking phase, while on others, it has no effect. In any
case, it&rsquo;s always harmless to supply &quot;-g&quot; or
&quot;-O&quot; for both commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings <br>
Most compilers are capable of catching a number of common
programming errors (e.g., forgetting to return a value from
a function that&rsquo;s supposed to return a value).
Usually, <br>
you&rsquo;ll want to turn on warnings. How you do this
depends on your compiler (see the man page), but with the
&quot;gcc&quot; compiler, I usually use something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -g -Wall -c xyz.c -o
xyz.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Sometimes I also add
&quot;-Wno-uninitialized&quot; after &quot;-Wall&quot;
because of a warning that is usually wrong that crops up
when optimizing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These warnings have saved me
many many hours of debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other useful compilation options
<br>
Often, necessary include files are stored in some directory
other than the current directory or the system include
directory (/usr/include). This frequently happens when you
are <br>
using a library that comes with include files to define the
functions or classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose, for example, you are
writing an application that uses the Qt libraries.
You&rsquo;ve installed a local copy of the Qt library in
/home/users/joe/qt, which means that the <br>
include files are stored in the directory
/home/users/joe/qt/include. In your code, you want to be
able to do things like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include &lt;qwidget.h&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include
&quot;/home/users/joe/qt/include/qwidget.h&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can tell the compiler to
look for include files in a different directory by using the
&quot;-I&quot; compilation option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g++ -I/home/users/joe/qt/include
-g -c mywidget.cpp -o mywidget.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is usually no space
between the &quot;-I&quot; and the directory name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the C++ compiler is looking
for the file qwidget.h, it will look in
/home/users/joe/qt/include before looking in the system
include directory. You can specify as many &quot;-I&quot;
<br>
options as you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using libraries <br>
You will often have to tell the linker to link with specific
external libraries, if you are calling any functions that
aren&rsquo;t part of the standard C library. The
&quot;-l&quot; (lowercase <br>
L) option says to link with a specific library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g xyz.o -o xyz -lm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-lm&quot; says to link
with the system math library, which you will need if you are
using functions like &quot;sqrt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware: if you specify more than
one &quot;-l&quot; option, the order can make a difference
on some systems. If you are getting undefined variables when
you know you have included the <br>
library that defines them, you might try moving that library
to the end of the command line, or even including it a
second time at the end of the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the libraries you will
need are not stored in the default place for system
libraries. &quot;-labc&quot; searches for a file called
libabc.a or libabc.so or libabc.sa in the <br>
system library directories (/usr/lib and usually a few other
places too, depending on what kind of Unix you&rsquo;re
running). The &quot;-L&quot; option specifies an additional
directory to <br>
search for libraries. To take the above example again,
suppose you&rsquo;ve installed the Qt libraries in
/home/users/joe/qt, which means that the library files are
in <br>
/home/users/joe/qt/lib. Your link step for your program
might look something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g++ -g test_mywidget.o
mywidget.o -o test_mywidget -L/home/users/joe/qt/lib
-lqt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(On some systems, if you link in
Qt you will need to add other libraries as well (e.g.,
&quot;-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11 -lXext&quot;). What you need to
do will depend on your system.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there is no space
between &quot;-L&quot; and the directory name. The
&quot;-L&quot; option usually goes before any &quot;-l&quot;
options it&rsquo;s supposed to affect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do you know which libraries
you need? In general, this is a hard question, and varies
depending on what kind of Unix you are running. The
documentation for the functions or <br>
classes you are using should say what libraries you need to
link with. If you are using functions or classes from an
external package, there is usually a library you need to
<br>
link with; the library will usually be a file called
&quot;libabc.a&quot; or &quot;libabc.so&quot; or
&quot;libabc.sa&quot; if you need to add a &quot;-labc&quot;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some other confusing things <br>
You may have noticed that it is possible to specify options
which normally apply to compilation on the linking step, and
options which normally apply to linking on the <br>
compilation step. For example, the following commands are
valid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g -L/usr/X11R6/lib -c xyz.c
-o xyz.o <br>
cc -g -I/somewhere/include xyz.o -o xyz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The irrelevant options are
ignored; the above commands are exactly equivalent to
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -g -c xyz.c -o xyz.o <br>
cc -g xyz.o -o xyz</p>
