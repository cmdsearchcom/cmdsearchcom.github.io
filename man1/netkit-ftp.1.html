<p>FTP(1) BSD General Commands Manual FTP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ftp &acirc; Internet file transfer program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ftp [-46pinegvd] [host [port]] <br>
pftp [-46inegvd] [host [port]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ftp is the user interface to the Internet standard File
Transfer Protocol. The program allows a user to transfer
files to and from a remote network site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be specified at the
command line, or to the command interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Use only IPv4 to contact any
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Use IPv6 only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Use passive mode for data
transfers. Allows use of ftp in environments where a
firewall prevents connections from the outside world back to
the client machine. Requires that <br>
the ftp server support the PASV command. This is the default
if invoked as pftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Turns off interactive
prompting during multiple file transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Restrains ftp from attempting
&acirc;auto-login&acirc; upon initial connection. If
auto-login is enabled, ftp will check the .netrc (see
netrc(5)) file in the user&rsquo;s home directory for <br>
an entry describing an account on the remote machine. If no
entry exists, ftp will prompt for the remote machine login
name (default is the user identity on the local <br>
machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an
account with which to login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Disables command editing and
history support, if it was compiled into the ftp executable.
Otherwise, does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Disables file name
globbing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose option forces ftp to
show all responses from the remote server, as well as report
on data transfer statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Enables debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The client host and an optional
port number with which ftp is to communicate may be
specified on the command line. If this is done, ftp will
immediately attempt to establish a <br>
connection to an FTP server on that host; otherwise, ftp
will enter its command interpreter and await instructions
from the user. When ftp is awaiting commands from the user
the <br>
prompt &acirc;ftp&gt;&acirc; is provided to the user. The
following commands are recognized by ftp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! [command [args]] <br>
Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine. If there
are arguments, the first is taken to be a command to execute
directly, with the rest of the arguments as its <br>
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ macro-name [args] <br>
Execute the macro macro-name that was defined with the
macdef command. Arguments are passed to the macro
unglobbed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account [passwd] <br>
Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system
for access to resources once a login has been successfully
completed. If no argument is included, the user <br>
will be prompted for an account password in a non-echoing
input mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">append local-file [remote-file]
<br>
Append a local file to a file on the remote machine. If
remote-file is left unspecified, the local file name is used
in naming the remote file after being altered by <br>
any ntrans or nmap setting. File transfer uses the current
settings for type, format, mode, and structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ascii Set the file transfer type
to network ASCII. This is the default type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell Arrange that a bell be
sounded after each file transfer command is completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary Set the file transfer
type to support binary image transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bye Terminate the FTP session
with the remote server and exit ftp. An end of file will
also terminate the session and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case Toggle remote computer file
name case mapping during mget commands. When case is on
(default is off), remote computer file names with all
letters in upper case are <br>
written in the local directory with the letters mapped to
lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd remote-directory <br>
Change the working directory on the remote machine to
remote-directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cdup Change the remote machine
working directory to the parent of the current remote
machine working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chmod mode file-name <br>
Change the permission modes of the file file-name on the
remote system to mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Terminate the FTP session
with the remote server, and return to the command
interpreter. Any defined macros are erased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cr Toggle carriage return
stripping during ascii type file retrieval. Records are
denoted by a carriage return/linefeed sequence during ascii
type file transfer. When cr <br>
is on (the default), carriage returns are stripped from this
sequence to conform with the UNIX single linefeed record
delimiter. Records on non-UNIX remote systems may <br>
contain single linefeeds; when an ascii type transfer is
made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record
delimiter only when cr is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qc Toggle the printing of
control characters in the output of ASCII type commands.
When this is turned on, control characters are replaced with
a question mark if the <br>
output file is the standard output. This is the default when
the standard output is a tty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete remote-file <br>
Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug [debug-value] <br>
Toggle debugging mode. If an optional debug-value is
specified it is used to set the debugging level. When
debugging is on, ftp prints each command sent to the remote
<br>
machine, preceded by the string &acirc;--&gt;&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir [remote-directory]
[local-file] <br>
Print a listing of the directory contents in the directory,
remote-directory, and, optionally, placing the output in
local-file. If interactive prompting is on, ftp <br>
will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is
indeed the target local file for receiving dir output. If no
directory is specified, the current working <br>
directory on the remote machine is used. If no local file is
specified, or local-file is -, output comes to the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect A synonym for
close.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">form format <br>
Set the file transfer form to format. The default format is
&acirc;file&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get remote-file [local-file]
<br>
Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
If the local file name is not specified, it is given the
same name it has on the remote machine, subject to <br>
alteration by the current case, ntrans, and nmap settings.
The current settings for type, form, mode, and structure are
used while transferring the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glob Toggle filename expansion
for mdelete, mget and mput. If globbing is turned off with
glob, the file name arguments are taken literally and not
expanded. Globbing for <br>
mput is done as in csh(1). For mdelete and mget, each remote
file name is expanded separately on the remote machine and
the lists are not merged. Expansion of a <br>
directory name is likely to be different from expansion of
the name of an ordinary file: the exact result depends on
the foreign operating system and ftp server, and <br>
can be previewed by doing &acirc;mls remote-files -&acirc;
Note: mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire
directory subtrees of files. That can be done by
transferring a <br>
tar(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash [increment] <br>
Toggle hash-sign (&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;) printing
for each transferred data block, but only in the absence of
an argument. The size of a data block is set to 1024 bytes
by default, <br>
but can be changed by the argument increment, which also
accepts the suffixed multipliers &rsquo;k&rsquo; and
&rsquo;K&rsquo; for kilobytes, &rsquo;m&rsquo; and
&rsquo;M&rsquo; for Megabytes, and finally &rsquo;g&rsquo;
and &rsquo;G&rsquo; <br>
for Gigabytes. Setting a size activates hash printing
unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help [command] <br>
Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
If no argument is given, ftp prints a list of the known
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle [seconds] <br>
Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to seconds
seconds. If seconds is omitted, the current inactivity timer
is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipany Allow the address resolver
to return any address family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv4 Restrict the address
resolver to look only for IPv4 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipv6 Restrict host adressing to
IPv6 only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lcd [directory] <br>
Change the working directory on the local machine. If no
directory is specified, the user&rsquo;s home directory is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls [remote-directory]
[local-file] <br>
Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote
machine. The listing includes any system-dependent
information that the server chooses to include; for <br>
example, most UNIX systems will produce output from the
command &acirc;ls -l&acirc;. (See also nlist.) If
remote-directory is left unspecified, the current working
directory is <br>
used. If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the
user to verify that the last argument is indeed the target
local file for receiving ls output. If no local <br>
file is specified, or if local-file is &acirc;-&acirc;, the
output is sent to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macdef macro-name <br>
Define a macro. Subsequent lines are stored as the macro
macro-name; a null line (consecutive newline characters in a
file or carriage returns from the terminal) ter&acirc; <br>
minates macro input mode. There is a limit of 16 macros and
4096 total characters in all defined macros. Macros remain
defined until a close command is executed. The <br>
macro processor interprets &lsquo;$&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&acute; as special characters. A &lsquo;$&rsquo;
followed by a number (or numbers) is replaced by the
corresponding argument on the macro invocation <br>
command line. A &lsquo;$&rsquo; followed by an
&lsquo;i&rsquo; signals that macro processor that the
executing macro is to be looped. On the first pass
&lsquo;$i&rsquo; is replaced by the first argument <br>
on the macro invocation command line, on the second pass it
is replaced by the second argument, and so on. A
&lsquo;&acute; followed by any character is replaced by that
charac&acirc; <br>
ter. Use the &lsquo;&acute; to prevent special treatment of
the &lsquo;$&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdelete [remote-files] <br>
Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mdir remote-files local-file
<br>
Like dir, except multiple remote files may be specified. If
interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to
verify that the last argument is indeed the target <br>
local file for receiving mdir output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mget remote-files <br>
Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
for each file name thus produced. See glob for details on
the filename expansion. Resulting file names will <br>
then be processed according to case, ntrans, and nmap
settings. Files are transferred into the local working
directory, which can be changed with &acirc;lcd
directory&acirc;; new <br>
local directories can be created with &acirc;! mkdir
directory&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkdir directory-name <br>
Make a directory on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mls remote-files local-file <br>
Like nlist, except multiple remote files may be specified,
and the local-file must be specified. If interactive
prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify <br>
that the last argument is indeed the target local file for
receiving mls output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode [mode-name] <br>
Set the file transfer mode to mode-name. The default mode is
&acirc;stream&acirc; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modtime file-name <br>
Show the last modification time of the file on the remote
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mput local-files <br>
Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as
arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.
See glob for details of filename expansion. Result&acirc;
<br>
ing file names will then be processed according to ntrans
and nmap settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newer file-name [local-file]
<br>
Get the file only if the modification time of the remote
file is more recent that the file on the current system. If
the file does not exist on the current system, the <br>
remote file is considered newer. Otherwise, this command is
identical to get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nlist [remote-directory]
[local-file] <br>
Print a list of the files in a directory on the remote
machine. If remote-directory is left unspecified, the
current working directory is used. If interactive <br>
prompting is on, ftp will prompt the user to verify that the
last argument is indeed the target local file for receiving
nlist output. If no local file is specified, <br>
or if local-file is -, the output is sent to the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmap [inpattern outpattern] <br>
Set or unset the filename mapping mechanism. If no arguments
are specified, the filename mapping mechanism is unset. If
arguments are specified, remote filenames are <br>
mapped during mput commands and put commands issued without
a specified remote target filename. If arguments are
specified, local filenames are mapped during mget com&acirc;
<br>
mands and get commands issued without a specified local
target filename. This command is useful when connecting to a
non-UNIX remote computer with different file nam&acirc; <br>
ing conventions or practices. The mapping follows the
pattern set by inpattern and outpattern. [Inpattern] is a
template for incoming filenames (which may have <br>
already been processed according to the ntrans and case
settings). Variable templating is accomplished by including
the sequences &lsquo;$1&rsquo;, &lsquo;$2&rsquo;, ...,
&lsquo;$9&rsquo; in inpattern. <br>
Use &lsquo;&acute; to prevent this special treatment of the
&lsquo;$&rsquo; character. All other characters are treated
literally, and are used to determine the nmap [inpattern]
variable <br>
values. For example, given inpattern $1.$2 and the remote
file name &quot;mydata.data&quot;, $1 would have the value
&quot;mydata&quot;, and $2 would have the value
&quot;data&quot;. The <br>
outpattern determines the resulting mapped filename. The
sequences &lsquo;$1&rsquo;, &lsquo;$2&rsquo;, ....,
&lsquo;$9&rsquo; are replaced by any value resulting from
the inpattern template. The <br>
sequence &lsquo;$0&rsquo; is replace by the original
filename. Additionally, the sequence &acirc;[seq1,
seq2]&acirc; is replaced by [seq1] if seq1 is not a null
string; otherwise it is <br>
replaced by seq2. For example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nmap $1.$2.$3
[$1,$2].[$2,file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would yield the output filename
&quot;myfile.data&quot; for input filenames
&quot;myfile.data&quot; and &quot;myfile.data.old&quot;,
&quot;myfile.file&quot; for the input filename
&quot;myfile&quot;, and <br>
&quot;myfile.myfile&quot; for the input filename
&quot;.myfile&quot;. Spaces may be included in outpattern,
as in the example: &lsquo;nmap $1 sed &quot;s/ *$//&quot;
&gt; $1&rsquo; . Use the &lsquo;&acute; character to <br>
prevent special treatment of the
&lsquo;$&rsquo;,&rsquo;[&rsquo;,&rsquo;[&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;,&rsquo; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntrans [inchars [outchars]] <br>
Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.
If no arguments are specified, the filename character
translation mechanism is unset. If arguments are <br>
specified, characters in remote filenames are translated
during mput commands and put commands issued without a
specified remote target filename. If arguments are <br>
specified, characters in local filenames are translated
during mget commands and get commands issued without a
specified local target filename. This command is useful <br>
when connecting to a non-UNIX remote computer with different
file naming conventions or practices. Characters in a
filename matching a character in inchars are <br>
replaced with the corresponding character in outchars. If
the character&rsquo;s position in inchars is longer than the
length of outchars, the character is deleted from the <br>
file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open host [port] <br>
Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server. An
optional port number may be supplied, in which case, ftp
will attempt to contact an FTP server at that <br>
port. If the auto-login option is on (default), ftp will
also attempt to automatically log the user in to the FTP
server (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prompt Toggle interactive
prompting. Interactive prompting occurs during multiple file
transfers to allow the user to selectively retrieve or store
files. If prompting is <br>
turned off (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer
all files, and any mdelete will delete all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proxy ftp-command <br>
Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.
This command allows simultaneous connection to two remote
ftp servers for transferring files between the two <br>
servers. The first proxy command should be an open, to
establish the secondary control connection. Enter the
command &quot;proxy ?&quot; to see other ftp commands
executable on <br>
the secondary connection. The following commands behave
differently when prefaced by proxy: open will not define new
macros during the auto-login process, close will <br>
not erase existing macro definitions, get and mget transfer
files from the host on the primary control connection to the
host on the secondary control connection, and <br>
put, mput, and append transfer files from the host on the
secondary control connection to the host on the primary
control connection. Third party file transfers depend <br>
upon support of the ftp protocol PASV command by the server
on the secondary control connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">put local-file [remote-file]
<br>
Store a local file on the remote machine. If remote-file is
left unspecified, the local file name is used after
processing according to any ntrans or nmap settings in <br>
naming the remote file. File transfer uses the current
settings for type, format, mode, and structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pwd Print the name of the
current working directory on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit A synonym for bye.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quote arg1 arg2 ... <br>
The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote
FTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recv remote-file [local-file]
<br>
A synonym for get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reget remote-file [local-file]
<br>
Reget acts like get, except that if local-file exists and is
smaller than remote-file, local-file is presumed to be a
partially transferred copy of remote-file and the <br>
transfer is continued from the apparent point of failure. If
local-file does not exist ftp won&rsquo;t fetch the file.
This command is useful when transferring very large <br>
files over networks that are prone to dropping
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remotehelp [command-name] <br>
Request help from the remote FTP server. If a command-name
is specified it is supplied to the server as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remotestatus [file-name] <br>
With no arguments, show status of remote machine. If
file-name is specified, show status of file-name on remote
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename [from] [to] <br>
Rename the file from on the remote machine, to the file
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset Clear reply queue. This
command re-synchronizes command/reply sequencing with the
remote ftp server. Resynchronization may be necessary
following a violation of the <br>
ftp protocol by the remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart marker <br>
Restart the immediately following get or put at the
indicated marker. On UNIX systems, marker is usually a byte
offset into the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmdir directory-name <br>
Delete a directory on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runique Toggle storing of files
on the local system with unique filenames. If a file already
exists with a name equal to the target local filename for a
get or mget command, a <br>
&quot;.1&quot; is appended to the name. If the resulting
name matches another existing file, a &quot;.2&quot; is
appended to the original name. If this process continues up
to &quot;.99&quot;, an <br>
error message is printed, and the transfer does not take
place. The generated unique filename will be reported. Note
that runique will not affect local files gener&acirc; <br>
ated from a shell command (see below). The default value is
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send local-file [remote-file]
<br>
A synonym for put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sendport Toggle the use of PORT
commands. By default, ftp will attempt to use a PORT command
when establishing a connection for each data transfer. The
use of PORT commands <br>
can prevent delays when performing multiple file transfers.
If the PORT command fails, ftp will use the default data
port. When the use of PORT commands is disabled, <br>
no attempt will be made to use PORT commands for each data
transfer. This is useful for certain FTP implementations
which do ignore PORT commands but, incorrectly, <br>
indicate they&rsquo;ve been accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site arg1 arg2 ... <br>
The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote
FTP server as a SITE command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size file-name <br>
Return size of file-name on remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Show the current status
of ftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct [struct-name] <br>
Set the file transfer structure to struct-name. By default
&acirc;stream&acirc; structure is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sunique Toggle storing of files
on remote machine under unique file names. Remote ftp server
must support ftp protocol STOU command for successful
completion. The remote <br>
server will report unique name. Default value is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system Show the type of
operating system running on the remote machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tenex Set the file transfer type
to that needed to talk to TENEX machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trace Toggle packet tracing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type [type-name] <br>
Set the file transfer type to type-name. If no type is
specified, the current type is printed. The default type is
network ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">umask [newmask] <br>
Set the default umask on the remote server to newmask. If
newmask is omitted, the current umask is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user user-name [password]
[account] <br>
Identify yourself to the remote FTP server. If the password
is not specified and the server requires it, ftp will prompt
the user for it (after disabling local echo). <br>
If an account field is not specified, and the FTP server
requires it, the user will be prompted for it. If an account
field is specified, an account command will be <br>
relayed to the remote server after the login sequence is
completed if the remote server did not require it for
logging in. Unless ftp is invoked with
&acirc;auto-login&acirc; dis&acirc; <br>
abled, this process is done automatically on initial
connection to the FTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose Toggle verbose mode. In
verbose mode, all responses from the FTP server are
displayed to the user. In addition, if verbose is on, when a
file transfer completes, sta&acirc; <br>
tistics regarding the efficiency of the transfer are
reported. By default, verbose is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? [command] <br>
A synonym for help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command arguments which have
embedded spaces may be quoted with quote
&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo; marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER <br>
To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key
(usually Ctrl-C). Sending transfers will be immediately
halted. Receiving transfers will be halted by sending a ftp
pro&acirc; <br>
tocol ABOR command to the remote server, and discarding any
further data received. The speed at which this is
accomplished depends upon the remote server&rsquo;s support
for ABOR pro&acirc; <br>
cessing. If the remote server does not support the ABOR
command, an &acirc;ftp&gt;&acirc; prompt will not appear
until the remote server has completed sending the requested
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The terminal interrupt key
sequence will be ignored when ftp has completed any local
processing and is awaiting a reply from the remote server. A
long delay in this mode may <br>
result from the ABOR processing described above, or from
unexpected behavior by the remote server, including
violations of the ftp protocol. If the delay results from
unexpected <br>
remote server behavior, the local ftp program must be killed
by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS <br>
Files specified as arguments to ftp commands are processed
according to the following rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the file name
&acirc;-&acirc; is specified, the stdin (for reading) or
stdout (for writing) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the first character of the
file name is &acirc;|&acirc;, the remainder of the argument
is interpreted as a shell command. Ftp then forks a shell,
using popen(3) with the argument sup&acirc; <br>
plied, and reads (writes) from the stdout (stdin). If the
shell command includes spaces, the argument must be quoted;
e.g. &acirc;&quot; ls -lt&quot;&acirc;. A particularly
useful example of <br>
this mechanism is: &acirc;dir more&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Failing the above checks, if
&lsquo;&lsquo;globbing&rsquo;&rsquo; is enabled, local file
names are expanded according to the rules used in the
csh(1); c.f. the glob command. If the ftp command <br>
expects a single local file (.e.g. put), only the first
filename generated by the &quot;globbing&quot; operation is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. For mget commands and get
commands with unspecified local file names, the local
filename is the remote filename, which may be altered by a
case, ntrans, or nmap setting. The <br>
resulting filename may then be altered if runique is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. For mput commands and put
commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote
filename is the local filename, which may be altered by a
ntrans or nmap setting. The <br>
resulting filename may then be altered by the remote server
if sunique is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS <br>
The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may
affect a file transfer. The type may be one of
&acirc;ascii&acirc;, &acirc;image&acirc; (binary),
&acirc;ebcdic&acirc;, and &acirc;local byte size&acirc; (for
PDP-10&rsquo;s <br>
and PDP-20&rsquo;s mostly). Ftp supports the ascii and image
types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for tenex
mode transfers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ftp supports only the default
values for the remaining file transfer parameters: mode,
form, and struct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Ftp utilizes the following environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME For default location of a
.netrc file, if one exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL For default shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
ftpd(8), netrc(5), RFC 959</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The ftp command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper
behavior by the remote server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An error in the treatment of
carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has
been corrected. This correction may result in incorrect
transfers of binary files to and <br>
from 4.2BSD servers using the ascii type. Avoid this problem
by using the binary image type.</p>
