<p>faxspool(1) mgetty+sendfax manual faxspool(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faxspool - queue and convert files for faxing with
sendfax(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
faxspool [options] phone-number files...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Queue the named files for later transmission with
sendfax(8). The input files are converted to G3 fax files,
spooled to /var/spool/fax/outgoing/&lt;dir&gt;/f*.g3, and
queued for <br>
transmsssion to the fax address
&quot;phone-number&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On top of each page, faxspool
puts a header line, telling the other side the number of
pages, your fax id, ..., whatever you like. The format of
this line is configurable via the <br>
file /etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxheader and per-user via the file
$HOME/.faxheader. (you can select another one with the
&quot;-h&quot; option, for example, one for your business
faxes and one <br>
for the private stuff).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file should contain a few
lines of text, normally only one line, but more than one
line is permitted. The text may use the tokens @T@ for the
remote telephone number, @U@ <br>
for the sending user name, @N@ for his full name (fifth
field of /etc/passwd, if not given with &quot;-F&quot;), @P@
for the page number and @M@ for the total number of pages.
@D@ will be <br>
replaced by the string specified with the &quot;-D&quot;
option (see below), @DATE@ will be substituted by the output
of the &lsquo;date&lsquo; command, and @ID@ stands for the
sender&rsquo;s fax number <br>
(FAX_STATION_ID). Finally, @S@ will be substituted by the
JOB ID (Fxxxxxx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;phone-number&quot;
contains non-numeric characters, faxspool interprets it as
an alias and tries to look it up in the files
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxaliases and $HOME/.faxnrs. <br>
These files have a very simple format: one line per alias,
alias name first, whitespace (tab or blank), phone number.
Optionally, you can place a short description of the <br>
receiver after the phone number, this will be used as if it
had been specified with &quot;-D&quot; (an explicit
&quot;-D&quot; flag overrides this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: gert 0893244814 Gert
Doering</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access control is handled
similar to the way &quot;crontab&quot; does it: if a file
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/fax.allow exists, only those users
listed in that file (one name per line) may use <br>
the fax service. If it does not exist, but a file
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/fax.deny exists, all users but those
listed in that file may use faxspool(1), and if neither file
exists, <br>
only root may send faxes. (Note: if the user name in the
fax.allow file is followed by a blank, the rest of that line
is ignored. Some other fax spooling software uses this to
<br>
store additional information about the user sending the
request).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, faxspool can
generate user-customizable fax cover pages. It is quite easy
to set up: if a file /usr/lib64/mgetty+sendfax/make.coverpg
exists and is executable, it is <br>
run with all relevant source/destination data on the command
line, and its output is sent as the first page of the
resulting fax. If $HOME/.make.coverpg exists, this file is
used <br>
instead. See coverpg(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n Tells faxspool to use normal resolution (as opposed to
the default, fine resolution) both when converting files to
G3 format and when transmitting (no effect on pbm files)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h &lt;text file&gt; <br>
Use &lt;text file&gt; for the FAX header line(s). The
default format file for faxspool is
/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxheader. &rsquo;-&rsquo; means
&rsquo;no header line&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q do not output progress
messages (file ... is format ..., spooling to ...). Error
messages will be seen anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;mail address&gt; <br>
Use the address given for the status mail that faxrunq(1)
sends after completing / dequeueing the request. If no mail
address is specified, the requesting user (on the <br>
local machine) gets the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;user name&gt; <br>
Do not use the current user ID for authentication purposes
but the user name specified. Since this can lead to easy
breach of security, only &quot;trusted&quot; users may use
this <br>
flag. Currently, those users are &quot;root&quot;,
&quot;lp&quot; and &quot;daemon&quot; (hardwired into the
code). Note: the status mail will still go to the user
running faxspool(1) unless changed <br>
with &quot;-f&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D &lt;destination&gt; <br>
Verbose form of the fax&rsquo;s destination. Used only for
informational purposes, that is, faxq(1) will show it,
faxrunq(1) will put it into the return mail (&quot;Subject:
your fax <br>
to ...&quot;), and a @D@ in the page header will be replaced
by it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;description&gt; <br>
Full name or similar description of the sending user (if not
specified, the full name field from /etc/passwd will be
used). Used only for informational purposes, that is, <br>
faxspool(1) will substitute a @N@ in the page header file
with it, and it will be passed to the cover page program (if
used) as &lt;sender-NAME&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;priority&gt; <br>
Sets the priority of the fax in the queue. 9 is highest
(meaning: faxes get sent out first), 1 is lowest. If nothing
is specified, a default value of 5 is used. Right now, <br>
only faxrunqd understands priority, faxrunq will silently
ignore it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;cover page program&gt;
<br>
Specify that the named program is to be used to generate a
cover page for the fax that is being queued. How the program
is called is described in the coverpg(1) manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special program name
&quot;-&quot; is used to specify &quot;no coverpage at
all&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No message is issued if the
program isn&rsquo;t found, or cannot be executed, faxspool
will simply queue the fax without cover page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default cover page program
used is $HOME/.make.coverpg; if this file doesn&rsquo;t
exist /usr/lib64/mgetty+sendfax/make.coverpg is used.
(However, if $HOME/.make.coverpg <br>
exists, but is not executable, no coverpage is used at
all.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Spool a request that will try
polling (see &quot;sendfax -p&quot;). The implementation
isn&rsquo;t too smart yet, the polled files will simply go
into the job&rsquo;s spool directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;hh:mm&gt; <br>
Don&rsquo;t send the fax before the time given. It may not
be sent exactly at &lt;hh:mm&gt;, but the first time faxrunq
runs after that time. If the fax cannot be sent successfully
<br>
before midnight, it won&rsquo;t be sent on the next day
until &lt;hh:mm&gt;!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;hh:mm&gt;-&lt;hh:mm&gt;
<br>
Only send the fax in the time range between those two times.
This is only implemented in faxrunqd. If the second time
specified is &rsquo;earlier&rsquo; than the first time, it
is <br>
interpreted as a time range crossing midnight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A &lt;data&gt; <br>
pass faxspool a chunk of data that is ignored (so you can
put anything you want here), but written to all the log
files (acct.log, sendfax.log). This can be used to tag <br>
faxes as private/corporate, to tag faxes with the customer
ID to use for billing, or something along that lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;phone1&gt; &lt;phone2&gt;
&lt;phone3&gt; ... -- <br>
Multicasting - send the specified files to all phone numbers
in the list given after &quot;-m&quot;. The list is
terminated with &quot;--&quot;. &quot;-m&quot; has to be the
last option on the command <br>
line (not implemented yet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M &lt;file name&gt; <br>
Multicasting - read a list of telephone numbers to send the
fax to from the given file. Do not use in conjunction with
&quot;-m&quot; (not implemented yet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Copy source files to a sub
directory &quot;.source-files/&quot; in the fax queue
directory (most likely, you won&rsquo;t ever need this - I
needed it for one project, so it&rsquo;s here and <br>
documented. Don&rsquo;t ask what it&rsquo;s good for).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/var/spool/fax/outgoing/* <br>
fax spool directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxaliases
<br>
global fax alias file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.faxnrs <br>
private fax alias file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/mgetty+sendfax/fax.allow
<br>
list of allowed users</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/mgetty+sendfax/fax.deny
<br>
list of denied users</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxheader
<br>
default fax page header</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib64/mgetty+sendfax/make.coverpg
<br>
program to create fax cover page (see coverpg(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxspool.rules
<br>
program to control which file extentions are recognized
(.txt, .ps, ...) and how those file formats should be
converted to G3.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib64/mgetty+sendfax/faxq-helper
<br>
this a small C helper program that facilitates access to the
fax spool queue (which is since mgetty 1.1.29 no longer
world-writeable)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
faxspool is not too smart about recognizing file types</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of faxspool -n with bitmap
files may give wrong results, depending on the aspect ratio
of the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multicasting with the -m and -M
options is not implemented yet.</p>
