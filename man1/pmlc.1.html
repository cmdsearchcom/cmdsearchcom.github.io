<b>pmlc</b> - configure active Performance Co-Pilot pmlogger(s) interactively
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>pmlc</b> [ <b>-e</b>] [ <b>-h</b> <i>host</i>] [ <b>-i</b>] [ <b>-n</b>
  <i>pmnsfile</i>] [ <b>-P</b>] [ <b>-p</b> <i>port</i>] [ <b>-Z</b>
  <i>timezone</i>] [ <b>-z</b>] [ <b>pid</b>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>pmlc</b> may be used to change those metrics and instances which a
  <b>pmlogger</b>(1) writes to a Performance Co-Pilot archive (see
  <b>PCPIntro</b>(1)), the frequency with which the metrics are collected and
  whether the logging is mandatory, advisory, on or off. It also reports the
  current logging status of metrics and instances. <b>pmlc</b> may be used to
  control pmlogger instances on remote hosts as well as those on the local host.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally <b>pmlc</b> operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space
  (PMNS), however if the <b>-n</b> option is specified an alternative local PMNS
  is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-P</b> option is specified, <b>pmlc</b> will attempt to start with a
  connection to the primary pmlogger on the local host. If the <b>-p</b> option
  is specified, then <b>pmlc</b> will attempt to start with a connection to the
  pmlogger on this TCP/IP <i>port</i>. Alternatively, if <i>pid</i> is
  specified, a connection to the pmlogger instance with that process id will be
  attempted on startup. The <b>-h</b> option may only be used if <b>-P,</b>
  <b>-p</b> <i>port</i> or a <i>pid</i> is also specified. In that case
  <b>pmlc</b> will initially connect to the specified (remote) pmlogger instance
  on <i>host</i> rather than the local host. If the connection to the specified
  pmlogger instance cannot be established, <b>pmlc</b> will start with no
  connection. These options typically allow the same file of <b>pmlc</b>
  commands to be directed to multiple pmlogger instances by varying the command
  line arguments. Note that <b>-P</b>, <b>-p</b> <i>port</i>, <i>pid</i> and
  <b>-h</b> are used only when making an initial connection to a pmlogger
  instance. They are not used as defaults if subsequent connections are made
  interactively (see the <b>connect</b> command below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>pmlc</b> reports the time of day according to the local timezone
  on the system where <b>pmlc</b> is run. The <b>-Z</b> option changes the
  timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format of the environment variable
  <b>TZ</b> as described in <b>environ</b>(7). The <b>-z</b> option changes the
  timezone to the timezone of the pmlogger instance from which information is
  being obtained. Only one of <b>-z</b> or <b>-Z</b> may be specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If standard input is from a tty, <b>pmlc</b> is interactive, with prompts. The
  <b>-i</b> flag may be used to force interactive behavior, and is typically
  used in conjunction with <b>-e</b> to echo all command input on standard
  output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following commands may be used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>show</b> [ <b>loggers</b> ] [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Displays the process identities of all pmlogger instances
      running on the local host (or <i>host</i>, if specified). The primary
      pmlogger pid is parenthesized because it can be referred to as
      &quot;primary&quot; as well as by its pid.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>connect</b> <i>pid</i> [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     <b>connect</b> <b>primary</b> [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
    <br/>
    Connects <b>pmlc</b> to the specified pmlogger process. Any existing
      connection to a pmlogger instance is closed first. Each pmlogger instance
      will accept at most one connection at a time, so if the connection is
      successfully established, your <b>pmlc</b> will be the only one
      controlling the pmlogger instance it is connected to.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>new volume</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
      instance is established. It tells the pmlogger to close the current volume
      of the log and open a new volume. Closed volumes may be archived, e.g. as
      part of a regular log management procedure to control the size of the
      physical log files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>status</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
      instance is established. It prints information about the state of the
      pmlogger instance and its associated log.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>timezone</b> <b>local</b> | <b>logger</b> |
    <b>&quot;</b> <i>timezone</i><b>&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command sets the time zone used when times are
      printed. <b>local</b> means use the time zone of the machine that
      <b>pmlc</b> is running on. <b>logger</b> means use the time zone of the
      machine where the pmlogger instance is running. Alternatively an explicit
      <i>timezone</i> enclosed in quotes may be supplied (refer to <b>TZ</b> in
      <b>environ</b>(7) for details). The default time zone is <b>local</b>
      unless one of the <b>-z</b> or <b>-Z</b> options has been supplied on the
      command line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>flush</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
      instance is established, and requests the pmlogger instance to flush to
      disk all buffers associated with the current archive. For old-timers,
      <b>sync</b> is a synonym for <b>flush</b>. In current versions of
      <b>pmlogger</b>(1) all writes are unbuffered and aligned with the logical
      records in the external files, so this command achieves nothing, but is
      retained for backwards compatibility.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Displays a summary of the available commands.
    <div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>quit</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Exits from <b>pmlc</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The remaining commands query and change the logging state of metrics and
  instances. They will work only if <b>pmlc</b> has a connection to a pmlogger
  instance. Metrics may be specified as fully qualified names (e.g. hinv.ncpu)
  or subtrees of the PMNS (e.g. hinv) which are expanded to include all metrics
  in the subtree (e.g. hinv.ncpu, hinv.cpuclock, etc.). Lists of metrics may be
  specified by enclosing them in braces with spaces or a comma between metrics
  (e.g. {hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk}). Subtrees of metrics may be included in such
  lists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each individual metric specification may be further qualified with a space or
  comma separated list of instances in square brackets (e.g.
  kernel.all.load[&quot;1 minute&quot;, &quot;5 minute&quot;]). External
  instance names or numeric internal instance identifiers or both may be used in
  the same list (e.g. sample.colour.[red,1,&quot;blue&quot;]). If an instance
  qualification is applied to a subtree of the PMNS all of the metrics in the
  subtree must have the same instance domain. Instance qualifications may not be
  applied to entire lists of metrics but may appear inside such lists.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no instances are specified for a metric, all instances are used. All
  instances means all instances available at the time the pmlogger instance in
  question fetches the metrics for logging. If an instance domain changes over
  time this is not always the same as the set of instances displayed by
  <b>pmlc</b>, which can only display the currently available instances. To
  prevent unintentional errors, only the instances that are currently available
  to <b>pmlc</b> may appear in instance specifications.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>query</b><i> metriclist</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The current logging state of each metric (and instances,
      where applicable) in <i>metriclist</i> is displayed. This includes the
      logging state (e.g. on, maybe, off) and the logging interval for each

      metrics (and instances) may appear in the output: <b>adv</b>, advisory;
      <b>mand</b>, mandatory; <b>nl</b>, not in the log; <b>na</b>, in the log
      but not currently available from its Performance Metrics Domain Agent
      (PMDA). Where appropriate, an instance name will appear last on a line

  <dd class="It-tag">This form of the <b>log</b> command turns on logging for
      the metrics (and any instances) in <i>metriclist.</i> <i>interval</i>
      specifies how often the specified metrics/instances should be logged.
      <b>once</b> indicates that the metrics/instances should appear at most
      once in the log. More often one would use the optional keyword
      <b>every</b> followed by a positive number and one of <b>millisecond</b>
      (or <b>msec</b>), <b>second</b> (or <b>sec</b>), <b>minute</b> (or
      <b>min</b>), <b>hour</b> or their plurals.

    Advisory logging is only applicable if the last logging state specified for
      a metric/instance was &quot;mandatory maybe&quot; (which permits
      subsequent advisory logging control) or if the logging state is already
      advisory. These two statements turn advisory logging on or off
      (respectively) for the specified metrics/instances.

There is no continuation character required for commands that span lines.

The word <b>at</b> may be used interchangeably with <b>@</b>.

A request to log all instances of a metric will supersede any prior request to
  log either all or specific instances of a metric (if the request specifies a
  permissible transition in the logging state). A request to log specific
  instances of a metric when all instances of a metric are already being logged
  is refused by <b>pmlogger</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ACCESS_CONTROL"><a class="selflink" href="#ACCESS_CONTROL">ACCESS
  CONTROL</a></h1>
<b>pmlc</b> may have restricted access to and control over <b>pmlogger</b>(1)
  processes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a <b>pmlogger</b>(1) is unable to export its control information to the local
  <b>pmcd</b>(1), then that <b>pmlogger</b>(1) cannot cannot be connected to nor
  controlled by <b>pmlc</b>. In practice, this means the <b>pmlogger</b>(1)
  process has to be owned by the user ``pcp'' and/or the group ``pcp''. If
  <b>pmlogger</b>(1) is running on the host ``foo'' then use ``pminfo -f -h foo
  pmcd.pmlogger'' to verify that the <b>pmlogger</b>(1) of interest is known to
  <b>pmcd</b>(1), alternatively <b>pmlogger</b>(1) instances that are not
  reported from the <b>pmlc</b> <b>show loggers @foo</b> command are not known
  to <b>pmcd</b>(1) on the host ``foo''.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>pmlogger</b>(1) is launched with a configuration file that contains an
  <b>[access]</b> section, then <b>pmlc</b> will be unable to connect to that
  <b>pmlogger</b>(1) unless the access controls allow <b>some</b> access from
  the host where <b>pmlc</b> is being run. Minimally this requires the
  <b>enquire</b> access to be permitted in the <b>pmlogger</b>(1) access control
  section.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>pmlc</b> is able to connect to the <b>pmlogger</b>(1) of interest, then
  the following table summarizes the permissions needed to perform different
  <b>pmlc</b> commands:

Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the
  file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
  <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these variables. The

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
Most error or warning messages are self-explanatory. A message of the form
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
Warning: unable to change logging state for...
<br/>
followed by a list of metrics (and possibly instances) indicates that
  <b>pmlogger</b> refused the request for the metrics (and instances) that
  appear. Any metrics (and instances) that were specified but do not appear in
  the message have had their logging state updated successfully (no news is good
  news). Usually this warning results from requesting advisory logging when a
  mandatory control is already in place, or requesting logging for specific
  instances when all instances are already being logged.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEAT"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEAT">CAVEAT</a></h1>
If all instances of a metric are being logged and a request is made to log
  specific instances of the metric with the same state and frequency, the
  request may appear to succeed, even though <b>pmlogger</b> has refused the
  request. This is not normally a problem, as the required information will
  still be placed into the log by <b>pmlogger</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However in the case where the metric is to be logged once, the outcome is not
  what might be expected. When <b>pmlogger</b> receives a request to log a
  metric once, it places the current value(s) of the metric into the log as soon
  as it can, regardless of whether the metric is already in the log. This may be
  used to force values into the log. When a request to log specific instances of
  a metric arrives and is refused because all instances of the metric are
  already being logged, <b>pmlogger</b> does not place values for the instances
  requested into the log. It returns the current logging state for each instance
  requested to <b>pmlc</b>. The requested and returned states are identical, so
  <b>pmlc</b> doesn't raise an error as it should.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To ensure that only certain instances of a metric are being logged, one should
  always turn off logging for all instances of the metric prior to turning on
  logging for the specific instances required.</div>
