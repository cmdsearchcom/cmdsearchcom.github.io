<p>PMLC(1) General Commands Manual PMLC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlc - configure active Performance Co-Pilot pmlogger(s)
interactively</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmlc [-e] [-h host] [-i] [-n pmnsfile] [-P] [-p port] [-Z
timezone] [-z] [pid]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmlc may be used to change those metrics and instances which
a pmlogger(1) writes to a Performance Co-Pilot archive (see
PCPIntro(1)), the frequency with which the metrics are <br>
collected and whether the logging is mandatory, advisory, on
or off. It also reports the current logging status of
metrics and instances. pmlc may be used to control pmlogger
<br>
instances on remote hosts as well as those on the local
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmlc operates on the
distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however
if the -n option is specified an alternative local PMNS is
loaded from the file pmnsfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -P option is specified,
pmlc will attempt to start with a connection to the primary
pmlogger on the local host. If the -p option is specified,
then pmlc will attempt to <br>
start with a connection to the pmlogger on this TCP/IP port.
Alternatively, if pid is specified, a connection to the
pmlogger instance with that process id will be attempted on
<br>
startup. The -h option may only be used if -P, -p port or a
pid is also specified. In that case pmlc will initially
connect to the specified (remote) pmlogger instance on host
<br>
rather than the local host. If the connection to the
specified pmlogger instance cannot be established, pmlc will
start with no connection. These options typically allow the
<br>
same file of pmlc commands to be directed to multiple
pmlogger instances by varying the command line arguments.
Note that -P, -p port, pid and -h are used only when making
an <br>
initial connection to a pmlogger instance. They are not used
as defaults if subsequent connections are made interactively
(see the connect command below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pmlc reports the
time of day according to the local timezone on the system
where pmlc is run. The -Z option changes the timezone to
timezone in the format of the <br>
environment variable TZ as described in environ(7). The -z
option changes the timezone to the timezone of the pmlogger
instance from which information is being obtained. Only <br>
one of -z or -Z may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If standard input is from a tty,
pmlc is interactive, with prompts. The -i flag may be used
to force interactive behavior, and is typically used in
conjunction with -e to echo <br>
all command input on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands may be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show [ loggers ] [ @host ] <br>
Displays the process identities of all pmlogger instances
running on the local host (or host, if specified). The
primary pmlogger pid is parenthesized because it can be <br>
referred to as &quot;primary&quot; as well as by its
pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect pid [ @host ] <br>
connect primary [ @host ] <br>
Connects pmlc to the specified pmlogger process. Any
existing connection to a pmlogger instance is closed first.
Each pmlogger instance will accept at most one connection
<br>
at a time, so if the connection is successfully established,
your pmlc will be the only one controlling the pmlogger
instance it is connected to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new volume <br>
This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
instance is established. It tells the pmlogger to close the
current volume of the log and open a new volume. Closed <br>
volumes may be archived, e.g. as part of a regular log
management procedure to control the size of the physical log
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status <br>
This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
instance is established. It prints information about the
state of the pmlogger instance and its associated log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timezone local | logger |
&quot;timezone&quot; <br>
This command sets the time zone used when times are printed.
local means use the time zone of the machine that pmlc is
running on. logger means use the time zone of the <br>
machine where the pmlogger instance is running.
Alternatively an explicit timezone enclosed in quotes may be
supplied (refer to TZ in environ(7) for details). The
default <br>
time zone is local unless one of the -z or -Z options has
been supplied on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flush <br>
This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
instance is established, and requests the pmlogger instance
to flush to disk all buffers associated with the current
<br>
archive. For old-timers, sync is a synonym for flush. In
current versions of pmlogger(1) all writes are unbuffered
and aligned with the logical records in the external <br>
files, so this command achieves nothing, but is retained for
backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Displays a summary of the available commands. <br>
h and ? are synonyms for help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit <br>
Exits from pmlc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining commands query and
change the logging state of metrics and instances. They will
work only if pmlc has a connection to a pmlogger instance.
Metrics may be speci&acirc; <br>
fied as fully qualified names (e.g. hinv.ncpu) or subtrees
of the PMNS (e.g. hinv) which are expanded to include all
metrics in the subtree (e.g. hinv.ncpu, hinv.cpuclock,
etc.). <br>
Lists of metrics may be specified by enclosing them in
braces with spaces or a comma between metrics (e.g.
{hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk}). Subtrees of metrics may be included
in such <br>
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each individual metric
specification may be further qualified with a space or comma
separated list of instances in square brackets (e.g.
kernel.all.load[&quot;1 minute&quot;, &quot;5
minute&quot;]). <br>
External instance names or numeric internal instance
identifiers or both may be used in the same list (e.g.
sample.colour.[red,1,&quot;blue&quot;]). If an instance
qualification is <br>
applied to a subtree of the PMNS all of the metrics in the
subtree must have the same instance domain. Instance
qualifications may not be applied to entire lists of metrics
but <br>
may appear inside such lists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no instances are specified
for a metric, all instances are used. All instances means
all instances available at the time the pmlogger instance in
question fetches the metrics <br>
for logging. If an instance domain changes over time this is
not always the same as the set of instances displayed by
pmlc, which can only display the currently available <br>
instances. To prevent unintentional errors, only the
instances that are currently available to pmlc may appear in
instance specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">query metriclist <br>
The current logging state of each metric (and instances,
where applicable) in metriclist is displayed. This includes
the logging state (e.g. on, maybe, off) and the logging <br>
interval for each metric (and instance) requested. The
following abbreviations pertaining to metrics (and
instances) may appear in the output: adv, advisory; mand,
manda&acirc; <br>
tory; nl, not in the log; na, in the log but not currently
available from its Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).
Where appropriate, an instance name will appear last <br>
on a line preceded by its numeric internal instance
identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ log ] mandatory on interval
metriclist <br>
This form of the log command turns on logging for the
metrics (and any instances) in metriclist. interval
specifies how often the specified metrics/instances should
be <br>
logged. once indicates that the metrics/instances should
appear at most once in the log. More often one would use the
optional keyword every followed by a positive number <br>
and one of millisecond (or msec), second (or sec), minute
(or min), hour or their plurals. <br>
Note that the keyword default which may be used for the
default interval in a pmlogger(1) configuration file cannot
be used in pmlc. <br>
Internal limitations require the interval to be less than
(approximately) 74 hours. An interval value of zero is a
synonym for once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ log ] mandatory off metriclist
<br>
This tells the pmlogger instance not to log any of the
metrics/instances in metriclist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ log ] mandatory maybe
metriclist <br>
This tells the pmlogger instance to honor any subsequent
advisory logging requests for the metrics/instances in
metriclist. If the current logging state of the met&acirc;
<br>
rics/instances is mandatory (either on or off) the new state
will be set to maybe (effectively advisory off). If the
current state of the metrics/instances is already
advi&acirc; <br>
sory (either on or off) the state(s) for the
metrics/instances will remain as they are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ log ] advisory on interval
metriclist <br>
[ log ] advisory off metriclist <br>
Advisory logging is only applicable if the last logging
state specified for a metric/instance was &quot;mandatory
maybe&quot; (which permits subsequent advisory logging
control) or if <br>
the logging state is already advisory. These two statements
turn advisory logging on or off (respectively) for the
specified metrics/instances. <br>
The interpretation for interval is as above for the
mandatory case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no continuation
character required for commands that span lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The word at may be used
interchangeably with @.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A request to log all instances
of a metric will supersede any prior request to log either
all or specific instances of a metric (if the request
specifies a permissible transition <br>
in the logging state). A request to log specific instances
of a metric when all instances of a metric are already being
logged is refused by pmlogger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS CONTROL <br>
pmlc may have restricted access to and control over
pmlogger(1) processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a pmlogger(1) is unable to
export its control information to the local pmcd(1), then
that pmlogger(1) cannot cannot be connected to nor
controlled by pmlc. In practice, this <br>
means the pmlogger(1) process has to be owned by the user
&lsquo;&lsquo;pcp&rsquo;&rsquo; and/or the group
&lsquo;&lsquo;pcp&rsquo;&rsquo;. If pmlogger(1) is running
on the host &lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo; then use
&lsquo;&lsquo;pminfo -f -h foo pmcd.pmlog&acirc; <br>
ger&rsquo;&rsquo; to verify that the pmlogger(1) of interest
is known to pmcd(1), alternatively pmlogger(1) instances
that are not reported from the pmlc show loggers @foo
command are not <br>
known to pmcd(1) on the host
&lsquo;&lsquo;foo&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pmlogger(1) is launched with
a configuration file that contains an [access] section, then
pmlc will be unable to connect to that pmlogger(1) unless
the access controls allow <br>
some access from the host where pmlc is being run. Minimally
this requires the enquire access to be permitted in the
pmlogger(1) access control section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If pmlc is able to connect to
the pmlogger(1) of interest, then the following table
summarizes the permissions needed to perform different pmlc
commands:</p>

PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

pcp.conf(5), pcp.env(5) and environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Most error or warning messages are self-explanatory. A
message of the form <br>
Warning: unable to change logging state for... <br>
followed by a list of metrics (and possibly instances)
indicates that pmlogger refused the request for the metrics
(and instances) that appear. Any metrics (and instances)
that <br>
were specified but do not appear in the message have had
their logging state updated successfully (no news is good
news). Usually this warning results from requesting advisory
<br>
logging when a mandatory control is already in place, or
requesting logging for specific instances when all instances
are already being logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEAT <br>
If all instances of a metric are being logged and a request
is made to log specific instances of the metric with the
same state and frequency, the request may appear to succeed,
<br>
even though pmlogger has refused the request. This is not
normally a problem, as the required information will still
be placed into the log by pmlogger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However in the case where the
metric is to be logged once, the outcome is not what might
be expected. When pmlogger receives a request to log a
metric once, it places the cur&acirc; <br>
rent value(s) of the metric into the log as soon as it can,
regardless of whether the metric is already in the log. This
may be used to force values into the log. When a <br>
request to log specific instances of a metric arrives and is
refused because all instances of the metric are already
being logged, pmlogger does not place values for the <br>
instances requested into the log. It returns the current
logging state for each instance requested to pmlc. The
requested and returned states are identical, so pmlc
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
raise an error as it should.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ensure that only certain
instances of a metric are being logged, one should always
turn off logging for all instances of the metric prior to
turning on logging for the spe&acirc; <br>
cific instances required.</p>
