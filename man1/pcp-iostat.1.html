<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pcp-iostat reports I/O statistics for scsi devices (by
default) or device-mapper devices (if the -x dm option is
specified). By default pcp-iostat reports live data for the
<br>
local host but can also report for a remote host (-h) or
from a previously captured PCP archive (-a).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S, -T, -O and -A options
may be used to define a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved, set an initial origin within the time window, or
specify a &lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; align&acirc;
<br>
ment of the sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other options which control
the source, timing and layout of the information reported by
pcp-iostat are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Performance metric values are
retrieved from the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log
files identified by the argument archive, which is a
comma-separated list of names, <br>
each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name
of a directory containing one or more archives. See also
-u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Specifies that statistics for
device names matching the regular expression specified with
the -R regex option should be aggregated according to
method. Note this is aggre&acirc; <br>
gation based on matching device names (not temporal
aggregation). When -G is used, the device name column is
reported as method(regex), e.g. if -G sum -R
&rsquo;sd(a|b)$&rsquo; is <br>
specified, the device column will be sum(sd(a|b)$) and
summed statistics for sda and sdb will be reported in the
remaining columns. If -G is specified but -R is not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, then the default regex is .*, i.e. matching all device
names. If method is sum then the statistics are summed. This
includes the %util column, which may therefore <br>
exceed 100% if more than one device name matches. If method
is avg then the statistics are summed and then averaged by
dividing by the number of matching device names. If <br>
method is min or max, the minimum or maximum statistics for
matching devices are reported, respectfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Current performance metric
values are retrieved from the nominated host machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The argument samples defines
the number of samples to be retrieved and reported. If
samples is 0 or -s is not specified, pcp-iostat will sample
and report continuously (in <br>
real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives
(in archive mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The default update interval
may be set to something other than the default 1 second. The
interval argument follows the syntax described in
PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest <br>
form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this
case are seconds). The -t option is particularly useful when
replaying large sets of archives (-a option) that <br>
span several hours or even days. In this case specifying a
large interval (e.g. 1h for 1 hour) will reduce the volume
of data reported and the i/o statistics will be aver&acirc;
<br>
aged (interpolated) over the reporting interval (unless the
-u option is specified, see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R This restricts the report to
device names matching regex. The regex pattern is searched
as a perl style regular expression, and will match any
portion of a device name. <br>
e.g. &rsquo;^sd[a-zA-Z]+&rsquo; will match all device names
starting with &rsquo;sd&rsquo; followed by one or more
alphabetic characters. e.g. &rsquo;^sd(a|b)$&rsquo; will
only match &rsquo;sda&rsquo; and &rsquo;sdb&rsquo;. e.g.
<br>
&rsquo;sda$&rsquo; will match &rsquo;sda&rsquo; but not
&rsquo;sdab&rsquo;. See also the -G option for aggregation
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P This indicates the number of
decimals to print. The default precision N may be set to
something other than the default 2 decimals. Note that the
avgrq-sz and avgqu-sz <br>
fields are always reported with N+1 decimals of precision.
These fields typically have values less than 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u When replaying a set of
archives, by default values are reported according to the
selected sample interval (-t option), not according to the
actual record intervals in the <br>
set of archives. To this effect PCP interpolates the values
to be reported based on the records in the set of archives,
and is particularly useful when the -t option is <br>
used to replay a set of archives with a longer sampling
interval than the underlying interval the set of archives
was originally recorded with. With the -u option,
uninter&acirc; <br>
polated reporting is enabled - every value is reported
according to the native recording interval in the set of
archives. When the -u option is specified, the -t option
<br>
makes no sense and is incompatible because the replay
interval is always the same as the recording interval in the
set of archive. In addition, -u only makes sense when <br>
replaying a set of archives, see -a above, and so if -u is
specified then -a must also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z By default, pcp-iostat
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on
the system where pcp-iostat is run. The -Z option changes
the timezone to timezone in the <br>
format of the environment variable TZ as described in
environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Change the reporting timezone
to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as identified via either the -h or -a
options. When replaying <br>
a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign timezone, the
-z option would almost always be used (the default reporting
timezone is the local timezone, which may not be the <br>
same as the timezone of the PCP archive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Specifies a comma separated
list of one or more extended reporting options as follows:
<br>
dm - report statistics for device-mapper logical devices
instead of scsi devices, <br>
t - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in
ctime(3) format, <br>
h - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24
samples, <br>
noidle - Do not display statistics for idle devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT <br>
The columns in the pcp-iostat report have the following
interpretation :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timestamp <br>
When the -x t option is specified, this column is the
timestamp in ctime(3) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Device Specifies the scsi device
name, or if -x dm is specified, the device-mapper logical
device name. When -G is specified, this is replaced by the
aggregation method and reg&acirc; <br>
ular expression - see the -G and -R options above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rrqm/s The number of read
requests expressed as a rate per-second that were merged
during the reporting interval by the I/O scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrqm/s The number of write
requests expressed as a rate per-second that were merged
during the reporting interval by the I/O scheduler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r/s The number of read requests
completed by the device (after merges), expressed as a rate
per second during the reporting interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w/s The number of write requests
completed by the device (after merges), expressed as a rate
per second during the reporting interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rkB/s The average volume of data
read from the device expressed as KBytes/second during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wkB/s The average volume of data
written to the device expressed as KBytes/second during the
reporting interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avgrq-sz <br>
The average I/O request size for both reads and writes to
the device expressed as Kbytes during the reporting
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avgqu-sz <br>
The average queue length of read and write requests to the
device during the reporting interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">await The average time in
milliseconds that read and write requests were queued (and
serviced) to the device during the reporting interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r_await <br>
The average time in milliseconds that read requests were
queued (and serviced) to the device during the reporting
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w_await <br>
The average time in milliseconds that write requests were
queued (and serviced) to the device during the reporting
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%util The percentage of time
during the reporting interval that the device was busy
processing requests. A value of 100% indicates device
saturation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* <br>
default PMNS specification files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
