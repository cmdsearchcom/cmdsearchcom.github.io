<p style="margin-top: 1em">wxGUI Module dialogs DESCRIPTION
<br>
GRASS GIS functionality is organized into modules, which are
standalone programs with defined interface. Their graphical
user interface (GUI) is a dialog with several tabs which
<br>
organize module parameters into groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each parameter can have
different type of input fields, for example text entry or
drop-down list. Flags are represented as checkboxes. The
parameter (or flag) name is visible on <br>
the right side of each input field so that it is simple to
understand how the module dialog relates to the command
representation which is used in the manuals and tutorials.
The <br>
commands can be used to call the module in the command line,
Shell scripts or, with a slight modification, in a Python
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tabs <br>
Module parameters and flags are organized in tabs. Their
names can depend on a module, however every module has
Command output tab where the progress can be observed, and
the <br>
module output including text results or warnings are
printed. The last Manual tab contains description of
module&acirc;s parameters and examples. The same information
can be found in <br>
the online manual as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The style of the tabs can be
changed through GUI settings - Appearance - Module dialog
style. Note that the style appearance depends on the
platform and some styles might be more <br>
suitable for different platforms. <br>
Figure: Example of style &quot;left&quot; and
&quot;top&quot; on Ubuntu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags <br>
Module flags are represented as checkboxes with description.
There are three special flags - overwrite, verbose and
quiet. Flags verbose and quiet set the level of verbosity of
<br>
the module (how detailed the messages should be).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules which output a new map
or a new file have the flag overwrite which must be used
when the specified output map or file is already present. If
the map or file of the spec&acirc; <br>
ified name already exist and overwrite flag is not used, an
error message appears: <br>
r.slope.aspect elevation=elevation slope=slope <br>
ERROR: option &lt;slope&gt;: &lt;slope&gt; exists. To
overwrite, use the --overwrite flag <br>
If using the command instead of GUI, these flags are unlike
other flags prefixed with double dash: <br>
r.slope.aspect elevation=elevation slope=slope --overwrite
--quiet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current working directory <br>
Certain modules require a file as input or output. Either
the full path to the file needs to be specified or a path
relative to the current working directory is enough, for
<br>
example only the name of the file. Current working directory
is a directory where GRASS would look for or output files to
if the full path is not specified. By default working <br>
directory is user&acirc;s home folder. It can be changed in
wxGUI menu Settings - GRASS working environment - Change
working directory, or by typing cd and pressing Enter in the
wxGUI <br>
Command console. If the working directory is changed to a
directory where the input files are, then it is enough to
specify just the name of the file instead of the full
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies to external files
such as text files or GeoTiff files. This does not apply to
raster maps, vector maps and other geospatial data stored in
GRASS database which do <br>
not need any path to be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special widgets <br>
For raster, vector or 3D raster input, there is a special
widget which after clicking on the arrow to the right pops
up a list of existing maps from different mapsets. Selecting
<br>
a map from the popup list will add it to the entry field. In
case multiple maps can be specified (denoted by [multiple]
label), selecting a map from the popup list will append <br>
the map names with comma in between.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input file is supposed to
be a text file (for example color rules in r.colors), it is
possible to type the text in the provided box directly
instead of creating a new file <br>
in a text editor and saving it. A temporary file is created
in this case. By pressing the Save as button, the content of
the box is then saved into user specified file, so that <br>
user&acirc;s workflow can be reproduced later. With Load
button we can display the content of selected file and edit
it directly in the box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Figure: In the first image, user
specified a full path to a file. In the second image, user
typed color rules conveniently into the box below, however
the rules will not be <br>
stored permanently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Dialogs are generated automatically based on module
interface defined using g.parser. Command line interface can
be obtained when running the module with a --help flag. The
<br>
options and flags are the same as in the module GUI. <br>
r.neighbors --help <br>
Description: <br>
Makes each cell category value a function of the category
<br>
values assigned to the cells around it, and stores new cell
<br>
values in an output raster map layer. <br>

[gauss=value] [quantile=value[,value,...]] [--overwrite]
<br>
