GIT-CONFLICT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-conflict - record conflict resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git conflict &lt;commit&gt; <br>
git conflict --continue | --abort | -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
git conflict records a conflict resolution between two
branches that git octopus will be able to reuse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start the recording process
between the current branch and an other branch with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git conflict
an_other_branch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will set the index and the
working tree in the conflict state. Once you&acirc;ve
resolved it using git add, run git conflict --continue to
record the resolution. It will print a <br>
ref that points to the resolution and resets the repository
back to HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git conflict --continue <br>
Conflict resolution created:
refs/conflicts/75dd2c142264373c96a3341b2f9fb57bec7a7b7d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So git conflict doesn&acirc;t
write history in your current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git conflict --continue fails if
a resolution for the same conflict already exists. To
override a resolution you will need to delete the ref with
git update-ref -d &lt;ref&gt; before <br>
recording the new one and possibly force the push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&acirc;re satisfied with
the resolution you can push it using a simple git push.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git push origin
refs/conflicts/75dd2c142264373c96a3341b2f9fb57bec7a7b7d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l <br>
List all resolutions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--abort <br>
Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
reconstruct the pre-merge state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there were uncommitted
worktree changes present when the merge started, git
conflict --abort will in some cases be unable to reconstruct
these changes. It is therefore <br>
recommended to always commit or stash your changes before
running git conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--continue <br>
Record the index state as the resolution of the conflict and
prints its ref. The index and the working tree are reset
back to HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNALS <br>
The first thing to know is that a conflict ref, for instance
refs/conflicts/75dd2c142264373c96a3341b2f9fb57bec7a7b7d, is
a standard commit. You can inspect it with git show or <br>
any logger tool. It has an author and dates etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sha1 in the ref is a hash of
the content of the conflict that has been resolved. This
allows resolutions to be found easily by other commands
given a conflict state by simply <br>
hashing the conflict content and looking for a
refs/conflict/&lt;sha1&gt; of the same name. A resolution is
not related to a particular branch, it can be applied in any
circumstances <br>
that produced the same conflict. This means that you can
continue to commit on your branches, you can rebase them,
rename them anyhow. As long as the same conflict is
produced, <br>
the resolution can be retrieved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Currently, when reapplying a resolution, it will only look
at both modified files. So conflicts with renames, mod
changes and deletions are not handled. In addition, If you
<br>
changed something in a file that wasn&acirc;t in conflict
state, it won&acirc;t be reapply neither.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Managing conflicts with more
than a single branch is subtle. Let&acirc;s say I&acirc;m on
a local branch topic_mine and I have two different conflicts
with topic_arya and topic_eddard</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A---B---C topic_mine <br>
/ <br>
D---E---F---G topic_eddard <br>
H---I topic_arya</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I can write two resolutions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git conflict topic_arya <br>
... <br>
$ git conflict --continue <br>
Conflict resolution created:
refs/conflicts/9a4b40f6ec56260618b820e19c8bd734fbfb744d <br>
$ git conflict topic_eddard <br>
... <br>
git conflict --continue <br>
Conflict resolution created:
refs/conflicts/8b3d16d22d0138ddbe6a1cd1a4cb9abf516a4609</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If I run git octopus topic_* on
my current branch (topic_mine), it will starts by merging
topic_arya (branches are sorted alphabeticaly), will find
the first resolution and then <br>
apply changes from topic_eddard, find the 2nd resolution and
end up with a success. Let&acirc;s push !</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git push origin
refs/conflicts/9a4b40f6ec56260618b820e19c8bd734fbfb744d
refs/conflicts/8b3d16d22d0138ddbe6a1cd1a4cb9abf516a4609</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then Arya fetches and runs git
octopus topic_* from her branch topic_arya. It will starts
by merging topic_eddard, no conflict happens (assuming),
then merges topic_mine. The <br>
actual conflict of that merge will combine both conflicts
because the current state have changes from both topic_arya
and topic_eddard. This means that this conflict has a new
<br>
signature that doesn&acirc;t have any resolution and the
octopus will fail. In this case git octopus is not
associative.</p>
