<p>RTF2RTF(1) General Commands Manual RTF2RTF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rtf2rtf - programs to postprocess the raw RTF generated by
the mapping files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rtf2rtf [options] ..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the rtf2rtf commands.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution because the original program does not have a
manual <br>
page for rtf2rtf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rtf2rtf is a program to
postprocess the raw RTF generated by the mapping files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is used by other programs in
sgml-tools (v1), and usually normal user does not need to
use this program directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following is quoted from the
README in the source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Begin Quotes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;m not proud of this
code. It&rsquo;s a hack foisted upon a hack, nested within
another hack or two. It sort of works well enough for my
purposes (generating WinHelp .RTF files for <br>
my documents), but it could definitely use a
redesign/rewrite. It started as a simple pertubation of the
html2html filter, but got ugly very quickly...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I shamelessly blame the RTF
format for most of the hackery here -- RTF is not a
_language_ like LaTeX or ROFF -- it&rsquo;s just a file
format. So, we can&rsquo;t rely on RTF to do even sim&acirc;
<br>
ple things like &quot;insert a paragraph break here only if
the previous token was not also a paragraph break. Since the
SGML front end has no conditional processing capabilities,
<br>
multiple blank likes in the SGML get translated to multiple
para breaks in the RTF. That&rsquo;s why we use a
&quot;lex&quot; filter (rtf2rtf) to postprocess the raw RTF
generated by the mapping <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again: I offer this to the
Linuxdoc community with the hopes that it will be useful to
others and that someone else can help flesh out the missing
pieces. What? Missing pieces? <br>
Yes, recall that I say it works &quot;well enough for my
purposes&quot;. The replacement files (general, mapping)
started out like as the latex replacement files. Much of
them still <br>
_are_ the latex replacement files. I only converted those
parts that are actually used by my documents. Your documents
may require more of the files to be translated to RTF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since I&rsquo;m using these
mappings for actual documentation, I plan on maintaining
this backend, so please send me any improvements --
I&rsquo;ll coordinate with Greg to make sure they get <br>
into the the next official release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(End Quotes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The programs does not support normal command line
option.</p>
