This manual page documents briefly the <b>rtf2rtf</b> commands. This manual page
  was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program
  does not have a manual page for rtf2rtf.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>rtf2rtf</b> is a program to postprocess the raw RTF generated by the mapping
  files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is used by other programs in sgml-tools (v1), and usually normal user does
  not need to use this program directly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Following is quoted from the README in the source tree.

I'm not proud of this code. It's a hack foisted upon a hack, nested within
  another hack or two. It sort of works well enough for my purposes (generating
  WinHelp .RTF files for my documents), but it could definitely use a
  redesign/rewrite. It started as a simple pertubation of the html2html filter,
  but got ugly very quickly...
<div class="Pp"></div>
I shamelessly blame the RTF format for most of the hackery here -- RTF is not a
  _language_ like LaTeX or ROFF -- it's just a file format. So, we can't rely on
  RTF to do even simple things like &quot;insert a paragraph break here only if
  the previous token was not also a paragraph break. Since the SGML front end
  has no conditional processing capabilities, multiple blank likes in the SGML
  get translated to multiple para breaks in the RTF. That's why we use a
  &quot;lex&quot; filter (rtf2rtf) to postprocess the raw RTF generated by the
  mapping files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Again: I offer this to the Linuxdoc community with the hopes that it will be
  useful to others and that someone else can help flesh out the missing pieces.
  What? Missing pieces? Yes, recall that I say it works &quot;well enough for my
  purposes&quot;. The replacement files (general, mapping) started out like as
  the latex replacement files. Much of them still _are_ the latex replacement
  files. I only converted those parts that are actually used by my documents.
  Your documents may require more of the files to be translated to RTF.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since I'm using these mappings for actual documentation, I plan on maintaining
  this backend, so please send me any improvements -- I'll coordinate with Greg
  to make sure they get into the the next official release.
