<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qemu-img - QEMU disk image utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
usage: qemu-img command [command options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
qemu-img allows you to create, convert and modify images
offline. It can handle all image formats supported by
QEMU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Never use qemu-img to
modify images in use by a running virtual machine or any
other process; this may destroy the image. Also, be aware
that querying an image that is <br>
being modified by another process may encounter inconsistent
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following commands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [-q] [-f fmt]
[--output=ofmt] [-r [leaks | all]] [-T src_cache] filename
<br>
create [-q] [-f fmt] [-o options] filename [size] <br>
commit [-q] [-f fmt] [-t cache] filename <br>

amend [-q] [-f fmt] [-t cache] -o options filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
is a disk image filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fmt is the disk image format. It
is guessed automatically in most cases. See below for a
description of the supported disk formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backing-chain <br>
will enumerate information about backing files in a disk
image chain. Refer below for further description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size <br>
is the disk image size in bytes. Optional suffixes
&quot;k&quot; or &quot;K&quot; (kilobyte, 1024)
&quot;M&quot; (megabyte, 1024k) and &quot;G&quot; (gigabyte,
1024M) and T (terabyte, 1024G) are supported. &quot;b&quot;
is <br>
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output_filename <br>
is the destination disk image filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output_fmt <br>
is the destination format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
is a comma separated list of format specific options in a
name=value format. Use &quot;-o ?&quot; for an overview of
the options supported by the used format or see the format
<br>
descriptions below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c indicates that target image
must be compressed (qcow format only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h with or without a command
shows help and lists the supported formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p display progress bar
(compare, convert and rebase commands only). If the -p
option is not used for a command that supports it, the
progress is reported when the process <br>
receives a &quot;SIGUSR1&quot; signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet mode - do not print any
output (except errors). There&rsquo;s no progress bar in
case both -q and -p options are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S size <br>
indicates the consecutive number of bytes that must contain
only zeros for qemu-img to create a sparse image during
conversion. This value is rounded down to the nearest 512
<br>
bytes. You may use the common size suffixes like
&quot;k&quot; for kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t cache <br>
specifies the cache mode that should be used with the
(destination) file. See the documentation of the
emulator&rsquo;s &quot;-drive cache=...&quot; option for
allowed values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T src_cache <br>
specifies the cache mode that should be used with the source
file(s). See the documentation of the emulator&rsquo;s
&quot;-drive cache=...&quot; option for allowed values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters to snapshot
subcommand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapshot <br>
is the name of the snapshot to create, apply or delete</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a applies a snapshot (revert
disk to saved state)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c creates a snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d deletes a snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lists all snapshots in the
given image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters to compare
subcommand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f First image format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Second image format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Strict mode - fail on on
different image size or sector allocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters to convert
subcommand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Skip the creation of the
target volume</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command description:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [-f fmt] [--output=ofmt]
[-r [leaks | all]] [-T src_cache] filename <br>
Perform a consistency check on the disk image filename. The
command can output in the format ofmt which is either
&quot;human&quot; or &quot;json&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;-r&quot; is specified,
qemu-img tries to repair any inconsistencies found during
the check. &quot;-r leaks&quot; repairs only cluster leaks,
whereas &quot;-r all&quot; fixes all kinds of errors, <br>
with a higher risk of choosing the wrong fix or hiding
corruption that has already occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the formats
&quot;qcow2&quot;, &quot;qed&quot; and &quot;vdi&quot;
support consistency checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create [-f fmt] [-o options]
filename [size] <br>
Create the new disk image filename of size size and format
fmt. Depending on the file format, you can add one or more
options that enable additional features of this format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the option backing_file is
specified, then the image will record only the differences
from backing_file. No size needs to be specified in this
case. backing_file will <br>
never be modified unless you use the &quot;commit&quot;
monitor command (or qemu-img commit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size can also be specified
using the size option with &quot;-o&quot;, it doesn&rsquo;t
need to be specified separately in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commit [-f fmt] [-t cache]
filename <br>
Commit the changes recorded in filename in its base image or
backing file. If the backing file is smaller than the
snapshot, then the backing file will be resized to be the
<br>
same size as the snapshot. If the snapshot is smaller than
the backing file, the backing file will not be truncated. If
you want the backing file to match the size of the <br>
smaller snapshot, you can safely truncate it yourself once
the commit operation successfully completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compare [-f fmt] [-F fmt] [-T
src_cache] [-p] [-s] [-q] filename1 filename2 <br>
Check if two images have the same content. You can compare
images with different format or settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format is probed unless you
specify it by -f (used for filename1) and/or -F (used for
filename2) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, images with
different size are considered identical if the larger image
contains only unallocated and/or zeroed sectors in the area
after the end of the other <br>
image. In addition, if any sector is not allocated in one
image and contains only zero bytes in the second one, it is
evaluated as equal. You can use Strict mode by <br>
specifying the -s option. When compare runs in Strict mode,
it fails in case image size differs or a sector is allocated
in one image and is not allocated in the second one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, compare prints out a
result message. This message displays information that both
images are same or the position of the first different byte.
In addition, result <br>
message can report different image size in case Strict mode
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compare exits with 0 in case the
images are equal and with 1 in case the images differ. Other
exit codes mean an error occurred during execution and
standard error output <br>
should contain an error message. The following table
sumarizes all exit codes of the compare subcommand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Images are identical</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Images differ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Error on opening an image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Error on checking a sector
allocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Error on reading data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">convert [-c] [-p] [-n] [-f fmt]
[-t cache] [-T src_cache] [-O output_fmt] [-o options] [-s
snapshot_name] [-S sparse_size] filename [filename2 [...]]
output_filename <br>
Convert the disk image filename or a snapshot snapshot_name
to disk image output_filename using format output_fmt. It
can be optionally compressed (&quot;-c&quot; option) or use
any <br>
format specific options like encryption (&quot;-o&quot;
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the formats
&quot;qcow&quot; and &quot;qcow2&quot; support compression.
The compression is read-only. It means that if a compressed
sector is rewritten, then it is rewritten as uncompressed
<br>
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image conversion is also useful
to get smaller image when using a growable format such as
&quot;qcow&quot;: the empty sectors are detected and
suppressed from the destination image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sparse_size indicates the
consecutive number of bytes (defaults to 4k) that must
contain only zeros for qemu-img to create a sparse image
during conversion. If sparse_size is <br>
0, the source will not be scanned for unallocated or zero
sectors, and the destination image will always be fully
allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the backing_file
option to force the output image to be created as a copy on
write image of the specified base image; the backing_file
should have the same <br>
content as the input&rsquo;s base image, however the path,
image format, etc may differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;-n&quot; option is
specified, the target volume creation will be skipped. This
is useful for formats such as &quot;rbd&quot; if the target
volume has already been created with site <br>
specific options that cannot be supplied through
qemu-img.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info [-f fmt] [--output=ofmt]
[--backing-chain] filename <br>
Give information about the disk image filename. Use it in
particular to know the size reserved on disk which can be
different from the displayed size. If VM snapshots are <br>
stored in the disk image, they are displayed too. The
command can output in the format ofmt which is either
&quot;human&quot; or &quot;json&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a disk image has a backing
file chain, information about each disk image in the chain
can be recursively enumerated by using the option
&quot;--backing-chain&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if you have an
image chain like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base.qcow2 &lt;- snap1.qcow2
&lt;- snap2.qcow2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enumerate information about
each disk image in the above chain, starting from top to
base, do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qemu-img info --backing-chain
snap2.qcow2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map [-f fmt] [--output=ofmt]
filename <br>
Dump the metadata of image filename and its backing file
chain. In particular, this commands dumps the allocation
state of every sector of filename, together with the <br>
topmost file that allocates it in the backing file
chain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two option formats are possible.
The default format (&quot;human&quot;) only dumps
known-nonzero areas of the file. Known-zero parts of the
file are omitted altogether, and likewise <br>
for parts that are not allocated throughout the chain.
qemu-img output will identify a file from where the data can
be read, and the offset in the file. Each line will <br>
include four fields, the first three of which are
hexadecimal numbers. For example the first line of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Offset Length Mapped to File
<br>
0 0x20000 0x50000 /tmp/overlay.qcow2 <br>
0x100000 0x10000 0x95380000 /tmp/backing.qcow2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means that 0x20000 (131072)
bytes starting at offset 0 in the image are available in
/tmp/overlay.qcow2 (opened in &quot;raw&quot; format)
starting at offset 0x50000 (327680). Data <br>
that is compressed, encrypted, or otherwise not available in
raw format will cause an error if &quot;human&quot; format
is in use. Note that file names can include newlines, thus
it <br>
is not safe to parse this output format in scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternative format
&quot;json&quot; will return an array of dictionaries in
JSON format. It will include similar information in the
&quot;start&quot;, &quot;length&quot;, &quot;offset&quot;
fields; it will <br>
also include other more specific information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- whether the sectors contain
actual data or not (boolean field &quot;data&quot;; if
false, the sectors are either unallocated or stored as
optimized all-zero clusters);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- whether the data is known to
read as zero (boolean field &quot;zero&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- in order to make the output
shorter, the target file is expressed as a
&quot;depth&quot;; for example, a depth of 2 refers to the
backing file of the backing file of filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In JSON format, the
&quot;offset&quot; field is optional; it is absent in cases
where &quot;human&quot; format would omit the entry or exit
with an error. If &quot;data&quot; is false and the
&quot;offset&quot; <br>
field is present, the corresponding sectors in the file are
not yet in use, but they are preallocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, consult
include/block/block.h in QEMU&rsquo;s source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapshot [-l | -a snapshot | -c
snapshot | -d snapshot ] filename <br>
List, apply, create or delete snapshots in image
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rebase [-f fmt] [-t cache] [-T
src_cache] [-p] [-u] -b backing_file [-F backing_fmt]
filename <br>
Changes the backing file of an image. Only the formats
&quot;qcow2&quot; and &quot;qed&quot; support changing the
backing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backing file is changed to
backing_file and (if the image format of filename supports
this) the backing file format is changed to backing_fmt. If
backing_file is <br>
specified as &quot;&quot; (the empty string), then the image
is rebased onto no backing file (i.e. it will exist
independently of any backing file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache specifies the cache mode
to be used for filename, whereas src_cache specifies the
cache mode for reading backing files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two different modes in
which &quot;rebase&quot; can operate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Safe mode <br>
This is the default mode and performs a real rebase
operation. The new backing file may differ from the old one
and qemu-img rebase will take care of keeping the guest-
<br>
visible content of filename unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to achieve this, any
clusters that differ between backing_file and the old
backing file of filename are merged into filename before
actually changing the backing <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the safe mode is an
expensive operation, comparable to converting an image. It
only works if the old backing file still exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsafe mode <br>
qemu-img uses the unsafe mode if &quot;-u&quot; is
specified. In this mode, only the backing file name and
format of filename is changed without any checks on the file
contents. <br>
The user must take care of specifying the correct new
backing file, or the guest-visible content of the image will
be corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mode is useful for renaming
or moving the backing file to somewhere else. It can be used
without an accessible old backing file, i.e. you can use it
to fix an image <br>
whose backing file has already been moved/renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use &quot;rebase&quot;
to perform a &quot;diff&quot; operation on two disk images.
This can be useful when you have copied or cloned a guest,
and you want to get back to a thin image on <br>
top of a template or base image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Say that &quot;base.img&quot;
has been cloned as &quot;modified.img&quot; by copying it,
and that the &quot;modified.img&quot; guest has run so there
are now some changes compared to &quot;base.img&quot;. To
<br>
construct a thin image called &quot;diff.qcow2&quot; that
contains just the differences, do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qemu-img create -f qcow2 -b
modified.img diff.qcow2 <br>
qemu-img rebase -b base.img diff.qcow2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At this point,
&quot;modified.img&quot; can be discarded, since
&quot;base.img + diff.qcow2&quot; contains the same
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize filename [+ | -]size <br>
Change the disk image as if it had been created with
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before using this command to
shrink a disk image, you MUST use file system and
partitioning tools inside the VM to reduce allocated file
systems and partition sizes <br>
accordingly. Failure to do so will result in data loss!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After using this command to grow
a disk image, you must use file system and partitioning
tools inside the VM to actually begin using the new space on
the device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amend [-f fmt] [-t cache] -o
options filename <br>
Amends the image format specific options for the image file
filename. Not all file formats support this operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Supported image file formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw Raw disk image format
(default). This format has the advantage of being simple and
easily exportable to all other emulators. If your file
system supports holes (for example <br>
in ext2 or ext3 on Linux or NTFS on Windows), then only the
written sectors will reserve space. Use &quot;qemu-img
info&quot; to know the real size used by the image or
&quot;ls -ls&quot; on <br>
Unix/Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;preallocation&quot; <br>
Preallocation mode (allowed values: &quot;off&quot;,
&quot;falloc&quot;, &quot;full&quot;). &quot;falloc&quot;
mode preallocates space for image by calling
posix_fallocate(). &quot;full&quot; mode preallocates space
<br>
for image by writing zeros to underlying storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qcow2 <br>
QEMU image format, the most versatile format. Use it to have
smaller images (useful if your filesystem does not supports
holes, for example on Windows), optional AES <br>
encryption, zlib based compression and support of multiple
VM snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;compat&quot; <br>
Determines the qcow2 version to use. &quot;compat=0.10&quot;
uses the traditional image format that can be read by any
QEMU since 0.10. &quot;compat=1.1&quot; enables image format
<br>
extensions that only QEMU 1.1 and newer understand (this is
the default). Amongst others, this includes zero clusters,
which allow efficient copy-on-read for sparse <br>
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;backing_file&quot; <br>
File name of a base image (see create subcommand)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;backing_fmt&quot; <br>
Image format of the base image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;encryption&quot; <br>
If this option is set to &quot;on&quot;, the image is
encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encryption uses the AES format
which is very secure (128 bit keys). Use a long password (16
characters) to get maximum protection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;cluster_size&quot; <br>
Changes the qcow2 cluster size (must be between 512 and 2M).
Smaller cluster sizes can improve the image file size
whereas larger cluster sizes generally provide better <br>
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;preallocation&quot; <br>
Preallocation mode (allowed values: &quot;off&quot;,
&quot;metadata&quot;, &quot;falloc&quot;, &quot;full&quot;).
An image with preallocated metadata is initially larger but
can improve performance when the <br>
image needs to grow. &quot;falloc&quot; and &quot;full&quot;
preallocations are like the same options of &quot;raw&quot;
format, but sets up metadata also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;lazy_refcounts&quot; <br>
If this option is set to &quot;on&quot;, reference count
updates are postponed with the goal of avoiding metadata I/O
and improving performance. This is particularly interesting
<br>
with cache=writethrough which doesn&rsquo;t batch metadata
updates. The tradeoff is that after a host crash, the
reference count tables must be rebuilt, i.e. on the next
open <br>
an (automatic) &quot;qemu-img check -r all&quot; is
required, which may take some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can only be enabled
if &quot;compat=1.1&quot; is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other <br>
QEMU also supports various other image file formats for
compatibility with older QEMU versions or other hypervisors,
including VMDK, VDI, VHD (vpc), VHDX, qcow1 and QED. For
<br>
a full list of supported formats see &quot;qemu-img
--help&quot;. For a more detailed description of these
formats, see the QEMU Emulation User Documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main purpose of the block
drivers for these formats is image conversion. For running
VMs, it is recommended to convert the disk images to either
raw or qcow2 in order to <br>
achieve good performance.</p>
