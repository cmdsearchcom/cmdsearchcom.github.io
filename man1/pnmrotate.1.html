<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmrotate - rotate a PNM image by some angle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmrotate [-noantialias] [-background=color] angle
[pnmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmrotate reads a PNM image as
input. It rotates it by the specified angle and produces the
same kind of PNM image as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input is the file named by
pnmfile or Standard Input if you don&rsquo;t specify
pnmfile. The output goes to Standard Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting image is a
rectangle that contains the (rectangular) input image within
it, rotated with respect to its bottom edge. The containing
rectangle is as small as possi&acirc; <br>
ble to contain the rotated image. The background of the
containing image is a single color that pnmrotate determines
to be the background color of the original image, or that
<br>
you specify explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">angle is in decimal degrees
(floating point), measured counter-clockwise. It can be
negative, but it should be between -90 and 90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should use pamflip instead
for rotations that are a multiple of a quarter turn. It is
faster and more accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For rotations greater than 45
degrees you may get better results if you first use pamflip
to do a 90 degree rotation and then pnmrotate less than 45
degrees back the other direc&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rotation algorithm is Alan
Paeth&rsquo;s three-shear method. Each shear is implemented
by looping over the source pixels and distributing fractions
to each of the destination pix&acirc; <br>
els. This has an &rsquo;anti-aliasing&rsquo; effect - it
avoids jagged edges and similar artifacts. However, it also
means that the original colors or gray levels in the image
are modi&acirc; <br>
fied. If you need to keep precisely the same set of colors,
you can use the -noantialias option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program runs faster and uses
less real memory with the -noantialias option. It uses a
large amount of virtual memory either way, as it keeps a
copy of the input image and a <br>
copy of the output image in memory, using 12 bytes per pixel
for each. But with -noantialias, it accesses this memory
sequentially in half a dozen passes, with only a few pages
<br>
of memory at a time required in real memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, without
-noantialias, the program&rsquo;s real memory working set
size is one page per input image row plus one page per
output image row. Before Netpbm 10.16 (June <br>
2003), -noantialias had the same memory requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
prefix. You may use two hyphens instead of one to designate
an option. You may use either white space or equals signs
<br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-background=color <br>
This determines the color of the background on which the
rotated image sits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (color) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, if you don&rsquo;t
specify this option, pnmrotate selects what appears to it to
be the background color of the original image. It determines
this color rather sim&acirc; <br>
plistically, by taking an average of the colors of the two
top corners of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.15. Before that, pnmrotate always behaved as is the
default now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noantialias <br>
This option forces pnmrotate to simply move pixels around
instead of synthesizing output pixels from multiple input
pixels. The latter could cause the output to contain <br>
colors that are not in the input, which may not be
desirable. It also probably makes the output contain a large
number of colors. If you need a small number of colors, <br>
but it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are the exact ones from
the input, consider using pnmquant on the output instead of
using -noantialias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that to ensure the output
does not contain colors that are not in the input, you also
must consider the background color. See the -background
option.</p>
