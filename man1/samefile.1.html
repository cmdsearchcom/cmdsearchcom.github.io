<p>SAMEFILE(1) JS SAMEFILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
samefile - find identical files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
samefile [-g size] [-l | -r] [-s sep] [-0aiqVvx]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
samefile reads a list of filenames (one filename per line)
from stdin. For each filename pair with identical contents,
a line consisting of six fields is output: The size in <br>
bytes, two filenames, the character
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; if the two files are on the
same device, &lsquo;&lsquo;X&rsquo;&rsquo; otherwise, and
the link counts of the two files. The output is sorted in
reverse order <br>
by size as the primary key and the filenames as the
secondary key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-0 Indicates that the input list of file names is NUL
terminated, for example as generated by implementations of
find(1) that support the -print0 option. Without this <br>
option, the file names are assumed to be newline
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Do not sort files with same
size alphabetically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g size <br>
Compare only files with size greater than size bytes.
Default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Allow files with the same
device/i-node pair to be added to the binary tree. This
might be useful if output will be fed into some other
program. If this option is used, <br>
the statistics displayed when using -v will not contain the
&lsquo;&lsquo;You have a total of x bytes in identical
files&rsquo;&rsquo; line because -i prohibits proper
calculation of this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Do not check if files with
identical contents are hard links created by ln(1). By
default, samefile checks if files with identical contents
are hard linked and, if they <br>
are, does not write a name pair to stdout. A slight speedup
is gained when using this option. This option is
incompatible with the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Do not issue warning messages
when open(2) fails. When you encounter such a warning, open
probably failed due to a &rsquo;permission denied&rsquo;
error on files or directories for <br>
which you have no read permission. Useful if you are not
root and want to compare your files against files in a
system directory like /etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Report whether identical
files are hard linked. The separator string followed by the
[bracketed] link count is appended to each name pair if they
are hard links created <br>
with ln. This option is incompatible with the -l option.
Note that this kind of output has only four fields and will
appear unsorted before the actual output of samefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sep Use string sep as the
output field separator, defaults to a tab character. Useful
if filenames contain tab characters and output must be
processed by another program, say <br>
awk(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version information
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose mode. Write some
statistical messages about memory usage and work reduction
as well as the sum of the sizes of all identical files to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Switch off intelligence. This
option prevents samefile from being smart. If files file1,
file2 and file3 are identical, it will do 3 comparisons
instead of just the two <br>
needed and write more output. See the discussion under
INTERNALS why this could be useful. If this option is used,
the statistics displayed when using -v will not contain <br>
the &lsquo;&lsquo;You have a total of x bytes in identical
files&rsquo;&rsquo; line because -x prohibits proper
calculation of this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNALS <br>
samefile uses two stages to give optimum performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first stage, all
non-plain files are skipped (directories, devices, FIFOs,
sockets, symbolic links) as well as files for which stat(2)
fails and files that have a size <br>
less than or equal to size. Output of the first stage (the
filenames) is written into a binary tree with one node for
every file size. It is also at this early stage where <br>
checks for hard links are done. If hard links are found, and
-r is requested, the name pairs are output immediately. The
whole list of hard linked name pairs will therefore <br>
appear before any output of the second stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For any i-node only one filename
will be added to the binary tree (unless -i was
requested.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second stage all files
having the same size are compared against each other. The
rules of mathematical logic are applied to reduce work and
output noise (unless -x is <br>
requested): if files a, b, and c have the same size and
samefile finds that a = b and a = c then it will not compare
b against c (and will not output a line for b and c) but
only <br>
for a = b and a = c. Note however, that because only the
first filename per i-node gets into the second stage, the
output for a group of identical files with different i-node
<br>
numbers is also minimized. Suppose you have six identical
files of size 100 in an i-node group consisting of the three
i-nodes with numbers 10, 20 and 30 (the term &rsquo;i-node
group&rsquo; <br>
has nothing to do with the i-node group notion of some file
systems - it merely refers to a set of i-nodes addressing
files with identical contents):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls -i <br>
10 file1 20 file4 30 file6 <br>
10 file2 20 file5 <br>
10 file3 <br>
$ ls | samefile <br>
100 file1 file4 = 3 2 <br>
100 file1 file6 = 3 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sum of the sizes in the
first column is the amount of disk space you could gain by
making all 6 files links to only one file or remove all but
one of the files. To be pre&acirc; <br>
cise, disk space is allocated in blocks - you will probably
gain two blocks here, rather than 200 bytes. Note that it is
not enough to just remove file4 and file6 (you would <br>
gain only 100 bytes because file5 still exists.) The proper
way is to use the -i option. The output will look like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100 file1 file2 = 3 3 <br>
100 file1 file3 = 3 3 <br>
100 file1 file4 = 3 2 <br>
100 file1 file5 = 3 2 <br>
100 file1 file6 = 3 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Removing all files listed in the
third field will leave only file1. Making all files hard
links to file1 is easy. If the fourth field is a
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo; do a forced hard link. If you
<br>
need to know about all combinations of identical files, then
you use both the -i and -x option. This produces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls | samefile -ix <br>
100 file1 file2 = 3 3 <br>
100 file1 file3 = 3 3 <br>
100 file1 file4 = 3 2 <br>
100 file1 file5 = 3 2 <br>
100 file1 file6 = 3 1 <br>
100 file2 file3 = 3 3 <br>
100 file2 file4 = 3 2 <br>
100 file2 file5 = 3 2 <br>
100 file2 file6 = 3 1 <br>
100 file3 file4 = 3 2 <br>
100 file3 file5 = 3 2 <br>
100 file3 file6 = 3 1 <br>
100 file4 file5 = 2 2 <br>
100 file4 file6 = 2 1 <br>
100 file5 file6 = 2 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Find all identical files in the current working
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ls | samefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find all identical files in my
HOME directory and subdirectories and also tell me if there
are hard links:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ find $HOME -type f | samefile
-r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find all identical files in the
/usr directory tree that are bigger than 10000 bytes and
write the result to usr.dups (that one is for the sysadmin
folks, you may want to &rsquo;amp&rsquo; - <br>
put it in the background with the ampersand &amp; - this
command because it takes a few minutes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ find /usr -type f | samefile
-g 10000 &gt;usr.dups</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
You will see a short usage message if you use an invalid
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">malloc - free = xxxx <br>
I didn&rsquo;t free the memory I&rsquo;ve malloc(3)ed. You
found a bug. Please report it to the author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocation failed for
&rsquo;expr&rsquo; ... <br>
Oops! You ran out of virtual memory. You must have a real
big filename list. Try to use a smaller one or increase
resources available to your processes. For more
informa&acirc; <br>
tion see ulimit(1) or your similar shell builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There are no known bugs. The source has been lint(1)ed and
all possible care has been taken while coding. If you find a
bug (or miss a feature) please contact the author.</p>
