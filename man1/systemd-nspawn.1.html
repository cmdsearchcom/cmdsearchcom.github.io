<p>SYSTEMD-NSPAWN(1) systemd-nspawn SYSTEMD-NSPAWN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
systemd-nspawn - Spawn a namespace container for debugging,
testing and building</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
systemd-nspawn [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND [ARGS...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-nspawn -b [OPTIONS...]
[ARGS...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
systemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a
light-weight namespace container. In many ways it is similar
to chroot(1), but more powerful since it fully virtualizes
the <br>
file system hierarchy, as well as the process tree, the
various IPC subsystems and the host and domain name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-nspawn limits access to
various kernel interfaces in the container to read-only,
such as /sys, /proc/sys or /sys/fs/selinux. Network
interfaces and the system clock may <br>
not be changed from within the container. Device nodes may
not be created. The host system cannot be rebooted and
kernel modules may not be loaded from within the
container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even though these
security precautions are taken systemd-nspawn is not
suitable for secure container setups. Many of the security
features may be circumvented and are <br>
hence primarily useful to avoid accidental changes to the
host system from the container. The intended use of this
program is debugging and testing as well as building of <br>
packages, distributions and software involved with boot and
systems management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast to chroot(1)
systemd-nspawn may be used to boot full Linux-based
operating systems in a container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a tool like yum(8),
debootstrap(8), or pacman(8) to set up an OS directory tree
suitable as file system hierarchy for systemd-nspawn
containers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that systemd-nspawn will
mount file systems private to the container to /dev, /run
and similar. These will not be visible outside of the
container, and their contents will <br>
be lost when the container exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that running two
systemd-nspawn containers from the same directory tree will
not make processes in them see each other. The PID namespace
separation of the two containers is <br>
complete and the containers will share very few runtime
objects except for the underlying file system. Use
machinectl(1)&rsquo;s login command to request an additional
login prompt in <br>
a running container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">systemd-nspawn implements the
Container Interface[1] specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a safety check systemd-nspawn
will verify the existence of /usr/lib/os-release or
/etc/os-release in the container tree before starting the
container (see os-release(5)). It <br>
might be necessary to add this file to the container tree
manually if the OS of the container is too old to contain
this file out-of-the-box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If option -b is specified, the arguments are used as
arguments for the init binary. Otherwise, COMMAND specifies
the program to launch in the container, and the remaining
<br>
arguments are used as arguments for this program. If -b is
not used and no arguments are specifed, a shell is launched
in the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --directory= <br>
Directory to use as file system root for the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither --directory=, nor
--image= is specified the directory is determined as
/var/lib/machines/ suffixed by the machine name as specified
with --machine=. If neither <br>
--directory=, --image=, nor --machine= are specified, the
current directory will be used. May not be specified
together with --image=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--template= <br>
Directory or &quot;btrfs&quot; subvolume to use as template
for the container&rsquo;s root directory. If this is
specified and the container&rsquo;s root directory (as
configured by --directory=) <br>
does not yet exist it is created as &quot;btrfs&quot;
subvolume and populated from this template tree. Ideally,
the specified template path refers to the root of a
&quot;btrfs&quot; subvolume, <br>
in which case a simple copy-on-write snapshot is taken, and
populating the root directory is instant. If the specified
template path does not refer to the root of a
&quot;btrfs&quot; <br>
subvolume (or not even to a &quot;btrfs&quot; file system at
all), the tree is copied, which can be substantially more
time-consuming. Note that if this option is used the
container&rsquo;s <br>
root directory (in contrast to the template directory!) must
be located on a &quot;btrfs&quot; file system, so that the
&quot;btrfs&quot; subvolume may be created. May not be
specified together <br>
with --image= or --ephemeral.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --ephemeral <br>
If specified, the container is run with a temporary
&quot;btrfs&quot; snapshot of its root directory (as
configured with --directory=), that is removed immediately
when the container <br>
terminates. This option is only supported if the root file
system is &quot;btrfs&quot;. May not be specified together
with --image= or --template=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --image= <br>
Disk image to mount the root directory for the container
from. Takes a path to a regular file or to a block device
node. The file or block device must contain either:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An MBR partition
table with a single partition of type 0x83 that is marked
bootable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A GUID partition
table (GPT) with a single partition of type
0fc63daf-8483-4772-8e79-3d69d8477de4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A GUID partition
table (GPT) with a marked root partition which is mounted as
the root directory of the container. Optionally, GPT images
may contain a home and/or a <br>
server data partition which are mounted to the appropriate
places in the container. All these partitions must be
identified by the partition types defined by the <br>
Discoverable Partitions Specification[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other partitions, such as
foreign partitions, swap partitions or EFI system partitions
are not mounted. May not be specified together with
--directory=, --template= or <br>
--ephemeral.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --boot <br>
Automatically search for an init binary and invoke it
instead of a shell or a user supplied program. If this
option is used, arguments specified on the command line are
used <br>
as arguments for the init binary. This option may not be
combined with --share-system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user= <br>
After transitioning into the container, change to the
specified user-defined in the container&rsquo;s user
database. Like all other systemd-nspawn features, this is
not a security <br>
feature and provides protection against accidental
destructive operations only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --machine= <br>
Sets the machine name for this container. This name may be
used to identify this container during its runtime (for
example in tools like machinectl(1) and similar), and is
<br>
used to initialize the container&rsquo;s hostname (which the
container can choose to override, however). If not
specified, the last component of the root directory path of
the <br>
container is used, possibly suffixed with a random
identifier in case --ephemeral mode is selected. If the root
directory selected is the host&rsquo;s root directory the
host&rsquo;s <br>
hostname is used as default instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uuid= <br>
Set the specified UUID for the container. The init system
will initialize /etc/machine-id from this if this file is
not set yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--slice= <br>
Make the container part of the specified slice, instead of
the default machine.slice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--private-network <br>
Disconnect networking of the container from the host. This
makes all network interfaces unavailable in the container,
with the exception of the loopback device and those <br>
specified with --network-interface= and configured with
--network-veth. If this option is specified, the
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability will be added to the set of
capabilities the <br>
container retains. The latter may be disabled by using
--drop-capability=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--network-interface= <br>
Assign the specified network interface to the container.
This will remove the specified interface from the calling
namespace and place it in the container. When the container
<br>
terminates, it is moved back to the host namespace. Note
that --network-interface= implies --private-network. This
option may be used more than once to add multiple network
<br>
interfaces to the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--network-macvlan= <br>
Create a &quot;macvlan&quot; interface of the specified
Ethernet network interface and add it to the container. A
&quot;macvlan&quot; interface is a virtual interface that
adds a second MAC <br>
address to an existing physical Ethernet link. The interface
in the container will be named after the interface on the
host, prefixed with &quot;mv-&quot;. Note that
--network-macvlan= <br>
implies --private-network. This option may be used more than
once to add multiple network interfaces to the
container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--network-ipvlan= <br>
Create an &quot;ipvlan&quot; interface of the specified
Ethernet network interface and add it to the container. An
&quot;ipvlan&quot; interface is a virtual interface, similar
to a &quot;macvlan&quot; <br>
interface, which uses the same MAC address as the underlying
interface. The interface in the container will be named
after the interface on the host, prefixed with
&quot;iv-&quot;. <br>
Note that --network-ipvlan= implies --private-network. This
option may be used more than once to add multiple network
interfaces to the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --network-veth <br>
Create a virtual Ethernet link (&quot;veth&quot;) between
host and container. The host side of the Ethernet link will
be available as a network interface named after the
container&rsquo;s <br>
name (as specified with --machine=), prefixed with
&quot;ve-&quot;. The container side of the Ethernet link
will be named &quot;host0&quot;. Note that --network-veth
implies --private-network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--network-bridge= <br>
Adds the host side of the Ethernet link created with
--network-veth to the specified bridge. Note that
--network-bridge= implies --network-veth. If this option is
used, the <br>
host side of the Ethernet link will use the &quot;vb-&quot;
prefix instead of &quot;ve-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --port= <br>
If private networking is enabled, maps an IP port on the
host onto an IP port on the container. Takes a protocol
specifier (either &quot;tcp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;),
separated by a colon from <br>
a host port number in the range 1 to 65535, separated by a
colon from a container port number in the range from 1 to
65535. The protocol specifier and its separating colon <br>
may be omitted, in which case &quot;tcp&quot; is assumed.
The container port number and its colon may be ommitted, in
which case the same port as the host port is implied. This
option <br>
is only supported if private networking is used, such as
--network-veth or --network-bridge=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --selinux-context= <br>
Sets the SELinux security context to be used to label
processes in the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --selinux-apifs-context=
<br>
Sets the SELinux security context to be used to label files
in the virtual API file systems in the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--capability= <br>
List one or more additional capabilities to grant the
container. Takes a comma-separated list of capability names,
see capabilities(7) for more information. Note that the <br>
following capabilities will be granted in any way:
CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH,
CAP_FOWNER, CAP_FSETID, CAP_IPC_OWNER, CAP_KILL, CAP_LEASE,
<br>
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE, CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,
CAP_NET_BROADCAST, CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETFCAP,
CAP_SETPCAP, CAP_SETUID, CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_SYS_CHROOT,
CAP_SYS_NICE, <br>
CAP_SYS_PTRACE, CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG, CAP_SYS_RESOURCE,
CAP_SYS_BOOT, CAP_AUDIT_WRITE, CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL. Also
CAP_NET_ADMIN is retained if --private-network is specified.
If <br>
the special value &quot;all&quot; is passed, all
capabilities are retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drop-capability= <br>
Specify one or more additional capabilities to drop for the
container. This allows running the container with fewer
capabilities than the default (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--link-journal= <br>
Control whether the container&rsquo;s journal shall be made
visible to the host system. If enabled, allows viewing the
container&rsquo;s journal files from the host (but not vice
versa). <br>
Takes one of &quot;no&quot;, &quot;host&quot;,
&quot;try-host&quot;, &quot;guest&quot;,
&quot;try-guest&quot;, &quot;auto&quot;. If &quot;no&quot;,
the journal is not linked. If &quot;host&quot;, the journal
files are stored on the host file system <br>
(beneath /var/log/journal/machine-id) and the subdirectory
is bind-mounted into the container at the same location. If
&quot;guest&quot;, the journal files are stored on the guest
file <br>
system (beneath /var/log/journal/machine-id) and the
subdirectory is symlinked into the host at the same
location. &quot;try-host&quot; and &quot;try-guest&quot; do
the same but do not fail if <br>
the host does not have persistent journalling enabled. If
&quot;auto&quot; (the default), and the right subdirectory
of /var/log/journal exists, it will be bind mounted into the
<br>
container. If the subdirectory does not exist, no linking is
performed. Effectively, booting a container once with
&quot;guest&quot; or &quot;host&quot; will link the journal
persistently if <br>
further on the default of &quot;auto&quot; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j <br>
Equivalent to --link-journal=try-guest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--read-only <br>
Mount the root file system read-only for the container.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bind=, --bind-ro= <br>
Bind mount a file or directory from the host into the
container. Either takes a path argument -- in which case the
specified path will be mounted from the host to the same
<br>
path in the container --, or a colon-separated pair of paths
-- in which case the first specified path is the source in
the host, and the second path is the destination in <br>
the container. The --bind-ro= option creates read-only bind
mounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tmpfs= <br>
Mount a tmpfs file system into the container. Takes a single
absolute path argument that specifies where to mount the
tmpfs instance to (in which case the directory access <br>
mode will be chosen as 0755, owned by root/root), or
optionally a colon-separated pair of path and mount option
string, that is used for mounting (in which case the kernel
<br>
default for access mode and owner will be chosen, unless
otherwise specified). This option is particularly useful for
mounting directories such as /var as tmpfs, to allow <br>
state-less systems, in particular when combined with
--read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--setenv= <br>
Specifies an environment variable assignment to pass to the
init process in the container, in the format
&quot;NAME=VALUE&quot;. This may be used to override the
default variables or <br>
to set additional variables. This parameter may be used more
than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--share-system <br>
Allows the container to share certain system facilities with
the host. More specifically, this turns off PID namespacing,
UTS namespacing and IPC namespacing, and thus allows <br>
the guest to see and interact more easily with processes
outside of the container. Note that using this option makes
it impossible to start up a full Operating System in the
<br>
container, as an init system cannot operate in this mode. It
is only useful to run specific programs or applications this
way, without involving an init system in the <br>
container. This option implies --register=no. This option
may not be combined with --boot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--register= <br>
Controls whether the container is registered with
systemd-machined(8). Takes a boolean argument, defaults to
&quot;yes&quot;. This option should be enabled when the
container runs a <br>
full Operating System (more specifically: an init system),
and is useful to ensure that the container is accessible via
machinectl(1) and shown by tools such as ps(1). If the <br>
container does not run an init system, it is recommended to
set this option to &quot;no&quot;. Note that --share-system
implies --register=no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-unit <br>
Instead of creating a transient scope unit to run the
container in, simply register the service or scope unit
systemd-nspawn has been invoked in with systemd-machined(8).
<br>
This has no effect if --register=no is used. This switch
should be used if systemd-nspawn is invoked from within a
service unit, and the service unit&rsquo;s sole purpose is
to run <br>
a single systemd-nspawn container. This option is not
available if run from a user session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--personality= <br>
Control the architecture (&quot;personality&quot;) reported
by uname(2) in the container. Currently, only
&quot;x86&quot; and &quot;x86-64&quot; are supported. This
is useful when running a 32-bit <br>
container on a 64-bit host. If this setting is not used, the
personality reported in the container is the same as the one
reported on the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Turns off any status output by the tool itself. When this
switch is used, the only output from nspawn will be the
console output of the container OS itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--volatile=MODE <br>
Boots the container in volatile mode. When no mode parameter
is passed or when mode is specified as &quot;yes&quot; full
volatile mode is enabled. This means the root directory is
<br>
mounted as mostly unpopulated &quot;tmpfs&quot; instance,
and /usr from the OS tree is mounted into it, read-only (the
system thus starts up with read-only OS resources, but
pristine <br>
state and configuration, any changes to the either are lost
on shutdown). When the mode parameter is specified as
&quot;state&quot; the OS tree is mounted read-only, but /var
is <br>
mounted as &quot;tmpfs&quot; instance into it (the system
thus starts up with read-only OS resources and
configuration, but pristine state, any changes to the latter
are lost on <br>
shutdown). When the mode parameter is specified as
&quot;no&quot; (the default) the whole OS tree is made
available writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that setting this to
&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;state&quot; will only work
correctly with operating systems in the container that can
boot up with only /usr mounted, and are able to populate
<br>
/var automatically, as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short help text and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print a short version string and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1. Download a Fedora image and start a shell in
it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># machinectl pull-raw
--verify=no

<br>
# systemd-nspawn -M Fedora-Cloud-Base-20141203-21</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This downloads an image using

--enablerepo=fedora install systemd passwd yum
fedora-release vim-minimal <br>
# systemd-nspawn -bD /srv/mycontainer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This installs a minimal Fedora
distribution into the directory /srv/mycontainer/ and then
boots an OS in a namespace container in it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 3. Spawn a shell in a
container of a minimal Debian unstable distribution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># debootstrap --arch=amd64
unstable ~/debian-tree/ <br>
# systemd-nspawn -D ~/debian-tree/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This installs a minimal Debian
