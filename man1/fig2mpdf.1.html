<p>fig2mpdf(1) Including xfig figures into LaTeX documents
fig2mpdf(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fig2mpdf - creation of multilayer pdf or eps figures from
fig files using latex for typesetting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fig2mpdf [OPTION]... FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This tool can create pdf or eps figures using fig files as
source. For beamer presentations, for example, you can use
the multilayer mode to create multiple figures that can be
<br>
overlayed to get a dynamic figure. For proper appearance you
can use latex to typeset some or all texts, possibly
containing formulas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default interpretation of
the given fig FILE depends on its suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig Normal conversion of a fig
file. All texts are interpreted as postscript texts and all
elements of the figure are included in the resulting
figure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lfig LaTeX interpretation of the
file. All texts of the input file that have the special bit
set are typeset by pdflatex resp. latex (see: Option
-|+l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mfig Multilayer file
interpretation. Depending on the used depths of the figure
it is split into multiple parts. For each part an output
file is created (see: section Multi&acirc; <br>
LayerOutput).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mlfig or lmfig <br>
Combination of multilayer and LaTeX interpretation of the
input (see: Suffix lfig and mfig).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default interpretation of
the input can be changed by using the options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-e produce an eps output file. Instead of creating a pdf
file (the default) an eps figure is produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-|+l force calling (pdf)latex
(-) or do not use (pdf)latex (+) for typesetting the text
marked with the special flag. With this option you can
change the default behavior given <br>
by the input file suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-|+m force set (-) or unset (+)
the multilayer interpretation (see: MultiLayerOutput below)
which was previously set by the input file suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p ranges <br>
explicitly set the ranges of depths for splitting the input
figure in multilayer mode. ranges is a colon separated list
of ranges of the form upper-lower or depth where <br>
upper is the top and lower the bottom depth in the range. If
you use the depth form the range consist of just that
depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i include the the bottommost
range (that is, the one with the highest depth) into all
output figures. This is for compatibility to older versions
of this tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I turn on pyramid mode. The
figure of a corresponding range in multilayer mode includes
all lower ranges too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g gapwidth <br>
set the allowed gapwidth between two used depths to decide
if these depths should be grouped together in one range.
With this option you get more flexibility to insert <br>
objects with new depths. The default width is zero (no gap =
consecutively numbered depths are grouped together).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s style <br>
replace the default style for selecting a font family in
LaTeX mode. If this option is omitted the style
&lsquo;times&rsquo; is set by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H header <br>
replace the default header sequence for creating temporary
LaTeX documents in LaTeX mode. To get maximum flexibility
you can set the entire document header in the file <br>
header (see: Customized Headers below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G in multilayer mode change the
default output file pattern to the PDF format which is
&lt;name&gt;.page&lt;no&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v be verbose and print out all
executed commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V print out the version of
fig2mpdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MultiLayerOutput <br>
In xfig you can assign an individual depth to all objects of
the figure. These depths are normally used to determine the
order of printing the objects. fig2mpdf uses these depths
<br>
to group the objects into ranges in automatic mode (if the
ranges option is omitted). In the list of used depths,
consecutively numbered depths are grouped into one range.
That <br>
is, all gaps between used depths are used to logically split
the figure. With -g you can set the gapwidth which
doesn&rsquo;t split the figure (default: zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting list of ranges
determines the number of output files. In default mode all
objects with depths assigned to one range are collected and
put into the corresponding <br>
output file. The contents of the output files can be changed
with the two Options -i and -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option reduces the number
of output files by one. The bottommost range, that is the
range which consist of the highest depths of the figure, is
included into all output <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In pyramid mode, activated by
the option -I, the output files contain additionally all
lower ranges. With this mode you can get stand alone figures
that don&rsquo;t have to be over&acirc; <br>
layed to have meaningful content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 1 <br>
Assume that you have a fig file foo.fig which contains the
three ranges 230-233, 455-460 and 499-500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no options set you get
three output files, one per range. But if you set the -i
option you get the following two files where the bottommost
range is included in both of the <br>
files: <br>
foo-0.pdf with ranges 455-460 and 499-500 <br>
foo-1.pdf with ranges 230-233 and 499-500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2 <br>
The pyramid mode, activated by the option -I, will produce
the following files from the source file of Example 1: <br>
foo-0.pdf with ranges 499-500 <br>
foo-1.pdf with ranges 455-460 and 499-500 <br>
foo-2.pdf with ranges 230-233, 455-460 and 499-500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 3 <br>
If both options are set you will get just two files with the
following contents: <br>
foo-0.pdf with ranges 455-460 and 499-500 <br>
foo-1.pdf with ranges 230-233, 455-460 and 499-500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customized Headers <br>
For various reasons you might want to change the standard
latex generation, e.g., if you want to change the default
font family. The following example represents a valid header
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usage of this example file
changes the font family to sans serif and adds an additional
search path for includegraphics to the &lsquo;figures&rsquo;
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocumentclass{article} <br>
sepackage{german,amssymb,amsmath} <br>
enewcommand{milydefault}{efault} <br>
1{aphicspath{{figures/}}}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following packages are
generally used: color, graphicx and epsfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tex errors <br>
Sometimes it might happen that latex generates an error
while processing your special texts. To keep you informed
about the occurrence of that error and about what has
happened, <br>
in this case the log file is shown by invoking a less
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
In single layer mode for the resulting files the suffix fig
is replaced by pdf (resp. eps) (i.e. foo.fig -&gt;
foo.pdf).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In multilayer mode the base name
of the source fig files is extended by
&rsquo;-&lt;range&gt;&rsquo; and the suffix is set to pdf
(resp. eps). <br>
(i.e., foo.fig -&gt; foo-0.pdf, foo-1.pdf, foo-2.pdf, ...
<br>
or foo.fig -&gt; foo.page0.pdf, foo.page1.pdf,
foo.page2.pdf, ... <br>
if the option -G is set).</p>
