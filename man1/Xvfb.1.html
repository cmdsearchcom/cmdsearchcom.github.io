<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Xvfb - virtual framebuffer X server for X Version 11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Xvfb [ option ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xvfb is an X server that can run on machines with no display
hardware and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb
framebuffer using virtual memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary use of this server
was intended to be server testing. The fb code for any depth
can be exercised with this server without the need for real
hardware that supports <br>
the desired depths. The X community has found many other
novel uses for Xvfb, including testing clients against
unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch
processing <br>
with Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as
an aid to porting the X server to a new platform, and
providing an unobtrusive way to run applications that
don&rsquo;t <br>
really need an X server but insist on having one anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
In addition to the normal server options described in the
Xserver(1) manual page, Xvfb accepts the following command
line switches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-screen screennum WxHxD <br>
This option creates screen screennum and sets its width,
height, and depth to W, H, and D respectively. By default,
only screen 0 exists and has the dimensions 1280x1024x8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pixdepths list-of-depths <br>
This option specifies a list of pixmap depths that the
server should support in addition to the depths implied by
the supported screens. list-of-depths is a space-separated
<br>
list of integers that can have values from 1 to 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbdir framebuffer-directory
<br>
This option specifies the directory in which the memory
mapped files containing the framebuffer memory should be
created. See FILES. This option only exists on machines <br>
that have the mmap and msync system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shmem <br>
This option specifies that the framebuffer should be put in
shared memory. The shared memory ID for each screen will be
printed by the server. The shared memory is in xwd <br>
format. This option only exists on machines that support the
System V shared memory interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -shmem nor -fbdir is
specified, the framebuffer memory will be allocated with
malloc().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linebias n <br>
This option specifies how to adjust the pixelization of thin
lines. The value n is a bitmask of octants in which to
prefer an axial step when the Bresenham error term is <br>
exactly zero. See the file Xserver/mi/miline.h for more
information. This option is probably only useful to server
developers to experiment with the range of line
pixeliza&acirc; <br>
tion possible with the fb code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-blackpixel pixel-value,
-whitepixel pixel-value <br>
These options specify the black and white pixel values the
server should use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The following files are created if the -fbdir option is
given.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">framebuffer-directory/Xvfb_screen&lt;n&gt;
<br>
Memory mapped file containing screen n&rsquo;s framebuffer
memory, one file per screen. The file is in xwd format.
Thus, taking a full-screen snapshot can be done with a file
<br>
copy command, and the resulting snapshot will even contain
the cursor image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1600x1200x32 <br>
The server will listen for connections as server number 1,
and screen 0 will be depth 32 1600x1200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xvfb :1 -screen 1 1600x1200x16
<br>
The server will listen for connections as server number 1,
will have the default screen configuration (one screen,
1280x1024x8), and screen 1 will be depth 16 1600x1200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xvfb -pixdepths 3 27 -fbdir
/var/tmp <br>
The server will listen for connections as server number 0,
will have the default screen configuration (one screen,
1280x1024x8), will also support pixmap depths of 3 and <br>
27, and will use memory mapped files in /var/tmp for the
framebuffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xwud -in /var/tmp/Xvfb_screen0
<br>
Displays screen 0 of the server started by the preceding
example.</p>
