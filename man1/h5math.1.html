<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
h5math - combine/create HDF5 files with math expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
h5math [OPTION]... OUTPUT-HDF5FILE [INPUT-HDF5FILES...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
h5math takes any number of HDF5 files as input, along with a
mathematical expression, and combines them to produce a new
HDF5 file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDF5 is a free, portable binary
format and supporting library developed by the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of
Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. <br>
A single h5 file can contain multiple data sets; by default,
h5math creates a dataset called &quot;h5math&quot;, but this
can be changed via the -d option, or by using the syntax
<br>
HDF5FILE:DATASET. The -a option can be used to append new
datasets to an existing HDF5 file. The same syntax is used
to specify the dataset used in the input file(s); by <br>
default, the first dataset (alphabetically) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple example of
h5math&rsquo;s usage is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h5math -e &quot;d1 + 2*d2&quot;
out.h5 foo.h5 bar.h5:blah</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which produces a new file,
out.h5, by adding the first dataset in foo.h5 with twice the
&quot;blah&quot; dataset in bar.h5. In the expression
(specified by -e), the first input dataset <br>
(from left to right) is referred to as d1, the second as d2,
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to input datasets,
you can also use the x/y/z coordinates of each point in the
expression, referenced by &quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot; and
&quot;z&quot; variables (for the first three dimensions) as
<br>
well as a &quot;t&quot; variable that refers to the last
dimension. By default, these are integers starting at 0 at
the corner of the dataset, but the -0 option will change the
x/y/z ori&acirc; <br>
gin to the center of the dataset (t is unaffected), and the
-r res option will specify the &quot;resolution&quot;,
dividing the x/y/z coordinates by res.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the input datasets must
have the same dimensions, which are also the dimensions of
the output. If there are no input files, and you are
defining the output purely by a <br>
mathematical formula, you can specify the dimensions of the
output explicitly via the -n size option, where size is e.g.
&quot;2x2x2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, however, you want to
use only a smaller-dimensional &quot;slice&quot; of
multi-dimensional data. To do this, you specify coordinates
in one (or more) slice dimension(s), via <br>
the -xyzt options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display help on the command-line options and usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
copyright info for h5math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a If the HDF5 output file
already exists, append the data as a new dataset rather than
overwriting the file (the default behavior). An existing
dataset of the same name <br>
within the file is overwritten, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e expression <br>
Specify the mathematical expression that is used to
construct the output (generally in &quot; quotes to group
the expression as one item in the shell), in terms of the
vari&acirc; <br>
ables for the input datasets and the coordinates as
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expressions use a C-like infix
notation, with most standard operators and mathematical
functions (+, sin, etc.) being supported. This functionality
is provided (and its <br>
features determined) by GNU libmatheval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Name of a text file to read the expression from, if no -e
expression is specified. Defaults to stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x ix, -y iy, -z iz, -t it <br>
This tells h5math to use a particular slice of a
multi-dimensional dataset. e.g. -x uses the subset (with one
less dimension) at an x index of ix (where the indices run
<br>
from zero to one less than the maximum index in that
direction). Here, x/y/z correspond to the first/second/third
dimensions of the HDF5 dataset. The -t option specifies <br>
a slice in the last dimension, whichever that might be. See
also the -0 option to shift the origin of the x/y/z slice
coordinates to the dataset center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-0 Shift the origin of the x/y/z
slice coordinates to the dataset center, so that e.g. -0 -x
0 (or more compactly -0x0) returns the central x plane of
the dataset instead of <br>
the edge x plane. (-t coordinates are not affected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This also shifts the origin of
the x/y/z variables in the expression so that 0 is the
center of the dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r res Use a resolution res for
x/y/z (but not t) variables in the expression, so that the
data &quot;grid&quot; coordinates are divided by res. The
default res is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the x dimension
has 21 grid steps, setting a res of 20 will mean that x
variables in the expression run from 0.0 to 1.0 (or -0.5 to
0.5 if -0 is speci&acirc; <br>
fied), instead of 0 to 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r does not affect the
coordinates used for slices, which are always integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n size <br>
The output dataset must be the same size as the input
datasets. If there are no input datasets (if you are
defining the output purely by a formula), then you must
specify <br>
the output size manually with this option: size is of the
form MxNxLx... (with M, N, L being integers) and may be of
any dimensionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d name <br>
Write to dataset name in the output; otherwise, the output
dataset is called &quot;data&quot; by default. Also use
dataset name in the input; otherwise, the first input
dataset <br>
(alphabetically) in a file is used. Alternatively, use the
syntax HDF5FILE:DATASET (which overrides the -d option).</p>
