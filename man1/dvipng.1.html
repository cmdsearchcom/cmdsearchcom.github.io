<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvipng - A DVI-to-PNG translator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvipng [options] filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvipng [options] [filename]
-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as
obtained from TeX and its relatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If GIF support is enabled, GIF
output is chosen by using the dvigif binary or with the
--gif option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The benefits of dvipng/dvigif
include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Speed. It is a
very fast bitmap-rendering code for DVI files, which makes
it suitable for generating large amounts of images
on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK <br>
and others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It does not read
the postamble, so it can be started before TeX finishes.
There is a --follow switch that makes dvipng wait at
end-of-file for further output, unless it finds <br>
the POST marker that indicates the end of the DVI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Interactive
query of options. dvipng can read options interactively
through stdin, and all options are usable. It is even
possible to change the input file through this <br>
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Supports PK, VF,
PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, subfonts (i.e., as
used in CJK-LaTeX), color specials, and inclusion of
PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; and more...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Many of the parameterless options listed here can be turned
off by suffixing the option with a zero (0); for instance,
to turn off page reversal, use -r0. Such options are <br>
marked with a trailing *.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Read additional options from
standard input after processing the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print a usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bd num <br>
-bd color_spec <br>
-bd &rsquo;num color_spec&rsquo; <br>
Set the pixel width of the transparent border (default 0).
Using this option will make the image edges transparent, but
it only affects pixels with the background color. <br>
Giving a color_spec will set the fallback color, to be used
in viewers that cannot handle transparency (the default is
the background color). The color spec should be in TeX <br>
color cial syntax, e.g., &rsquo;rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0&rsquo;.
Setting the fallback color makes the default border width 1
px.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bdpi num <br>
This option only has an effect when using bitmapped (PK)
fonts. The option sets the base (Metafont) resolution, both
horizontal and vertical, to num dpi (dots per inch). This
<br>
option is necessary when manually selecting Metafont mode
with the --mode option (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bg color_spec <br>
Choose background color for the images. This option will be
ignored if there is a background color cial in the DVI. The
color spec should be in TeX color cial syntax, <br>
e.g., &rsquo;rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0&rsquo;. You can also specify
&rsquo;Transparent&rsquo; or &rsquo;transparent&rsquo; which
will give you a transparent background with the normal
background as a fallback color. A <br>
capitalized &rsquo;Transparent&rsquo; will give a full-alpha
transparency, while an all-lowercase
&rsquo;transparent&rsquo; will give a simple fully
transparent background with non-transparent <br>
antialiased pixels. The latter would be suitable for viewers
who cannot cope with a true alpha channel. GIF images do not
support full alpha transparency, so in case of GIF <br>
output, both variants will use the latter behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d num <br>
Set the debug flags, showing what dvipng (thinks it) is
doing. This will work unless dvipng has been compiled
without the &quot;DEBUG&quot; option (not recommended). Set
the flags as <br>
you need them, use -d -1 as the first option for maximum
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D num <br>
Set the output resolution, both horizontal and vertical, to
num dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One may want to adjust this to
fit a certain text font size (e.g., on a web page), and for
a text font height of font_px pixels (in Mozilla) the
correct formula is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;dpi&gt; = &lt;font_px&gt; *
72.27 / 10 [px * TeXpt/in / TeXpt]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last division by ten is due
to the standard font height 10pt in your document, if you
use 12pt, divide by 12. Unfortunately, some proprietary
browsers have font height in <br>
pt (points), not pixels. You have to rescale that to pixels,
using the screen resolution (default is usually 96 dpi)
which means the formula is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;font_px&gt; =
&lt;font_pt&gt; * 96 / 72 [pt * px/in / (pt/in)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some high-res screens, the
value is instead 120 dpi. Good luck!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--depth* <br>
Report the depth of the image. This only works reliably when
the LaTeX style preview.sty from preview-latex is used with
the active option. It reports the number of pixels <br>
from the bottom of the image to the baseline of the image.
This can be used for vertical positioning of the image in,
e.g., web documents, where one would use (Cascading <br>
StyleSheets 1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;IMG
SRC=&quot;&lt;filename.png&gt;&quot;
STYLE=&quot;vertical-align: -&lt;depth&gt;px&quot;&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The depth is a negative offset
in this case, so the minus sign is necessary, and the unit
is pixels (px).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dvinum* <br>
Set this option to make the output page number be the TeX
page numbers rather than the physical page number. See the
-o switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg color_spec <br>
Choose foreground color for the images. This option will be
ignored if there is a foreground color cial in the DVI. The
color spec should be in TeX color cial syntax, <br>
e.g., &rsquo;rgb 1.0 0.0 0.0&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--follow* <br>
Wait for data at end-of-file. One of the benefits of dvipng
is that it does not read the postamble, so it can be started
before TeX finishes. This switch makes dvipng wait at <br>
end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST
marker that indicates the end of the DVI. This is similar to
tail -f but for DVI-to-PNG conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--freetype* <br>
Enable/disable FreeType font rendering (default on). This
option is available if the FreeType2 font library was
present at compilation time. If this is the case, dvipng
will <br>
have direct support for PostScript Type1 and TrueType fonts
internally, rather than using gsftopk for rendering the
fonts. If you have PostScript versions of Computer Modern
<br>
installed, there will be no need to generate bitmapped (PK)
variants on disk of these. Then, you can render images at
different (and unusual) resolutions without cluttering <br>
the disk with lots of bitmapped fonts. Note that if you have
both FreeType and T1lib on your system, FreeType will be
preferred by dvipng. If you for some reason would want <br>
to use T1lib rendering, use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gamma num <br>
Control the interpolation of colors in the greyscale
anti-aliasing color palette. Default value is 1.0. For 0
&lt; num &lt; 1, the fonts will be lighter (more like the
<br>
background), and for num &gt; 1, the fonts will be darker
(more like the foreground).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gif* <br>
The images are output in the GIF format, if GIF support is
enabled. This is the default for the dvigif binary, which
only will be available when GIF support is enabled. GIF <br>
images are palette images (see the --palette option) and
does not support true alpha channels (see the --bg option).
See also the --png option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--height* <br>
Report the height of the image. This only works reliably
when the LaTeX style preview.sty from preview-latex is used
with the active option. It reports the number of pixels <br>
from the top of the image to the baseline of the image. The
total height of the image is obtained as the sum of the
values reported from --height and --depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l [=]num <br>
The last page printed will be the first one numbered num.
Default is the last page in the document. If num is prefixed
by an equals sign, then it (and the argument to the -p <br>
option, if specified) is treated as a physical (absolute)
page number, rather than a value to compare with the TeX
will end with the ninth page of the document, no matter what
the pages are actually numbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mode mode <br>
This option only has an effect when using bitmapped (PK)
fonts. Use mode as the Metafont device name for the PK fonts
(both for path searching and font generation). This <br>
needs to be augmented with the base device resolution, given
with the --bdpi option. See the file
&lt;ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/modes.mf&gt; for a list of
resolutions and mode names <br>
for most devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M* This option only has an
effect when using bitmapped (PK) fonts. It turns off
automatic PK font generation (mktexpk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nogs* <br>
This switch prohibits the internal call to GhostScript for
displaying PostScript specials. --nogs0 turns the call back
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nogssafer* <br>
Normally, if GhostScript is used to render PostScript
specials, the GhostScript interpreter is run with the option
-dSAFER. The --nogssafer option runs GhostScript without
<br>
-dSAFER. The -dSAFER option in Ghostscript disables
PostScript operators such as deletefile, to prevent possibly
malicious PostScript programs from having any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--norawps* <br>
Some packages generate raw PostScript specials, even
non-rendering such specials. This switch turns off the
internal call to GhostScript intended to display these raw
<br>
PostScript specials. --norawps0 turns the call back on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o name <br>
Send output to the file name. A single occurrence of %d or
%01d, ..., %09d will be exchanged for the physical page
number (this can be changed, see the --dvinum switch). The
<br>
default output filename is file%d.png where the input DVI
file was file.dvi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O x-offset,y-offset <br>
Move the origin by x-offset,y-offset, a comma-separated pair
of dimensions such as .1in,-.3cm. The origin of the page is
shifted from the default position (of one inch down, <br>
one inch to the right from the upper left corner of the
paper) by this amount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [=]num <br>
The first page printed will be the first one numbered num.
Default is the first page in the document. If num is
prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and the argument to the
<br>
-l option, if specified) is treated as a physical (absolute)
page number, rather than a value to compare with the TeX =3
will start with the third page of the document, no matter
what the pages are actually numbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--palette* <br>
When an external image is included, dvipng will
automatically switch to truecolor mode, to avoid unnecessary
delay and quality reduction, and enable the EPS translator
to <br>
draw on a transparent background and outside of the
boundingbox. This switch will force palette (256-color)
output and make dvipng revert to opaque clipped image
inclusion. <br>
This will also override the --truecolor switch if
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--picky* <br>
No images are output when a warning occurs. Normally, dvipng
will output an image in spite of a warning, but there may be
something missing in this image. One reason to use <br>
this option would be if you have a more complete but slower
fallback converter. Mainly, this is useful for failed figure
inclusion and unknown cial occurrences, but <br>
warnings will also occur for missing or unknown color specs
and missing PK fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--png* <br>
The images are output in the PNG format. This is the default
for the dvipng binary. See also the --gif option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pp firstpage-lastpage <br>
Print pages firstpage through lastpage; but not quite
equivalent to -p firstpage -l lastpage. For example, when
rendering a book, there may be several instances of a page
in <br>
the DVI file (one in &quot;ontmatter&quot;, one in
&quot;inmatter&quot;,c and one in &quot;ktter&quot;). In
case of several pages matching, -pp mfirstpage-lastpage will
render all pages that <br>
matches the specified range, while -p firstpage -l lastpage
will render the pages from the first occurrence of firstpage
to the first occurrence of lastpage. This is the <br>
(undocumented) behaviour of dvips. In dvipng you can give
both kinds of options, in which case you get all pages that
matches the range in -pp between the pages from -p to <br>
-l. Also multiple -pp options accumulate, unlike -p and -l.
The - separator can also be :. Note that -pp -1 will be
interpreted as &quot;all pages up to and including 1&quot;,
if you <br>
want a page numbered -1 (only the table of contents, say)
put -pp -1--1, or more readable, -pp -1:-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q* Run quietly. Don&rsquo;t
chatter about pages converted, etc. to standard output;
report no warnings (only errors) to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q num <br>
Set the quality to num. That is, choose the number of
antialiasing levels for bitmapped fonts (PK) and fonts
rendered using T1lib, to be num*num+1. The default value is
4 <br>
which gives 17 levels of antialiasing for antialiased fonts
from these two. If FreeType is available, its rendering is
unaffected by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r* Toggle output of pages in
reverse/forward order. By default, the first page in the DVI
is output first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strict* <br>
The program exits when a warning occurs. Normally, dvipng
will output an image in spite of a warning, but there may be
something missing in this image. One reason to use this <br>
option would be if you have a more complete but slower
fallback converter. See the --picky option above for a list
of when warnings occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T image_size <br>
Set the image size to image_size which can be either of
bbox, tight, or a comma-separated pair of dimensions
hsize,vsize such as .1in,.3cm. The default is bbox which
produces <br>
a PNG that includes all ink put on the page and in addition
the DVI origin, located 1in from the top and 1in from the
left edge of the paper. This usually gives whitespace <br>
above and to the left in the produced image. The value tight
will make dvipng only include all ink put on the page,
producing neat images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--t1lib* <br>
Enable T1lib font rendering (default on). This option is
available if the T1lib font library was present at
compilation time. If this is the case, dvipng will have
direct <br>
support for PostScript Type1 fonts internally, rather than
using gsftopk for rendering the fonts. If you have
PostScript versions of Computer Modern installed, there will
be <br>
no need to generate bitmapped variants on disk of these.
Then, you can render images at different (and unusual)
resolutions without cluttering the disk with lots of <br>
bitmapped fonts. Note that if you have both FreeType and
T1lib on your system, FreeType will be preferred by dvipng,
and if you for some reason rather want to use T1lib, give
<br>
the option --freetype0 (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--truecolor* <br>
This will make dvipng generate truecolor output. Note that
truecolor output is automatic if you include an external
image in your DVI, e.g., via a PostScript special (i.e.,
<br>
the graphics or graphicx package). This switch is overridden
by the --palette switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v* Enable verbose operation.
This will currently indicate what fonts is used, in addition
to the usual output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--width* <br>
Report the width of the image. See also --height and
--depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x num <br>
This option is deprecated; it should not be used. It is much
better to select the output resolution directly with the -D
option. This option sets the magnification ratio to <br>
num/1000 and overrides the magnification specified in the
DVI file. Must be between 10 and 100000. It is recommended
that you use standard magstep values (1095, 1200, 1440, <br>
1728, 2074, 2488, 2986, and so on) to help reduce the total
number of PK files generated. num may be a real number, not
an integer, for increased precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z num <br>
Set the PNG compression level to num. This option is enabled
if your libgd is new enough. The default compression level
is 1, which selects maximum speed at the price of <br>
slightly larger PNGs. For an older libgd, the hard-soldered
value 5 is used. The include file png.h says
&quot;Currently, valid values range from 0 - 9,
corresponding directly to <br>
the zlib compression levels 0 - 9 (0 - no compression, 9 -
&quot;maximal&quot; compression). Note that tests have shown
that zlib compression levels 3-6 usually perform as well as
<br>
level 9 for PNG images, and do considerably fewer
calculations. In the future, these values may not correspond
directly to the zlib compression levels.&quot;</p>
