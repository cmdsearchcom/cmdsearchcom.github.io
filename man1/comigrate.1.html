<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
comigrate - managing package migrations from Debian unstable
to testing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
comigrate [options] [--heidi file] [--hints file] <br>
comigrate [options] --update <br>
comigrate [options] --migrate package <br>
comigrate [options] --equivocal <br>
comigrate [options] --excuses file [--svg] <br>
comigrate [options] --explain dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
comigrate is a tool designed to manage the migration of
packages from Debian unstable to testing. It can be used in
different ways. First, it can compute which packages can
<br>
migrate into testing; it can output either an HeidiResult
file listing the updated contents of testing, or a set of
hints that can be fed to Britney to help it perform the
migra&acirc; <br>
tion. Second, it can output detailed reports of what
prevents packages from migrating. Last, it can be used to
interactively troubleshoot the migration of a given
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless an alternative command is
given, comigrate will perform package migration and output
the corresponding HeidiResult file at the location indicated
in the configuration <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Commands <br>
The default behavior of comigrate is to compute which
packages can migrate from unstable to testing. This behavior
can be overriden by the options below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--equivocal <br>
Output the set of packages that can migrate without making
any package non-installable but that will make it impossible
to install some set of packages together (package <br>
co-installability would no be preserved). This makes it
possible to find the packages that would be allowed to
migrate when using the --inst option (preserving only
pack&acirc; <br>
age installability), but that could nonetheless be
problematic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--excuses file <br>
Write to this HTML file a detailed explanation of why some
packages cannot migrate. With the --svg option, an SVG graph
is also included for each installability or co- <br>
installability issue (set of packages that one would not be
able to install together anymore) that prevents the
migration. The dot tool is required to produce these <br>
graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--explain dir <br>
This command is designed to produce a report that can be
published over HTTP. An HTML file is created for each
package that cannot migrate, providing a detailed
explana&acirc; <br>
tion of why this package cannot migrate. A file listing
co-installability issues (that is, set of packages that can
no longer be installed together) that would result from <br>
forthcoming migrations is also created. The --popcon option
can be used to specify popcon data to use for the report.
The dot tool is required for this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--migrate package <br>
Compute whether it is possible to migrate this source
package. If this is indeed possible, a corresponding Britney
hint is outputted, by default on the standard output <br>
(this can be overridden with the --hints option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update <br>
Initialize or update the data directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common Options <br>
--arches lst <br>
Comma-separated list of architectures to consider (default
to all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file, --config file <br>
Use this Britney configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package Migration Options <br>
--all-hints <br>
Show all hints. By default, hints consisting of a single
package are omitted when outputting hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--break sets <br>
Override the default migration constraint that set of
packages that could be install together can still be
installed together after migration (package
co-installability). <br>
This option allows to specify that some precise set of
packages can become non co-installable (or, in the case of a
single package, that this package can become non <br>
installable). This is crucial to allow the migration of
packages that are no longer compatible. The argument sets is
a comma-separated list of sets of packages. Each set <br>
is either a list of binary package names separated by a
vertical bar symbol |, or a wildcard _ standing for any
package. We explain this option through examples. You can
<br>
write --break libjpeg62-dev to state that package
libjpeg62-dev does not have to remain installable. But it is
usually better to indicate that the package should remain
<br>
installable but that it is fine if it is no longer
installable with some other packages: --break
libjpeg62-dev,_. You can be even more precise and specify
that two given <br>
packages can become incompatible, but no other
incompatibility should be introduced: --break
parallel,moreutils. Finally, you can use the vertical bar
symbol to factorize <br>
several sets of packages: --break
&rsquo;unoconv,python-uno|docvert-libreoffice&rsquo; means
that package unoconv does not have to remain installable
together with python-uno nor <br>
docvert-libreoffice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--heidi HeidiResult <br>
Write the result of package migration to file HeidiResult.
When HeidiResult is -, write to standard output. The option
only make sense when no specific command is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hints file <br>
Output hints to this file. When file is -, write to standard
output. This disable the ouput of the HeidiResult file,
unless an explicit --heidi option is provided as <br>
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inst When computing possible
migration, only preserves single package installability.
This is similar to what Britney does. The default is to
ensure the stronger requirement <br>
that set of packages that could be install together can
still be installed together after migration (that is,
package co-installability).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--offset n <br>
Move n days into the future. This is convenient to see what
packages will be able to migrate in a few days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove pkg <br>
Compute package migration as if the source package pkg and
its associated binary packages had been removed from
unstable. This is a convenient way to migrate an important
<br>
package when its migration is prevented by packages of low
importance. Together with the --migrate command, this option
can help finding out all issues preventing the <br>
migration of a given package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-Specific Options <br>
--svg Include conflict graphs (in SVG format) in excuse
output. This option only makes sense together with the
--excuses option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--popcon file <br>
Use popcon data from this file. This option only makes sense
together with the --explain option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source url <br>
Download package information from the given url. This option
only makes sense together with the --update option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous Options <br>
--debug name <br>
Activate debug option name. Use --debug help to list
available debug options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help, --help <br>
Print a usage message briefly summarizing the command-line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input dir <br>
Select the directory containing Britney data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cache <br>
Disable on-disk caching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--proc n <br>
Provide number of processors. Use 1 to disable concurrency.
Defaults to use all processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ignored Options <br>
These two Britney options are currently ignored and are
present only for compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--control-files <br>
Currently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Currently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To get started, you need to use a Britney configuration file
britney.conf. The files specifies in particular the location
of migration data (control files, hint files, ...). <br>
These data can then be downloaded (or updated) with the
command below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comigrate -c britney.conf
--update</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running comigrate without option
will make it behave like Britney: it will compute the set of
packages that can migrate and write a corresponding
HeidiResult file at the location <br>
indicated in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comigrate -c britney.conf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, comigrate is more
picky than Britney: it will not allow packages to migrate if
any set of packages that could be installed together can no
longer be installed <br>
together. With the --inst option, comigrate will only check
that packages remain installable, just like Britney
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comigrate -c britney.conf
--inst</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can get the
set of Britney easy hints corresponding to the
migration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comigrate -c britney.conf
--hints - --all-hints</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --migrate option will give
you an explanation of why a package cannot migrate. (If the
package can in fact migrate, the corresponding easy hint
will be printed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comigrate -c britney.conf
--migrate ghc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --remove and --break options
can be used together with this option to get a clear
understand of what needs to be done to migrate the
package.</p>
