<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vncviewer - VNC viewer for X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vncviewer [options] [host][:display#] <br>
vncviewer [options] [host][::port] <br>
vncviewer [options] -listen [port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vncviewer is a viewer (client) for Virtual Network
Computing. This manual page documents version 4 for the X
window system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run the viewer with no
arguments it will prompt you for a VNC server to connect to.
Alternatively, specify the VNC server as an argument,
e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vncviewer snoopy:2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &rsquo;snoopy&rsquo; is
the name of the machine, and &rsquo;2&rsquo; is the display
number of the VNC server on that machine. Either the machine
name or display number can be omitted. So for <br>
example &quot;:1&quot; means display number 1 on the same
machine, and &quot;snoopy&quot; means &quot;snoopy:0&quot;
i.e. display 0 on machine &quot;snoopy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the VNC server is
successfully contacted, you will be prompted for a password
to authenticate you. If the password is correct, a window
will appear showing the desktop of the <br>
VNC server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOMATIC PROTOCOL SELECTION
<br>
The viewer tests the speed of the connection to the server
and chooses the encoding and pixel format (color level)
appropriately. This makes it much easier to use than
previous <br>
versions where the user had to specify arcane command line
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The viewer normally starts out
assuming the link is slow, using the encoding with the best
compression. If it turns out that the link is fast enough it
switches to an encoding <br>
which compresses less but is faster to generate, thus
improving the interactive feel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The viewer normally starts in
full-color mode, but switches to low-color mode if the
bandwidth is insufficient. However, this only occurs when
communicating with servers support&acirc; <br>
ing protocol 3.8 or newer, since many old servers does not
support color mode changes safely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatic selection can be
turned off by setting the AutoSelect parameter to false, or
from the options dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POPUP MENU <br>
The viewer has a popup menu containing entries which perform
various actions. It is usually brought up by pressing F8,
but this can be configured with the MenuKey parameter. <br>
Actions which the popup menu can perform include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* switching in and out of
full-screen mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* quitting the viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* generating key events, e.g.
sending ctrl-alt-del</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* accessing the options dialog
and various other dialogs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, key presses in the
popup menu get sent to the VNC server and dismiss the popup.
So to get an F8 through to the VNC server simply press it
twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FULL SCREEN MODE <br>
A full-screen mode is supported. This is particularly useful
when connecting to a remote screen which is the same size as
your local one. If the remote screen is bigger, you can <br>
scroll by bumping the mouse against the edge of the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately this mode
doesn&rsquo;t work completely with all window managers,
since it breaks the X window management conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS (PARAMETERS) <br>
You can get a list of parameters by giving -h as a
command-line option to vncviewer. Parameters can be turned
on with -param or off with -param=0. Parameters which take a
value <br>
can be specified as -param value. Other valid forms are
param=value -param=value --param=value. Parameter names are
case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the parameters can also
be set graphically via the options dialog box. This can be
accessed from the popup menu or from the &quot;Connection
details&quot; dialog box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display Xdisplay <br>
Specifies the X display on which the VNC viewer window
should appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
Standard X position and sizing specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-listen [port] <br>
Causes vncviewer to listen on the given port (default 5500)
for reverse connections from a VNC server. WinVNC supports
reverse connections initiated using the &rsquo;Add New <br>
Client&rsquo; menu option or the &rsquo;-connect&rsquo;
command-line option. Xvnc supports reverse connections with
a helper program called vncconfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-passwd password-file,
-PasswordFile password-file <br>
If you are on a filesystem which gives you access to the
password file used by the server, you can specify it here to
avoid typing it in. It will usually be <br>
&quot;~/.vnc/passwd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DotWhenNoCursor <br>
Show the dot cursor when the server sends an invisible
cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PointerEventInterval <br>
Time in milliseconds to rate-limit successive pointer
events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ImprovedHextile <br>
Try harder to compress data (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-QualityLevel level <br>
JPEG quality level (default is 8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-NoJPEG <br>
Disable lossy JPEG compression in Tight encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CompressLevel level <br>
Use specified compression level (default is 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CustomCompressLevel level <br>
Use custom compression level. Default is CompressLevel is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SendPrimary <br>
Send the primary selection and cut buffer to the server as
well as the clipboard selection (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SendClipboard <br>
Send clipboard changes to the server (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-AcceptClipboard <br>
Accept clipboard changes from the server (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Shared <br>
When you make a connection to a VNC server, all other
existing connections are normally closed. This option
requests that they be left open, allowing you to share the
<br>
desktop with someone already using it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ViewOnly <br>
Specifies that no keyboard or mouse events should be sent to
the server. Useful if you want to view a desktop without
interfering; often needs to be combined with <br>
-Shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Maximize <br>
Maximize viewer window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FullScreen <br>
Start in full-screen mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FullScreenAllMonitors <br>
Enable full screen over all monitors (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FullscreenSystemKeys <br>
Pass special keys directly to the server in full-screen
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-RemoteResize <br>
Dynamically resize the remote desktop size as the size of
the local client window changes (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DesktopSize widthxheight <br>
Instead of keeping the existing remote screen size, the
client will attempt to switch to the specified since when
connecting. If the server does not support the
SetDesk&acirc; <br>
topSize message then the screen will retain the original
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-AutoSelect <br>
Use automatic selection of encoding and pixel format
(default is on). Normally the viewer tests the speed of the
connection to the server and chooses the encoding and <br>
pixel format appropriately. Turn it off with
-AutoSelect=0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FullColor, -FullColour <br>
Tells the VNC server to send full-color pixels in the best
format for this display. This is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-LowColorLevel, -LowColourLevel
level <br>
Selects the reduced color level to use on slow links. level
can range from 0 to 2, 0 meaning 8 colors, 1 meaning 64
colors (the default), 2 meaning 256 colors. Note that <br>
decision if reduced color level is used is made by
vncviewer. If you would like to force vncviewer to use
reduced color level use -AutoSelect=0 parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PreferredEncoding encoding <br>
This option specifies the preferred encoding to use from one
of &quot;Tight&quot;, &quot;ZRLE&quot;, &quot;hextile&quot;
or &quot;raw&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-UseLocalCursor <br>
Render the mouse cursor locally if the server supports it
(default is on). This can make the interactive performance
feel much better over slow links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-WMDecorationWidth w,
-WMDecorationHeight h <br>
The total width and height taken up by window manager
decorations. This is used to calculate the maximum size of
the VNC viewer window. Default is width 6, height 24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log logname:dest:level <br>
Configures the debug log settings. dest can currently be
stderr or stdout, and level is between 0 and 100, 100
meaning most verbose output. logname is usually * meaning
<br>
all, but you can target a specific source file if you know
the name of its &quot;LogWriter&quot;. Default is
*:stderr:30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MenuKey keysym-name <br>
This option specifies the key which brings up the popup
menu. The key is specified as an X11 keysym name (these can
be obtained by removing the XK_ prefix from the <br>
entries in &quot;/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h&quot; - the
currently implemented list is: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7,
F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, Pause, Print, Scroll_Lock, Escape,
<br>
Insert, Delete, Home, Page_Up, Page_Down). Default is
F8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-via gateway <br>
Automatically create encrypted TCP tunnel to the gateway
machine before connection, connect to the host through that
tunnel (TigerVNC-specific). By default, this option <br>
invokes SSH local port forwarding, assuming that SSH client
binary can be accessed as /usr/bin/ssh. Note that when using
the -via option, the host machine name should be <br>
specified as known to the gateway machine, e.g.
&quot;localhost&quot; denotes the gateway, not the machine
where vncviewer was launched. The environment variable
VNC_VIA_CMD can <br>
override the default tunnel command of /usr/bin/ssh -f -L
&quot;$L&quot;:&quot;$H&quot;:&quot;$R&quot; &quot;$G&quot;
sleep 20. The tunnel command is executed with the
environment variables L, H, R, and G taken <br>
the values of the local port number, the remote host, the
port number on the remote host, and the gateway machine
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ZlibLevel level <br>
Zlib compression level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x509crl file <br>
X509 CRL file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x509ca file <br>
X509 CA certificate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SecurityTypes types <br>
Specify which security scheme to use.</p>
