<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pssh &acirc; parallel ssh program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pssh [-vAiIP] [-h hosts_file] [-H [user@]host[:port]] [-l
user] [-p par] [-o outdir] [-e errdir] [-t timeout] [-O
options] [-x args] [-X arg] command ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pssh -I [-vAiIP] [-h hosts_file]
[-H [user@]host[:port]] [-l user] [-p par] [-o outdir] [-e
errdir] [-t timeout] [-O options] [-x args] [-X arg]
[command ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pssh is a program for executing ssh in parallel on a number
of hosts. It provides features such as sending input to all
of the processes, passing a password to ssh, saving
out&acirc; <br>
put to files, and timing out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PSSH_NODENUM and PSSH_HOST
environment variables are sent to the remote host. The
PSSH_NODENUM variable is assigned a unique number for each
ssh connection, starting with 0 <br>
and counting up. The PSSH_HOST variable is assigned the name
of the host as specified in the hosts list. Note that sshd
drops environment variables by default, so sshd_config <br>
on the remote host must include the line: <br>
AcceptEnv PSSH_NODENUM PSSH_HOST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h host_file <br>
--hosts host_file <br>
Read hosts from the given host_file. Lines in the host file
are of the form [user@]host[:port] and can include blank
lines and comments (lines beginning with &quot;#&quot;). If
<br>
multiple host files are given (the -h option is used more
than once), then pssh behaves as though these files were
concatenated together. If a host is specified multiple <br>
times, then pssh will connect the given number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H [user@]host[:port] <br>
--host [user@]host[:port] <br>
-H &quot;[user@]host[:port] [ [user@]host[:port ] ...
]&quot; <br>
--host &quot;[user@]host[:port] [ [user@]host[:port ] ...
]&quot; <br>
Add the given host strings to the list of hosts. This option
may be given multiple times, and may be used in conjunction
with the -h option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
--user user <br>
Use the given username as the default for any host entries
that don&rsquo;t specifically specify a user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p parallelism <br>
--par parallelism <br>
Use the given number as the maximum number of concurrent
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
--timeout timeout <br>
Make connections time out after the given number of seconds.
With a value of 0, pssh will not timeout any
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outdir <br>
--outdir outdir <br>
Save standard output to files in the given directory.
Filenames are of the form [user@]host[:port][.num] where the
user and port are only included for hosts that explic&acirc;
<br>
itly specify them. The number is a counter that is
incremented each time for hosts that are specified more than
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e errdir <br>
--errdir errdir <br>
Save standard error to files in the given directory.
Filenames are of the same form as with the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x args <br>
--extra-args args <br>
Passes extra SSH command-line arguments (see the ssh(1) man
page for more information about SSH arguments). This option
may be specified multiple times. The arguments <br>
are processed to split on whitespace, protect text within
quotes, and escape with backslashes. To pass arguments
without such processing, use the -X option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X arg <br>
--extra-arg arg <br>
Passes a single SSH command-line argument (see the ssh(1)
man page for more information about SSH arguments). Unlike
the -x option, no processing is performed on the <br>
argument, including word splitting. To pass multiple
command-line arguments, use the option once for each
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O options <br>
--options options <br>
SSH options in the format used in the SSH configuration file
(see the ssh_config(5) man page for more information). This
option may be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
--askpass <br>
Prompt for a password and pass it to ssh. The password may
be used for either to unlock a key or for password
authentication. The password is transferred in a fairly <br>
secure manner (e.g., it will not show up in argument lists).
However, be aware that a root user on your system could
potentially intercept the password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
--inline <br>
Display standard output and standard error as each host
completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inline-stdout <br>
Display standard output (but not standard error) as each
host completes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Include error messages from ssh with the -i and
&nbsp;options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I <br>
--send-input <br>
Read input and send to each ssh process. Since ssh allows a
command script to be sent on standard input, the -I option
may be used in lieu of the command argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
--print <br>
Display output as it arrives. This option is of limited
usefulness because output from different hosts are
interleaved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Connect to host1 and host2, and print &quot;hello,
world&quot; from each: <br>
pssh -i -H &quot;host1 host2&quot; echo &quot;hello,
world&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print &quot;hello, world&quot;
from each host specified in the file hosts.txt: <br>
pssh -i -h hosts.txt echo &quot;hello, world&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run a command as root with a
prompt for the root password: <br>
pssh -i -h hosts.txt -A -l root echo hi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run a long command without
timing out: <br>
pssh -i -h hosts.txt -t 0 sleep 10000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file hosts.txt has a
large number of entries, say 100, then the parallelism
option may also be set to 100 to ensure that the commands
are run concurrently: <br>
pssh -i -h hosts.txt -p 100 -t 0 sleep 10000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run a command without checking
or saving host keys: <br>
pssh -i -H host1 -H host2 -x &quot;-O
StrictHostKeyChecking=no -O UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -O
GlobalKnownHostsFile=/dev/null&quot; echo hi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the node number for each
connection (this will print 0, 1, and 2): <br>
pssh -i -H host1 -H host1 -H host2 &rsquo;echo
$PSSH_NODENUM&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIPS <br>
If you have a set of hosts that you connect to frequently
with specific options, it may be helpful to create an alias
such as: <br>
alias pssh_servers=&quot;pssh -h /path/to/server_list.txt -l
root -A&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when an ssh command is
terminated, it does not kill remote processes (OpenSSH bug
#396 has been open since 2002). One workaround is to
instruct ssh to allocate a <br>
pseudo-terminal, which makes it behave more like a normal
interactive ssh session. To do this, use pssh&rsquo;s
&quot;-x&quot; option to pass &quot;-tt&quot; to ssh. For
example: <br>
pssh -i -x &quot;-tt&quot; -h hosts.txt -t 10 sleep 1000
<br>
will ensure that all of the sleep commands will terminate
(with SIGHUP) after the 10 second timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ssh uses full
buffering for non-interactive commands. Line buffering may
be preferrable to full buffering if you intend to look at
the files in an output directory <br>
as a command is running. To switch ssh to use line
buffering, use its &quot;-tt&quot; option (which allocates a
pseudo-terminal) using the &quot;-x&quot; option in
pssh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ssh_config file can include
an arbitrary number of Host sections. Each host entry
specifies ssh options which apply only to the given host.
Host definitions can even behave <br>
like aliases if the HostName option is included. This ssh
feature, in combination with pssh host files, provides a
tremendous amount of flexibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status codes from pssh are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Success</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Miscellaneous error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Syntax or usage error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 At least one process was
killed by a signal or timed out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 All processes completed, but
at least one ssh process reported an error (exit status
255).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 There were no ssh errors, but
at least one remote command had a non-zero exit status.</p>
