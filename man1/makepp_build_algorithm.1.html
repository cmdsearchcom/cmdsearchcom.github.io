makepp_build_algorithm -- How makepp executes a makefile
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Makepp's internals differ from the standard Unix make in fundamental ways. This
  page describes the different philosophy in detail.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Reverse_vs._forward_inference"><a class="selflink" href="#Reverse_vs._forward_inference">Reverse
  vs. forward inference</a></h2>
Makepp works in the opposite direction from the standard Unix make. Traditional
  Unix make is given a target to build, and then it finds a rule which matches
  the characters in the target filename. If the target is older than any of its
  dependencies of the rule, then it is rebuilt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, consider this pattern rule:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    %.o: %.cxx
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When make realizes it needs to make a file called &quot;xyz.o&quot;, it searches
  through its list of pattern rules until it sees that &quot;xyz.o&quot; matches
  the pattern &quot;%.o&quot;, and then it applies this rule.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp works in the opposite direction. It first computes all files that it can
  possibly build by applying rules that match the characters in the dependency
  filenames. Then when it needs to build a file, it simply looks to see if it's
  one of the files that it knows how to build. The list of known files is stored
  based on the absolute filename.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When makepp encounters the above pattern rule, it searches for all files in the
  directory matching the pattern &quot;%.cxx&quot; (i.e., &quot;*.cxx&quot;).
  For each of these files, it then remembers that it can produce the
  corresponding &quot;.o&quot; file. If subsequently makepp discovers that it
  can make another &quot;.cxx&quot; file that doesn't currently exist, this rule
  will also be applied and the corresponding &quot;.o&quot; file will be marked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This might seem somewhat inefficient, but it turns out not to be that slow in
  most cases, and it is often true that virtually all the files that can be
  built are in fact built. And knowing the complete list of files that can be
  built has several advantages:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Wildcards can match files which don't exist yet but can be
      built.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Header files which have been detected by the automatic
      dependency scanner don't have to exist; makepp knows where they will be.
      (Most other solutions to this problem assume that any headers which don't
      exist yet are in the current directory.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Repositories are much simpler to implement since makepp
      knows beforehand what files it can make. (See makepp_repositories for
      details.)</dd>

  vs. textual patterns</a></h2>
Makepp associates build commands with a target file, not to a textual pattern
  for a filename. It is therefore not confused by different names for the same
  file. Thus, for example, makepp will know that &quot;./xyz&quot; and and
  &quot;xyz&quot; are the same file, whereas other make utilities may not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is particularly important because (unlike the standard make) makepp loads
  makefiles from different directories. In order for the makefiles to be
  relatively independent, with no special position given to a top-level
  makefile, each makefile refers to all files relative to its own directory.
  Thus if you load a makefile from the subdirectory &quot;other_stuff&quot;, and
  that makefile refers to &quot;../xyz&quot;, makepp will again realize that
  it's the same file referred to above. (It also won't be confused by
  soft-linked directory names.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Stored_build_information"><a class="selflink" href="#Stored_build_information">Stored
  build information</a></h2>
Makepp stores much more information about each file that it builds beyond just
  the date stamp (which is all that the standard make cares about). This
  information includes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The signature of this file on the last build, so we know if
      the file itself has changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The names of each dependency file, including include files
      and other files inferred automatically. If this list changes, then makepp
      assumes it needs to rebuild.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The signature of each dependency. This way, makepp knows to
      rebuild not only when the dependencies are newer than the target, but when
      they change at all. This also makes it possible to use other kinds of
      signatures, such as cryptographic checksums, rather than the file
    date.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The entire build command (and its cwd). This way if you
      change the build command (e.g., change the compiler options), makepp knows
      to rebuild even if the files themselves haven't changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The architecture. If you have compiled your program on
      Linux and then switch to Solaris, makepp automatically knows to recompile
      everything.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp makes a subdirectory in every directory that it touches called
  &quot;.makepp&quot;. The build information for a file <i>filename</i> in a
  directory is stored in <i>.makepp/filename</i>. If you delete this
  subdirectory or alter the files, makepp will rebuild all affected files.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Implicit_loading"><a class="selflink" href="#Implicit_loading">Implicit
  loading</a></h2>
If makepp is trying to build a target in a directory and doesn't have a rule for
  it yet, or if it is looking for files matching a wildcard in a directory, it
  will look in that directory to see if a makefile is present. If so, the
  makefile will be loaded automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means that you usually don't have to tell makepp explicitly where to find
  makefiles--all you have to do is to reference a file in another directory, and
  makepp will automatically figure out how to build it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Implicit loading will occur only if the directory is writable to you. Thus if
  you want to prevent makepp from trying to build a bunch of things that never
  change, simply make the directory read-only.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Implicit loading will not occur if you are in a tree under a
  <i>RootMakeppfile(.mk)</i> and the other makefile is outside that tree. If you
  do want this once, you can give a &quot;--do-build=/&quot; option to makepp,
  to make everything outside the tree buildable. If you always want this, you
  can put a &quot;load_makefile&quot; statement somewhere within the tree to
  explicitly connect it to the tree.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If implicit loading gets in your way (i.e., makepp loads too many makefiles and
  it wastes time, or else you really don't want it to try to rebuild all the
  stuff described in the makefiles), you can turn it off for all directories
  using the &quot;--noimplicit_load&quot; command line option, or you can turn
  it off for selected directories using the &quot;no_implicit_load&quot;
  statement in your makefile.</div>
