<p>MAKEPP_BUILD_ALGORITHM(1) Makepp
MAKEPP_BUILD_ALGORITHM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_build_algorithm -- How makepp executes a makefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Makepp&rsquo;s internals differ from the standard Unix make
in fundamental ways. This page describes the different
philosophy in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reverse vs. forward inference
<br>
Makepp works in the opposite direction from the standard
Unix make. Traditional Unix make is given a target to build,
and then it finds a rule which matches the characters in
<br>
the target filename. If the target is older than any of its
dependencies of the rule, then it is rebuilt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, consider this
pattern rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.o: %.cxx <br>
$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When make realizes it needs to
make a file called &quot;xyz.o&quot;, it searches through
its list of pattern rules until it sees that
&quot;xyz.o&quot; matches the pattern &quot;%.o&quot;, and
then it applies <br>
this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp works in the opposite
direction. It first computes all files that it can possibly
build by applying rules that match the characters in the
dependency filenames. Then <br>
when it needs to build a file, it simply looks to see if
it&rsquo;s one of the files that it knows how to build. The
list of known files is stored based on the absolute
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When makepp encounters the above
pattern rule, it searches for all files in the directory
matching the pattern &quot;%.cxx&quot; (i.e.,
&quot;*.cxx&quot;). For each of these files, it then <br>
remembers that it can produce the corresponding
&quot;.o&quot; file. If subsequently makepp discovers that
it can make another &quot;.cxx&quot; file that doesn&rsquo;t
currently exist, this rule will <br>
also be applied and the corresponding &quot;.o&quot; file
will be marked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This might seem somewhat
inefficient, but it turns out not to be that slow in most
cases, and it is often true that virtually all the files
that can be built are in fact built. <br>
And knowing the complete list of files that can be built has
several advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Wildcards can
match files which don&rsquo;t exist yet but can be
built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Header files
which have been detected by the automatic dependency scanner
don&rsquo;t have to exist; makepp knows where they will be.
(Most other solutions to this problem assume <br>
that any headers which don&rsquo;t exist yet are in the
current directory.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Repositories are
much simpler to implement since makepp knows beforehand what
files it can make. (See makepp_repositories for
details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is possible
to determine easily which files can be built (see the
&quot;$(only_targets )&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Makepp&rsquo;s
&quot;$(infer_objects)&quot; function is greatly simplified
by knowing what objects are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files vs. textual patterns <br>
Makepp associates build commands with a target file, not to
a textual pattern for a filename. It is therefore not
confused by different names for the same file. Thus, for
<br>
example, makepp will know that &quot;./xyz&quot; and and
&quot;xyz&quot; are the same file, whereas other make
utilities may not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is particularly important
because (unlike the standard make) makepp loads makefiles
from different directories. In order for the makefiles to be
relatively independent, <br>
with no special position given to a top-level makefile, each
makefile refers to all files relative to its own directory.
Thus if you load a makefile from the subdirectory <br>
&quot;other_stuff&quot;, and that makefile refers to
&quot;../xyz&quot;, makepp will again realize that
it&rsquo;s the same file referred to above. (It also
won&rsquo;t be confused by soft-linked directory <br>
names.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stored build information <br>
Makepp stores much more information about each file that it
builds beyond just the date stamp (which is all that the
standard make cares about). This information includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature of
this file on the last build, so we know if the file itself
has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The names of
each dependency file, including include files and other
files inferred automatically. If this list changes, then
makepp assumes it needs to rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The signature of
each dependency. This way, makepp knows to rebuild not only
when the dependencies are newer than the target, but when
they change at all. This also makes <br>
it possible to use other kinds of signatures, such as
cryptographic checksums, rather than the file date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The entire build
command (and its cwd). This way if you change the build
command (e.g., change the compiler options), makepp knows to
rebuild even if the files themselves <br>
haven&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
architecture. If you have compiled your program on Linux and
then switch to Solaris, makepp automatically knows to
recompile everything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp makes a subdirectory in
every directory that it touches called &quot;.makepp&quot;.
The build information for a file filename in a directory is
stored in .makepp/filename. If you <br>
delete this subdirectory or alter the files, makepp will
rebuild all affected files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicit loading <br>
If makepp is trying to build a target in a directory and
doesn&rsquo;t have a rule for it yet, or if it is looking
for files matching a wildcard in a directory, it will look
in that <br>
directory to see if a makefile is present. If so, the
makefile will be loaded automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that you usually
don&rsquo;t have to tell makepp explicitly where to find
makefiles--all you have to do is to reference a file in
another directory, and makepp will <br>
automatically figure out how to build it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicit loading will occur only
if the directory is writable to you. Thus if you want to
prevent makepp from trying to build a bunch of things that
never change, simply make <br>
the directory read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicit loading will not occur
if you are in a tree under a RootMakeppfile(.mk) and the
other makefile is outside that tree. If you do want this
once, you can give a <br>
&quot;--do-build=/&quot; option to makepp, to make
everything outside the tree buildable. If you always want
this, you can put a &quot;load_makefile&quot; statement
somewhere within the tree to <br>
explicitly connect it to the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If implicit loading gets in your
way (i.e., makepp loads too many makefiles and it wastes
time, or else you really don&rsquo;t want it to try to
rebuild all the stuff described in the <br>
makefiles), you can turn it off for all directories using
the &quot;--noimplicit_load&quot; command line option, or
you can turn it off for selected directories using the <br>
&quot;no_implicit_load&quot; statement in your makefile.</p>
