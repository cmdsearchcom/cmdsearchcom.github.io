make-kpkg - build Debian kernel packages from Linux kernel sources
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>make-kpkg</b> [<i>options</i>] [<i>target</i> [<i>target</i> ...]]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual page explains the Debian <b>make-kpkg</b> utility, which is used to
  create the kernel related Debian packages. This utility needs to be run from a
  top level Linux kernel source directory, which has been previously configured
  (unless you are using the configure target). Normally, if kernel-package does
  not find a <i>.config</i> file in the current directory, it tries very hard to
  get an appropriate one (usually a config file already tailored for Debian
  kernels for that architecture), and then calls <b>make oldconfig</b> to let
  the user answer any new questions. However, this might still result in an
  inappropriate configuration, you are encouraged to configure the kernel by the
  usual means before invoking <b>make-kpkg</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typically, <b>make-kpkg</b> should be run under <b>fakeroot</b>,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
make-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot kernel_image
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
but instead you run this command as root (this is not recommended), or under
  <b>fakeroot</b>, or tell <b>make-kpkg</b> how to become root (not recommended
  either, <b>fakeroot</b> is perhaps the safest option), like so:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
make-kpkg --rootcmd sudo kernel_image
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The Debian package file is created in the parent directory of the kernel source
  directory where this command is run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also, please note that some versions of gcc do not interact well with the kernel
  source. You may control which version of gcc used in kernel compilation by
  setting the Makefile variables CC and HOSTCC in the top level kernel Makefile.
  You can do this simply by setting the environment variable <b>MAKEFLAGS</b>.
  To observe, try:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 % KBUILD_VERBOSE=1 MAKEFLAGS=&quot;CC=gcc-4.4&quot; make-kpkg configure
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please note that the kernel Makefile might pay attention to other variables (for
  instance <b>KCFLAGS</b> ). This can be addressed like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 % KBUILD_VERBOSE=1 MAKEFLAGS='CC=gcc-4.4 KCFLAGS=&quot;-march=athlon64&quot;'
  make-kpkg configure
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>KBUILD_VERBOSE</b> shows the details of the commands being run. (please
  see the top level kernel Makefile for variables that can be set).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>WARNING</b>: Do NOT set the -j option in MAKEFLAGS directly, this shall cause
  the build to fail. Use CONCURRENCY_LEVEL as specified below. There is also a
  -j flag that can be used.

      <i>/etc/kernel/prerm.d/&lt;VERSION&gt;/</i>, and
      <i>/etc/kernel/postrm.d/&lt;VERSION&gt;/</i>. If they exists, the
      kernel-image package shall run a <b>run-parts</b> program over the
      directory (including the versioned one), giving the version being
      installed or removed as an argument, in the corresponding phase of
      installation or removal. Before calling these scripts, the env variable
      <b>STEM</b> shall be set to the value of the <i>--stem</i> argument (or
      the default value, linux), and the variable <b>KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION</b>
      shall be set to the version of the kernel-package that created the
      package. These scripts shall be called with two arguments, the first being
      the <i>version</i> of the kernel image, and the second argument being the
      <i>location</i> of the kernel image itself. Since debconf is in use before
      the script is called, this script should issue no diagnostic messages to
      stdout -- while the postinst does call <b>db_stop</b>, debconf does not
      restore stdout, so messages to stdout disappear.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">On installation, it also offers to run the Linux loader,
      <i>LILO</i> (or alternates like <i>loadlin</i>, <i>SILO</i>, <i>QUIK</i>,
      <i>VMELILO</i>, <i>ZIPL</i>, <i>yaboot</i>, <i>PALO</i> or <i>GRUB</i>),
      creating a configuration file for supported boot loaders if needed. At
      that time it also offers to put the new kernel on a floppy, formatting the
      floppy if needed. On deletion, the package checks the version of the
      kernel running, and refuses to delete a running kernel. <i>grub</i> rates
      a special mention here, since grub may not need to be rerun after
      installing a kernel image, though an automated change to the menu list
      would be nice on install and removal of kernel image packages.</dd>

      compiled for at the same time you build your kernel image. This target
      expects to find the modules or packages under /usr/src/modules, and, for
      all such directories, changes to MODULE_LOC/x (MODULE_LOC defaults to
      <i>/usr/src/modules</i>), and runs the <b>kdist</b> rule in the local
      <i>debian.rules</i> file. This target should create the <b>Debian</b>
      module package(s), and may also produce a compressed tar file, and a
      compressed diff file, with <i>md5sums</i> recorded in a changes file using
      <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>. The file is signed by the same identity that would

<b>KPKG_DEBUG</b>, if set, causes make-kpkg to spit out debugging messages about
  some shell functions executed internally. This is probably of not interest to
  anyone not debugging <b>make-kpkg</b>. The following variables (documented

Apart from the runtime options, the <i>debian.rules</i> file run by
  <b>make-kpkg</b> also looks for a per user configuration file
  <i>~/.kernel-pkg.conf</i>. Failing that, it looks for site-wide defaults in
  the file <i>/etc/kernel-pkg.conf</i>. The default configuration allows there
  to be a site wide override for the full name and email address of the person
  responsible for maintaining the kernel packages on the site, but the
  <i>/etc/kernel-pkg.conf</i> (or <i>~/.kernel-pkg.conf</i>) file is actually a
  Makefile snippet, and any legal make directives may be included in there.
  <b>Note</b>: Caution is urged with this file, since you can totally change the
  way that the make is run by suitably editing this file. Please look at
  <i>/usr/share/doc/kernel-package/Problems.gz</i> for a list of known problems
  while compiling kernel images. Extensive tutorial like documentation is also
  available in <i>/usr/share/doc/kernel-package/README.gz</i> and it is
  recommended that one read that before using this utility.
