<p>MAKE-KPKG(1) Debian GNU/Linux manual MAKE-KPKG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
make-kpkg - build Debian kernel packages from Linux kernel
sources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
make-kpkg [options] [target [target ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page explains the Debian make-kpkg utility,
which is used to create the kernel related Debian packages.
This utility needs to be run from a top level Linux kernel
<br>
source directory, which has been previously configured
(unless you are using the configure target). Normally, if
kernel-package does not find a .config file in the current
direc&acirc; <br>
tory, it tries very hard to get an appropriate one (usually
a config file already tailored for Debian kernels for that
architecture), and then calls make oldconfig to let the <br>
user answer any new questions. However, this might still
result in an inappropriate configuration, you are encouraged
to configure the kernel by the usual means before invoking
<br>
make-kpkg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically, make-kpkg should be
run under fakeroot,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make-kpkg --rootcmd fakeroot
kernel_image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but instead you run this command
as root (this is not recommended), or under fakeroot, or
tell make-kpkg how to become root (not recommended either,
fakeroot is perhaps the <br>
safest option), like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make-kpkg --rootcmd sudo
kernel_image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Debian package file is
created in the parent directory of the kernel source
directory where this command is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, please note that some
versions of gcc do not interact well with the kernel source.
You may control which version of gcc used in kernel
compilation by setting the Makefile <br>
variables CC and HOSTCC in the top level kernel Makefile.
You can do this simply by setting the environment variable
MAKEFLAGS. To observe, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% KBUILD_VERBOSE=1
MAKEFLAGS=&quot;CC=gcc-4.4&quot; make-kpkg configure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that the kernel
Makefile might pay attention to other variables (for
instance KCFLAGS ). This can be addressed like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% KBUILD_VERBOSE=1
MAKEFLAGS=&rsquo;CC=gcc-4.4
KCFLAGS=&quot;-march=athlon64&quot;&rsquo; make-kpkg
configure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The KBUILD_VERBOSE shows the
details of the commands being run. (please see the top level
kernel Makefile for variables that can be set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Do NOT set the -j
option in MAKEFLAGS directly, this shall cause the build to
fail. Use CONCURRENCY_LEVEL as specified below. There is
also a -j flag that can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help Print out a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--revision number <br>
Changes the version number for the packages produced to the
argument number. This has certain constraints: the version
must start with a digit. the version may contain <br>
only alphanumerics and the characters ~ + . (tilde, full
stop and plus) and must contain a digit. (Look at the Policy
manual for details). Optionally, you may prepend the <br>
revision with a digit followed by a colon (:). The default
is 10.00.Custom unless the environment variable
DEBIAN_REVISION_MANDATORY is set, in which case an error is
gen&acirc; <br>
erated if the revision is not set on the command line or the
configuration file. Hint: You may set it to
$(version)-&lt;foo&gt; in the configuration file to get the
upstream <br>
version number prepended to your custom string
&lt;foo&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append-to-version foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--append_to_version foo <br>
This argument (foo) is appended to the value of the
EXTRAVERSION variable present in the kernel Makefile. Since
EXTRAVERSION is a component of the kernel version, it is
<br>
also added to the Debian package name, and, as such must
obey the policy governing the package name. That means it
may contain only lowercase alphanumerics and the
charac&acirc; <br>
ters ~ - + . (tilde, full stop, hyphen, and plus). Uppercase
letters are not permitted under the Policy for a new
package. If the environment variable IGNORE_UPPER&acirc;
<br>
CASE_VERSION is set, make-kpkg shall lower case version
numbers set in the Makefile or in the localversion file.
This option overrides the environment variable <br>
APPEND_TO_VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--added-modules foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--added_modules foo <br>
The argument should be a comma separated list of additional
add-on modules (not in the main kernel tree) that you wish
to build when you invoke the modules_blah targets. <br>
You may give full path names of the directory the modules
reside in, or just the module name if it can be found in
MODULE_LOC, which defaults to /usr/src/modules. The <br>
default is that all modules in MODULE_LOC, are compiled when
the modules_blah targets are invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch foo <br>
This is useful for setting the architecture when you are
cross compiling. If you are not cross compiling, the
architecture is determined automatically. The same effect
can <br>
be achieved by setting the environment variable KPKG_ARCH.
The value should be whatever DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU contains when
dpkg-architecture is run on the target machine, or <br>
it can be another architecture in a multi-arch set (like
i386/amd64).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cross-compile foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cross_compile foo <br>
This is useful for setting the target string when you are
cross compiling. Use the dummy target &quot;-&quot; if you
are building for other arches of a multiarch set, like <br>
i386/amd64. The same effect can be achieved by setting the
environment variable. Please note that this does not in any
way set the compiler the kernel build process shall <br>
use; if the default compiler that the build process comes up
with is not the one desired, please explicitly specify the
compiler that should be used. CROSS_COMPILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--subarch foo <br>
Some architectures (the Alpha, and the m68k) require a
different kernel for each sub-architecture. This option
provides a way of specifying it as an argument to make-kpkg.
<br>
Please note that additional support for sub-architectures
may be required in the kernel sources to actually make this
do anything. The same effect can be achieved by set&acirc;
<br>
ting the environment variable KPKG_SUBARCH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch-in-name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch_in_name <br>
This option uses an extended name for the kernel image
package by embedding the sub-architecture in the image name,
so one could write a script to create multiple <br>
sub-architectures one after the other. You may also do this
by setting the environment variable ARCH_IN_NAME. Please
note that only the package name is affected, not mod&acirc;
<br>
ules locations etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgpsign name <br>
Set the string used to sign the changes file for any
external modules in /usr/src/modules/ using PGP. This option
will override the builtin default and the site wide
cus&acirc; <br>
tomizations stored in the file /etc/kernel-pkg.conf or
~/.kernel-pkg.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config target <br>
Change the type of configure done from the default
oldconfig. target must be one of oldconfig, config,
menuconfig, gconfig, nconfig, xconfig, randconfig,
defconfig, <br>
allmodconfig, allyesconfig, allnoconfig, old, menu, g, or
x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note however that make-kpkg
scans the config file at start up for some options, notably
the fact that modules are enabled or not, so toggling the
status during the delayed <br>
configuration results in an error. If needed, create the
configuration file as close to the desired one before
calling make-kpkg with this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--targets <br>
Prints out a list of known targets. See the Section Targets
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noexec <br>
Pass a -n option to the make process so that commands are
merely printed to the screen but not actually executed. This
is very useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
This calls make with the -V=1 option, which calls out the
top level Make commands, also useful in seeing what is
happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--initrd <br>
If make-kpkg is generating a kernel-image package, arrange
to convey to the hook scripts run from the post installation
maintainer scripts that this image requires an ini&acirc;
<br>
trd, and that the initrd generation hook scripts should not
short circuit early. Without this option, the example
initramfs hook scripts bundled in with kernel-package <br>
will take no action on installation. The same effect can be
achieved by setting the environment variable INITRD to any
non empty value. Please note that unless there are <br>
hook scripts in /etc/kernel or added into the hook script
parameter of /etc/kernel-img.conf, no initrd will be created
(the bundled in example scripts are just examples -- <br>
user action is required before anything happens). On most
systems, however initramfs-tools installs scripts (since
version 0.94 (and they have respected the INITRD vari&acirc;
<br>
able since 0.98)). dracut also does this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jobs number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j number <br>
Set the environment variable CONCURRENCY_LEVEL to
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overlay-dir /path/to/directory
<br>
The specified directory should contain files that will be
placed in the ./debian directory of the kernel sources, in
preparation to building the debian packages. The files <br>
will replace anything in /usr/share/kernel-package that
would normally be placed there, and it is up to the user to
make sure that the files in the overlay directory are <br>
compatible with make-kpkg. If you break make-kpkg with an
overlay file, you get to keep the pieces. The same effect
can be achieved by setting the environment variable <br>
KPKG_OVERLAY_DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that
overlay-dir/Control and overlay-dir/changelog are special,
and variable substitution is performed on these files. Use
/usr/share/kernel-package/Control <br>
and /usr/share/kernel-package/changelog files as
templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a overlay-dir/post-install
executable (or executable script) exists, it shall be run
immediately after ./debian is populated. The script shall be
executed in the <br>
./debian directory. This can be used, for instance, to
delete files the user does not want, or to take actions
other than simple replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rootcmd foo <br>
The command that provides a means of gaining super user
access (for example, &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; or
&lsquo;fakeroot&rsquo;) as needed by
dpkg-buildpackage&rsquo;s -r option. This option does not
work <br>
for three of the targets, namely, binary, binary-indep, and
binary-arch. For those targets the entire make-kpkg command
must be run as (fake)root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stem foo <br>
Call the packages foo-* instead of kernel-*. This is useful
in helping transition from calling the packages kernel-* to
linux-* packages, in preparation for non-linux ker&acirc;
<br>
nels in the distribution. The default is linux. The stem,
since it is the initial part of a package name must consist
only of lower case letters (&lsquo;a-z&rsquo;), digits
(&lsquo;0-9&rsquo;), <br>
plus (&lsquo;+&rsquo;) and minus (&lsquo;-&rsquo;) signs,
and periods (&lsquo;.&rsquo;). It must be at least two
characters long and must start with an alphanumeric
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--us This option is passed to
dpkg-buildpackage, and directs that package not to sign the
source. This is only relevant for the buildpackage
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uc This option is passed to
dpkg-buildpackage, and directs that package not to sign the
changelog. This is only relevant for the buildpackage
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options maybe shortened to
the smallest unique string, and may be entered with either a
- or a -- prefix, and you may use a space or an = symbol
between an option string and <br>
a value. You may also use the form option=value; for details
these and other variant forms supported, please read
Getopt::Long(3perl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCURRENCY_LEVEL <br>
If defined, this environment variable sets the concurrency
level of make used to compile the kernel and the modules set
using -j flags to the sub make in the build target <br>
of make-kpkg. Should be a (small) integer, if used. You can
get the current number of CPUs using the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep -c &rsquo;^processor&rsquo;
/proc/cpuinfo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Do NOT set the -j
option in MAKEFLAGS directly, this shall call the build to
fail. It is possible to set -j as a make-kpkg argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGETS <br>
clean Cleans the kernel source directory of all files
created by target build, and runs a make distclean. (Please
look at a Linux kernel Makefile for details). Please note
that <br>
although we take care of the list of current kernel
configuration contained in the file .config, the file
include/linux/autoconf.h is not preserved. This target
should not <br>
be combined with other targets, since make-kpkg reads in all
data before running any target, so the subsequent targets
shall be run with the old data, which may not be <br>
what you want. Please note that by default the clean target
is not run as root, whic works fine of the command fakeroot
was used. However, if previously the build was done <br>
using sudo, you need to run make-kpkgclean also under
sudo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buildpackage <br>
This target runs the targets clean, and binary, and produces
the complete package using dpkg-buildpackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary This target produces all
four Debian kernel packages by running the targets
binary-indep and binary-arch. However, this requires
make-kpkg to be run as root (or fake&acirc; <br>
root), since --rootcmd will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary-indep <br>
This target produces the arch independent packages by
running the targets kernel_source, kernel_manual and
kernel_doc. However, this also requires make-kpkg to be run
as <br>
root (or fakeroot), since --rootcmd will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary-arch <br>
This target produces the arch dependent packages by running
the targets kernel_headers and kernel_image. However, this
also requires make-kpkg to be run as root (or fake&acirc;
<br>
root), since --rootcmd will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_source <br>
This target produces a debianised package of the Linux
kernel sources. If the environment variable
SOURCE_CLEAN_HOOK points to an executable, then that
executable shall <br>
be run from the temporary (top) directory of the kernel
sources just before packaging it,
./debian/tmp-source/usr/src/kernel-source-X.X.XX, so people
may take any action <br>
they see fit (remove arch trees, prune version control
directories, find . -type d -name CVS -prune -exec rm -rf {}
; etc.). This has no effect on anything other than the <br>
kernel sources that are being packaged -- if the script
operates on the current directory and its children, the
original source tree should remain intact. The environment
<br>
variables HEADER_CLEAN_HOOK and DOC_CLEAN_HOOK are similar.
They should point to executables, then that executable shall
be run from the temporary (top) directory of the <br>
kernel headers and documentation just before packaging
respectively, so people may take any action they see fit.
This also has no effect on anything other than the sources
<br>
that are being packaged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_debug <br>
This target produces a Debian package containing the
debugging symbols for the modules contained in the
corresponding image package. The basic idea here is to keep
the <br>
space in /lib/modules/&lt;kver&gt; under control, since this
could be on a root partition with space restrictions. Please
note that if module signatures are enable in the kernel <br>
configuration the corresponding image package will not have
modules with the debugging link pointing to these debugging
symbol files. In order to turn on debugging links <br>
for modules in the image package you need to turn off module
signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_headers <br>
This target produces a Debian package containing the header
files included in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_manual <br>
This target produces a Debian package containing the section
9 manual pages included in the Linux kernel. Please note
that this is not really an independent target; call&acirc;
<br>
ing this shall also invoke the kernel_doc target, and
creates a kernel-doc package at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_doc <br>
This target produces a Debian package containing the
documentation included in the Linux kernel. This can be
called independently of the kernel_manual target, but not
the <br>
other way around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel_image <br>
This target produces a Debian package of the Linux kernel
source image, and any modules configured in the kernel
configuration file .config. If there is no .config file <br>
in the kernel source directory, a default configuration is
provided similar to the one used to create the Debian
boot-floppies. If the kernel configuration file has <br>
enabled support for modules, modules will be created and
installed. If module signatures are not enabled, the
resulting modules will have a link to the location of the
<br>
debugging symbols file for the module, usually installed by
the debug package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file
./debian/post-install exists, and is an executable, it is
run just before the kernel image package is created. Also,
please note that if there are any scripts <br>
in ./debian/image.d/ directory, run-parts shall be called on
that directory just before the kernel image package is
built. The location of the root of the image package <br>
being built shall be passed in the environment variable
IMAGE_TOP, and the kernel version is passed in through the
environment variable version for all these scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please see the documentation
about hooks in kernel-img.conf(5). These hooks are variables
that can be pointed by the local sysadmin to scripts that
add or remove a line <br>
from the grub menu list at kernel image install and remove
times. A sample script to add lines to a grub menu file is
included in the directory /usr/share/doc/kernel-pack&acirc;
<br>
age/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from hook variables that
the local admin may set, there are a set of directories
where packages, or the local admin, may drop in script
files. The directories are <br>
/etc/kernel/preinst.d/, /etc/kernel/postinst.d/,
/etc/kernel/prerm.d/, /etc/kernel/postrm.d/,
/etc/kernel/preinst.d/&lt;VERSION&gt;/,
/etc/kernel/postinst.d/&lt;VERSION&gt;/, <br>
/etc/kernel/prerm.d/&lt;VERSION&gt;/, and
/etc/kernel/postrm.d/&lt;VERSION&gt;/. If they exists, the
kernel-image package shall run a run-parts program over the
directory (including <br>
the versioned one), giving the version being installed or
removed as an argument, in the corresponding phase of
installation or removal. Before calling these scripts, the
<br>
env variable STEM shall be set to the value of the --stem
argument (or the default value, linux), and the variable
KERNEL_PACKAGE_VERSION shall be set to the version of <br>
the kernel-package that created the package. These scripts
shall be called with two arguments, the first being the
version of the kernel image, and the second argument <br>
being the location of the kernel image itself. Since debconf
is in use before the script is called, this script should
issue no diagnostic messages to stdout -- while the <br>
postinst does call db_stop, debconf does not restore stdout,
so messages to stdout disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On installation, it also offers
to run the Linux loader, LILO (or alternates like loadlin,
SILO, QUIK, VMELILO, ZIPL, yaboot, PALO or GRUB), creating a
configuration file <br>
for supported boot loaders if needed. At that time it also
offers to put the new kernel on a floppy, formatting the
floppy if needed. On deletion, the package checks the <br>
version of the kernel running, and refuses to delete a
running kernel. grub rates a special mention here, since
grub may not need to be rerun after installing a kernel <br>
image, though an automated change to the menu list would be
nice on install and removal of kernel image packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">build This target, used by
target kernel_image above, compiles the Linux kernel
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules <br>
This target allows you to build all add-on modules and
packages that are very dependent on the precise kernel
version they are compiled for at the same time you build
your <br>
kernel image. This target expects to find the modules or
packages under /usr/src/modules, and, for all such
directories, changes to MODULE_LOC/x (MODULE_LOC defaults to
<br>
/usr/src/modules), and runs the kdist rule in the local
debian.rules file. This target should create the Debian
module package(s), and may also produce a compressed tar
<br>
file, and a compressed diff file, with md5sums recorded in a
changes file using dpkg-genchanges. The file is signed by
the same identity that would be used to sign the <br>
kernel packages. This option is used by maintainers
uploading the package to the Debian archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules_config <br>
This target allows you to configure all packages under
MODULE_LOC, which defaults to /usr/src/modules. This is
useful if you need to manually modify some aspects of the
<br>
configuration, or if you want to manually compile the add on
modules. This should not be called unless you already have a
./debian directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules_image <br>
This target allows you to build all packages under
MODULE_LOC, which defaults to /usr/src/modules, but does not
create the source or diff files, and does not create and
<br>
sign a changes file. This is the only modules related option
you need if you just want to compile the add on modules
image files for installation on one or more machines. <br>
Generally called in conjunction with kernel_image,
especially if also using the option append_to_version
(prevents spurious warnings). This should not be called
unless <br>
you already have a ./debian directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules_clean <br>
This target allows you to clean all packages under
MODULE_LOC, which defaults to /usr/src/modules, and this
should be all that is needed to undo the effect of any of
the <br>
other modules_ targets. This should not be called unless you
already have a ./debian directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">configure <br>
This target runs configure (actually, config_target, set by
--config which defaults to oldconfig) early, so you may edit
files generated by make config in the kernel <br>
source directory and not have them stomped by make-kpkg
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debian This target creates the
./debian directory, and optionally patches the source. This
target is called by the configure target. You may use this
target to have the sources <br>
patched, and then manually run the configuration step to
update the configuration file, with any new configuration
options the patches may have introduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libc-kheaders <br>
This is a special target for the libc-dev maintainer, who
can use it to create the headers package that libc needs.
Please note that it is dangerous to create a <br>
libc-kheaders package that is different from the headers
libc was compiled with; it is known to subtly break systems.
Please look at /usr/share/kernel-package/README.head&acirc;
<br>
ers for details. Creating and installing a self created
libc-kheaders package may break your system unless you know
what you are doing. You have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
KPKG_DEBUG, if set, causes make-kpkg to spit out debugging
messages about some shell functions executed internally.
This is probably of not interest to anyone not debugging
<br>
make-kpkg. The following variables (documented above) also
affect make-kpkg: DEBIAN_REVISION_MANDATORY,
APPEND_TO_VERSION, VERSION_H_OK, KPKG_ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE,
KPKG_SUBARCH, <br>
KPKG_OVERLAY_DIR, ARCH_IN_NAME, INITRD, SOURCE_CLEAN_HOOK,
MODULE_LOC, CONCURRENCY_LEVEL and
IGNORE_UPPERCASE_VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Apart from the runtime options, the debian.rules file run by
make-kpkg also looks for a per user configuration file
~/.kernel-pkg.conf. Failing that, it looks for site-wide
<br>
defaults in the file /etc/kernel-pkg.conf. The default
configuration allows there to be a site wide override for
the full name and email address of the person responsible
for <br>
maintaining the kernel packages on the site, but the
/etc/kernel-pkg.conf (or ~/.kernel-pkg.conf) file is
actually a Makefile snippet, and any legal make directives
may be <br>
included in there. Note: Caution is urged with this file,
since you can totally change the way that the make is run by
suitably editing this file. Please look at <br>
/usr/share/doc/kernel-package/Problems.gz for a list of
known problems while compiling kernel images. Extensive
tutorial like documentation is also available in <br>
/usr/share/doc/kernel-package/README.gz and it is
recommended that one read that before using this
utility.</p>
