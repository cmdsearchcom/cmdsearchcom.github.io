<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gifshuffle - GIF colourmap steganography program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gifshuffle [ -CQS1 ] [ -p passwd ] [ -f file | -m message ]
[ infile.gif [ outfile.gif ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gifshuffle is a program for concealing messages in GIF
images by shuffling the colourmap. A shuffled image is
visibly indistinguishable from the original. gifshuffle
works with <br>
all GIF images, including those with transparency and
animation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider a pack of 52 cards.
There are 52 factorial ways to sort the pack, which means
that any particular ordering of the cards can represent a
number in the range [0, 52!-1]. <br>
In other words, given n cards, you can store approximately
log2(n!) bits of information based on their ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIF images contain a colourmap
with up to 256 entries, resulting in a maximum storage
capacity of 1675 bits. The image itself consists of a
compressed array of indices into this <br>
colourmap. To conceal a message within a GIF image the
following steps take place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Start with the message you
want to conceal, specified on the command line or in a file.
Optionally compress and/or encrypt this message. You are
then left with a sequence <br>
of 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Prepend a 1 to this sequence,
giving you a binary number m (probably quite large).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Next take a look at the GIF
image that you want to conceal the message in. Count the
number of unique colours in the image, and call the value n.
If m &gt; n!-1 then the <br>
message is too large, and the procedure will be aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The colours in the colourmap
are first sorted into their &quot;natural&quot; order
(except when encryption is being used - see details below).
Each RGB colour is assigned the value <br>
(red * 65536 + green * 256 + blue), and the colours are
sorted according to these values. Any duplicate colours are
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Iterate i through the values
1 .. n. Each colour i-1 is allocated a target position (m
mod i), then m is divided by i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Each colour is then in turn
inserted into a new colourmap at its target position.
Colours previously occupying the target position and above
are moved up one place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. If the size of the colourmap
is greater than the number of unique colours, then the
colourmap will be padded with the last colour from the
original colourmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. The image component of the
GIF is then uncompressed, the colour indices are re-mapped
to the new colourmap, and the image is re-compressed. For
animated GIFs this is <br>
repeated for each image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting a hidden message
follows a similar procedure, but in reverse. The ordering of
the colourmap is used to construct a binary number, which is
then optionally decrypted <br>
and uncompressed before being output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gifshuffle provides rudimentary
compression, using Huffman tables optimised for English
text. However, if the data is not text, or if there is a lot
of data, the use of the <br>
built-in compression is not recommended, since an external
compression program such as compress or gzip will do a much
better job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encryption is also provided,
using the ICE encryption algorithm in 1-bit cipher-feedback
(CFB) mode to encrypt the data (after compression). Because
of ICE&rsquo;s arbitrary key size, <br>
passwords of any length up to 1170 characters are supported
(since only 7 bits of each character are used, this means
keys up to 1024-bytes are supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of gifshuffle 2.0 encryption
is also applied to the ordering of the colours in the
colourmap. Instead of using their &quot;natural&quot;
ordering, the ordering of their encrypted hash <br>
is used. This has the benefit of making colourmaps look
random even when there is only a small message concealed. To
disable this feature (which is incompatible with version 1
of <br>
gifshuffle) use the -1 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a message string or message
file are specified on the command-line, gifshuffle will
attempt to conceal the message in the file infile.gif if
specified, or standard input oth&acirc; <br>
erwise. The resulting file will be written to outfile.gif if
specified, or standard output if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no message string is
provided, gifshuffle attempts to extract a message from the
input file. The result is written to the output file or
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C Compress the data if concealing, or uncompress it if
extracting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Quiet mode. If not set, the
program reports statistics such as compression percentages
and amount of available storage space used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Report on the amount of space
available for hidden message in the GIF colourmap. This is
calculated from the number of unique colours in the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Retain compatibility with
version 1 of gifshuffle by ordering colours using their
&quot;natural&quot; ordering, rather than their encrypted
ordering. This is only relevant if a <br>
password is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p password <br>
If this is set, the data will be encrypted with this
password during concealment, or decrypted during
extraction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f message-file <br>
The contents of this file will be concealed in the input GIF
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m message-string <br>
The contents of this string will be concealed in the input
GIF image. Note that, unless a newline is somehow included
in the string, a newline will not be printed when <br>
the message is extracted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following command will conceal the message &quot;Meet me
at 6&quot; in the file infile.gif, with compression, and
encrypted with the password &quot;hello world&quot;. The
resulting text will be <br>
stored in outfile.gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gifshuffle -C -m &quot;Meet me
at 6&quot; -p &quot;hello world&quot; infile.gif
outfile.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract the message, the
command would be</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gifshuffle -C -p &quot;hello
world&quot; outfile.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the resulting message
will not be terminated by a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The storage capacity of a file
can be determined with the -S option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gifshuffle -S infile.gif</p>
