<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
drivemap - show block devices in a tree of dependencies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
drivemap [-i|--info [-w|--width N]] [-d|--drive] [FILE] <br>
drivemap [-i|--info [-w|--width N]] [-p|--mountpoint]
[-f|--backing-file] [-n|--dm-name] [-m|--mark] [FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drivemap -h|--help <br>
drivemap [--debug] [-x|--set-x] [OPTIONS] [FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
drivemap is a shell script using the proc, sysfs and udev
databases to display block devices in a tree of
dependencies. It is based on bilibop-common shell functions
and sup&acirc; <br>
ports device-mapper (including dm-crypt and LVM) and loop
devices, with some limitations. RAID devices and mhddfs
filesystems are not supported. See the ENHANCEMENTS AND
LIMITA&acirc; <br>
TIONS section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
When no FILE argument is invoked, the command is applied to
all drives. If a FILE is given as argument and exists, then
the command applies to the drive hosting it. FILE can be a
<br>
regular file, a directory or a block device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Display debug information on stderr. When this option is
invoked, each called function prints its name. See also
&rsquo;--set-x&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --drive <br>
Only show the drive node instead of its tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --backing-file <br>
Try to replace each loop device in the tree by its backing
file. This can fail in some cases: for example on DebianLive
systems, a loop device is associated to filesys&acirc; <br>
tem.squashfs from into the initramfs environment; the path
of the backing file in /sys is not updated when the squashfs
itself becomes the new root filesystem. And so the <br>
filename stored in backing_file is obsolete, and will not be
displayed here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a summary of options on stdout and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --info <br>
Display additional information about block devices. For
drives, this includes the ID (as found in /dev/disk/by-id),
and the size (human readable). For other devices (par&acirc;
<br>
titions and virtual block devices), this includes the
filesystem type ant its size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mark <br>
If a FILE is given as argument, append a mark (a star
between parenthesis: (*)) to the name of the device hosting
this FILE. Otherwise, append a mark to the name of the <br>
device hosting the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dm-name <br>
Replace device-mapper nodes (/dev/dm-*) by device-mapper
names (/dev/mapper/*), which are statically attributed and
generally easier to understand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --mountpoint <br>
Show the mountpoints of mounted devices, and show swap
devices in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w N, --width=N <br>
Format the output on N columns. Can be used with
&rsquo;--info&rsquo; and/or &rsquo;--mountpoint&rsquo;. If N
is not an integer or is greater than the number of columns
of the screen, then the <br>
output will use the full width of the screen. If this option
is not used, then the default is to display the result on 70
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --set-x <br>
Display debug information on stderr. When this option is
invoked, the shell script is set as -x, for more debug
details. See also &rsquo;--debug&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENHANCEMENTS AND LIMITATIONS
<br>
drivemap is a part of the bilibop(7) project. It has
initially been written to be applied to the external drive
hosting the running system. By design, it don&rsquo;t
support RAID <br>
devices, and will never support them. Another design issue
is that lvm(8) Volume Groups should contain only one
Physical Volume. We assume that there is no sense to use
several <br>
Physical Volumes on the same drive for the same Volume
Group. Adopting a parent/child mindview, we say that each
device can have at most one parent but zero to several
children. <br>
Since the script has been extended to be applied to all
drives connected to the computer, this sounds like a
bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the lsblk(1) command,
drivemap integrates loopback devices in the tree of
dependencies. In fact, the question that can be asked is the
following: <br>
&quot; What will happen to the content of other physical or
virtual block devices if I dd(1), shred(1) or wipe(1) this
one or this one ? &quot; <br>
And then it appears that slaves and holders information in
sysfs are not sufficient to organize block devices in a
tree, or should be extended. For the same reason, logical
par&acirc; <br>
titions are shown as subdevices of primary extended
partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only block devices whose
contents is hosted by a physical disk are shown: this means
if a loop device is associated to a file residing on a
temporary filesystem (tmpfs, i.e. the <br>
RAM), this device will not be shown. This is NOT a bug: as
said by its name, drivemap builts and displays a &rsquo;map
of drive(s)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
List the physical drives actually known by the kernel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drivemap -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find the drive hosting the
running system, and display its ID and size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drivemap -id /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show where is my current working
directory on a disk with a complex partition scheme (LVM +
LUKS + LVM):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drivemap -min .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
