<p>NCRENAME(1) General Commands Manual NCRENAME(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncrename - netCDF Renamer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
ncrename [-a old_name,new_name] [-a ... ] [-D] [-d
old_name,new_name] [-d ... ] [-g old_name,new_name] [-g ...
] [--glb att_name= att_val]] [-h] [--hdr_pad sz_byt] [-l
path] <br>
[-O] [-p path] [-R] [-r] [--ram_all] [-v old_name,new_name]
[-v ... ] input-file [ output-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncrename renames dimensions, variables, and attributes in a
netCDF file. Each object that has a name in the list of old
names is renamed using the corresponding name in the list
<br>
of new names. All the new names must be unique. Every old
name must exist in the input file, unless the name is
preceded by the character .. The validity of the old names
is <br>
not checked prior to the renaming. Thus, if an old name is
specified without the the . prefix and is not present in
input-file, ncrename will abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncrename is the exception to the
normal rules that the user will be interactively prompted
before an existing file is changed, and that a temporary
copy of an output file is con&acirc; <br>
structed during the operation. If only input-file is
specified, then ncrename will change the names of the
input-file in place without prompting and without creating a
temporary <br>
copy of input-file. This is because the renaming operation
is considered reversible if the user makes a mistake. The
new_name can easily be changed back to old_name by using
<br>
ncrename one more time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that renaming a dimension
to the name of a dependent variable can be used to invert
the relationship between an independent coordinate variable
and a dependent variable. In <br>
this case, the named dependent variable must be
one-dimensional and should have no missing values. Such a
variable will become a coordinate variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to the netCDF Users
Guide, renaming properties in netCDF files does not incur
the penalty of recopying the entire file when the new_name
is shorter than the old_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a old_name, new_name Attribute renaming. The old and new
names of the attribute are specified by the associated
old_name and new_name values. Global attributes are treated
<br>
no differently than variable attributes. This option may be
specified more than once. You cannot change the attribute
name for one particular variable (unless it is <br>
uniquely named); all occurrences of the attribute of a given
name will be renamed. This is considered an oversight and
will be addressed in a future version of NCO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d old_name, new_name Dimension
renaming. The old and new names of the dimension are
specified by the associated old_name and new_name values.
This option may be specified <br>
more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g old_name, new_name Group
renaming. The old and new names of the group are specified
by the associated old_name and new_name values. This option
may be specified more <br>
than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v old_name, new_name Variable
renaming. The old and new names of the variable are
specified by the associated old_name and new_name values.
This option may be specified <br>
more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Interactive. ncrename will
prompt for confirmation before overwriting an existing
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Rename the variable p to pressure and t to temperature in
netCDF in.nc. In this case p must exist in the input file
(or ncrename will abort), but the presence of t is optional:
<br>
ncrename -v p,pressure -v .t,temperature in.nc <br>
ncrename does not automatically attach dimensions to
variables of the same name. If you want to rename a
coordinate variable so that it remains a coordinate
variable, you must <br>
separately rename both the dimension and the variable: <br>
ncrename -d lon,longitude -v lon,longitude in.nc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create netCDF out.nc identical
to in.nc except the attribute _FillValue is changed to
missing_value (in all variables which possess it) and the
global attribute Zaire is changed <br>
to Congo: <br>
ncrename -a _FillValue,missing_value -a Zaire,Congo in.nc
out.nc</p>

The full documentation for NCO is maintained as a Texinfo
manual called the NCO Users Guide. Because NCO is
mathematical in nature, the documentation includes
TeX-intensive por&acirc; <br>
tions not viewable on character-based displays. Hence the
only complete and authoritative versions of the NCO Users
Guide are the PDF (recommended), DVI, and Postscript
versions <br>
at &lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.pdf&gt;,
&lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.dvi&gt;, and
