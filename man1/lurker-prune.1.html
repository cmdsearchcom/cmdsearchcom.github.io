<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lurker-prune &acirc; prunes the web-server cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lurker-prune [-c &lt;config-file&gt;] [-f &lt;frontend&gt;]
[-m &lt;days&gt;] [-a &lt;days&gt;] [-p -v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lurker-prune prunes obsolete or stale files from the
web-server accessible cache. This command must be run at
regular intervals from eg. a cronjob. If it is not run, then
the <br>
lurker web interface will appear to not be receiving new
mail or have contradictory links between pages. A good
interval is every 15 minutes and should not exceed one
hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that it is possible for
an attacker to use up a large amount of disk space through
lurker. An attacker could request many distinct lurker web
pages each of which is <br>
cached, thus using disk space. Please setup a quota for the
lurker user, read your logs, and follow whatever
site-specific policies you have for denial of service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good script to run in parallel
with normal lurker-prune use is one similar to: if test
&lsquo;du -s /var/www/lurker | cut -f1&lsquo; -gt 32768;
then lurker-prune -p; fi This might help <br>
guard against a potential denial-of-service attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c config-file <br>
Use this config file for lurker settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f frontend <br>
The directory of the lurker frontend cache to clean. You can
selectively purge cache with this option. By default,
lurker-prune will clean all frontends specified in <br>
the config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m days Keep cached files for at
most this many days. Any cached file regardless of last
access will be deleted after the specified number of days
(defaults to 7). Files which <br>
are obsolete due to new mail, config changes, or no accesses
will be deleted earlier. Deleted files will be automagically
regenerated if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a days Kill cache files not
accessed for this many days. Any cached file which has not
been read from for the specified number of days (defaults to
1) will be deleted. Files <br>
which are obsolete due to new mail or config changes will be
deleted earlier. Deleted files will be automagically
regenerated if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Purge mode. Delete all cache
files even if they do not appear to be expired. This will
only deletes files that are generated by lurker, and is thus
preferable to rm <br>
*/*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation. Indicate
which files are being deleted and the reasoning behind
lurker&rsquo;s decisions. This can help in tracking down why
some files are deleted and not <br>
others.</p>
