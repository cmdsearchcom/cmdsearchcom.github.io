PERL-CROSS-DEBIAN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl-cross-debian - Long term maintenance of cross-build
support for the Debian configuration of perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
perl-cross-debian [--rootdir=DIRECTORY] --variant=STRING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl-cross-debian --clean</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl-cross-debian [{-h | --help}
| {-v | --version}]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
perl-cross-debian supports the long term maintenance of
cross-build support for the Debian configuration of
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl-cross-debian is not
expected to be run directly on the command line, it is
executed by the modified debian/rules of a Debian source
package of perl, within the constraints <br>
of a cross-build. perl-cross-debian uses the cross-building
environment set by dpkg-architecture -aARCH to provide
essential configuration values for the requested
architecture <br>
to avoid executing cross-built binaries within the
cross-build. Full support is limited to specific versions of
perl already packaged in Debian and only for selected <br>
architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl-cross-debian copies
pre-produced config files into the current perl build tree
to prevent the build from needing to execute test binaries
during the configuration stage by <br>
providing the values of the tests in advance.
perl-cross-debian then extracts values from the cached files
to update the build information and package Makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl-cross-debian then relies on
a patched Makefile.SH to call the host perl interpreter
instead of the perl interpreter being built internally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Running the cross build for
details of how to prepare the Debian packages of perl for
cross-building for the one of the currently supported host
architectures. (Patches to <br>
apply to supported Debian versions of perl are included in
/usr/share/perl-cross-debian/patches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See perl-cross-staging (1) for
information on how to extend perl-cross-debian to other host
architectures and other versions of perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND <br>
--variant VARIANT <br>
Name of the current perl build variant (static, debug or
shared), passed in via debian/rules, must be specified once
for each iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean <br>
Runs the perl-cross-debian clean target and exits zero.
--clean overrides any --variant command - the clean
operation does not depend on the current variant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--rootdir DIRECTORY <br>
Debug support for testing with unreleased config files, uses
the files from the rootdir instead of looking in the <br>

/usr/share/perl-cross-debian/$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)/$(PERL_VERSION)
directory. ($(PERL_VERSION) in this instance is the output
of /bin/bash debian/config.debian <br>
--full-version.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, -h, --help, --version <br>
Show summary of options and the version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
perl-cross-debian implements a safeguard that the perl
interpreter to be used during the cross-build is the same
upstream version as the perl interpreter to be cross-built
due to <br>
limitations of DynaLoader.pm :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -c
-D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -DDEBIAN -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g
-O2 -fstack-protector <br>
--param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Werror=format-security
-fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -I/usr/local/include <br>
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -O2 -g -DVERSION=
<br>
-fPIC &quot;-I../..&quot; Cwd.c <br>
Running Mkbootstrap for Cwd () <br>
DynaLoader object version 1.13 does not match
$DynaLoader::VERSION 1.14 at ../../lib/DynaLoader.pm line
86. <br>
Compilation failed in require at
../../lib/ExtUtils/Mkbootstrap.pm line 27.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, perl-cross-debian dies
with a version mismatch and fails the cross-build. Ensure
that the installed perl interpreter is upgraded before
testing a cross-build of the <br>
updated perl source code (or use a chroot). When using a
chroot and old-style dpkg-cross dependencies, consider
preparing at least the zlib and bzip2 dependencies outside
the <br>
chroot as a new version of perl is frequently not
installable with lots of perl modules such as those used by
dpkg-cross. e.g. zlib1g-dev-armel-cross and
libbz2-dev-armel-cross <br>
as well as libdb-dev-armel-cross and
libgdbm-dev-armel-cross.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sudo xapt -a armel -b zlib1g-dev
libbz2-dev libdb-dev libgdbm-dev</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -cross packages are in
/var/lib/xapt/output and need to be copied into the chroot
and installed with dpkg -i ./*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl-cross-debian also
implements a safeguard to prevent cross-builds when
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=&quot;nocheck&quot; has not been set prior
to starting the build. Cross-build failures due to <br>
the running of test code within the perl build are not
always easy to identify, so perl-cross-debian checks for
this build option and fails the cross-build if it is not
set. (The <br>
check occurs inside perl-cross-debian so the clean target
will have been run before the check is made.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING THE CROSS BUILD <br>
perl-cross-debian needs some changes to the perl package
before cross-building, so ensure that Makefile.SH and
debian/rules are both patched and that the cross
dependencies and <br>
cross compiler are installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patches are carried in the
perl-cross-debian package in
/usr/share/perl-cross-debian/patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debuild is preferred as this
will provide a build log and run lintian (by default) which
means that the built packages will be checked to ensure that
the binaries have been <br>
correctly compiled for the cross architecture (amongst the
normal checks). Run the cross build with:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=&quot;nocheck&quot;
debuild -aarmel -us -uc -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note the use of the -d option as
dpkg cannot check cross-build dependencies until MutiArch
-dev packages are in use and the requirement for
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to disable the test <br>
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED VERSIONS AND
ARCHITECTURES <br>
perl-cross-debian support is patchy but can be improved.
Only specific architectures at specific versions are
supported - if you do not find the files for the requested
version <br>
in the directory of the architecture required, see
perl-cross-staging (1) for information on how this
information can be added and also for details of ongoing
work with perl <br>
upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLEAN TARGET SUPPORT <br>
perl-cross-debian includes support for a custom clean target
for cross-builds to ensure that version-specific content
generated during the cross-build is cleaned up before <br>
dpkg-source tries to verify the source package. If there are
additional files which need to be cleaned, file a bug
against perl-cross-debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENSION INSTALLATION <br>
The current method of building and installing the extensions
does need testing and improvement. Whilst the main emphasis
for a perl cross build is to support bootstrapping by <br>
having the normal perl interpreter available instead of just
miniperl, there may be less emphasis on the correct
functioning of the extensions and modules normally packaged
by a <br>
native perl build. Problems relating to any use of perl
extensions and modules when the cross built perl packages
are installed should be reported as bugs in
perl-cross-debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDING PERL-CROSS-DEBIAN <br>
perl-cross-debian provides some POD documentation of how to
extend support to new architectures and how to update
existing support for new versions of perl.</p>
