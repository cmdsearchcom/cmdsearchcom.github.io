<p>BURST(1) General Commands Manual BURST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
burst - explode digests into messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
burst [+folder] [msgs] [-inplace | -noinplace] [-mime |
-nomime] [-automime] [-quiet | -noquiet] [-verbose |
-noverbose] [-version] [-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Burst considers the specified messages in the named folder
to be Internet digests, and explodes them in that
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -inplace is given, each
digest is replaced by the &acirc;table of contents&acirc;
for the digest (the original digest is removed). Burst then
renumbers all of the messages following the <br>
digest in the folder to make room for each of the messages
contained within the digest. These messages are placed
immediately after the digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -noinplace is given, each
digest is preserved, no table of contents is produced, and
the messages contained within the digest are placed at the
end of the folder. Other mes&acirc; <br>
sages are not tampered with in any way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -automime is given, burst
will try to determine if the message is formatted with MIME
and contains MIME parts of type
&acirc;message/rfc822&acirc;. If it does, it will burst the
message <br>
using MIME formatting rules. The -mime switch can be used to
enforce the use of MIME formatting. The -nomime switch will
force burst to use RFC 934 rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -quiet switch directs burst
to be silent about reporting messages that are not in digest
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -verbose switch directs
burst to tell the user the general actions that it is taking
to explode the digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It turns out that burst works
equally well on forwarded messages and blind-carbon-copies
as on Internet digests, provided that the former two were
generated by forw or send.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.mh_profile The user&rsquo;s profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILE COMPONENTS <br>
Path: To determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory. <br>
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder. <br>
Msg-Protect: To set mode when creating a new message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proposed Standard for Message
Encapsulation (RFC 934)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
+folder The current folder. <br>
msgs The current message. <br>
-noinplace <br>
-automime <br>
-noquiet <br>
-noverbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
If a folder is given, it will become the current folder. If
-inplace is given, then the first message burst becomes the
current message. This leaves the context ready for a <br>
show of the table of contents of the digest, and a next to
see the first message of the digest. If -noinplace is given,
then the first message extracted from the first digest <br>
burst becomes the current message. This leaves the context
in a similar, but not identical, state to the context
achieved when using -inplace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The burst program enforces a limit on the number of messages
which may be burst from a single message. This number is on
the order of 1000 messages. There is usually no limit <br>
on the number of messages which may reside in the folder
after the bursting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although burst uses a
sophisticated algorithm to determine where one encapsulated
message ends and another begins, not all digestifying
programs use an encapsulation algorithm. <br>
In degenerate cases, this usually results in burst finding
an encapsulation boundary prematurely and splitting a single
encapsulated message into two or more messages. These <br>
erroneous digestifying programs should be fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, any text which
appears after the last encapsulated message is not placed in
a separate message by burst. In the case of digestified
messages, this text is usually <br>
an &acirc;End of digest&acirc; string. As a result of this
possibly un-friendly behavior on the part of burst, note
that when the -inplace option is used, this trailing
information is lost. <br>
In practice, this is not a problem since correspondents
usually place remarks in text prior to the first
encapsulated message, and this information is not lost.</p>
