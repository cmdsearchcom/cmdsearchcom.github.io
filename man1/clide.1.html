<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clide - color and style highlighting program for text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
clide [options] [file1] [file2] [...fileN]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| clide [options] (STDIN through
pipe)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide [options] (STDIN. Use
Ctrl-D to finish input)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
clide is a program that allows you to colorize and add
various display altering attributes to text based on search
patterns and expressions. Currently the focus is on creating
<br>
ANSI color and style escape codes for use in terminal
displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help - Show some terse help for the program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --expression
&lt;expression&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt; <br>
Examples: <br>
-e /searchpattern/,fg=red,bold <br>
-e HTMLTAG,fg=blue,bg=yellow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --definitionfile
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --expressionfile
&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--highlight, --hl
&lt;word1&gt;[,word2,word3,...] - Quickly highlight <br>
the words given in the comma seperated list of words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--highlightattributes, --ha
&lt;attribute1&gt;[,attribute2,attribute3,...] <br>
The default attributes used by the highlight option. <br>
This option uses the same comma seperate values taht <br>
can be defined in an normal expression.</p>

foreground and background colors <br>
that can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--liststyles - Show a list of
styles that can be used (not all <br>
of which may work on your display)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listdefinitions - Show a list
of predefined search expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reverseprecedence, -r -
Reverse the precedence order in which <br>
expressions are run through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--wf, --warmfuzzy
&quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot; - <br>
Send the developer a short message to let him know that you
like this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
FILE ARGUMENTS <br>
One way to utilize clide is to process the contents of a
file or multiple files. This is done simply by passing the
files as arguments after the other options you wish to
specify <br>
for matching expressions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide -e HTMLTAG,fg=yellow
index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIPELINES <br>
Another way to use clide is by passing the output of one
program into it. You are sending the standard output
(STDOUT) of one program to the standard input (STDIN) of
clide. <br>
Like this command that sends the output of ls through clide,
which colors lines that are directory entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls -l | clide -e
/^d.*/,fg=blue,bold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL ESCAPING <br>
If you are creating more complex search patterns, you are
probably going to need to put quotes around the whole
argument that is passed to a -e option. This is because your
<br>
shell will interpret certain characters like (, ), $, &amp;,
[, ], etc. For example, this command uses an expression that
will change the percentage display of a filesystem to red
<br>
if it is 94% or more:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">df -h | clide -e
&quot;/(100|9[4-9])%/,fg=red,bold&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But because ( ) is used in most
shells as a subshell sequence, you have to put quotes around
the whole expression so that its not processed by your
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPRESSIONS <br>
Expressions can be specified on the command line using one
or more -e options. You can also use the -f option one or
more times to specify premade expression files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK HIGHLIGHTING <br>
If you&rsquo;re in a hurry and don&rsquo;t want to come up
with an expression for matching words or characters that
you&rsquo;d like to highlight, you can use the --highlight
option along with a <br>
comma seperated list of values you want to match. Like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide --highlight car,truck,boat
insurance-readme.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default clide will highlight
these words in yellow. you can override this with the
--highlightattributes option, specifying what you want in
the same way you would pass <br>
attribute arguments in a -e argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the --highlight
option in combination with -e of -f options, but the
expressions will be applied after the expressions specified
with -e or -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
clide works by passing the expression that you specify into
a PERL matching operator. This means that you can pass
almost any valid PERL regular expression to clide and it
should <br>
work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only limitation is in what
flags you can pass to the search. Currently, you can only
pass a &rsquo;i&rsquo; (case insensitive) and/or a
&rsquo;g&rsquo; (global search) flag to the search
expression. <br>
The multiline flag &rsquo;m&rsquo; is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about perl
regular expressions, see the pcre(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSION SEARCH <br>
The basic way to tell clide what text you want to affect is
to use the regular expression search operator. This is
passed to the -e option along with a command seperated list
of <br>
attributes to set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide -e
/failed/i,fg=yellow,bg=red,bold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above expression searches
for the word failed (using the i option after the second /
means make the search case insensitive). It will change the
word failed to have a <br>
foreground color of bold yellow (bright) and a background
color of red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREDEFINED SEARCH PATTERNS <br>
A list of helpful predefined search patterns is included
with clide to make pattern matching easier for the user. A
list of the patterns is available by running clide with the
<br>
--listdefinitions option. You can also put your own
definitions in files and use the -f option to include
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a predefined search
expression is simply a matter of using its name for the
first part of the -e argument, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide -e HOSTNAME,bold
logfile.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Predefined search
patterns MUST use all uppercase names. In the future clide
may have other expression functions that start with lower
case letters and there needs to <br>
be a way to differentiate between a pattern definition and
an operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMATS <br>
NOTE: The author would like to encourage you to put your
expression and definition files in a directory called .clide
in your home directory. Future versions of clide may make it
<br>
easier to use these files if you have them located in such a
named directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPRESSION FILE <br>
The expression file is pretty simple, you put each
expression one per line in exactly the same way that you
would pass it to the -e option. expression definitions can
be used as <br>
the expressions themselves are parsed after all the
predefined expressions are read in. You can include these
files using the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So an expression file called
microblogging might look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTMLTAG,fg=red,bg=black <br>
URL,fg=yellow,bold,underline <br>
TWITTERGROUP,fg=blue,bold <br>
# Highlight some of my MB account names <br>
/@(mkrenz|climagic|suso)/,fg=yellow,bg=blue,bold <br>
TWITTERMENTION,fg=cyan <br>
IDENTICAGROUP,fg=blue,bold</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then you&rsquo;d use it like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">twidge lsrecent | clide -f
~/.clide/microblogging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments can be made using a #
character at the beginning of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINITION FILE <br>
The definition file has a bit more of a format to it. Each
line has two columns seperated by whitespace. The first
column is the name of the definition in all uppercase
letters. <br>
The second column is the search expression starting with a
forward slash and terminated by a forward slash and one or
more pcre flags (i or g)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># These are IPs I&rsquo;m
watching out for. 3 . 1 4 . 1 5 9 . 2 6 | 2 0 6 . 9 7 . 6 4
. [ 2 9 ] | 1 0 . [ <br>
INTERESTINGIPS /0 - 9 ] { 1 , 3 } . [ 0 - 9 ] { 1 , 3 } . [
0 - 9 ] { 1 , 3 } ) <br>
# Words I care about. <br>
LOGINWORDS /(error|failed|failure|success|successful)/gi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then just include the file using
-d for each file you want to include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you don&rsquo;t need
to escape or backslash as much in the searches when you put
them in a file as compared with when you specify the pattern
on the command line. Keep this <br>
in mind if you copy and paste your expressions into a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
Because one expression matching will actually alter the line
in order to add the escape sequences, matching expressions
that are run later may not match what the user expects <br>
them to match because the string has changed. This is going
to be fixed in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently clide can only work on
7-bit ASCII text. If it encounters a line with upper 8-bit
(binary) characters, it will simply print the line with out
doing any processing on <br>
it. If you&rsquo;re really curious as to why, you can read
the comments in the code or ask the author. A future version
of clide may not have this limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most terminal emulators and the
console itself have some limitations as to what they can
display. Most of them don&rsquo;t support blinking text,
only some support dark mode, etc. <br>
This is not a limitation of clide, it is your terminal
software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide doesn&rsquo;t support
multiline matching at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
pcre</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARMFUZZY <br>
If you like clide, you should let the author know by sending
a short message using the --warmfuzzy option, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clide --warmfuzzy &quot;I like
clide&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option makes an HTTP
request to a website that will in turn let the author know
what you thought.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I included this option because I
think that open source projects need an easier way for users
to give the developers a little reward for their
efforts.</p>
