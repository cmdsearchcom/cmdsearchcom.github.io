clide is a program that allows you to colorize and add various display altering
  attributes to text based on search patterns and expressions. Currently the
  focus is on creating ANSI color and style escape codes for use in terminal
  displays.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<pre>
  -h, --help - Show some terse help for the program
  -e, --expression &lt;expression&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;
      Examples:
         -e /searchpattern/,fg=red,bold
         -e HTMLTAG,fg=blue,bg=yellow
  -d, --definitionfile &lt;file&gt;
  -f, --expressionfile &lt;file&gt;
  --highlight, --hl &lt;word1&gt;[,word2,word3,...] - Quickly highlight
     the words given in the comma seperated list of words.
  --highlightattributes, --ha &lt;attribute1&gt;[,attribute2,attribute3,...]
          The default attributes used by the highlight option.
          This option uses the same comma seperate values taht
          can be defined in an normal expression.
  --listcolors - Show a list of foreground and background colors
                 that can be used.

                 of which may work on your display)
  --listdefinitions - Show a list of predefined search expressions
  --reverseprecedence, -r - Reverse the precedence order in which
                 expressions are run through.
  --wf, --warmfuzzy &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot; -
                Send the developer a short message to let him know that you like this program.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="FILE_ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_ARGUMENTS">FILE
  ARGUMENTS</a></h2>
One way to utilize clide is to process the contents of a file or multiple files.
  This is done simply by passing the files as arguments after the other options
  you wish to specify for matching expressions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 clide -e HTMLTAG,fg=yellow index.html
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PIPELINES"><a class="selflink" href="#PIPELINES">PIPELINES</a></h2>
Another way to use clide is by passing the output of one program into it. You
  are sending the standard output (STDOUT) of one program to the standard input
  (STDIN) of clide. Like this command that sends the output of ls through clide,
  which colors lines that are directory entries:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 ls -l | clide -e /^d.*/,fg=blue,bold
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SHELL_ESCAPING"><a class="selflink" href="#SHELL_ESCAPING">SHELL
  ESCAPING</a></h2>
If you are creating more complex search patterns, you are probably going to need
  to put quotes around the whole argument that is passed to a -e option. This is
  because your shell will interpret certain characters like (, ), $, &amp;, [,
  ], etc. For example, this command uses an expression that will change the
  percentage display of a filesystem to red if it is 94% or more:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 df -h | clide -e &quot;/(100|9[4-9])%/,fg=red,bold&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But because ( ) is used in most shells as a subshell sequence, you have to put
  quotes around the whole expression so that its not processed by your shell.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXPRESSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPRESSIONS">EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
Expressions can be specified on the command line using one or more -e options.
  You can also use the -f option one or more times to specify premade expression
  files.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="QUICK_HIGHLIGHTING"><a class="selflink" href="#QUICK_HIGHLIGHTING">QUICK
  HIGHLIGHTING</a></h2>
If you're in a hurry and don't want to come up with an expression for matching
  words or characters that you'd like to highlight, you can use the --highlight
  option along with a comma seperated list of values you want to match. Like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  clide --highlight car,truck,boat insurance-readme.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default clide will highlight these words in yellow. you can override this
  with the --highlightattributes option, specifying what you want in the same
  way you would pass attribute arguments in a -e argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use the --highlight option in combination with -e of -f options, but the
  expressions will be applied after the expressions specified with -e or -f.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PERL_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#PERL_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS">PERL
  REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</a></h2>
clide works by passing the expression that you specify into a PERL matching
  operator. This means that you can pass almost any valid PERL regular
  expression to clide and it should work as expected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The only limitation is in what flags you can pass to the search. Currently, you
  can only pass a 'i' (case insensitive) and/or a 'g' (global search) flag to
  the search expression. The multiline flag 'm' is not supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information about perl regular expressions, see the <i>pcre</i>(1) man
  page.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="REGULAR_EXPRESSION_SEARCH"><a class="selflink" href="#REGULAR_EXPRESSION_SEARCH">REGULAR
  EXPRESSION SEARCH</a></h2>
The basic way to tell clide what text you want to affect is to use the regular
  expression search operator. This is passed to the -e option along with a
  command seperated list of attributes to set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 clide -e /failed/i,fg=yellow,bg=red,bold
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The above expression searches for the word failed (using the i option after the
  second / means make the search case insensitive). It will change the word
  failed to have a foreground color of bold yellow (bright) and a background
  color of red.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="PREDEFINED_SEARCH_PATTERNS"><a class="selflink" href="#PREDEFINED_SEARCH_PATTERNS">PREDEFINED
  SEARCH PATTERNS</a></h2>
A list of helpful predefined search patterns is included with clide to make
  pattern matching easier for the user. A list of the patterns is available by
  running clide with the --listdefinitions option. You can also put your own
  definitions in files and use the -f option to include them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using a predefined search expression is simply a matter of using its name for
  the first part of the -e argument, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 clide -e HOSTNAME,bold logfile.txt
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
WARNING: Predefined search patterns MUST use all uppercase names. In the future
  clide may have other expression functions that start with lower case letters
  and there needs to be a way to differentiate between a pattern definition and
  an operation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_FORMATS">FILE
  FORMATS</a></h1>
NOTE: The author would like to encourage you to put your expression and
  definition files in a directory called .clide in your home directory. Future
  versions of clide may make it easier to use these files if you have them
  located in such a named directory.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="EXPRESSION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXPRESSION_FILE">EXPRESSION
  FILE</a></h2>
The expression file is pretty simple, you put each expression one per line in
  exactly the same way that you would pass it to the -e option. expression
  definitions can be used as the expressions themselves are parsed after all the
  predefined expressions are read in. You can include these files using the -f
  option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So an expression file called microblogging might look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 HTMLTAG,fg=red,bg=black
 URL,fg=yellow,bold,underline
 TWITTERGROUP,fg=blue,bold
 # Highlight some of my MB account names
 /@(mkrenz|climagic|suso)/,fg=yellow,bg=blue,bold
 TWITTERMENTION,fg=cyan
 IDENTICAGROUP,fg=blue,bold
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then you'd use it like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 twidge lsrecent | clide -f ~/.clide/microblogging
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Comments can be made using a # character at the beginning of the line.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="DEFINITION_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFINITION_FILE">DEFINITION
  FILE</a></h2>
The definition file has a bit more of a format to it. Each line has two columns
  seperated by whitespace. The first column is the name of the definition in all
  uppercase letters. The second column is the search expression starting with a
  forward slash and terminated by a forward slash and one or more pcre flags (i
  or g)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 # These are IPs I'm watching out for.
 INTERESTINGIPS /\b(3\.14\.159\.26|206\.97\.64\.[29]|10\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})\b/g
 # Words I care about.
 LOGINWORDS /(error|failed|failure|success|successful)/gi
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Then just include the file using -d for each file you want to include.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that you don't need to escape or backslash as much in the searches when you
  put them in a file as compared with when you specify the pattern on the
  command line. Keep this in mind if you copy and paste your expressions into a
  file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS">BUGS
  AND LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
Because one expression matching will actually alter the line in order to add the
  escape sequences, matching expressions that are run later may not match what
  the user expects them to match because the string has changed. This is going
  to be fixed in a future release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Currently clide can only work on 7-bit ASCII text. If it encounters a line with
  upper 8-bit (binary) characters, it will simply print the line with out doing
  any processing on it. If you're really curious as to why, you can read the
  comments in the code or ask the author. A future version of clide may not have
  this limitation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most terminal emulators and the console itself have some limitations as to what
  they can display. Most of them don't support blinking text, only some support
  dark mode, etc. This is not a limitation of clide, it is your terminal
  software.
<div class="Pp"></div>
clide doesn't support multiline matching at this time.

If you like clide, you should let the author know by sending a short message
  using the --warmfuzzy option, like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 clide --warmfuzzy &quot;I like clide&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option makes an HTTP request to a website that will in turn let the author
  know what you thought.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I included this option because I think that open source projects need an easier
  way for users to give the developers a little reward for their efforts.
