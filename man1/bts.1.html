<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bts - developers&rsquo; command line interface to the
BTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bts [options] command [args] [#comment] [.|, command [args]
[#comment]] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This is a command line interface to the Debian Bug Tracking
System (BTS), intended mainly for use by developers. It lets
the BTS be manipulated using simple commands that can be
<br>
run at the prompt or in a script, does various sanity checks
on the input, and constructs and sends a mail to the BTS
control address for you. A local cache of web pages and <br>
e-mails from the BTS may also be created and updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, the command line
interface is the same as what you would write in a mail to
control@bugs.debian.org, just prefixed with &quot;bts&quot;.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% bts severity 69042 normal <br>
% bts merge 69042 43233 <br>
% bts retitle 69042 blah blah</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A few additional commands have
been added for your convenience, and this program is less
strict about what constitutes a valid bug number. For
example, &quot;severity Bug#85942 <br>
normal&quot; is understood, as is &quot;severity #85942
normal&quot;. (Of course, your shell may regard
&quot;#&quot; as a comment character though, so you may need
to quote it!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, for your convenience, this
program allows you to abbreviate commands to the shortest
unique substring (similar to how cvs lets you abbreviate
commands). So it understands <br>
things like &quot;bts cl 85942&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to include a
comment in the mail sent to the BTS. If your shell does not
strip out the comment in a command like &quot;bts severity
30321 normal #inflated <br>
severity&quot;, then this program is smart enough to figure
out where the comment is, and include it in the email. Note
that most shells do strip out such comments before they get
to <br>
the program, unless the comment is quoted. (Something like
&quot;bts severity #85942 normal&quot; will not be treated
as a comment!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple
commands by separating them with a single dot, rather like
update-rc.d; a single comma may also be used; all the
commands will then be sent in a single <br>
mail. It is important the dot/comma is surrounded by
whitespace so it is not mistaken for part of a command. For
example (quoting where necessary so that bts sees the
comment):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% bts severity 95672 normal ,
merge 95672 95673 <br>
The abbreviation &quot;it&quot; may be used to refer to the
last mentioned bug number, so you could write:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% bts severity 95672 wishlist ,
retitle it &quot;bts: please add a --foo option&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please use this program
responsibly, and do take our users into consideration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
bts examines the devscripts configuration files as described
below. Command line options override the configuration file
settings, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --offline <br>
Make bts use cached bugs for the show and bugs commands, if
a cache is available for the requested data. See the cache
command, below for information on setting up a cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--online, --no-offline <br>
Opposite of --offline; overrides any configuration file
directive to work offline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-action <br>
Do not send emails but print them to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache, --no-cache <br>
Should we attempt to cache new versions of BTS pages when
performing show/bugs commands? Default is to cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-mode={min|mbox|full}
<br>
When running a bts cache command, should we only mirror the
basic bug (min), or should we also mirror the mbox version
(mbox), or should we mirror the whole thing, including <br>
the mbox and the boring attachments to the BTS bug pages and
the acknowledgement emails (full)? Default is min.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cache-delay=seconds <br>
Time in seconds to delay between each download, to avoid
hammering the BTS web server. Default is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mbox <br>
Open a mail reader to read the mbox corresponding to a given
bug number for show and bugs commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mailreader=READER <br>
Specify the command to read the mbox. Must contain a
&quot;%s&quot; string (unquoted!), which will be replaced by
the name of the mbox file. The command will be split on
white space <br>
and will not be passed to a shell. Default is &rsquo;mutt -f
%s&rsquo;. (Also, %% will be substituted by a single % if
this is needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cc-addr=CC_EMAIL_ADDRESS <br>
Send carbon copies to a list of users. CC_EMAIL_ADDRESS
should be a comma-separated list of email addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-default-cc <br>
Add the addresses specified in the configuration file option
BTS_DEFAULT_CC to the list specified using --cc-addr. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-use-default-cc <br>
Do not add addresses specified in BTS_DEFAULT_CC to the
carbon copy list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sendmail=SENDMAILCMD <br>
Specify the sendmail command. The command will be split on
white space and will not be passed to a shell. Default is
/usr/sbin/sendmail. The -t option will be <br>
automatically added if the command is /usr/sbin/sendmail or
/usr/sbin/exim*. For other mailers, if they require a -t
option, this must be included in the SENDMAILCMD, for <br>
example: --sendmail=&quot;/usr/sbin/mymailer -t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mutt <br>
Use mutt for sending of mails. Default is not to use mutt,
except for some commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that one of $DEBEMAIL or
$EMAIL must be set in the environment in order to use mutt
to send emails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-mutt <br>
Don&rsquo;t use mutt for sending of mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--soap-timeout=SECONDS <br>
Specify a timeout for SOAP calls as used by the select and
status commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--smtp-host=SMTPHOST <br>
Specify an SMTP host. If given, bts will send mail by
talking directly to this SMTP host rather than by invoking a
sendmail command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host name may be followed by
a colon (&quot;:&quot;) and a port number in order to use a
port other than the default. It may also begin with
&quot;ssmtp://&quot; or &quot;smtps://&quot; to indicate
<br>
that SMTPS should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that one of $DEBEMAIL or
$EMAIL must be set in the environment in order to use direct
SMTP connections to send emails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when sending directly
via an SMTP host, specifying addresses in --cc-addr or
BTS_DEFAULT_CC that the SMTP host will not relay will cause
the SMTP host to reject the <br>
entire mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that the use of the
reassign command may, when either --interactive or
--force-interactive mode is enabled, lead to the automatic
addition of a Cc to <br>
$newpackage@packages.debian.org. In these cases, the note
above regarding relaying applies. The submission interface
(port 587) on reportbug.debian.org does not support <br>
relaying and, as such, should not be used as an SMTP server
for bts under the circumstances described in this
paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--smtp-username=USERNAME,
--smtp-password=PASSWORD <br>
Specify the credentials to use when connecting to the SMTP
server specified by --smtp-host. If the server does not
require authentication then these options should not be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a username is specified but
not a password, bts will prompt for the password before
sending the mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--smtp-helo=HELO <br>
Specify the name to use in the HELO command when connecting
to the SMTP server; defaults to the contents of the file
/etc/mailname, if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some SMTP servers may
reject the use of a HELO which either does not resolve or
does not appear to belong to the host using it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bts-server <br>
Use a debbugs server other than https://bugs.debian.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force-refresh <br>
Download a bug report again, even if it does not appear to
have changed since the last cache command. Useful if a
--cache-mode=full is requested for the first time <br>
(otherwise unchanged bug reports will not be downloaded
again, even if the boring bits have not been
downloaded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-force-refresh <br>
Suppress any configuration file --force-refresh option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--only-new <br>
Download only new bugs when caching. Do not check for
updates in bugs we already have.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-resolved <br>
When caching bug reports, include those that are marked as
resolved. This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-include-resolved <br>
Reverse the behaviour of the previous option. That is, do
not cache bugs that are marked as resolved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-ack <br>
Suppress acknowledgment mails from the BTS. Note that this
will only affect the copies of messages CCed to bugs, not
those sent to the control bot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ack <br>
Do not suppress acknowledgement mails. This is the default
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive <br>
Before sending an e-mail to the control bot, display the
content and allow it to be edited, or the sending
cancelled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-interactive <br>
Similar to --interactive, with the exception that an editor
is spawned before prompting for confirmation of the message
to be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-interactive <br>
Send control e-mails without confirmation. This is the
default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
When running bts cache, only display information about newly
cached pages, not messages saying already cached. If this
option is specified twice, only output error messages <br>
(to stderr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
For full details about the commands, see the BTS
documentation.
&lt;https://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show [options] [bug number |
package | maintainer | : ] [opt=val ...] <br>
show [options] [src:package | from:submitter] [opt=val ...]
<br>
show [options] [tag:tag | usertag:tag ] [opt=val ...] <br>
show [release-critical | release-critical/... | RC] <br>
This is a synonym for bts bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bugs [options] [bug_number |
package | maintainer | : ] [opt=val ...] <br>
bugs [options] [src:package | from:submitter] [opt=val ...]
<br>
bugs [options] [tag:tag | usertag:tag ] [opt=val ...] <br>
bugs [release-critical | release-critical/... | RC] <br>
Display the page listing the requested bugs in a web browser
using sensible-browser(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be specified after
the bugs command in addition to or instead of options at the
start of the command line: recognised options at this point
are: <br>
-o/--offline/--online, -m/--mbox, --mailreader and
--[no-]cache. These are described earlier in this manpage.
If either the -o or --offline option is used, or there is
<br>
already an up-to-date copy in the local cache, the cached
version will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The meanings of the possible
arguments are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(none) If nothing is specified,
bts bugs will display your bugs, assuming that either
DEBEMAIL or EMAIL (examined in that order) is set to the
appropriate email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bug_number <br>
Display bug number bug_number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Display the bugs for the
package package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src:package <br>
Display the bugs for the source package package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maintainer <br>
Display the bugs for the maintainer email address
maintainer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from:submitter <br>
Display the bugs for the submitter email address
submitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag:tag Display the bugs which
are tagged with tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usertag:tag <br>
Display the bugs which are tagged with usertag tag. See the
BTS documentation for more information on usertags. This
will require the use of a users=email option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: Details of the bug tracking
system itself, along with a bug-request page with more
options than this script, can be found on
https://bugs.debian.org/. This page <br>
itself will be opened if the command &rsquo;bts bugs
:&rsquo; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">release-critical, RC <br>
Display the front page of the release-critical pages on the
BTS. This is a synonym for
https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/index.html. It is
also possible to <br>
say release-critical/debian/main.html and the like. RC is a
synonym for release-critical/other/all.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the argument specifying
what to display, you can optionally specify options to use
to format the page or change what it displayed. These are
passed to the BTS in the <br>
URL downloaded. For example, pass dist=stable to see bugs
affecting the stable version of a package, version=1.0 to
see bugs affecting that version of a package, or <br>
reverse=yes to display newest messages first in a bug
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If caching has been enabled
(that is, --no-cache has not been used, and BTS_CACHE has
not been set to no), then any page requested by bts show
will automatically be cached, <br>
and be available offline thereafter. Pages which are
automatically cached in this way will be deleted on
subsequent &quot;bts show|bugs|cache&quot; invocations if
they have not been <br>
accessed in 30 days. Warning: on a filesystem mounted with
the &quot;noatime&quot; option, running &quot;bts
show|bugs&quot; does not update the cache files&rsquo;
access times; a cached bug will <br>
then be subject to auto-cleaning 30 days after its initial
download, even if it has been accessed in the meantime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other bts commands following
this on the command line will be executed after the browser
has been exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The desired browser can be
specified and configured by setting the BROWSER environment
variable. The conventions follow those defined by Eric
Raymond at <br>
http://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/; we here reproduce the
relevant part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of BROWSER may consist
of a colon-separated series of browser command parts. These
should be tried in order until one succeeds. Each command
part may optionally <br>
contain the string %s; if it does, the URL to be viewed is
substituted there. If a command part does not contain %s,
the browser is to be launched as if the URL had been <br>
supplied as its first argument. The string %% must be
substituted as a single %.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rationale: We need to be able to
specify multiple browser commands so programs obeying this
convention can do the right thing in either X or console
environments, trying X <br>
first. Specifying multiple commands may also be useful for
people who share files like .profile across multiple
systems. We need %s because some popular browsers have
remote- <br>
invocation syntax that requires it. Unless %% reduces to %,
it won&rsquo;t be possible to have a literal %s in the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, on most Linux
systems a good thing to do would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BROWSER=&rsquo;mozilla -raise
-remote &quot;openURL(%s,new-window)&quot;:links&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select [key:value ...] <br>
Uses the SOAP interface to output a list of bugs which match
the given selection requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following keys are allowed,
and may be given multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Binary package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source Source package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maintainer <br>
E-mail address of the maintainer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submitter <br>
E-mail address of the submitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">severity <br>
Bug severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Status of the bug. One of
open, done, or forwarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag Tags applied to the bug. If
users is specified, may include usertags in addition to the
standard tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner Bug&rsquo;s owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">correspondent <br>
Address of someone who sent mail to the log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">affects Bugs which affect this
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bugs List of bugs to search
within.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">users Users to use when looking
up usertags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive Whether to search
archived bugs or normal bugs; defaults to 0 (i.e. only
search normal bugs). As a special case, if archive is both,
both archived and unarchived bugs <br>
are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to select the set
of bugs submitted by jrandomdeveloper@example.com and tagged
wontfix, one would use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts select
submitter:jrandomdeveloper@example.com tag:wontfix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a key is used multiple times
then the set of bugs selected includes those matching any of
the supplied values; for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts select package:foo
severity:wishlist severity:minor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">returns all bugs of package foo
with either wishlist or minor severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status [bug | file:file |
fields:field[,field ...] | verbose] ... <br>
Uses the SOAP interface to output status information for the
given bugs (or as read from the listed files -- use - to
indicate STDIN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, all populated fields
for a bug are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If verbose is given, empty
fields will also be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fields is given, only those
fields will be displayed. No validity checking is performed
on any specified fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clone bug new_ID [new_ID ...]
<br>
The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug
report. It is useful in the case where a single report
actually indicates that multiple distinct bugs have
occurred. <br>
&quot;New IDs&quot; are negative numbers, separated by
spaces, which may be used in subsequent control commands to
refer to the newly duplicated bugs. A new report is
generated for <br>
each new ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">done bug [version] <br>
Mark a bug as Done. This forces interactive mode since done
messages should include an explanation why the bug is being
closed. You should specify which version of the <br>
package closed the bug, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reopen bug [submitter] <br>
Reopen a bug, with optional submitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive bug <br>
Archive a bug that has previously been archived but is
currently not. The bug must fulfil all of the requirements
for archiving with the exception of those that are time-
<br>
based.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unarchive bug <br>
Unarchive a bug that is currently archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retitle bug title <br>
Change the title of the bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">summary bug [messagenum] <br>
Select a message number that should be used as the summary
of a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no message number is given,
the summary is cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submitter bug [bug ...]
submitter-email <br>
Change the submitter address of a bug or a number of bugs,
with ! meaning &lsquo;use the address on the current email
as the new submitter address&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reassign bug [bug ...] package
[version] <br>
Reassign a bug or a number of bugs to a different package.
The version field is optional; see the explanation at
&lt;https://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">found bug [version] <br>
Indicate that a bug was found to exist in a particular
package version. Without version, the list of fixed versions
is cleared and the bug is reopened.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notfound bug version <br>
Remove the record that bug was encountered in the given
version of the package to which it is assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fixed bug version <br>
Indicate that a bug was fixed in a particular package
version, without affecting the bug&rsquo;s open/closed
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notfixed bug version <br>
Remove the record that a bug was fixed in the given version
of the package to which it is assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to the
sequence of commands &quot;found bug version&quot;,
&quot;notfound bug version&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block bug by|with bug [bug ...]
<br>
Note that a bug is blocked from being fixed by a set of
other bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unblock bug by|with bug [bug
...] <br>
Note that a bug is no longer blocked from being fixed by a
set of other bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge bug bug [bug ...] <br>
Merge a set of bugs together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forcemerge bug bug [bug ...]
<br>
Forcibly merge a set of bugs together. The first bug listed
is the master bug, and its settings (those which must be
equal in a normal merge) are assigned to the bugs listed
<br>
next.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmerge bug <br>
Unmerge a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag bug [+|-|=] tag [tag ...]
<br>
tags bug [+|-|=] tag [tag ...] <br>
Set or unset a tag on a bug. The tag may either be the exact
tag name or it may be abbreviated to any unique tag
substring. (So using fixed will set the tag fixed, not
fixed- <br>
upstream, for example, but fix would not be acceptable.)
Multiple tags may be specified as well. The two commands
(tag and tags) are identical. At least one tag must be <br>
specified, unless the = flag is used, where the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts tags &lt;bug&gt; =</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will remove all tags from the
specified bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding/removing the security tag
will add &quot;team@security.debian.org&quot; to the Cc list
of the control email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">affects bug [+|-|=] package
[package ...] <br>
Indicates that a bug affects a package other than that
against which it is filed, causing the bug to be listed by
default in the package list of the other package. This <br>
should generally be used where the bug is severe enough to
cause multiple reports from users to be assigned to the
wrong package. At least one package must be specified, <br>
unless the = flag is used, where the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts affects &lt;bug&gt; =</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will remove all indications that
bug affects other packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user email <br>
Specify a user email address before using the usertags
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usertag bug [+|-|=] tag [tag
...] <br>
usertags bug [+|-|=] tag [tag ...] <br>
Set or unset a user tag on a bug. The tag must be the exact
tag name wanted; there are no defaults or checking of tag
names. Multiple tags may be specified as well. The two <br>
commands (usertag and usertags) are identical. At least one
tag must be specified, unless the = flag is used, where the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts usertags &lt;bug&gt; =</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will remove all user tags from
the specified bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">claim bug [claim] <br>
Record that you have claimed a bug (e.g. for a bug squashing
party). claim should be a unique token allowing the bugs you

often used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no claim is specified, the
environment variable DEBEMAIL or EMAIL (checked in that
order) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unclaim bug [claim] <br>
Remove the record that you have claimed a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no claim is specified, the
environment variable DEBEMAIL or EMAIL (checked in that
order) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">severity bug severity <br>
Change the severity of a bug. Available severities are:
wishlist, minor, normal, important, serious, grave,
critical. The severity may be abbreviated to any unique
substring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forwarded bug address <br>
Mark the bug as forwarded to the given address (usually an
email address or a URL for an upstream bug tracker).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notforwarded bug <br>
Mark a bug as not forwarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package [package ...] <br>
The following commands will only apply to bugs against the
listed packages; this acts as a safety mechanism for the
BTS. If no packages are listed, this check is turned off
<br>
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limit [key[:value]] ... <br>
The following commands will only apply to bugs which meet
the specified criterion; this acts as a safety mechanism for
the BTS. If no values are listed, the limits for that <br>
key are turned off again. If no keys are specified, all
limits are reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">submitter <br>
E-mail address of the submitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date Date the bug was
submitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subject Subject of the bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msgid Message-id of the initial
bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Binary package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source Source package name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag Tags applied to the bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">severity <br>
Bug severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner Bug&rsquo;s owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">affects Bugs affecting this
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive Whether to search
archived bugs or normal bugs; defaults to 0 (i.e. only
search normal bugs). As a special case, if archive is both,
both archived and unarchived bugs <br>
are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to limit the set of
bugs affected by the subsequent control commands to those
submitted by jrandomdeveloper@example.com and tagged
wontfix, one would use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts limit
submitter:jrandomdeveloper@example.com tag:wontfix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a key is used multiple times
then the set of bugs selected includes those matching any of
the supplied values; for example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts limit package:foo
severity:wishlist severity:minor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only applies the subsequent
control commands to bugs of package foo with either wishlist
or minor severity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner bug owner-email <br>
Change the &quot;owner&quot; address of a bug, with !
meaning &lsquo;use the address on the current email as the
new owner address&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The owner of a bug accepts
responsibility for dealing with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noowner bug <br>
Mark a bug as having no &quot;owner&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subscribe bug [email] <br>
Subscribe the given email address to the specified bug
report. If no email address is specified, the environment
variable DEBEMAIL or EMAIL (in that order) is used. If <br>
those are not set, or ! is given as email address, your
default address will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After executing this command,
you will be sent a subscription confirmation to which you
have to reply. When subscribed to a bug report, you receive
all relevant emails and <br>
notifications. Use the unsubscribe command to
unsubscribe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsubscribe bug [email] <br>
Unsubscribe the given email address from the specified bug
report. As with subscribe above, if no email address is
specified, the environment variables DEBEMAIL or EMAIL (in
<br>
that order) is used. If those are not set, or ! is given as
email address, your default address will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After executing this command,
you will be sent an unsubscription confirmation to which you
have to reply. Use the subscribe command to, well,
subscribe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reportspam bug ... <br>
The reportspam command allows you to report a bug report as
containing spam. It saves one from having to go to the bug
web page to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spamreport bug ... <br>
spamreport is a synonym for reportspam.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache [options] [maint_email |
pkg | src:pkg | from:submitter] <br>
cache [options] [release-critical | release-critical/... |
RC] <br>
Generate or update a cache of bug reports for the given
email address or package. By default it downloads all bugs
belonging to the email address in the DEBEMAIL environment
<br>
variable (or the EMAIL environment variable if DEBEMAIL is
unset). This command may be repeated to cache bugs belonging
to several people or packages. If multiple packages or <br>
addresses are supplied, bugs belonging to any of the
arguments will be cached; those belonging to more than one
of the arguments will only be downloaded once. The cached
bugs <br>
are stored in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/devscripts/bts/ or, if
XDG_CACHE_HOME is not set, in ~/.cache/devscripts/bts/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the cached bugs with
the -o switch. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bts -o bugs <br>
bts -o show 12345</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, bts will update the files
in it in a piecemeal fashion as it downloads information
from the BTS using the show command. You might thus set up
the cache, and update the <br>
whole thing once a week, while letting the automatic cache
updates update the bugs you frequently refer to during the
week.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options affect the
behaviour of the cache command. The first is the setting of
--cache-mode, which controls how much bts downloads of the
referenced links from the bug <br>
page, including boring bits such as the acknowledgement
emails, emails to the control bot, and the mbox version of
the bug report. It can take three values: min (the <br>
minimum), mbox (download the minimum plus the mbox version
of the bug report) or full (the whole works). The second is
--force-refresh or -f, which forces the download, even <br>
if the cached bug report is up-to-date. The
--include-resolved option indicates whether bug reports
marked as resolved should be downloaded during caching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these is configurable
from the configuration file, as described below. They may
also be specified after the cache command as well as at the
start of the command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, -q or --quiet will
suppress messages about caches being up-to-date, and giving
the option twice will suppress all cache messages (except
for error messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware of caching RC, though: it
will take a LONG time! (With 1000+ RC bugs and a delay of 5
seconds between bugs, you&rsquo;re looking at a minimum of
1.5 hours, and probably <br>
significantly more than that.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleancache package | src:package
| maintainer <br>
cleancache from:submitter | tag:tag | usertag:tag | number |
ALL <br>
Clean the cache for the specified package, maintainer, etc.,
as described above for the bugs command, or clean the entire
cache if ALL is specified. This is useful if you are <br>
going to have permanent network access or if the database
has become corrupted for some reason. Note that for safety,
this command does not default to the value of DEBEMAIL <br>
or EMAIL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listcachedbugs [number] <br>
List cached bug ids (intended to support bash completion).
The optional number argument restricts the list to those bug
ids that start with that number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Display version and copyright information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Display a short summary of commands, suspiciously similar to
parts of this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
DEBEMAIL <br>
If this is set, the From: line in the email will be set to
use this email address instead of your normal email address
(as would be determined by mail).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBFULLNAME <br>
If DEBEMAIL is set, DEBFULLNAME is examined to determine the
full name to use; if this is not set, bts attempts to
determine a name from your passwd entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BROWSER <br>
If set, it specifies the browser to use for the show and
bugs options. See the description above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced by a shell in that order to set
configuration variables. Command line options can be used to
<br>
override configuration file settings. Environment variable
settings are ignored for this purpose. The currently
recognised variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_OFFLINE <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the --offline
command line parameter being used. Only has an effect on the
show and bugs commands. The default is no. See the <br>
description of the show command above for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_CACHE <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the --no-cache
command line parameter being used. Only has an effect on the
show and bug commands. The default is yes. Again, <br>
see the show command above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_CACHE_MODE={min,mbox,full}
<br>
How much of the BTS should we mirror when we are asked to
cache something? Just the minimum, or also the mbox or the
whole thing? The default is min, and it has the same <br>
meaning as the --cache-mode command line parameter. Only has
an effect on the cache. See the cache command for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_FORCE_REFRESH <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the
--force-refresh command line parameter being used. Only has
an effect on the cache command. The default is no. See the
<br>
cache command for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_MAIL_READER <br>
If this is set, specifies a mail reader to use instead of
mutt. Same as the --mailreader command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND <br>
If this is set, specifies a sendmail command to use instead
of /usr/sbin/sendmail. Same as the --sendmail command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_ONLY_NEW <br>
Download only new bugs when caching. Do not check for
updates in bugs we already have. The default is no. Same as
the --only-new command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SMTP_HOST <br>
If this is set, specifies an SMTP host to use for sending
mail rather than using the sendmail command. Same as the
--smtp-host command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option takes
priority over BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND if both are set, unless
the --sendmail option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME,
BTS_SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD <br>
If these options are set, then it is the same as the
--smtp-username and --smtp-password options being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SMTP_HELO <br>
Same as the --smtp-helo command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_INCLUDE_RESOLVED <br>
If this is set to no, then it is the same as the
--no-include-resolved command line parameter being used.
Only has an effect on the cache command. The default is yes.
See <br>
the cache command for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SUPPRESS_ACKS <br>
If this is set to yes, then it is the same as the --no-ack
command line parameter being used. The default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_INTERACTIVE <br>
If this is set to yes or force, then it is the same as the
--interactive or --force-interactive command line parameter
being used. The default is no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_DEFAULT_CC <br>
Specify a list of e-mail addresses to which a carbon copy of
the generated e-mail to the control bot should automatically
be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SERVER <br>
Specify the name of a debbugs server which should be used
instead of https://bugs.debian.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
