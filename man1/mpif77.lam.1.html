<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mpif77 - Compile LAM FORTRAN programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mpif77 [-showme|-showme:compile|-showme:link] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-showme <br>
Does not invoke the underlying FORTRAN compiler. Instead, it
shows the full command line that would be executed to
compile the FORTRAN program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showme:compile <br>
Does not invoke the underlying FORTRAN compiler. Instead, it
shows the compiler flags that would be supplied to the
FORTRAN compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showme:link <br>
Does not invoke the underlying FORTRAN compiler. Instead, it
shows the linker flags that would be supplied to the FORTRAN
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See f77(1) (or whatever your
underlying FORTRAN compiler is) for all other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mpif77 is a convenience wrapper for the local native FORTRAN
compiler. Translation of a LAM program requires the linkage
of the LAM essential services libraries which may not <br>
reside in one of the standard search directories of ld(1).
mpif77 passes its arguments along to the local native
FORTRAN compiler along with the -L and -l options required
by <br>
LAM/MPI programs. This includes all necessary options for
ROMIO and/or C++ bindings support (if ROMIO/C++ support was
included when LAM was compiled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LAM Team strongly encourages
using mpif77 instead of attempting to link to the LAM
libraries manually. This allows the specific implementation
of LAM to change without forc&acirc; <br>
ing changes to linker directives in users&rsquo; Makefiles
(the specific set of underlying LAM libraries has already
changed multiple times, and will likely change again in
future ver&acirc; <br>
sions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indeed, since mpif77 is a very
thin wrapper on top of an underlying compiler, there are
very, very few compelling reasons not to use mpif77. When it
is not possible to use <br>
mpif77, the -showme:compile and -showme:link arguments
should be used instead. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ f77 -c file1.f
&lsquo;mpif77 -showme:compile&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ f77 -c file2.f
&lsquo;mpif77 -showme:compile&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ f77 file1.o file2.o
&lsquo;mpif77 -showme:link&lsquo; -o my_mpi_program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
By default, mpif77 uses the FORTRAN compiler that was
selected when LAM was configured (with the --with-fc flag to
./configure) as the local native FORTRAN compiler, but this
can <br>
be overridden by the LAMMPIF77 environment variable (an
older name for this environment variable is LAMHF77 -- this
also still works, but its use is deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
LAMHOME is set, mpif77 will use its value as the location of
the LAM installation directory instead of the value that was
compiled into mpif77. This <br>
means that mpif77 will use the value of LAMHOME as the base
to create the -I and -L arguments that are passed to the
lower-level compiler, not the installation directory that
was <br>
supplied when mpif77 was created. This is almost always a
Bad Idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of LAMHOME is
discouraged except for some rare configuration cases in
oddly networked sites (in which case your system
administrator should probably set this up), and for <br>
advanced users with multiple LAM/MPI installations who
really know what they are doing; if the LAMHOME environment
variable is unintentionally left set, it can lead to
tremendous <br>
user confusion. For example, if LAMHOME points to LAM
installation A, but the user&rsquo;s PATH points to LAM
installation B, then even though B&rsquo;s mpif77 will be
used, the user pro&acirc; <br>
gram will be compiled and linked against LAM installation
A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LAMHOME environment variable
is mainly only left in place for backwards compatibility; it
is not required for normal functioning of LAM/MPI. The LAM
Team discourages the use <br>
of the LAMHOME environment variable, and instead advocates
simply setting the PATH properly to switch between multiple
LAM/MPI implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Previous versions of LAM encouraged the use of hf77 to
compile LAM and/or MPI Fortran applications. In very old
versions of LAM, hf77 did not automatically add -lmpi to the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line. hf77 was eventually deprecated and replaced with
mpif77. The executable hf77 is now simply a symbolic link to
mpif77 just in case there&rsquo;s anyone out there that
still <br>
uses that name. It should be harmless to pass in the
additional -lmpi; mpif77 should silently do the Right Thing
(only link in the MPI library once).</p>
