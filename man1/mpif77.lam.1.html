<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>mpif77</i> is a convenience wrapper for the local native FORTRAN compiler.
  Translation of a LAM program requires the linkage of the LAM essential
  services libraries which may not reside in one of the standard search
  directories of ld(1). <i>mpif77</i> passes its arguments along to the local
  native FORTRAN compiler along with the -L and -l options required by LAM/MPI
  programs. This includes all necessary options for ROMIO and/or C++ bindings
  support (if ROMIO/C++ support was included when LAM was compiled).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The LAM Team <i>strongly</i> encourages using <i>mpif77</i> instead of
  attempting to link to the LAM libraries manually. This allows the specific
  implementation of LAM to change without forcing changes to linker directives
  in users' Makefiles (the specific set of underlying LAM libraries has already
  changed multiple times, and will likely change again in future versions).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Indeed, since <i>mpif77</i> is a very thin wrapper on top of an underlying
  compiler, there are very, very few compelling reasons <i>not</i> to use
  <i>mpif77</i>. When it is not possible to use <i>mpif77</i>, the
  <i>-showme:compile</i> and <i>-showme:link</i> arguments should be used
  instead. For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
shell$ f77 -c file1.f `mpif77 -showme:compile`
<div class="Pp"></div>
shell$ f77 -c file2.f `mpif77 -showme:compile`
<div class="Pp"></div>
shell$ f77 file1.o file2.o `mpif77 -showme:link` -o my_mpi_program
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
By default, <i>mpif77</i> uses the FORTRAN compiler that was selected when LAM
  was configured (with the --with-fc flag to ./configure) as the local native
  FORTRAN compiler, but this can be overridden by the LAMMPIF77 environment
  variable (an older name for this environment variable is LAMHF77 -- this also
  still works, but its use is deprecated).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the environment variable <i>LAMHOME</i> is set, <i>mpif77</i> will use its
  value as the location of the LAM installation directory instead of the value
  that was compiled into <i>mpif77</i>. This means that <i>mpif77</i> will use
  the value of <i>LAMHOME</i> as the base to create the -I and -L arguments that
  are passed to the lower-level compiler, not the installation directory that
  was supplied when <i>mpif77</i> was created. This is almost always a Bad Idea.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The use of <i>LAMHOME</i> is discouraged except for some rare configuration
  cases in oddly networked sites (in which case your system administrator should
  probably set this up), and for advanced users with multiple LAM/MPI
  installations who really know what they are doing; if the <i>LAMHOME</i>
  environment variable is unintentionally left set, it can lead to tremendous
  user confusion. For example, if <i>LAMHOME</i> points to LAM installation A,
  but the user's <i>PATH</i> points to LAM installation B, then even though B's
  <i>mpif77</i> will be used, the user program will be compiled and linked
  against LAM installation A.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>LAMHOME</i> environment variable is mainly only left in place for
  backwards compatibility; it is not required for normal functioning of LAM/MPI.
  The LAM Team discourages the use of the <i>LAMHOME</i> environment variable,
  and instead advocates simply setting the <i>PATH</i> properly to switch
  between multiple LAM/MPI implementations.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Previous versions of LAM encouraged the use of <i>hf77</i> to compile LAM and/or
  MPI Fortran applications. In very old versions of LAM, <i>hf77</i> did not
  automatically add <i>-lmpi</i> to the command line. <i>hf77</i> was eventually
  deprecated and replaced with <i>mpif77</i>. The executable <i>hf77</i> is now
  simply a symbolic link to <i>mpif77</i> just in case there's anyone out there
  that still uses that name. It should be harmless to pass in the additional
  <i>-lmpi</i>; <i>mpif77</i> should silently do the Right Thing (only link in
  the MPI library once).
