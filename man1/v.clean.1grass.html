<p style="margin-top: 1em">threshold=float[,float,...] <br>
Threshold in map units, one value for each tool <br>
Default: 0.0[,0.0,...])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
v.clean allows the user to automatically fix topology of
vector maps. Several tools may be listed to be executed
sequentially. In this case, also the threshold parameter
requires <br>
several values to be listed accordingly. An error map is
optionally written which stores the erroneous
geometries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Break lines/boundaries <br>
tool=break</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The break tool breaks
lines/boundaries at intersections and it also breaks
lines/boundaries forming a collapsed loop. For example,
0.0;1.0;0.0 is broken at 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply (it is
ignored), use an arbitrary value (e.g., 0) if v.clean is run
with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: Breaking lines should be
followed by removing duplicates, e.g. v.clean ...
tool=break,rmdupl. If the -c flag is used with v.clean ...
tool=break, duplicates are automati&acirc; <br>
cally removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove duplicate geometry
features <br>
tool=rmdupl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmdupl tool removes geometry
features with identical coordinates. Categories are merged.
If a point and a centroid have identical coordinates, one of
them will be removed if <br>
both points and centroids are selected with v.clean ...
type=point,centroid. The same applies for lines and
boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply (it is
ignored), use an arbitrary value (e.g., 0) if v.clean is run
with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmdupl tool should be used
after breaking lines and breaking polygons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove dangles or change
boundary dangles to type line <br>
tool=rmdangle and tool=chdangle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line/boundary is considered to
be a dangle if no other line of given type is on at least
one end node. If a dangle is formed by several lines, such a
string of lines is taken <br>
as one dangle and line lengths are summarized. The rmdangle
tool deletes a dangle if the (combined) length is shorter
than thresh or thresh &lt; 0. If the combined length is
larger <br>
than thresh, nothing is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold has to be given as
maximum line/boundary length in map units; for
latitude-longitude locations in degree. Dangles shorter than
thresh are removed sequentially. All dan&acirc; <br>
gles will be removed if thresh &lt; 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With thresh &lt; 0, only closed
loops and lines connecting loops will remain. This is useful
to remove all incorrect boundaries after other cleaning
operations with thres is &lt; 0. <br>
Areas can then be successfully built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To preferentially remove
shortest dangles first, a first pass with a small thresh
value can be followed by subsequent passes with higher
thresh values. This can be done as one <br>
v.clean job by listing the tool several times and by
defining a list of increasing thresh values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chdangle tool is similar to
the rmdangle tool, but works only on boundaries and changes
dangling boundaries to lines instead of removing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove or change bridges
connecting an area and an island or two islands <br>
tool=rmbridge and tool=chbridge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bridge is an area type
connection of an island (polygon in a polygon) to the outer
polygon. This is topologically incorrect (but OGC Simple
Features allow it). The rmbridge <br>
tool removes bridges and the chbridge tool changes bridges
to type line: <br>
+-------------+ +-------------+ +-------------+ <br>
| P| P: polygon | P| | P| <br>
| +---+ | I: island | +---+ | | +---+ | <br>
| | I | | B: bridge | | I | | | | I | | <br>
| | | | L: line | | | | | | | | <br>
| +-+-+ | | +---+ | | +-.-+ | <br>
| | | | | | . | <br>
| | B | | | | . L | <br>
| | | | | | . | <br>
+------+------+ +-------------+ +-------------+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Islands and areas must be
already clean, i.e. without dangles or small angles, e.g.
v.clean ... type=boundary
tool=rmdangle,rmsa,break,rmdupl,rmbridge
thresh=-1,0,0,0,0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply (it is
ignored), use an arbitrary value (e.g., 0) if v.clean is run
with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap lines to vertex in
threshold <br>
tool=snap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The snap tool snaps vertices to
another vertex not farther away than thresh. If there is no
other vertex within thresh, no snapping will be done. The
type option can have a <br>
strong influence on the result. A too large threshold and
type=boundary can severely damage area topology, beyond
repair.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold gives maximum distance
to another vertex in map units, for latitude-longitude
locations in degree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snapped boundaries may need to
be cleaned with break,rmdupl,rmsa. If the -c flag is used
with v.clean tool=snap, the sequence of break,rmdupl,rmsa is
automatically repeated <br>
after snapping until no more small angles a left. Additional
cleaning with e.g. tool=rmdanglemay be necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove duplicate area centroids
<br>
tool=rmdac</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmdac tool removes duplicate
area centroids that can result from deleting boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply (it is
ignored), use an arbitrary value (e.g., 0) if v.clean is run
with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Break (topologically clean)
areas (imported from a non topological <br>
format like ShapeFile) tool=bpol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bpol tool breaks boundaries
on each point shared between 2 and more areas where angles
of boundary segments are different and on all boundary nodes
(start and end points of <br>
each boundary). The bpol tool behaves similar to break for
boundaries, but does not break collapsed loops. The bpol
tool is faster than the break tool but needs more
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply (it is
ignored), use an arbitrary value (e.g., 0) if v.clean is run
with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bpol tool should be followed
by rmdupl. If the -c flag is used with v.clean ...
tool=bpol, duplicates are automatically removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove vertices in threshold
from lines and boundaries <br>
tool=prune</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prune tool simplifies lines
and boundaries by removing vertices according to threshold.
This tool preserves area topology, areas are never deleted
and centroid attachment is <br>
never changed. v.generalize offers much more functionality
for line simplification but does not preserve area
topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove small areas <br>
tool=rmarea</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmarea tool removes all
areas &lt;= thresh. The longest boundary with an adjacent
area is removed or all boundaries if there is no adjacent
area. Area categories are not com&acirc; <br>
bined when a small area is merged with a larger area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold must always be in
square meters, also for latitude-longitude locations or
locations with units other than meters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove all lines or boundaries
of zero length <br>
tool=rmline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmline tool removes all
lines or boundaries of zero length that may have resulted
from other cleaning operations. Zero length boundaries are
redundant and do not influence <br>
area topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply (it is
ignored), use an arbitrary value (e.g., 0) if v.clean is run
with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove small angles between
lines at nodes <br>
tool=rmsa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmsa tool only concerns
angles which are so small that the calculated angle is 0.
The following figure should help demonstrate what the tool
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Threshold does not apply, use
dummy value if v.clean is run with several tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tool=rmsa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rmsa tool should be followed
by break,rmdupl. The rmsa tool followed by break,rmdupl may
need to be run more than once to remove all small angles. If
the -c flag is used with <br>
v.clean ... tool=rmsa, the sequence of rmsa,break,rmdupl is
automatically repeated until no more small angles a
left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The user does not have to run v.build on the output vector,
unless the -b flag was used. The -b flag affects only the
output vector - topology is always built for error
vector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Snap lines to vertex in threshold <br>
v.clean input=testmap output=cleanmap tool=snap
threshold=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cleaning OGR imported data
(Simple Feature data) such as SHAPE file <br>
The import of areas with v.in.ogr -c (no cleaning) requires
a subsequent run of v.clean to update the map to a
topologically valid structure (removal of duplicate
collinear lines <br>
etc). The tools used for that are bpol and rmdupl: <br>
v.clean input=areamap output=areamap_clean tool=bpol,rmdupl
type=boundary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extracting intersection points
of vector lines <br>
v.clean input=lines1 output=lines2 err=points tool=break
type=line <br>
Intersection points are written to &acirc;points&acirc;
map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Break lines <br>
v.clean will break the lines where they cross, creating new
node if needed. Example: <br>
v.in.ascii -n out=crossed_lines format=standard &lt;&lt; EOF
