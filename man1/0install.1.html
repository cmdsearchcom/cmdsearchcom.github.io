<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Zero Install is a decentralised cross-distribution software
installation system. Programs and libraries are identified
by URIs, and there is no need for a central repository. <br>
Zero Install ensures that packages cannot conflict with each
other and that programs can be shared between mutually
untrusting users. See the web-site for more information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://0install.net/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest case is to ask
0install to run a program, given its URI. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install run
http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/Edit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first time you do this,
details about available versions of the program are
downloaded and cached, along with details about any
libraries it depends on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zero Install will run a solver
to select the best version of each component to use. For
example, it will select binaries that are compatible with
your CPU and operating system, <br>
in your preferred language, and marked &quot;stable&quot;
(by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If $DISPLAY is set, 0install
will display a window where you can confirm (or change) the
selected versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will then download the
corresponding archives for those versions and store them in
the cache too. Each package unpacks to its own
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, 0install will launch
the program, setting environment variables to let it locate
its libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
The first non-option argument to 0install is the particular
sub-command you want to perform; these are described in
detail in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, there are some options
that apply to all operations. These are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --console <br>
Never use the GUI. Normally, 0install switches to graphical
mode if it needs to download anything from the network
(unless DISPLAY is not set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dry-run <br>
Do not save any changes to disk, and do not actually run the
program. Instead, just print out the changes that would have
been made. Note that, as 0install is a very safe <br>
system, there is generally no need to use this option.
However, it can be useful as a learning aid or for
testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show the built-in help text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --offline <br>
Run in off-line mode, overriding the default setting. This
prevents 0install from checking for updates, and from
downloading updates even if it knows about them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
More verbose output. Use twice for even more verbose
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-store=DIR <br>
Append a directory to the list of implementation caches.
Each sub-directory of DIR contains the contents of one
version of a program or library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUB-COMMANDS <br>
0install select [OPTIONS] URI <br>
Select a version of the program identified by URI, and
compatible versions of all of its dependencies. The
information about available versions is downloaded if
it&rsquo;s not yet in <br>
the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The URI can be an HTTP URL, such
as &lsquo;http://site/program.xml&rsquo; or a local path
name like &lsquo;file:///path/to/program.xml&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For HTTP URLs, the remote file
is a signed XML document. If the key is not known and
trusted, you will be prompted to accept it first. Local feed
files are not signed (any signa&acirc; <br>
ture will be ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also specify a local
selections document, as created previously using the --xml
option, rather than a feed. In that case, 0install simply
uses those versions without run&acirc; <br>
ning the solver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After selecting (but not
downloading) a set of versions, the selection is displayed
in a human-readable format. Use --xml to get
machine-readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a set of versions cannot be
selected using the cached information, 0install will check
for updates first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a set of versions can be
selected based on the currently-cached information, but that
information is getting stale, 0install will immediately
return the current selection and <br>
will also start a background process to check for updates.
The &lsquo;freshness&rsquo; configuration setting controls
when cached information is considered to be stale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for select:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--before=VERSION <br>
Select a version earlier than VERSION (i.e. force the use of
an old version of the program). You can only restrict the
version of the program itself using this option, not <br>
the version of any dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--command=COMMAND <br>
Some programs provide multiple commands. This selects which
one you want. Common values are &lsquo;run&rsquo; (the
default), &lsquo;test&rsquo; (used by 0test) and
&lsquo;compile&rsquo; (used by 0compile). <br>
You can also use --command=&quot;&quot; if you don&rsquo;t
want to run any command (for example, if the package
contains data rather than a program).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--may-compile <br>
Treat every source implementation as a potential binary.
This can be used to find what needs to be compiled to run a
program. Currently this is only available for <br>
&quot;0install select&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--message=MESSAGE <br>
If we show a dialog box for the download, display MESSAGE to
the user to explain why the download is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--not-before=VERSION <br>
The selected version must not be earlier than VERSION. e.g.
if you want to run version 2.0 or later, use
--not-before=2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh <br>
Download a fresh copy of all used feeds before selecting.
Normally, cached copies will be used if available (checking
for updates later, in the background).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source <br>
Select source code rather than a binary. This is used
internally by &lsquo;0compile&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version=RANGE <br>
Require a version of the main program within the given
range. This can be a simple number (e.g. --version=2.3) or a
range (e.g. --version=2.3..!2.7). For ranges, either <br>
end may be omitted. The &quot;!&quot; indicates that the
range excludes the final value. Alternatives can be
separated by &quot;|&quot;, e.g. &quot;2.6..!3 | 3.2..&quot;
(allows 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, etc, but <br>
not 2.5 or 3.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also force a particular
implementation by its ID, using the syntax
&quot;=FEED/ID&quot;. ID must be escaped: Letters, digits,
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, &rsquo;.&rsquo;, and characters &gt; 127
stay as they <br>
are; &quot;/&quot; becomes &quot;__&quot;; and other
characters become &quot;_code_&quot;, where code is the
lowercase hex value of the byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version-for=URI RANGE <br>
Specifies the range (as for --version) for any library or
sub-component. If URI is the URI of the main program then
this is equivalent to using --version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xml Print the set of chosen
implementations as an XML document to stdout. This can be
used later with the &lsquo;download&rsquo; and
&lsquo;run&rsquo; sub-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;select&rsquo; returns an
exit status of zero if it selected a set of versions, and a
status of 1 if it could not find a consistent set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install download [OPTIONS] URI
<br>
This behaves similarly to &lsquo;0install select&rsquo;,
except that it also downloads the selected versions if they
are not already cached. Unlike &lsquo;select&rsquo;, it does
not print the selected <br>
versions by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options for
&lsquo;select&rsquo; can also be used for
&lsquo;download&rsquo;. In addition, these options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show Print the selected
versions in a human-readable format to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;download&rsquo; returns
an exit status of zero if it selected a suitable set of
versions and they are now all downloaded and in the cache.
It returns a status of 1 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install run [OPTIONS] URI
[ARGS] <br>
This behaves similarly to &lsquo;0install download&rsquo;,
except that it also runs the program after ensuring it is in
the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid having to keep typing
the full URI, use the &lsquo;0install add&rsquo; command to
create shortcuts to run your programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options for
&lsquo;select&rsquo; can also be used for &lsquo;run&rsquo;
except for --xml. In addition, these options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --main=MAIN <br>
Run the specified executable instead of the default. If MAIN
starts with &rsquo;/&rsquo; then the path is relative to the
implementation&rsquo;s top-level directory, whereas
otherwise it is <br>
relative to the directory containing the default MAIN
program. For example, if the default MAIN is bin/svn then
using --main=svnadmin will run .../bin/svnadmin instead.
<br>
This option has been largely superseded by the newer
--command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wrapper=WRAPPER <br>
Instead of executing the chosen program directly, run
WRAPPER PROGRAM ARGS. This is useful for running debuggers
and tracing tools on the program (rather than on <br>
0install!). Note that the wrapper is executed in the
environment selected by the program; hence, this mechanism
cannot be used for sandboxing. See the DEBUGGING section
<br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that any options after
&lsquo;URI&rsquo; will be passed to the program being run
rather than being interpreted by 0install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;run&rsquo; returns an
exit status of 1 if the download step failed. Otherwise, the
exit status will be the exit status of the program being
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install update [OPTIONS] URI
<br>
Check for updates to the program and download them if found.
This is similar to 0install download --refresh, except that
it prints information about whether any changes were <br>
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are the same as for
&lsquo;select&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install import FEED <br>
Import a feed from a local file, as if it had been
downloaded from the network. This is useful when testing a
feed file, to avoid uploading it to a remote server in order
to <br>
download it again. The file must have a trusted digital
signature, as when fetching from the network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also useful when
installing a feed from a CD or similar. Note: to create a
full bundle, for archiving or distribution on CD, see
0export(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install add-feed [INTERFACE]
FEED <br>
Register an additional source of implementations (versions)
of a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, when you check out
a developer version of a project, it may contain an XML feed
file. To add this version to the list of available versions,
use &lsquo;add-feed&rsquo; on the <br>
XML file. The file is not copied, so you don&rsquo;t need to
re-add the feed each time it is updated. You will probably
also want to set the &lsquo;help_with_testing&rsquo;
configuration option to <br>
ensure that testing versions are selected by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you just want to
run the program, you can invoke 0install on the feed file
directly (without using &lsquo;add-feed&rsquo;). This will
force the it to use that version, but won&rsquo;t <br>
affect what happens when you run it using the URI as normal.
Use &lsquo;add-feed&rsquo; when you want to use the
developer version even when using the URI, or if the program
is a library <br>
(and thus referenced by URI by other programs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install remove-feed [INTERFACE]
FEED <br>
Un-register a feed, reversing the effect of
&lsquo;add-feed&rsquo;. If INTERFACE is not given, you will
be prompted to choose which INTERFACE to remove it from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install list-feeds URI <br>
List all extra feeds added to URI using
&lsquo;add-feed&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install list [PATTERN] <br>
List all locally-cached interface (program) URIs. If a
search term is given, only URIs containing that string are
shown (case insensitive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install search QUERY <br>
Send the query string to the mirror server and display any
interfaces it returns. Note that the default mirror server
indexes all known feeds, regardless of quality; you must
<br>
decide whether to trust the programs before running
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install config [NAME [VALUE]]
<br>
View or change configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments,
&lsquo;0install config&rsquo; displays all configuration
settings. With one argument, it displays the current value
of the named setting. With two arguments, it sets the <br>
setting to the given value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install man COMMAND <br>
Show the man-page of the given command. If the single
argument COMMAND is a launcher script (created by
&quot;0install add&quot;) then the man-page is searched for
by 0install, otherwise <br>
the arguments are passed through directly to the
system&rsquo;s man command. This allows you to do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias man=&quot;0install man
--&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install digest DIRECTORY |
ARCHIVE [EXTRACT] <br>
Calculate the secure hash of an implementation. This is a
unique &quot;fingerprint&quot; of a directory and all the
files and subdirectories it contains. When publishing a
program using <br>
0install, this value must be placed in the XML file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --algorithm=HASH <br>
Select the secure hash function to be used. Supported values
are &quot;sha1new&quot; (the default), &quot;sha256&quot;
and &quot;sha256new&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an archive is given then the
hash is for the directory that would be created if the
archive were unpacked (or the EXTRACT subdirectory of it, if
one is specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --manifest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --digest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options control whether to
display the manifest itself (one line for each file or
directory) or the manifest&rsquo;s digest (or both). If
neither option is given, the digest is <br>
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install --version <br>
This can be used (without any command) the get version of
0install itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATIONS <br>
An application provides an easy way to run a program without
typing the full URL each time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install add NAME URI <br>
Creates a new application called NAME (which can be whatever
you want) to run the program URI. A directory (by default,
~/.config/0install.net/apps/NAME) is created to record the
<br>
current selections, as would be produced by &quot;0install
select --xml URI&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A launcher command (also called
NAME) will be created in $PATH to provide an easy way to run
the application. For example, to add and run ROX-Filer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ 0install add rox
http://rox.sourceforge.net/2005/interfaces/ROX-Filer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If additional requirements are
given (as for &quot;0install select&quot;, e.g. --before),
they are stored with the application and apply to all
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install show NAME | SELECTIONS
<br>
Show the current selections for this application (or the
contents of the given selections file). By default, the
output is in the same format as for &quot;0install
select&quot;, and the <br>
--xml option has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --root-uri <br>
Just display the root interface URI (e.g. the URI passed to
&quot;0install add&quot; when this application was
created).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install update NAME <br>
The feeds used to make the selections are updated and a new
set of selections is generated and saved into the
application&rsquo;s directory. Even if you don&rsquo;t run
this command explic&acirc; <br>
itly, 0install will check for updates if you run the program
and it hasn&rsquo;t been updated for a while. This happens
in the background and does not delay starting the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If additional requirements are
given (as for &quot;0install select&quot;, e.g. --before),
they update the requirements stored with the application and
apply to this and future updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install whatchanged NAME <br>
Show the differences between the current and previous
selections for this application. Various times may also be
displayed: &quot;Last checked&quot; is the last time we
successfully <br>
checked for updates (even if none was found), &quot;Last
attempted update&quot; is the last time we tried to check
for updates, and &quot;Last update&quot; is the last time
changes were found. If <br>
&quot;Last attempted update&quot; is shown, then either the
last updated failed or an update is currently in
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, only changes that
resulted in a different version being selected are shown. To
see all changes, use --full. Note that at most one set of
selections is saved per day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install destroy NAME <br>
The application NAME is deleted, along with any launchers
added for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install store ... <br>
Provides low-level access to the store of cached
implementations. See the 0store(1) man-page for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0install slave <br>
Run 0install in slave mode (currently EXPERIMENTAL and
likely to change). You can send JSON requests to the
process&rsquo;s standard input and receive responses from
its standard out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING TIPS <br>
To debug 0install itself, use the --verbose and --console
options. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ 0install -vvc run
http://myprog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To trace or debug programs run
by 0install, use the --wrapper option. For example, to run
myprog --help, displaying all calls to open(2):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ 0install run
--wrapper=&quot;strace -e open&quot; http://myprog
--help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run the application under the
gdb debugger:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ 0install run
--wrapper=&quot;gdb --args&quot; http://myprog --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Configuration files (see freedesktop.org basedir spec):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/0install.net/injector/global
<br>
Global configuration settings.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/0install.net/injector/trustdb.xml
<br>
List of trusted keys.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/0install.net/injector/feeds
<br>
Per-feed information (e.g. time of last check).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.config/0install.net/injector/interfaces
<br>
Per-interface settings (preferred stability and any extra
feeds that have been registered).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cached data (can be
re-downloaded if lost):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.cache/0install.net/interfaces
<br>
Downloaded cached feed files.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.cache/0install.net/implementations
<br>
Downloaded cached implementations, indexed by manifest
digest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the 0store(1) man page for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
XDG_* The configuration and cache directories can be changed
using XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_DIRS, XDG_CACHE_HOME and
XDG_CACHE_DIRS, as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is set, then the XDG_
variables are ignored and the configuration and cache are
stored in $ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE/config and
$ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE/cache <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZEROINSTALL_EXTERNAL_STORE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When 0install wants to add an
archive to the cache, it calls this program instead of doing
it itself. This is used internally on Windows to connect to
some .NET code. It <br>
may change in future.</p>
