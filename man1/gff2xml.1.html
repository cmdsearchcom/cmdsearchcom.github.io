<p>GFF2XML(1) BSD General Commands Manual GFF2XML(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gff2xml &acirc; BioWare GFF to XML converter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gff2xml [options] input_file [output_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gff2xml converts BioWare&rsquo;s GFF files (versions
V3.2/V3.3 and V4.0/V4.1) into human-readable XML. GFF are
hierarchical data files, similar to XML in concept, but
stored in binary. <br>
As such, these files are used as a basis for many of the
file formats found in the BioWare games. For example, an UTC
file is a GFF holding a template for a creature, while a GUI
<br>
file is a GFF describing an in-game menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both version 3 of the format
(V3.2/V3.3) and version 4 (V4.0/V4.1) are supported. While
they are similar, the 4th version carries several changes to
make the files more efficient <br>
to read in-game. This includes replacing the string field
names (which map to XML tags) with numerical identifiers,
resulting in converted XML files that are stripped of their
<br>
meaning. To compensate, this tool adds readable aliases to
many of these numerical identifiers, giving them back their
meaning. Unfortunately, not all of them are known. Most <br>
notably, the identifiers introduced in Sonic Chronicles: The
Dark Brotherhood and Dragon Age 2 are still missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The changes in the minor
versions (V3.2 vs. V3.3 and V4.0 vs. V4.1) are less
significant. V3.3 simply changes which languages are
supported, and V4.1 adds a common string table <br>
at the start of the file. Both of these additions are
handled transparently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h <br>
--help <br>
Show a help text and exit. <br>
--version <br>
Show version information and exit. <br>
--cp1252 <br>
Read GFF4 strings as Windows CP-1252. Usually, strings in
version 4 of the GFF format are encoded in little-endian
UTF-16. But some files store them as Windows CP-1252 <br>
instead. Since there&rsquo;s no clean way to autodetect the
different encoding, this switch manually selects Windows
CP-1252. <br>
--nwnpremium <br>
The GFF files found in the encrypted HAK files of
Neverwinter Nights premium modules are deliberately broken.
This options tells gff2xml to work around the brokenness.
<br>
input_file <br>
The GFF file to convert. <br>
[output_file] <br>
The XML file will be written there. If no output file is
specified, the XML data is written to stdout. The encoding
of the XML stream is always UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Convert the GFF file1.utc into an XML file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gff2xml file1.utc
file2.xml</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convert the GFF file1.utc into
an XML file on stdout:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gff2xml file1.utc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convert the GFF file1.utc, which
uses Windows CP-1252 strings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gff2xml --cp1252 file1.utc
file2.xml</p>
