<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ski is an IA-64 instruction set simulator from
Hewlett-Packard Company. It simulates the IA-64 architecture
as defined by the architecture manual. This is not a full
platform <br>
simulator, i.e., no system chipset or PCI bus simulation is
done. However it supports the full instruction set of the
architecture, including privileged instructions and
associ&acirc; <br>
ated semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ski can be used in two operating
mode: user- and system-mode. In user mode, you can run user
level applications directly on top of the simulator. The
emulation stops at the sys&acirc; <br>
tem call boundary. The system call is emulated by calling
the host OS, such as x86 Linux. Conversions between 64-bit
and 32-bit parameters are done by Ski as needed. This allows
<br>
fast execution of user programs. Most system calls are
emulated, though the emulation is not always 100 percent
accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In system-mode, operating-system
kernel development and execution is possible because
interrupts and virtual memory behaviors are simulated. In
this mode you can actually run the <br>
Linux kernel and, once booted, user applications can be run
on top of the simulated kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ski simulator comes with
three different interfaces. The simplest one is the batch
mode, called bskinc a shell running a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a full-text
curses-based mode, where you can interact with the simulator
to inspect code, set breakpoints, etc. This version is
called ski</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally there is a graphical
version called xski which gives you several windows where
you can look at the code, inspect register contents,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All three modes provides the
same core simulation, only the interface is different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help Prints the list of supported options for the specific
interface required. Not all options are available in every
possible interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nonet When running in kernel
mode, this option tells the simulator not to probe for
existing Ethernet interfaces on the host. This way the Linux
kernel won&rsquo;t detect any device. <br>
This option is useful when you don&rsquo;t want to run the
simulator as root (or setuid to root). For networking
support root privilege is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-srcroot directory <br>
Specify the directory where the program sources can be
found. This option is only useful when combined the
&quot;mixed mode&quot; display (see the &quot;pm&quot;
command inside Ski).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noconsole <br>
Do not use an xterm as the default output console, but use
the current tty. This option is only useful when ski is
invoked in batch mode. It allows to run in the current <br>
terminal window. This is used mostly within the NUE(1)
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-forceuser <br>
Force the simulator into user-mode. The simulator normally
auto-detects which mode to run in, but this option is
available to force user-mode in case auto-detection fails
<br>
for some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-forcesystem <br>
Force the simulator into system-mode. The simulator normally
auto-detects which mode to run in, but this option is
available to force system-mode in case auto-detection <br>
fails for some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strace <br>
This option displays all the system calls executed by the
user level programs. It is only valid when running in
user-mode. The output looks like a highly simplified
ver&acirc; <br>
sion of output from strace(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i file <br>
Process initialization &lt;file&gt; at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-icnt Store instruction counts
in &lt;file&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rest Restore simulation state
from &lt;file&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stats Display execution
run-time and instruction rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-palen &lt;n&gt; <br>
Implemented physical address bits. Default: n=63</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-valen &lt;n&gt; <br>
Implemented virtual address bits. Default: n=61</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ridlen &lt;n&gt; <br>
Implemented RR.rid bits. Default: n=24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keylen &lt;n&gt; <br>
Implemented PKR.key bits. Default: n=24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grlen &lt;n&gt; <br>
General Register file size. Default: n=128</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running in user-mode <br>
To run a simple IA-64 program in user-mode only, you can
type in the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ bskinc my_ia64_prg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will force execution is the
current terminal and in batch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPORTANT: To run dynamically
linked IA-64 binaries, it is necessary to have IA-64
versions of the necessary shared libraries installed. On x86
Linux, this is most easily accom&acirc; <br>
plished by installing the NUE(1) environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running in system-mode <br>
To run a Linux kernel on top of the simulator, you need
several components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a Linux kernel compiled to use
the HP-simulator. It needs to have the CONFIG_SIMSERIAL,
CONFIG_SIMSCSI, and CONFIG_SIMETH options turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a boot loader that goes with
it (compiled with &quot;make boot&quot; in the kernel source
tree).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- a disk image file with IA-64
binaries on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to extra
documentation to learn in greater details how to build those
3 components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have those components,
you launch execution by simply typing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ski bootloader vmlinux
simscsi=/path/sd simeth=eth0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the simscsi=
option informs the Linux kernel where to find the SCSI disk
images. Here /path/sd is just the prefix, the kernel will
automatically look for <br>
/path/sd{a,b,c,...}. So the disk image must use the full
name, i.e., /path/sda. The simeth= indicates which local
interface to use for the simulated Ethernet driver. The
simula&acirc; <br>
tor must be run with root privilege to get the networking
emulation to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify other options on
the command line, just like you would do at the LILO boot
prompt for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting help inside ski <br>
When you run ski in interactive mode via ski or xski, you
can get help on commands by typing help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running in curses mode, you
must make sure that you have the PAGER environment variable
set to whatever is your preferred pager command. It is
usually set to more(1) or <br>
less(1). If the variable does not exist ski will default to
using less(1). Note that less(1) usually behaves the best
when interacting with ski.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using Xski <br>
In this version (1.1.0) of ski, the X11 interface has not
been built. If you would like such a GUI, please feel free
to contribute patches to convert the current Motif version
<br>
to something more modern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
SKI_USE_FAKE_XTERM <br>
If this environment variable is set (the value is
unimportant), the ski-fake-xterm(1) utility will be used for
output to stdout, instead of xterm(1). This will result in
<br>
a temporary file created in the current working directory
with a name of the form &quot;ski.XXXXXX&quot;, where
&quot;XXXXXX&quot; can be any six characters.</p>
