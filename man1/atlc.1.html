<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
atlc - an Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
atlc [-C] [-s] [-S] [-v] [-c cutoff] [-d rrggbb=Er] [-i
factor] [-i prefix] [-t threads] [-r rate_multiplier]
bitmapfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the
complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages
<br>
are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
time the version was produced may be found in <br>
/usr/share/doc/atlc/html-docs/index.html <br>
Sometimes, errors are corrected in the documentation and
placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release
of atlc is released. Please, if you notice a problem with
<br>
the documentation - even spelling errors and typos, please
let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
atlc is a finite difference program that is used to
calculate the properties of a two-conductor electrical
transmission line of arbitrary cross section. It is used
whenever there <br>
are no analytical formula known, yet you still require an
answer. It can calculate: <br>
The impedance Zo (in Ohms) <br>
The capacitance per unit length (pF/m) <br>
The inductance per unit length (nF/m) <br>
The velocity of propagation v (m/s) <br>
The velocity factor, v/c, which is dimensionless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bitmap file (usually with the
extension .bmp or .BMP) is drawn in a graphics package such
as Gimp available from http://www.gimp.org. The bitmap file
must be saved as a 24-bit <br>
(16,777,216 colour) uncompqessed file. The colours used in
the bitmap indicate whether the region is a conductor (pure
red, pure green or pure blue) or a dielectric (anything <br>
else). Pure white is assumed to be a vacuum dielectric, but
other colours have different meanings. See COLOURS below for
precise definitions of the colours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C <br>
print copyright, licensing and copying information. <br>
-s <br>
Skip writing the Ex, Ey, E, V, U and Er bitmap (.bmp) files
-S <br>
Skip writing the Ex, Ey, E, V, U and Er binary (.bin) files
<br>
-v <br>
makes the output more verbose/talkative. <br>
-c cutoff <br>
Sets the convergence criteria of the finite difference
program. The default is 0.0001, meaning two separate
iterations must be within 01% for the program to stop
iterating. Set&acirc; <br>
ting to a smaller positive number gives more accuracy, but
takes longer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d rrggbb=Er <br>
is used to indicate the colour 0xrrggbb in the bitmap is
used to represent a material with permittivity Er. See also
COLOURS below</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i factor <br>
is used to lighten or darken the .bmp electric field profile
images produced by atlc. Set factor &gt; 2 to lighten or
between 1 and 2 to darken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r ratemultiplier <br>
Sets the parameter &rsquo;r&rsquo; used internally when
computing the voltage at a point w,h. The default, which is
(as of version 3.0.0) 1.95, results in what is believed to
be optimal <br>
results. Setting to 1.0 will avoid the use of the fast
convergence method, which is generally not a good idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prefix <br>
Adds &rsquo;prefix&rsquo;, which is usually a directory
name, in front of the output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOURS <br>
The 24-bitmaps that atlc uses have 8 bits assigned to
represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green.
Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a
total <br>
of 256*256*256=16777216 colours. Every one of the possible
16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the stating the
exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">red = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
<br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 <br>
blue = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff <br>
black = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 <br>
white = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff <br>
Brown = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff <br>
gray = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some colours, such as pink,
turquiose, sandy, brown, gray etc may mean slightly
different things to different people. This is not so with
atlc, as the program expects the colours <br>
below to be exactly defined as given. Whether you feel the
colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in
your bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour reconised
<br>
by atlc, or you must define it with a command line option
(see OPTIONS). <br>
red = 255,000,000 or 0xFF0000 is the live conductor. <br>
green = 000,255,000 or 0x00FF00 is the grounded conductor.
<br>
blue = 000,000,255 or 0x0000FF is the negative conductor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All bitmaps must have the live
(red) and grounded (green) conductor. The blue conductor is
used to indicate a negative conductor, is needed when the
program is used to analyse <br>
directional couplers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following dielectrics are
reconised by atlc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">white 255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as
Er=1.0 (vacuum) <br>
pink 255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air) <br>
L. blue 130,052,255 or 0x8235EF as Er=2.1 (PTFE) <br>
Mid gray 142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2 (duroid 5880)
<br>
mauve 255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33 (polyethylene) <br>
yellow 255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5 (polystyrene) <br>
sandy 239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3 (PVC) <br>
brown 188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335 (epoxy resin) <br>
L. yellow 223,247,136 or 0xDFF788 as Er=3.7 (FR4 PCB) <br>
Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8 (glass PCB) <br>
Dark gray 142,142,142 or 0x696969 as Er=6.15 (duroid 6006)
<br>
L. gray 240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2 (duroid 6010)
<br>
D. orange 213,160,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0 (mainly for
test purposes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are a few examples of the use of atlc. Again, see the
html documentation in atlc-X.Y.Zocsl-docs, the documentation
on your system (normally at <br>
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html ) or online
at http://atlc.sourceforge.net for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex_1 % atlc coax2.bmp <br>
This is a simple example (ex_1), in which the geometry of a
transmission line is defined in coax2.bmp. In this example,
only the predefined dielectrics (Er =1.0, 1.0006, 2.1, <br>
2.2, 2.33, 2.5, 3.3, 3.335, 3.7, 4.8, 6.15 or 10.2) could
have been used in the bitmap, which would have been done
with one of 13 different colours. white (0xFFFFFF) for
Er=1.0, <br>
pink (0xFFCACA) for 1.0006 etc. No other colour (dielectric)
could have been used, since it was not specified with the -d
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex_2 % atlc -d f9e77d=2.43
somefile.bmp <br>
In ex_2, a dielectric with Er=2.43 was wanted. A colour with
the RGB values of 0xF9E7&amp;d was used. The -d option tells
atlc what Er this colour refers to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ex_3 % atlc -v coax2.bmp <br>
In ex_3, atlc has been instructed to print the results of
intermediate calculations to stdout. Normally, only the
final result is printed. Using -vv even more information may
be <br>
produced, but this is really of only use to the developer of
the project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
bitmapfile.bmp <br>
Original bitmap file. Must be 24-bit colour uncompressed.
<br>
bitmapfile.Ex.bmp <br>
X-component of E-field as a bitmap. Red=+dV/dx, blue =-dV/dx
<br>
bitmapfile.Ey.bmp <br>
y-component of E-field as a bitmap. Red=+y, blue =-y <br>
bitmapfile.E.bmp <br>
E-field, as E=sqrt(Ex^2+Ey^2). <br>
bitmapfile.V.bin <br>
Voltage as a bitmap, red= positive, blue =negative. <br>
bitmapfile.Er.bin <br>
Bitmap showing the permittivity as a grayscale. Lighter is a
higher <br>
permittivity. <br>
bitmapfile.U.bmp <br>
Energy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the bitmaps, the
data is also saved in binary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the saved binary files
(.bin&rsquo;s) are saved as a double precision number for
each of the pixels. The first double is the top left, the
last the bottom right. If the original <br>
image has width W and height H, the saved binary files will
be W-1 by H-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the saved bitmap files are
24-bit uncompressed, just like the input files.</p>
