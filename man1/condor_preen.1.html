<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
condor_preen remove - extraneous files from HTCondor
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synopsis <br>
condor_preen [-mail] [-remove] [-verbose] [-debug]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
condor_preenexamines the directories belonging to HTCondor,
and removes extraneous files and directories which may be
left over from HTCondor processes which terminated
abnor&acirc; <br>
mally either due to internal errors or a system crash. The
directories checked are the LOG , EXECUTE , and SPOOL
directories as defined in the HTCondor configuration files.
<br>
condor_preenis intended to be run as user root or user
condor periodically as a backup method to ensure reasonable
file system cleanliness in the face of errors. This is done
<br>
automatically by default by the condor_masterdaemon. It may
also be explicitly invoked on an as needed basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When condor_preencleans the
SPOOL directory, it always leaves behind the files specified
in the configuration variables VALID_SPOOL_FILES and
SYSTEM_VALID_SPOOL_FILES , as <br>
given by the configuration. For the LOG directory, the only
files removed or reported are those listed within the
configuration variable INVALID_LOG_FILES list. The reason
for <br>
this difference is that, in general, the files in the LOG
directory ought to be left alone, with few exceptions. An
example of exceptions are core files. As there are new log
<br>
files introduced regularly, it is less effort to specify
those that ought to be removed than those that are not to be
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send mail to the user defined in
the PREEN_ADMIN configuration variable, instead of writing
to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove the offending files and
directories rather than reporting on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List all files found in the
Condor directories, even those which are not considered
extraneous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print extra debugging
information as the command executes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit Status <br>
condor_preenwill exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon
success, and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon
failure.</p>
