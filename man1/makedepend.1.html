<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makedepend - create dependencies in makefiles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
makedepend [ -Dname=def ] [ -Dname ] [ -Iincludedir ] [
-Yincludedir ] [ -a ] [ -fmakefile ] [ -include file ] [
-oobjsuffix ] [ -pobjprefix ] [ -sstring ] [ -wwidth ] [ -v
] [ <br>
-m ] [ -- otheroptions -- ] sourcefile ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The makedepend program reads each sourcefile in sequence and
parses it like a C-preprocessor, processing all #include,
#define, #undef, #ifdef, #ifndef, #endif, #if, #elif and
<br>
#else directives so that it can correctly tell which
#include, directives would be used in a compilation. Any
#include, directives can reference files having other
#include <br>
directives, and parsing will occur in these files as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every file that a sourcefile
includes, directly or indirectly, is what makedepend calls a
dependency. These dependencies are then written to a
makefile in such a way that <br>
make(1) will know which object files must be recompiled when
a dependency has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, makedepend places
its output in the file named makefile if it exists,
otherwise Makefile. An alternate makefile may be specified
with the -f option. It first <br>
searches the makefile for the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE --
make depend depends on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or one provided with the -s
option, as a delimiter for the dependency output. If it
finds it, it will delete everything following this to the
end of the makefile and put the <br>
output after this line. If it doesn&rsquo;t find it, the
program will append the string to the end of the makefile
and place the output following that. For each sourcefile
appearing <br>
on the command line, makedepend puts lines in the makefile
of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sourcefile.o: dfile ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where sourcefile.o is the name
from the command line with its suffix replaced with
&lsquo;&lsquo;.o&rsquo;&rsquo;, and dfile is a dependency
discovered in a #include directive while parsing sourcefile
<br>
or one of the files it included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Normally, makedepend will be used in a makefile target so
that typing &lsquo;&lsquo;make depend&rsquo;&rsquo; will
bring the dependencies up to date for the makefile. For
example, <br>
SRCS = file1.c file2.c ... <br>
CFLAGS = -O -DHACK -I../foobar -xyz <br>
depend: <br>
makedepend -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The program will ignore any option that it does not
understand so that you may use the same arguments that you
would for cc(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname=def or -Dname <br>
Define. This places a definition for name in
makedepend&rsquo;s symbol table. Without =def the symbol
becomes defined as &lsquo;&lsquo;1&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iincludedir <br>
Include directory. This option tells makedepend to prepend
includedir to its list of directories to search when it
encounters a #include directive. By default, makedepend <br>
only searches the standard include directories (usually
/usr/include and possibly a compiler-dependent
directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Yincludedir <br>
Replace all of the standard include directories with the
single specified include directory; you can omit the
includedir to simply prevent searching the standard include
<br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Append the dependencies to
the end of the file instead of replacing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmakefile <br>
Filename. This allows you to specify an alternate makefile
in which makedepend can place its output. Specifying
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; as the file name (i.e., -f-)
sends the output to <br>
standard output instead of modifying an existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include file <br>
Process file as input, and include all the resulting output
before processing the regular input file. This has the same
affect as if the specified file is an include state&acirc;
<br>
ment that appears before the very first line of the regular
input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oobjsuffix <br>
Object file suffix. Some systems may have object files whose
suffix is something other than
&lsquo;&lsquo;.o&rsquo;&rsquo;. This option allows you to
specify another suffix, such as
&lsquo;&lsquo;.b&rsquo;&rsquo; with <br>
-o.b or &lsquo;&lsquo;:obj&rsquo;&rsquo; with -o:obj and so
forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pobjprefix <br>
Object file prefix. The prefix is prepended to the name of
the object file. This is usually used to designate a
different directory for the object file. The default is the
<br>
empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sstring <br>
Starting string delimiter. This option permits you to
specify a different string for makedepend to look for in the
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wwidth <br>
Line width. Normally, makedepend will ensure that every
output line that it writes will be no wider than 78
characters for the sake of readability. This option enables
you <br>
to change this width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation. This
option causes makedepend to emit the list of files included
by each input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Warn about multiple
inclusion. This option causes makedepend to produce a
warning if any input file includes another file more than
once. In previous versions of makede&acirc; <br>
pend this was the default behavior; the default has been
changed to better match the behavior of the C compiler,
which does not consider multiple inclusion to be an error.
<br>
This option is provided for backward compatibility, and to
aid in debugging problems related to multiple inclusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- options -- <br>
If makedepend encounters a double hyphen (--) in the
argument list, then any unrecognized argument following it
will be silently ignored; a second double hyphen terminates
<br>
this special treatment. In this way, makedepend can be made
to safely ignore esoteric compiler arguments that might
normally be found in a CFLAGS make macro (see the
EXAM&acirc; <br>
PLE section above). All options that makedepend recognizes
and appear between the pair of double hyphens are processed
normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHM <br>
The approach used in this program enables it to run an order
of magnitude faster than any other &lsquo;&lsquo;dependency
generator&rsquo;&rsquo; I have ever seen. Central to this
performance are two <br>
assumptions: that all files compiled by a single makefile
will be compiled with roughly the same -I and -D options;
and that most files in a single directory will include
largely <br>
the same files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given these assumptions,
makedepend expects to be called once for each makefile, with
all source files that are maintained by the makefile
appearing on the command line. It <br>
parses each source and include file exactly once,
maintaining an internal symbol table for each. Thus, the
first file on the command line will take an amount of time
propor&acirc; <br>
tional to the amount of time that a normal C preprocessor
takes. But on subsequent files, if it encounters an include
file that it has already parsed, it does not parse it <br>
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, imagine you are
compiling two files, file1.c and file2.c, they each include
the header file header.h, and the file header.h in turn
includes the files def1.h and <br>
def2.h. When you run the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makedepend file1.c file2.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makedepend will parse file1.c
and consequently, header.h and then def1.h and def2.h. It
then decides that the dependencies for this file are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file1.o: header.h def1.h
def2.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But when the program parses
file2.c and discovers that it, too, includes header.h, it
does not parse the file, but simply adds header.h, def1.h
and def2.h to the list of depen&acirc; <br>
dencies for file2.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cc(1), make(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
makedepend parses, but does not currently evaluate, the SVR4
#predicate(token-list) preprocessor expression; such
expressions are simply assumed to be true. This may cause
the <br>
wrong #include directives to be evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Imagine you are parsing two
files, say file1.c and file2.c, each includes the file
def.h. The list of files that def.h includes might truly be
different when def.h is included <br>
by file1.c than when it is included by file2.c. But once
makedepend arrives at a list of dependencies for a file, it
is cast in concrete.</p>
