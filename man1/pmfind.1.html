<p>PMFIND(1) General Commands Manual PMFIND(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmfind - find PCP services on the network</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmfind [-q] [-m mechanism] [-s service] [-r] [-t
timeout]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmfind searches for instances of the specified PCP service
being advertised on the network and prints a list of URLs
corresponding to the services discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default pmfind will search
for all supported PCP services, however a specific PCP
service to discover can be specified using the -s option.
Supported services are pmcd(1), <br>
pmproxy(1) and pmwebd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option sets the mechanism
that pmfind uses when performing service discovery. By
default, or if the keyword &quot;all&quot; is specified,
every available mechanism will be used <br>
(iteratively). Supported mechanisms are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avahi Searches for services
which are broadcasting using mDNS via avahi-daemon(8). An
optional suffix &quot;,timeout=N&quot; may be added to limit
the amount of time waiting for the <br>
avahi-daemon. N is a floating point number specifying the
number of seconds to wait. The default is 0.5 seconds. This
timeout may also be specified by setting the envi&acirc;
<br>
ronment variable AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT to the desired
number of seconds. If both are specified, then the value
specified in the environment variable takes precedence.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">probe=&lt;net-address&gt;/&lt;mask-bits&gt;
<br>
Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP
service(s). &lt;net-address&gt; is an inet or ipv6 network
address and &lt;mask-bits&gt; is the number of bits used to
define <br>
the subnet. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an 8 bit
subnet consisting of the addresses 192.168.1.0 through
192.168.1.255. An optional suffix &quot;,maxThreads=N&quot;
may be <br>
added to limit the number of threads used while probing. The
default is the value of FD_SETSIZE or the number of
addresses in the subnet, whichever is less. An optional <br>
suffix &quot;,timeout=N&quot; may be added to limit the
amount of time waiting for each connection attempt. N is a
floating point number specifying the number of seconds to
wait. <br>
The default is 20ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option requests that DNS
name resolution be attempted for the addresses of any
discovered services. The default is to display the network
addresses of any discovered ser&acirc; <br>
vices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option sets the maximum
amount of time that pmfind will take before interrupting the
service discovery. The argument is a floating point number
representing the number of <br>
seconds before timing out. The default is to take as much
time as is needed to complete the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -q option suppresses all
output on the standard output stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The value of the exit status from the command is zero when
services were successfully located, one if no services were
found, and two if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the event of an error, a
message will be generated on standard error that is intended
to be self-explanatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
pmfind will interrupt the service discovery process when one
of the following signals is received: SIGHUP, SIGPIPE,
SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGXFSZ, SIGXCPU. pmfind will report any
<br>
results which were discovered up to point of the
interruption.</p>
