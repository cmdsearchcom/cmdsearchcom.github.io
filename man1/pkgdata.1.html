<p>PKGDATA(1) ICU 50.1.2 Manual PKGDATA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pkgdata - package data for use by ICU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pkgdata [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -c,
--copyright | -C, --comment comment ] [ -m, --mode mode ]
-p, --name name -O, --bldopt options [ -e, --entrypoint name
] [ -r, <br>
--revision version ] [ -F, --rebuild ] [ -I, --install ] [
-s, --sourcedir source ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] [ -T,
--tempdir directory ] [ file ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pkgdata takes a set of data files and packages them for use
by ICU or applications that use ICU. The typical reason to
package files using pkgdata is to make their distribution
<br>
easier and their loading by ICU faster and less consuming of
limited system resources such as file descriptors. Packaged
data also allow applications to be distributed with <br>
fewer resource files, or even with none at all if they link
against the packaged data directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkgdata supports a few different
methods of packaging data that serve different purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default packaging mode is
common, or archive. In this mode, the different data files
are bundled together as an architecture-dependent file that
can later be memory mapped <br>
for use by ICU. Data packaged using this mode will be looked
up under the ICU data directory. Such packaging is easy to
use for applications resource bundles, for example, as <br>
long as the application can install the packaged file in the
ICU data directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another packaging mode is the
dll, or library, mode, where the data files are compiled
into a shared library. ICU used to be able to dynamically
load these shared libraries, but <br>
as of ICU 2.0, such support has been removed. This mode is
still useful for two main purposes: to build ICU itself, as
the ICU data is packaged as a shared library by default;
<br>
and to build resource bundles that are linked to the
application that uses them. Such resource bundles can then
be placed anywhere where the system&rsquo;s dynamic linker
will be look&acirc; <br>
ing for shared libraries, instead of being forced to live
inside the ICU data directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The static packaging mode is
similar to the shared library one except that it produces a
static library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, pkgdata supports a
files mode which simply copies the data files instead of
packaging them as a single file or library. This mode is
mainly intended to provide support <br>
for building ICU before it is packaged as separate small
packages for distribution with operating systems such as
Debian GNU/Linux for example. Please refer to the packaging
doc&acirc; <br>
umentation in the ICU source distribution for further
information on the use of this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkgdata builds, packages,
installs, or cleans the appropriate data based on the
options given without the need to call GNU make anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, -?, --help <br>
Print help about usage and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Display extra informative messages during execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --copyright <br>
Include a copyright notice in the binary data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --comment comment <br>
Includes the specified comment in the resulting data instead
of the ICU copyright notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mode mode <br>
Set the packaging mode to be used by pkgdata. The different
modes and their meaning are explained in the DESCRIPTION
section above. The valid mode names are common (or <br>
archive), dll (or library), and files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --bldopt options <br>
Specify options for the builder. The builder is used
internally by pkgdata to generate the correct packaged file.
Such options include, but are not limited to, setting <br>
variables used by make(1) during the build of the packaged
file. Note: If icu-config is available, then this option is
not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --name name <br>
Set the packaged file name to name. This name is also used
as the default entry point name after having been turned
into a valid C identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --entrypoint name <br>
Set the data entry point (used for linking against the data
in a shared library form) to name. The default entry point
name is the name set by the -n, --name option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --revision version <br>
Enable versioning of the shared library produced in dll, or
library, mode. The version number has the format
major.minor.patchlevel and all parts except for major are
<br>
optional. If only major is supplied then the version is
assumed to be major.0 for versioning purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --rebuild <br>
Force the rebuilding of all data and their repackaging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --install <br>
Install the packaged file (or all the files in the files
mode). If the variable DESTDIR is set it will be used for
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --sourcedir source <br>
Set the source directory to source. The default source
directory is the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --destdir destination <br>
Set the destination directory to destination. The default
destination directory is the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --tempdir directory <br>
Set the directory used to generate temporary files to
directory. The default temporary directory is the same as
the destination directory as set by the -d, --destdir <br>
option.</p>
