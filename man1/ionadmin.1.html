<p>IONADMIN(1) ICI executables IONADMIN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ionadmin - ION node administration interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ionadmin [ commands_filename | . ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ionadmin configures, starts, manages, and stops the ION node
on the local computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It configures the node and sets
(and reports on) global operational settings for the DTN
protocol stack on the local computer in response to ION
configuration commands found in <br>
commands_filename, if provided; if not, ionadmin prints a
simple prompt (:) so that the user may type commands
directly into standard input. If commands_filename is a
period <br>
(.), the effect is the same as if a command file containing
the single command &rsquo;x&rsquo; were passed to ionadmin
-- that is, the ION node&rsquo;s rfxclock task is
stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of commands for
commands_filename can be queried from ionadmin by entering
the command &rsquo;h&rsquo; or &rsquo;?&rsquo; at the
prompt. The commands are documented in ionrc(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ionadmin always
computes a congestion forecast immediately before exiting.
The result of this forecast -- maximum projected occupancy
of the DTN protocol traffic <br>
allocation in ION&rsquo;s SDR database -- is retained for
application flow control purposes: if maximum projected
occupancy is the entire protocol traffic allocation, then a
message to <br>
this effect is logged and no new bundle origination by any
application will be accepted until a subsequent forecast
that predicts no congestion is computed. (Congestion <br>
forecasts are constrained by horizon times, which can be
established by commands issued to ionadmin. One way to
re-enable data origination temporarily while long-term
traffic <br>
imbalances are being addressed is to declare a congestion
forecast horizon in the near future, before congestion would
occur if no adjustments were made.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; Successful completion of ION node
administration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
ionadmin <br>
Enter interactive ION configuration command entry mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ionadmin host1.ion <br>
Execute all configuration commands in host1.ion, then
terminate immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Status and diagnostic messages from ionadmin and from other
software that utilizes the ION node are nominally written to
a log file in the current working directory within which
<br>
ionadmin was run. The log file is typically named
ion.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also ionconfig(5) and
ionrc(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables ION_NODE_LIST_DIR and ION_NODE_WDNAME
can be used to enable the operation of multiple ION nodes on
a single workstation computer. See section 2.1.3 of the <br>
ION Design and Operations Guide for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Note: all ION administration utilities expect source file
input to be lines of ASCII text that are NL-delimited. If
you edit the ionrc file on a Windows machine, be sure to use
<br>
dos2unix to convert it to Unix text format before presenting
it to ionadmin. Otherwise ionadmin will detect syntax errors
and will not function satisfactorily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following diagnostics may be
issued to the log file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t open command file...
<br>
The commands_filename specified in the command line
doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ionadmin SDR definition failed.
<br>
A node initialization command was executed, but an SDR
database already exists for the indicated node. It is likely
that an ION node is already running on this computer or <br>
that destruction of a previously started the previous ION
node was incomplete. For most ION installations, incomplete
node destruction can be repaired by (a) killing all ION <br>
processes that are still running and then (b) using ipcrm to
remove all SVr4 IPC objects owned by ION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ionadmin can&rsquo;t get SDR
parms. <br>
A node initialization command was executed, but the
ion_config_filename passed to that command contains
improperly formatted commands. Please see ionconfig(5) for
further <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various errors that don&rsquo;t
cause ionadmin to fail but are noted in the log file may be
caused by improperly formatted commands given at the prompt
or in the commands_filename. <br>
Please see ionrc(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If the ion_config_filename parameter passed to a node
initialization command refers to a nonexistent filename,
then ionadmin uses default values are used rather than
reporting an <br>
error in the command line argument.</p>
