ionadmin - ION node administration interface
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>ionadmin</b> [ <i>commands_filename</i> | . ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>ionadmin</b> configures, starts, manages, and stops the ION node on the local
  computer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It configures the node and sets (and reports on) global operational settings for
  the DTN protocol stack on the local computer in response to ION configuration
  commands found in <i>commands_filename</i>, if provided; if not,
  <b>ionadmin</b> prints a simple prompt (:) so that the user may type commands
  directly into standard input. If <i>commands_filename</i> is a period (.), the
  effect is the same as if a command file containing the single command 'x' were
  passed to <b>ionadmin</b> -- that is, the ION node's <i>rfxclock</i> task is
  stopped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of commands for <i>commands_filename</i> can be queried from
  <b>ionadmin</b> by entering the command 'h' or '?' at the prompt. The commands
  are documented in <i>ionrc</i>(5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that <i>ionadmin</i> always computes a congestion forecast immediately
  before exiting. The result of this forecast -- maximum projected occupancy of
  the DTN protocol traffic allocation in ION's SDR database -- is retained for
  application flow control purposes: if maximum projected occupancy is the
  entire protocol traffic allocation, then a message to this effect is logged
  and no new bundle origination by any application will be accepted until a
  subsequent forecast that predicts no congestion is computed. (Congestion
  forecasts are constrained by <i>horizon</i> times, which can be established by
  commands issued to <i>ionadmin</i>. One way to re-enable data origination
  temporarily while long-term traffic imbalances are being addressed is to
  declare a congestion forecast horizon in the near future, before congestion
  would occur if no adjustments were made.)

Status and diagnostic messages from <b>ionadmin</b> and from other software that
  utilizes the ION node are nominally written to a log file in the current
  working directory within which <b>ionadmin</b> was run. The log file is
  typically named <b>ion.log</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See also <i>ionconfig</i>(5) and <i>ionrc</i>(5).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Environment variables ION_NODE_LIST_DIR and ION_NODE_WDNAME can be used to
  enable the operation of multiple ION nodes on a single workstation computer.
  See section 2.1.3 of the ION Design and Operations Guide for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
<b>Note</b>: all ION administration utilities expect source file input to be
  lines of ASCII text that are NL-delimited. If you edit the ionrc file on a
  Windows machine, be sure to <b>use dos2unix to convert it to Unix text
  format</b> before presenting it to <b>ionadmin</b>. Otherwise <b>ionadmin</b>
  will detect syntax errors and will not function satisfactorily.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the log file:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Can't open command file...</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>commands_filename</i> specified in the command line
      doesn't exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ionadmin SDR definition failed.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A node initialization command was executed, but an SDR
      database already exists for the indicated node. It is likely that an ION
      node is already running on this computer or that destruction of a
      previously started the previous ION node was incomplete. For most ION
      installations, incomplete node destruction can be repaired by (a) killing
      all ION processes that are still running and then (b) using <b>ipcrm</b>
      to remove all SVr4 IPC objects owned by ION.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ionadmin can't get SDR parms.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A node initialization command was executed, but the
      <i>ion_config_filename</i> passed to that command contains improperly
      formatted commands. Please see <i>ionconfig</i>(5) for further
    details.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various errors that don't cause <b>ionadmin</b> to fail but are noted in the log
  file may be caused by improperly formatted commands given at the prompt or in
  the <i>commands_filename</i>. Please see <i>ionrc</i>(5) for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
If the <i>ion_config_filename</i> parameter passed to a node initialization
  command refers to a nonexistent filename, then <b>ionadmin</b> uses default
  values are used rather than reporting an error in the command line argument.
