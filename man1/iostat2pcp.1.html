<p>IOSTAT2PCP(1) General Commands Manual IOSTAT2PCP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
iostat2pcp - import iostat data and create a PCP archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
iostat2pcp [-v] [-S start] [-t interval] [-Z timezone]
infile outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
iostat2pcp reads a text file created with iostat(1) (infile)
and translates this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
archive with the basename outfile. If infile is - then <br>
iostat2pcp reads from standard input, allowing easy
preprocessing of the iostat(1) output with sed(1) or
similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resultant PCP archive may be
used with all the PCP client tools to graph subsets of the
data using pmchart(1), perform data reduction and reporting,
filter with the PCP <br>
inference engine pmie(1), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A series of physical files will
be created with the prefix outfile. These are outfile.0 (the
performance data), outfile.meta (the metadata that describes
the performance data) <br>
and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
replay operations for the archive). If any of these files
exists already, then iostat2pcp will not overwrite them <br>
and will exit with an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first output sample from
iostat(1) contains a statistical summary since boot time and
is ignored by iostat2pcp, so the first real data set is the
second one in the iostat(1) <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best results are obtained
when iostat(1) was run with its own -t flag, so each output
sample is prefixed with a timestamp. Even better is -t with
$S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO set in <br>
environment when iostat(1) is run, in which case the
timestamp includes the timezone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO
is not used with the -t option then iostat(1) may produce a
timestamp controlled by LC_TIME from the locale that is in a
format iostat2pcp cannot <br>
parse. The formats for the timestamp that iostat2pcp accepts
are illustrated by these examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2013-07-06T21:34:39+1000 <br>
(for the $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2013-07-06 21:34:39 <br>
(for some of the European formats, e.g. de_AT, de_BE, de_LU
and en_DK.utf8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">06/07/13 21:34:39 <br>
(for all of the $LC_TIME settings for English locales
outside North America, e.g. en_AU, en_GB, en_IE, en_NZ,
en_SG and en_ZA, and all the Spanish locales, e.g. es_ES,
es_MX <br>
and es_AR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, note that some
common North American $LC_TIME settings will not work with
iostat2pcp (namely, en_US, POSIX and C) because they use the
MM/DD format which may be <br>
incorrectly converted with the assumed DD/MM format. This is
another reason to recommend setting $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are no timestamps in
the input stream, iostat2pcp will try and deduce the sample
interval if basic Disk data (-d option for iostat(1)) is
found. If this fails, then the <br>
-t option may be used to specify the sample interval in
seconds. This option is ignored if timestamps are found in
the input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S option may be used to
specify as start time for the first real sample in infile,
where start must have the format HH:MM:SS. This option is
ignored if timestamps are found <br>
in the input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Z option may be used to
specify a timezone. It must have the format +HHMM (for hours
and minutes East of UTC) or -HHMM (for hours and minutes
West of UTC). Note in partic&acirc; <br>
ular that neither the zoneinfo (aka Olson) format, e.g.
Europe/Paris, nor the Posix TZ format, e.g. EST+5 is allowed
for the -Z option. This option is ignored if ISO timestamps
<br>
are found in the input stream. If the timezone is not
specified and cannot be deduced, it defaults to UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some additional diagnostic
output is generated with the -v option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iostat2pcp is a Perl script that
uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper around the PCP
libpcp_import library, and as such could be used as an
example to develop new tools to import <br>
other types of performance data and create PCP archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEAT <br>
iostat2pcp requires infile to have been created by the
version of iostat(1) from
&lt;http://freshmeat.net/projects/sysstat&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iostat2pcp handles the -c (CPU),
-d (Disk), -x (eXtended Disk) and -p (Partition) report
formats (including their -k, -m, -z and ALL variants), but
does not accommodate the -n <br>
(Network Filesystem) report format from iostat(1); this is a
demand-driven limitation rather than a technical
limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

Date::Format(3pm), Date::Parse(3pm), PCP::LogImport(3pm) and
