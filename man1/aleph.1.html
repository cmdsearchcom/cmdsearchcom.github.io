<p>ALEPH(1) General Commands Manual ALEPH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aleph - extended Unicode TeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aleph [options] [&amp;format] [file| DESCRIPTION <br>
Run the Aleph typesetter on file, usually creating file.dvi.
If the file argument has no extension, &quot;.tex&quot; will
be appended to it. Instead of a filename, a set of Aleph
com&acirc; <br>
mands can be given, the first of which must start with a
backslash. With a &amp;format argument Aleph uses a
different set of precompiled commands, contained in
format.fmt; it is <br>
usually better to use the -fmt format option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aleph is a version of the TeX
program modified for multilingual typesetting. It uses
Unicode, and has additional primitives for (among other
things) bidirectional typesetting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aleph&rsquo;s command line
options are similar to those of TeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aleph is no longer being
actively developed; see LuaTeX for current activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Run aleph --help to see the complete list of options; this
is not exhaustive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fmt format <br>
Use format as the name of the format to be used, instead of
the name by which Aleph was called or a %&amp; line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--halt-on-error <br>
Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ini Be &lsquo;initial&rsquo;
Aleph for dumping formats; this is implicitly true if the
program is called as inialeph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--interaction mode <br>
Sets the interaction mode. The mode can be one of batchmode,
nonstopmode, scrollmode, and errorstopmode. The meaning of
these modes is the same as that of the corre&acirc; <br>
sponding <br>
--ipc Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual
output file. Whether this option is available is the choice
of the installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ipc-start <br>
As --ipc, and starts the server at the other end as well.
Whether this option is available is the choice of the
installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kpathsea-debug bitmask <br>
Sets path searching debugging flags according to the
bitmask. See the Kpathsea manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maketex fmt <br>
Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be one of tex or tfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-maketex fmt <br>
Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be one of tex or tfm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-comment string <br>
Use string for the DVI file comment instead of the date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-directory directory
<br>
Write output files in directory instead of the current
directory. Look up input files in directory first, the along
the normal search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parse-first-line <br>
If the first line of the main input file begins with %&amp;
parse it to look for a dump name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--progname name <br>
Pretend to be program name. This affects both the format
used and the search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recorder <br>
Enable the filename recorder. This leaves a trace of the
files opened for input and output in a file with extension
.ofl. (This option is always on.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell-escape <br>
Enable the 480uct. The command can be any Bourne shell
command. By default, this construct is enabled in a
restricted mode, for security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the &lsquo;Path
specifications&rsquo; node) for precise details of how the
environment variables are used. The kpsewhich utility can be
used to <br>
query the values of the variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One caveat: In most Aleph
formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to
Aleph, because ~ is an active character, and hence is
expanded, not taken as part of the <br>
filename. Other programs, such as Metafont, do not have this
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXMFOUTPUT <br>
Normally, Aleph puts its output files in the current
directory. If any output file cannot be opened there, it
tries to open it in the directory specified in the
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable TEXMFOUTPUT. There is no default value for
that variable. For example, if you say tex paper and the
current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has <br>
the value /tmp, Aleph attempts to create /tmp/paper.log (and
/tmp/paper.dvi, if any output is produced.) TEXMFOUTPUT is
also checked for input files, as TeX often gener&acirc; <br>
ates files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no
suffixes (such as &lsquo;&lsquo;.tex&rsquo;&rsquo;) are
added by default, the input name is simply checked as
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXINPUTS <br>
Search path for input and mty path component will be
replaced with <br>
the paths defined in the texmf.cnf file. For example, set
TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/user/tex:&quot; to prepend the
current direcory and
&lsquo;&lsquo;/home/user/tex&rsquo;&rsquo; to the standard
search <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXEDIT <br>
Command template for switching to editor. The default,
usually vi, is set when Aleph is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive. The complete
documentation for this version of Aleph can be found in the
info manual Web2C: A TeX implementation. See <br>
http://tug/org/web2c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
This version of Aleph implements a number of optional
extensions. In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a
greater or lesser extent with the definition of Aleph. When
<br>
such extensions are enabled, the banner printed when Aleph
starts is changed to print Alephk instead of Aleph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of Aleph fails to
trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or
subtracted. Cases where this occurs are rare, but when it
does the generated DVI file will <br>
be invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
tex(1), mf(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The primary authors of Aleph are John Plaice and Yannis
Haralambous.</p>
