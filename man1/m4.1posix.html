<p>M4(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
M4(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
m4 &acirc; macro processor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
m4 [&acirc;s] [&acirc;D name[=val]]... [&acirc;U name]...
file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The m4 utility is a macro processor that shall read one or
more text files, process them according to their included
macro statements, and write the results to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The m4 utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that the order of the &acirc;D and
&acirc;U options shall be sig&acirc; <br>
nificant, and options can be interspersed with operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Enable line
synchronization output for the c99 preprocessor phase (that
is, #line directives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;D name[=val] <br>
Define name to val or to null if =val is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;U name Undefine name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a text file
to be processed. If no file is given, or if it is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the standard input shall be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be a text file that is used if no
file operand is given, or if it is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input file named by the file operand shall be a text
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of m4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The standard output shall be the same as the input files,
after being processed for macro expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used to display strings with the
errprint macro, macro tracing enabled by the traceon macro,
the defined text for macros written by the dumpdef macro,
<br>
or for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
The m4 utility shall compare each token from the input
against the set of built-in and user-defined macros. If the
token matches the name of a macro, then the token shall be
<br>
replaced by the macro&rsquo;s defining text, if any, and
rescanned for matching macro names. Once no portion of the
token matches the name of a macro, it shall be written to
standard <br>
output. Macros may have arguments, in which case the
arguments shall be substituted into the defining text before
it is rescanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macro calls have the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name(arg1, arg2, ..., argn)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macro names shall consist of
letters, digits, and underscores, where the first character
is not a digit. Tokens not of this form shall not be treated
as macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application shall ensure
that the &lt;left-parenthesis&gt; immediately follows the
name of the macro. If a token matching the name of a macro
is not followed by a &lt;left-parenthe&acirc; <br>
sis&gt;, it is handled as a use of that macro without
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a macro name is followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;, its arguments are the
&lt;comma&gt;-separated tokens between the
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt; and the matching
&lt;right-parenthesis&gt;. Unquoted <br>
white-space characters preceding each argument shall be
ignored. All other characters, including trailing
white-space characters, are retained. &lt;comma&gt;
characters enclosed <br>
between &lt;left-parenthesis&gt; and
&lt;right-parenthesis&gt; characters do not delimit
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arguments are positionally
defined and referenced. The string &quot;$1&quot; in the
defining text shall be replaced by the first argument.
Systems shall support at least nine arguments; <br>
only the first nine can be referenced, using the strings
&quot;$1&quot; to &quot;$9&quot;, inclusive. The string
&quot;$0&quot; is replaced with the name of the macro. The
string &quot;$#&quot; is replaced by the num&acirc; <br>
ber of arguments as a string. The string &quot;$*&quot; is
replaced by a list of all of the arguments, separated by
&lt;comma&gt; characters. The string &quot;$@&quot; is
replaced by a list of all of the <br>
arguments separated by &lt;comma&gt; characters, and each
argument is quoted using the current left and right quoting
strings. The string &quot;${&quot; produces unspecified
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fewer arguments are supplied
than are in the macro definition, the omitted arguments are
taken to be null. It is not an error if more arguments are
supplied than are in the <br>
macro definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No special meaning is given to
any characters enclosed between matching left and right
quoting strings, but the quoting strings are themselves
discarded. By default, the left <br>
quoting string consists of a grave accent (backquote) and
the right quoting string consists of an acute accent
(single-quote); see also the changequote macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are written but not
scanned for matching macro names; by default, the
begin-comment string consists of the &lt;number-sign&gt;
character and the end-comment string consists of <br>
a &lt;newline&gt;. See also the changecom and dnl
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The m4 utility shall make
available the following built-in macros. They can be
redefined, but once this is done the original meaning is
lost. Their values shall be null unless <br>
otherwise stated. In the descriptions below, the term
defining text refers to the value of the macro: the second
argument to the define macro, among other things. Except for
the <br>
first argument to the eval macro, all numeric arguments to
built-in macros shall be interpreted as decimal values. The
string values produced as the defining text of the decr,
<br>
divnum, incr, index, len, and sysval built-in macros shall
be in the form of a decimal-constant as defined in the C
language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changecom The changecom macro
shall set the begin-comment and end-comment strings. With no
arguments, the comment mechanism shall be disabled. With a
single non-null argument, <br>
that argument shall become the begin-comment and the
&lt;newline&gt; shall become the end-comment string. With
two non-null arguments, the first argument shall become the
<br>
begin-comment string and the second argument shall become
the end-comment string. The behavior is unspecified if
either argument is provided but null. Systems shall <br>
support comment strings of at least five characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">changequote <br>
The changequote macro shall set the begin-quote and
end-quote strings. With no arguments, the quote strings
shall be set to the default values (that is,
&lsquo;&rsquo;). The behav&acirc; <br>
ior is unspecified if there is a single argument or either
argument is null. With two non-null arguments, the first
argument shall become the begin-quote string and the <br>
second argument shall become the end-quote string. Systems
shall support quote strings of at least five characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decr The defining text of the
decr macro shall be its first argument decremented by 1. It
shall be an error to specify an argument containing any
non-numeric characters. <br>
The behavior is unspecified if decr is not immediately
followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define The second argument shall
become the defining text of the macro whose name is the
first argument. It is unspecified whether the define macro
deletes all prior defini&acirc; <br>
tions of the macro named by its first argument or preserves
all but the current definition of the macro. The behavior is
unspecified if define is not immediately fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defn The defining text of the
defn macro shall be the quoted definition (using the current
quoting strings) of its arguments. The behavior is
unspecified if defn is not <br>
immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divert The m4 utility maintains
nine temporary buffers, numbered 1 to 9, inclusive. When the
last of the input has been processed, any output that has
been placed in these <br>
buffers shall be written to standard output in
buffer-numerical order. The divert macro shall divert future
output to the buffer specified by its argument. Specifying
<br>
no argument or an argument of 0 shall resume the normal
output process. Output diverted to a stream with a negative
number shall be discarded. Behavior is implementa&acirc;
<br>
tion-defined if a stream number larger than 9 is specified.
It shall be an error to specify an argument containing any
non-numeric characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divnum The defining text of the
divnum macro shall be the number of the current output
stream as a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnl The dnl macro shall cause m4
to discard all input characters up to and including the next
&lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpdef The dumpdef macro shall
write the defined text to standard error for each of the
macros specified as arguments, or, if no arguments are
specified, for all macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errprint The errprint macro
shall write its arguments to standard error. The behavior is
unspecified if errprint is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval The eval macro shall
evaluate its first argument as an arithmetic expression,
using signed integer arithmetic with at least 32-bit
precision. At least the following C- <br>
language operators shall be supported, with precedence,
associativity, and behavior as described in Section 1.1.2.1,
Arithmetic Precision and Operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">() <br>
unary + <br>
unary &acirc; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! <br>
binary * <br>

== <br>
!= <br>
binary &amp; <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
&amp;&amp; <br>
||</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systems shall support octal and
hexadecimal numbers as in the ISO C standard. The second
argument, if specified, shall set the radix for the result;
if the argument is <br>
blank or unspecified, the default is 10. Behavior is
unspecified if the radix falls outside the range 2 to 36,
inclusive. The third argument, if specified, sets the <br>
minimum number of digits in the result. Behavior is
unspecified if the third argument is less than zero. It
shall be an error to specify the second or third argument
<br>
containing any non-numeric characters. The behavior is
unspecified if eval is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifdef If the first argument to
the ifdef macro is defined, the defining text shall be the
second argument. Otherwise, the defining text shall be the
third argument, if spec&acirc; <br>
ified, or the null string, if not. The behavior is
unspecified if ifdef is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ifelse The ifelse macro takes
three or more arguments. If the first two arguments compare
as equal strings (after macro expansion of both arguments),
the defining text shall <br>
be the third argument. If the first two arguments do not
compare as equal strings and there are three arguments, the
defining text shall be null. If the first two argu&acirc;
<br>
ments do not compare as equal strings and there are four or
five arguments, the defining text shall be the fourth
argument. If the first two arguments do not compare as <br>
equal strings and there are six or more arguments, the first
three arguments shall be discarded and processing shall
restart with the remaining arguments. The behavior <br>
is unspecified if ifelse is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include The defining text for
the include macro shall be the contents of the file named by
the first argument. It shall be an error if the file cannot
be read. The behavior is <br>
unspecified if include is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">incr The defining text of the
incr macro shall be its first argument incremented by 1. It
shall be an error to specify an argument containing any
non-numeric characters. <br>
The behavior is unspecified if incr is not immediately
followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index The defining text of the
index macro shall be the first character position (as a
string) in the first argument where a string matching the
second argument begins (zero <br>
origin), or &acirc;1 if the second argument does not occur.
The behavior is unspecified if index is not immediately
followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">len The defining text of the len
macro shall be the length (as a string) of the first
argument. The behavior is unspecified if len is not
immediately followed by a &lt;left- <br>
parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m4exit Exit from the m4 utility.
If the first argument is specified, it is the exit code. The
default is zero. It shall be an error to specify an argument
containing any non- <br>
numeric characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m4wrap The first argument shall
be processed when EOF is reached. If the m4wrap macro is
used multiple times, the arguments specified shall be
processed in the order in which <br>
the m4wrap macros were processed. The behavior is
unspecified if m4wrap is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maketemp The defining text shall
be the first argument, with any trailing &rsquo;X&rsquo;
characters replaced with the current process ID as a string.
The behavior is unspecified if <br>
maketemp is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mkstemp The first argument shall
be taken as a template for creating an empty file, with
trailing &rsquo;X&rsquo; characters replaced with characters
from the portable filename character <br>
set. The behavior is unspecified if the first argument does
not end in at least six &rsquo;X&rsquo; characters. If a
temporary file is successfully created, then the defining
text <br>
of the macro shall be the name of the new file. The user ID
of the file shall be set to the effective user ID of the
process. The group ID of the file shall be set to <br>
the group ID of the file&rsquo;s parent directory or to the
effective group ID of the process. The file access
permission bits are set such that only the owner can both
read <br>
and write the file, regardless of the current umask of the
process. If a file could not be created, the defining text
of the macro shall be the empty string. The behav&acirc;
<br>
ior is unspecified if mkstemp is not immediately followed by
a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">popdef The popdef macro shall
delete the current definition of its arguments, replacing
that definition with the previous one. If there is no
previous definition, the macro is <br>
undefined. The behavior is unspecified if popdef is not
immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pushdef The pushdef macro shall
be equivalent to the define macro with the exception that it
shall preserve any current definition for future retrieval
using the popdef macro. <br>
The behavior is unspecified if pushdef is not immediately
followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shift The defining text for the
shift macro shall be a comma-separated list of its arguments
except the first one. Each argument shall be quoted using
the current quoting <br>
strings. The behavior is unspecified if shift is not
immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sinclude The sinclude macro
shall be equivalent to the include macro, except that it
shall not be an error if the file is inaccessible. The
behavior is unspecified if sinclude <br>
is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">substr The defining text for the
substr macro shall be the substring of the first argument
beginning at the zero-offset character position specified by
the second argument. <br>
The third argument, if specified, shall be the number of
characters to select; if not specified, the characters from
the starting point to the end of the first argument <br>
shall become the defining text. It shall not be an error to
specify a starting point beyond the end of the first
argument and the defining text shall be null. It shall <br>
be an error to specify an argument containing any
non-numeric characters. The behavior is unspecified if
substr is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syscmd The syscmd macro shall
interpret its first argument as a shell command line. The
defining text shall be the string result of that command.
The string result shall not <br>
be rescanned for macros while setting the defining text. No
output redirection shall be performed by the m4 utility. The
exit status value from the command can be <br>
retrieved using the sysval macro. The behavior is
unspecified if syscmd is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysval The defining text of the
sysval macro shall be the exit value of the utility last
invoked by the syscmd macro (as a string).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">traceon The traceon macro shall
enable tracing for the macros specified as arguments, or, if
no arguments are specified, for all macros. The trace output
shall be written to <br>
standard error in an unspecified format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">traceoff The traceoff macro
shall disable tracing for the macros specified as arguments,
or, if no arguments are specified, for all macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">translit The defining text of
the translit macro shall be the first argument with every
character that occurs in the second argument replaced with
the corresponding character <br>
from the third argument. If no replacement character is
specified for some source character because the second
argument is longer than the third argument, that
charac&acirc; <br>
ter shall be deleted from the first argument in
translit&rsquo;s defining text. The behavior is unspecified
if the &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; character appears within the
second or third argument <br>
anywhere besides the first or last character. The behavior
is unspecified if the same character appears more than once
in the second argument. The behavior is unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied if translit is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefine The undefine macro
shall delete all definitions (including those preserved
using the pushdef macro) of the macros named by its
arguments. The behavior is unspecified if <br>
undefine is not immediately followed by a
&lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undivert The undivert macro
shall cause immediate output of any text in temporary
buffers named as arguments, or all temporary buffers if no
arguments are specified. Buffers can <br>
be undiverted into other temporary buffers. Undiverting
shall discard the contents of the temporary buffer. The
behavior is unspecified if an argument contains any <br>
non-numeric characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the m4exit macro is used, the
exit value can be specified by the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The defn macro is useful for renaming macros, especially
built-ins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since eval defers to the ISO C
standard, some operations have undefined behavior. In some
implementations, division or remainder by zero cause a fatal
signal, even if the divi&acirc; <br>
sion occurs on the short-circuited branch of
&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; or &quot;||&quot;. Any operation that
overflows in signed arithmetic produces undefined behavior.
Likewise, using the shift operators <br>
with a shift amount that is not positive and smaller than
the precision is undefined, as is shifting a negative number
to the right. Historically, not all implementations obeyed
<br>
C-language precedence rules: &rsquo;~&rsquo; and
&rsquo;!&rsquo; were lower than &rsquo;==&rsquo;;
&rsquo;==&rsquo; and &rsquo;!=&rsquo; were not lower than
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;; and &rsquo;|&rsquo; was not lower than
&rsquo;^&rsquo;; the liberal use of &quot;()&quot; can force
the <br>
desired precedence even with these non-compliant
implementations. Furthermore, some traditional
implementations treated &rsquo;^&rsquo; as an exponentiation
operator, although most implemen&acirc; <br>
tations now use &quot;**&quot; as an extension for this
purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a macro has been multiply
defined via the pushdef macro, it is unspecified whether the
define macro will alter only the most recent definition (as
though by popdef and <br>
pushdef), or replace the entire stack of definitions with a
single definition (as though by undefine and pushdef). An
application desiring particular behavior for the define <br>
macro in this case can redefine it accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications should use the
mkstemp macro instead of the obsolescent maketemp macro for
creating temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If the file m4src contains the lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of &lsquo;VER&rsquo;
is &quot;VER&quot;. <br>
ifdef(&lsquo;VER&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;VER&rsquo;&rsquo; is
defined to be VER., VER is not defined.) <br>
ifelse(VER, 1, &lsquo;&lsquo;VER&rsquo;&rsquo; is

ifelse(VER, 2, &lsquo;&lsquo;VER&rsquo;&rsquo; is
&lsquo;VER&rsquo;., &lsquo;&lsquo;VER&rsquo;&rsquo; is not

end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Historic System V-based behavior treated &quot;${&quot; in a
macro definition as two literal characters. However, this
sequence is left unspecified so that implementations may
offer exten&acirc; <br>
