<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dircproxy - Detachable Internal Relay Chat Proxy Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dircproxy [-hvDI] [-f config_file] [-P listen_port] [-p
pid_file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dircproxy is an IRC proxy server designed for people who use
IRC from lots of different workstations or clients, but wish
to remain connected and see what they missed while they <br>
were away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You connect to IRC through
dircproxy, and it keeps you connected to the server, even
after you detach your client from it. While you&rsquo;re
detached, it logs channel and private <br>
messages as well as important events, and when you re-attach
it&rsquo;ll let you know what you missed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be used to give you
roughly the same functionality as using ircII and screen(8)
together, except you can use whatever IRC client you like,
including X ones!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Authentication is provided by a
password, and optional hostname checking. This links it to a
connection class specified in the configuration file. Only
one user may use a con&acirc; <br>
nection class at one time, when that user detaches, the
connection to the server is kept open. When someone (usually
the user) subsequently connects to dircproxy and provides
<br>
the same password, they are reconnected to the connection to
the server, instead of having a new connection created for
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple connection classes can
be defined, allowing multiple people to use the same
proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dircproxy can use either a
.dircproxyrc file in the user&rsquo;s home directory, or a
system-wide dircproxyrc file. It will load the first it
finds (home directory first, then system- <br>
wide). If no configuration file is specified, it will not
start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f config_file <br>
Specifies the configuration file to be used, overriding the
default search list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays a brief help message
detailing the command-line arguments, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Displays the dircproxy
version number, then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Run in the foreground and do
not fork into the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Use to indicate dircproxy is
being run from the inetd(8) daemon. This implies -D. For
more information on running dircproxy under inetd(8), see
the README.inetd file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P listen_port <br>
Specifies an alternate port to use, overriding the default
and any value specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pid_file <br>
Specifies a file to write the process id to, overriding the
default and any value specified in the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The configuration file has the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty lines and lines starting
with &rsquo;#&rsquo; are comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connection classes start with
&rsquo;connection {&rsquo; and end with &rsquo;}&rsquo;.
They obtain default values from all the entries above them
in the configuration file, and may contain values of <br>
their own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise a line is of the
format &rsquo;keywords arguments&rsquo;. If the argument
contains spaces it should be contained in double quotes
(&rsquo;&quot;with spaces&quot;&rsquo;). The possible
keywords and <br>
their meanings are as follows (note that the configuration
file is not case-sensitive):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCAL OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options may not be placed
inside a connection class as they affect the operation of
the entire dircproxy server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listen_port <br>
What port should dircproxy listen for connections from IRC
clients on?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be a numeric port
number, or a service name from /etc/services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pid_file <br>
File to write the dircproxy process id to on startup. If you
start this with a &quot;~/&quot; then it refers to a file in
a directory under your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Don&rsquo;t write pid
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">client_timeout <br>
Maxmimum amount of time (in seconds) a client can take to
connect to dircproxy and provide their password and nickname
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect_timeout <br>
Maximum amount of time (in seconds) a client has to provide
a server to connect to after they&rsquo;ve logged in. This
only applies if &rsquo;server_autoconnect&rsquo; is
&rsquo;no&rsquo; for that <br>
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dns_timeout <br>
Maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a reply from
a DNS server. If the time exceeds this then the lookup is
cancelled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options may be placed in a
connection class, or outside of one. If they are outside
then they only affect those connection classes defined
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_port <br>
What port do we connect to IRC servers on if the server
string doesn&rsquo;t explicitly set one</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be a numeric port
number, or a service name from /etc/services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_retry <br>
How many seconds after disconnection or last connection
attempt do we wait before retrying again?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_maxattempts <br>
If we are disconnected from the server, how many times
should we iterate the server list before giving up and
declaring the proxied connection dead?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = iterate forever</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_maxinitattempts <br>
On first connection, how many times should we iterate the
server list before giving up and declaring the proxied
connection dead?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = iterate forever. This
isn&rsquo;t recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_keepalive <br>
This checks whether the dircproxy to server connection is
alive at the TCP level. If no data is sent in either
direction for a period of time, a TCP keepalive probe is
<br>
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = send keepalive probes <br>
no = don&rsquo;t send keepalive probes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_pingtimeout <br>
For some people, dircproxy doesn&rsquo;t notice that the
connection to the server has been dropped because the socket
remains open. For example, those behind a NAT&rsquo;d
firewall. <br>
dircproxy can ping the server and make sure it gets replies
back. If the time since the last reply was received exceeds
the number of seconds below the server is assumed <br>
to be &quot;stoned&quot; and dircproxy leaves it. If you
have a high latency connection to the server, it can wrongly
assume the server is stoned because the PINGs don&rsquo;t
arrive in <br>
time. Either raise the value, or use the
&rsquo;server_keepalive&rsquo; option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = don&rsquo;t send PINGs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_throttle <br>
To prevent you from being flooded off the IRC network,
dircproxy can throttle the connection to the server to
prevent too much being sent within a certain time
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For this you specify a number of
bytes, then optionally a time period in seconds seperated by
a colon. If the time period is ommitted then per second is
assmued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_throttle 10 # 10 bytes
per second <br>
server_throttle 10:2 # 10 bytes per 2 seconds (5 per
second)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = do not throttle the
connection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server_autoconnect <br>
Should dircproxy automatically connect to the first server
in the list when you connect. If you set this to
&rsquo;no&rsquo;, then &rsquo;allow_jump&rsquo; is
automatically set to &rsquo;yes&rsquo;. If <br>
&rsquo;allow_jump_new&rsquo; is also &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, then
you can create connection classes with no
&rsquo;server&rsquo; lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Automatically connect to
the first server <br>
no = Wait for a /DIRCPROXY JUMP from the client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">channel_rejoin <br>
If we are kicked off a channel, how many seconds do we wait
before attempting to rejoin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 = Don&rsquo;t rejoin <br>
0 = Immediately</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">channel_leave_on_detach <br>
Should dircproxy automatically make you leave all the
channels you were on when you detach?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Leave them <br>
no = Remain on them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">channel_rejoin_on_attach <br>
If &rsquo;channel_leave_on_detach&rsquo; is
&rsquo;yes&rsquo; then should dircproxy rejoin those
channels when you attach again?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Rejoin the channels
dircproxy automatically left <br>
no = Leave permanently on detach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">idle_maxtime <br>
Set this to the maximum amount of time you want to appear
idle for while on IRC, if you set this then dircproxy will
reset your idle time if it reaches this limit (in sec&acirc;
<br>
onds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = Don&rsquo;t reset idle
time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect_existing_user <br>
If, when you connect to dircproxy, another client is already
using your connection class (ie, if you forgot to close that
one), then this option lets you automatically <br>
kill that one off. Make sure you turn any &quot;automatic
reconnect to server&quot; options off before using this,
otherwise you&rsquo;ll have a fight on your hands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Yes, disconnect <br>
no = No, don&rsquo;t let me on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect_on_detach <br>
When you detach from dircproxy it usually keeps you
connected to the server until you connect again. If you
don&rsquo;t want this, and you want it to close your server
connec&acirc; <br>
tion as well, then set this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Close session on
disconnection <br>
no = Stay connected to server until reattachment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initial_modes <br>
Which user modes should we automatically set when you first
connect to a server. Just in case you forget to do it
yourself with your irc client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set to &quot;&quot; to not set
any modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">drop_modes <br>
Which user modes to drop automatically when you detach,
handy to limit the impact that your client has while
connected, or for extra security if you&rsquo;re an
IRCop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set to &quot;&quot; to not drop
any modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refuse_modes <br>
Which user modes to refuse to accept from a server. If the
server attempts to set one of these, then the connection to
it will be dropped and the next server in the list <br>
will be tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good setting for many people
would be &quot;+r&quot;, as most servers use that to mean
your connection is restricted. Don&rsquo;t set it to this if
you&rsquo;re on DALnet however, DALnet <br>
uses +r to indicate you have registered with NickServ (gee,
thanks guys!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set to &quot;&quot; to not
refuse any modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local_address <br>
Local hostname to use when connecting to an IRC server. This
provides the same functionality as the ircII -H
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not bind any specific
hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">away_message <br>
If you don&rsquo;t explicitly set an /AWAY message before
you detach, dircproxy can for you, so people don&rsquo;t
think you are really at your keyboard when you&rsquo;re
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not set an away
message for you</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit_message <br>
If you don&rsquo;t explicitly give a message when you
/DIRCPROXY QUIT, this will be used instead. Also used for
when you&rsquo;ve sent dircproxy not to remain attached to
the server <br>
on detachment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Use dircproxy version
number as QUIT message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attach_message <br>
dircproxy can send an announcement onto every channel you
are on when you reattach to it, just to let everyone know
you are back. If you start this with &quot;/ME &quot; then
it <br>
will be sent as an ACTION CTCP message (just like the ircII
/me command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not announce
attachment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detach_message <br>
dircproxy can send an announcement onto every channel you
are on when you detach from it, just to let everyone know
you are gone. If you start this with &quot;/ME &quot; then
it <br>
will be sent as an ACTION CTCP message (just like the ircII
/me command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not announce
detachment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detach_nickname <br>
Nickname to change to automatically after you detach, to
indicate you are away for example. If this contains a
&rsquo;*&rsquo; character, then that character is replaced
with <br>
whataver your nickname was before you detached (ie
&quot;*_away&quot; adds &quot;_away&quot; to the end of your
nickname);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Leave nickname as it
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nick_keep <br>
Whether dircproxy should attempt to keep the nickname you
last set using your client. If this is &rsquo;yes&rsquo; and
your nickname is lost while your client is disconnected,
then <br>
it will keep on trying to get it back until a client
connects again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = try to keep my nickname
while I&rsquo;m disconnected <br>
no = if it changes, leave it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctcp_replies <br>
Whether dircproxy should reply to the standard set of CTCP
messages while the client is detached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = reply to ctcp messages
while client is detached <br>
no = nothing but silence</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_enabled <br>
Whether logging of channel text to files should take place.
If this is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, then you&rsquo;ll be able to
recall channel text when you rejoin and see what you
missed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Channel text is logged to
files <br>
no = Channel text is NOT logged to files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_always <br>
Channel text will always be logged while you are offline, so
when you come back you can see what you missed. You can
also, if you wish, log channel text while online, so <br>
if you&rsquo;re only away a short time you can get an idea
of any context etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only applies if
&rsquo;chan_log_enabled&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Log channel text while
offline and online <br>
no = Log channel text only while offline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_maxsize <br>
To preserve your harddisk space, you can limit the size of a
channel log file. Once the log file reaches this number of
lines, every line added will result in a line <br>
removed from the top. If you know you are never going to
want all that logged information, this might be a good
setting for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only applies if
&rsquo;chan_log_enabled&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = No limit to log files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_recall <br>
Number of lines from each channel log file to automatically
recall to your IRC client when you attach. If this is low,
you may not get much useful information, if this is <br>
high, it may take a long time for all the information to
arrive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only applies if
&rsquo;chan_log_enabled&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 = Recall the whole log (not
recommended if chan_log_always is yes) <br>
0 = Don&rsquo;t automatically recall anything</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_timestamp <br>
Channel text can have a timestamp added to the front to let
you know exactly when a message was logged. These timestamps
are displayed when you recall the log files, or <br>
when automatially dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies to ordinary channel
logs if &rsquo;chan_log_enabled&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;
and also to the permanent copy if
&rsquo;chan_log_copydir&rsquo; is set to something other
than &rsquo;none&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Include timestamp <br>
no = Do not include timestamp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_relativetime <br>
If &rsquo;chan_log_timestamp&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;
then you also have the option of using intelligent relative
timestamps. If you do, the timestamp shown when log file
information is <br>
recalled depends on how old that line is, making sure it
displays enough information (including date if necessary).
Otherwise dircproxy will just tell you the time in <br>
HH:MM format which may not be as useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does mean that the time
itself won&rsquo;t be displayed in the log files themselves,
a timestamp is in place instead. This may cause problems if
you&rsquo;re doing things with <br>
the log files yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Do fancy relative
timestamping <br>
no = Do normal timestamping</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_copydir <br>
As well as dircproxy&rsquo;s own log files, it can also keep
a permanent copy somewhere for your use. dircproxy will
append all channel text seen to this file, but will not use
<br>
it itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do define it, it&rsquo;ll
add to each log as you use it. If you start with
&quot;~/&quot; then it will use a directory under your home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done regardless of the
&rsquo;chan_log_enabled&rsquo; and
&rsquo;chan_log_always&rsquo; options, although if those are
off then you won&rsquo;t get that text recalled to your
client, despite it <br>
being in this file. The timestamping options do apply
however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not make a permanent
copy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chan_log_program <br>
Program to pipe channel text into. If given, dircproxy will
run this program for each log file entry giving the full
source information as the first argument, the desti&acirc;
<br>
nation as the second and the text as a single line on
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program can be anywhere in
your $PATH, or you can start it with &quot;~/&quot; if its
in a directory under your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done regardless of the
&rsquo;chan_log_enabled&rsquo; and
&rsquo;chan_log_always&rsquo; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not pipe log messages
to a program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other_log_enabled <br>
Whether logging of server and private messages to files
should take place. If this is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;, then
you&rsquo;ll be able to recall server and private messages
when you rejoined <br>
and see what you missed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Server/private messages
are logged to files <br>
no = Server/private messages are NOT logged to files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other_log_always <br>
Server and private messages will always be logged while you
are offline, so when you come back you can see what you
missed. You can also, if you wish, log these messages <br>
while online, so if you&rsquo;re only away a short time you
can get an idea of any context etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only applies if
&rsquo;other_log_enabled&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Log server/private
messages while offline and online <br>
no = Log server/private messages only while offline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other_log_maxsize <br>
To preserve your harddisk space, you can limit the size of
the server/private message log file. Once the log file
reaches this number of lines, every line added will <br>
result in a line removed from the top. If you know you are
never going to want all that logged information, this might
be a good setting for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only applies if

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = No limit to log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other_log_recall <br>
Number of lines from the server/private message log file to
automatically recall to your IRC client when you attach. If
this is low, you may not get much useful informa&acirc; <br>
tion, if this is high, it may take a long time for all the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 = Recall the whole log (not
recommended if other_log_always is yes) <br>
0 = Don&rsquo;t automatically recall anything</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other_log_timestamp <br>
Server and private messages can have a timestamp added to
the front to let you know exactly when a message was logged.
These timestamps are displayed when you recall the <br>
log files, or when automatially dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies to the
server/private message log if
&rsquo;other_log_enabled&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo; and
also the permanet copy if &rsquo;other_log_copydir&rsquo; is
set to something other than &rsquo;none&rsquo;.</p>

As well as dircproxy&rsquo;s own log file, it can keep a
permanent copy somewhere for your use. dircproxy will append
all server and private messages seen to this file, but <br>
will not use it itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do define it, it&rsquo;ll
add to the log as it uses it. If you start with
&quot;~/&quot; then it will use a directory under your home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is done regardless of the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_timeoffset <br>
Difference in minutes from your IRC client to the dircproxy
machine. So if you&rsquo;re in GMT, but your dircproxy
machine is in PST (which is 8 hours behind), then this would
<br>
be -(8 * 60) = -480. Used for log file timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = Don&rsquo;t adjust log
timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_events <br>
Events you want dircproxy to log for you. This is a comma
seperated list of event names, prefixed with &rsquo;+&rsquo;
to add the event to the list or &rsquo;-&rsquo; to remove an
event. You <br>
can also specify &rsquo;all&rsquo; to log all events (the
default) or &rsquo;none&rsquo; to not log anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example, to just log text and
action&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_events
&quot;none,+text,+action&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example, to log everything but
server messages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log_events
&quot;all,-server&quot; <br>
# you don&rsquo;t need to specify &rsquo;all&rsquo; <br>
log_events -server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible events are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">text <br>
Channel text and private messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">action <br>
CTCP ACTION events (/me) sent to you or channels</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error <br>
Problems and errors dircproxy encounters (recommended!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_proxy_incoming <br>
Whether dircproxy should proxy DCC chat and send requests
sent to you by others on IRC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Proxy incoming requests.
<br>
no = Do not proxy incoming requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_proxy_outgoing <br>
Whether dircproxy should proxy DCC chat and send requests
sent by you to others on IRC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Proxy outgoing requests.
<br>
no = Do not proxy outgoing requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_proxy_ports <br>
Ports that dircproxy can use to listen for DCC connections
on. This is for when you&rsquo;re behind a firewall that
only allows certain ports through, or when doing DCC-via-
<br>
ssh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is a comma seperated list of
port numbers or ranges of ports, for example
&rsquo;57100-57199,57400,57500,57600-57800&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">any = Use any port given to us
by the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_proxy_timeout <br>
Maxmimum amount of time (in seconds) to allow for both sides
of a DCC proxy to be connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_proxy_sendreject <br>
Whether to send a physical REJECT message via CTCP back to
the source of the request in event of failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Send reject CTCP message
back. <br>
no = Do not send any message back.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_send_fast <br>
Whether to ignore the &quot;acknowledgment&quot; packets
from the client and just send the file to them as fast as
possible. There should be no real danger in doing this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Send as fast as possible.
<br>
no = Wait for each packet to be acknowledged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_capture_directory <br>
dircproxy can capture files sent via DCC and store them on
the server. Especially useful while you are detached,
whether it does it while attached or not depends on <br>
&rsquo;dcc_capture_always&rsquo;. This is the directory to
store those captured files in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If start with &quot;~/&quot;
then it will use a directory under your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not capture files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_capture_always <br>
If we&rsquo;re capturing DCC send&rsquo;s, should we do it
while the client is connected as well? If &rsquo;yes&rsquo;,
then the client will never see the file, it&rsquo;ll be just
stored on the <br>
server with a notice sent to the client telling them
where.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Capture even when a client
is connected. <br>
no = Capture only when client detached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_capture_withnick <br>
Whether to start the filename of the captured file with the
nickname of the sender, so you know who it came from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Start with nickname. <br>
no = Do not alter the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_capture_maxsize <br>
Maximum size (in kilobytes) that a captured file can be. If
a captured file is larger than this, or becomes larger than
this, then the capture will be aborted and the <br>
file removed from the disk. Prevents people from filling
your disk up while you&rsquo;re detached with a massive
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 = No limit to file size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_tunnel_incoming <br>
Port of a local ssh tunnel leading to another dircproxy
client that we should use for incoming DCC requests. This
should not be set if &rsquo;dcc_tunnel_outgoing&rsquo; is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the README.dcc-via-ssh file
included with the dircproxy distribution for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be a numeric port
number, or a service name from /etc/services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = There is no tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dcc_tunnel_outgoing <br>
Port of a local ssh tunnel leading to another dircproxy
client that we should use for outgoing DCC requests. This
should not be set if &rsquo;dcc_tunnel_incoming&rsquo; is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the README.dcc-via-ssh file
included with the dircproxy distribution for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be a numeric port
number, or a service name from /etc/services</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = There is no tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch_user <br>
If you&rsquo;re running dircproxy as root, it can switch to
a different &quot;effective user id&quot; to create the
server connection. This means that your system ident daemon
(and <br>
therefore IRC, if it queries it) will see your server
connection as the user you put here, instead of root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is most useful if you are
sysadmin running a dircproxy server for multiple people and
want them to all appear as different usernames without using
a hacked identd. <br>
Because dircproxy is still running as root, it will have
those privileges for all operations, including the bind(2)
for the &rsquo;local_address&rsquo; config option if
you&rsquo;re using <br>
Secure Linux patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can only be used if your
system supports seteuid(2) and if you are running dircproxy
as the root user, and not just setuid. Attempting otherwise
will generate a <br>
warning as dircproxy starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be a numeric uid or a
username from /etc/passwd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = Do not do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">motd_logo <br>
If this is yes, then the dircproxy logo and version number
will be included in the message of the day when you connect.
Only the picky would turn this off, its pretty!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Show me the pretty logo
<br>
no = I don&rsquo;t like logos, I&rsquo;m boring, I eat
llamas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">motd_file <br>
Custom message of the day file to send when users connect to
dircproxy. The contents of this file will be sent after the
logo and before the stats. If you start this <br>
with a &quot;~/&quot; then it refers to a file in a
directory under your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none = No custom motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">motd_stats <br>
Display information on what channels you were on, and log
file sizes etc in the message of the day. This is handy, and
lets you know how not only much information you <br>
missed, but how much will be sent to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Show the stats <br>
no = They don&rsquo;t interest me, don&rsquo;t show
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_persist <br>
You can disable the /DIRCPROXY PERSIST command if you do not
want people using your proxy to be able to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Command enabled <br>
no = Command disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_jump <br>
You can disable the /DIRCPROXY JUMP command if you do not
want people to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Command enabled <br>
no = Command disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_jump_new <br>
If the /DIRCPROXY JUMP commmand is enabled, then you can
disable it being used to jump to a server:port not in the
list specified in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Can jump to any server
<br>
no = Only ones in the config file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_host <br>
You can disable the /DIRCPROXY HOST command if you do not
want people to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Command enabled <br>
no = Command disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_die <br>
You can enable the /DIRCPROXY DIE command if you want people
to be able to kill your proxy. This isn&rsquo;t recommended
as a global option, instead only enable it for a spe&acirc;
<br>
cific connection class (ie yours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Command enabled <br>
no = Command disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_users <br>
You can enable the /DIRCPROXY USERS command if you want
people to be able to see who&rsquo;s using your proxy. This
isn&rsquo;t recommended as a global option, instead only
enable it <br>
for a specific connection class (ie yours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Command enabled <br>
no = Command disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow_kill <br>
You can enable the /DIRCPROXY KILL command if you want
people to be able to disconnect anyone using your proxy
(including you!). This isn&rsquo;t recommended as a global
<br>
option, instead only enable it for a specific connection
class (ie yours).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yes = Command enabled <br>
no = Command disabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the following
keywords may go only inside a connection class definition.
One &rsquo;password&rsquo; and at least one
&rsquo;server&rsquo; (unless
&rsquo;server_autoconnect&rsquo; is &rsquo;no&rsquo; and
<br>
&rsquo;allow_jump_new&rsquo; is &rsquo;yes&rsquo;) are
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
Password required to use this connection class. This should
be encrypted using your system&rsquo;s crypt(3) function. It
must be the same as the password supplied by the IRC <br>
client on connection for this connection class to be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the included
dircproxy-crypt(1) utility to generate these passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server Server to connect to.
Multiple servers can be given, in which case they are
iterated when the connection to one is dropped. This has the
following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[hostname[:[port][:password]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">from The connection hostname
must match this mask, multiple masks can be specified to
allow more hosts to connect. The * and ? wildcards may be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join Channels to join when you
first connect. Multiple channels can be given, either by
seperating the names with a comma, or by specifying multiple
from the channel name with <br>
a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: You must surround the list
of channels with quotes to distinguish from comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For clarification, this is the
format of this line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join &quot;channel[
key][,channel[ key]]...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
dircproxy will reread its configuration file whenever it
receives the hangup signal, SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending an interrupt signal,
SIGINT, or a terminate signal, SIGTERM, will cause dircproxy
to exit cleanly.</p>
