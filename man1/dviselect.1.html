<i>Dviselect</i> selects pages from a DVI file produced by TeX, creating a new
  DVI file usable by any of the TeX conversion programs, or even by
  <i>dviselect</i> itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>range</i> is a string of the form <i>even</i>, <i>odd</i>, or
  <i>first:last</i> where both <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> are optional numeric
  strings, with negative numbers indicated by a leading underscore character
  ``_''. If both <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> are omitted, the colon may also be
  omitted, or may be replaced with an asterisk ``*''. A <i>page range</i> is a
  list of ranges separated by periods. A <i>list of pages</i> is described by a
  set of page ranges separated by commas and/or white space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Dviselect</i> actually looks at the ten <i>count</i> variables that TeX
  writes; the first of these (\count0) is the page number, with \count1 through
  \count9 having varied uses depending on which macro packages are in use.
  (Typically \count1 might be a chapter or section number.) A page is included
  in <i>dviselect</i>'s output if all its \count values match any one of the
  ranges listed on the command line. For example, the command ``dviselect
  *.1,35:'' might select everything in chapter 1, as well as pages 35 and up.
  ``dviselect 10:30'' would select pages 10 through 30 (inclusive). ``:43''
  means everything up to and including page 43 (including negative-numbered
  pages). To get all even-numbered pages, use ``even''; to get all odd-numbered
  pages, use ``odd''. If a Table of Contents has negative page numbers, ``:_1''
  will select it. Note that ``*'' must be quoted from the shell; the empty
  string is more convenient to use, if harder to read.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Instead of \count values, <i>dviselect</i> can also select by ``absolute page
  number'', where the first page is page 1, the second page 2, and so forth.
  Absolute page numbers are indicated by a leading equal sign ``=''. Ranges of
  absolute pages are also allowed: ``dviselect =3:7'' will extract the third
  through seventh pages. Dot separators are not legal in absolute ranges, and
  there are no negative absolute page numbers. Even/odd specifiers, however, are
  legal; ``dviselect =even'' selects every other page, starting with the second.
<div class="Pp"></div>
More precisely, an asterisk or an empty string implies no limit; an equal sign
  means absolute page number rather than \counts; a leading colon means
  everything up to and including the given page; a trailing colon means
  everything from the given page on; the word ``even'' means only even values
  shall be accepted; the word ``odd'' means only odd values shall be accepted;
  and a period indicates that the next \count should be examined. If fewer than
  10 ranges are specified, the remaining \counts are left unrestricted (that is,
  ``1:5'' and ``1:5.*'' are equivalent). A single number <i>n</i> is treated as
  if it were the range <i>n:n</i>. An arbitrary number of page selectors may be
  given, separated by commas or whitespace; a page is selected if any of the
  selectors matches its \counts or absolute page number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dviselect normally prints the page numbers of the pages selected; the <i>-s</i>
  option suppresses this.

A leading ``-'' ought to be allowed for negative numbers, but it is currently
  used as a synonym for ``:'', for backwards compatibility.

Section or subsection selection will sometimes fail, for the DVI file lists only
  the \count values that were active when the page ended. Clever macro packages
  can alleviate this by making use of other ``free'' \count registers. Chapters
  normally begin on new pages, and do not suffer from this particular problem.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The heuristic that decides which arguments are page selectors and which are file
  names is often wrong. Using shell redirection or the -i and -o options is
  safest.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Dviselect</i> does not adjust the parameters in the postamble; however, since
  these values are normally used only to size certain structures in the output
  conversion programs, and the parameters never need to be adjusted upward, this
  has not proven to be a problem.</div>
