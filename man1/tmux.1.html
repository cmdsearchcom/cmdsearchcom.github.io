<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tmux &acirc; terminal multiplexer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tmux [-28lCquvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L
socket-name] [-S socket-path] [command [flags]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of
terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a
single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and
continue run&acirc; <br>
ning in the background, then later reattached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When tmux is started it creates
a new session with a single window and displays it on
screen. A status line at the bottom of the screen shows
information on the current session <br>
and is used to enter interactive commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session is a single collection
of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux. Each
session has one or more windows linked to it. A window
occupies the entire screen and may <br>
be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate
pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the
technical details of pseudo terminals). Any number of tmux
<br>
instances may connect to the same session, and any number of
windows may be present in the same session. Once all
sessions are killed, tmux exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each session is persistent and
will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1)
connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
&acirc;C-b d&acirc; key strokes). tmux may be reat&acirc;
<br>
tached using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux attach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In tmux, a session is displayed
on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a
single server. The server and each client are separate
processes which communicate through <br>
a socket in /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 Force tmux to assume the
terminal supports 256 colours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8 Like -2, but indicates that
the terminal supports 88 colours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Start in control mode. Given
twice (-CC) disables echo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c shell-command <br>
Execute shell-command using the default shell. If necessary,
the tmux server will be started to retrieve the
default-shell option. This option is for compatibility <br>
with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file Specify an alternative
configuration file. By default, tmux loads the system
configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then
looks for a user configuration <br>
file at ~/.tmux.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration file is a set
of tmux commands which are executed in sequence when the
server is first started. tmux loads configuration files once
when the server <br>
process has started. The source-file command may be used to
load a file later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux shows any error messages
from commands in configuration files in the first session
created, and continues to process the rest of the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L socket-name <br>
tmux stores the server socket in a directory under /tmp (or
TMPDIR if set); the default socket is named default. This
option allows a different socket name to be <br>
specified, allowing several independent tmux servers to be
run. Unlike -S a full path is not necessary: the sockets are
all created in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the socket is accidentally
removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent to the tmux server
process to recreate it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Behave as a login shell. This
flag currently has no effect and is for compatibility with
other shells when using tmux as a login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Set the quiet server option
to prevent the server sending various informational
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S socket-path <br>
Specify a full alternative path to the server socket. If -S
is specified, the default socket directory is not used and
any -L flag is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u tmux attempts to guess if the
terminal is likely to support UTF-8 by checking the first of
the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environment variables to be
set for the <br>
string &quot;UTF-8&quot;. This is not always correct: the -u
flag explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the server is started from a
client passed -u or where UTF-8 is detected, the utf8 and
status-utf8 options are enabled in the global window and
session options <br>
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Request verbose logging. This
option may be specified multiple times for increasing
verbosity. Log messages will be saved into
tmux-client-PID.log and <br>
tmux-server-PID.log files in the current directory, where
PID is the PID of the server or client process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Report the tmux version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [flags] <br>
This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
tmux, as described in the following sections. If no commands
are specified, the new-session command is <br>
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a
key combination of a prefix key, &acirc;C-b&acirc; (Ctrl-b)
by default, followed by a command key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default command key bindings
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-b Send the prefix key (C-b)
through to the application. <br>
C-o Rotate the panes in the current window forwards. <br>
C-z Suspend the tmux client. <br>

M-Up, M-Down <br>
M-Left, M-Right <br>
Resize the current pane in steps of five cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key bindings may be changed with
the bind-key and unbind-key commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
This section contains a list of the commands supported by
tmux. Most commands accept the optional -t argument with one
of target-client, target-session target-window, or <br>
target-pane. These specify the client, session, window or
pane which a command should affect. target-client is the
name of the pty(4) file to which the client is connected,
for <br>
example either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the client
attached to /dev/ttyp1. If no client is specified, the
current client is chosen, if possible, or an error is
reported. <br>
Clients may be listed with the list-clients command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-session is the session id
prefixed with a $, the name of a session (as listed by the
list-sessions command), or the name of a client with the
same syntax as target-client, <br>
in which case the session attached to the client is used.
When looking for the session name, tmux initially searches
for an exact match; if none is found, the session names are
<br>
checked for any for which target-session is a prefix or for
which it matches as an fnmatch(3) pattern. If a single match
is found, it is used as the target session; multiple <br>
matches produce an error. If a session is omitted, the
current session is used if available; if no current session
is available, the most recently used is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-window specifies a window
in the form session:window. session follows the same rules
as for target-session, and window is looked for in order: as
a window index, for exam&acirc; <br>
ple mysession:1; as a window ID, such as @1; as an exact
window name, such as mysession:mywindow; then as an
fnmatch(3) pattern or the start of a window name, such as
myses&acirc; <br>
sion:mywin* or mysession:mywin. An empty window name
specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example
the new-window and link-window commands) otherwise the
current <br>
window in session is chosen. The special character
&acirc;!&acirc; uses the last (previously current) window,
&acirc;^&acirc; selects the highest numbered window,
&acirc;$&acirc; selects the lowest numbered window, <br>
and &acirc;+&acirc; and &acirc;-&acirc; select the next
window or the previous window by number. When the argument
does not contain a colon, tmux first attempts to parse it as
window; if that fails, an <br>
attempt is made to match a session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target-pane takes a similar form
to target-window but with the optional addition of a period
followed by a pane index, for example: mysession:mywindow.1.
If the pane index is <br>
omitted, the currently active pane in the specified window
is used. If neither a colon nor period appears, tmux first
attempts to use the argument as a pane index; if that fails,
<br>
it is looked up as for target-window. A &acirc;+&acirc; or
&acirc;-&acirc; indicate the next or previous pane index,
respectively. One of the strings top, bottom, left, right,
top-left, top-right, <br>
bottom-left or bottom-right may be used instead of a pane
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special characters
&acirc;+&acirc; and &acirc;-&acirc; may be followed by an
offset, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-window -t:+2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dealing with a session that
doesn&rsquo;t contain sequential window indexes, they will
be correctly skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux also gives each pane
created in a server an identifier consisting of a
&acirc;%&acirc; and a number, starting from zero. A
pane&rsquo;s identifier is unique for the life of the tmux
server and <br>
is passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE
environment variable. It may be used alone to target a pane
or the window containing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell-command arguments are
sh(1) commands. These must be passed as a single item, which
typically means quoting them, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-window &rsquo;vi
/etc/passwd&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [arguments] refers to a
tmux command, passed with the command and arguments
separately, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key F1 set-window-option
force-width 81</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or if using sh(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux bind-key F1
set-window-option force-width 81</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple commands may be
specified together as part of a command sequence. Each
command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon;
commands are executed sequentially from left <br>
to right and lines ending with a backslash continue on to
the next line, except when escaped by another backslash. A
literal semicolon may be included by escaping it with a
back&acirc; <br>
slash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to
bind-key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example tmux commands
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-session -tfirst
newname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-window-option -t:0
monitor-activity on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-window ; split-window -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key R source-file
~/.tmux.conf ; display-message &quot;source-file
done&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or from sh(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux kill-window -t :1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-window ; split-window
-d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-session -d &rsquo;vi
/etc/passwd&rsquo; ; split-window -d ; attach</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENTS AND SESSIONS <br>
The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and
panes. Clients are attached to sessions to interact with
them, either when they are created with the new-session
command, or <br>
later with the attach-session command. Each session has one
or more windows linked into it. Windows may be linked to
multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each
<br>
of which contains a pseudo terminal. Commands for creating,
linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in
the WINDOWS AND PANES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following commands are
available to manage clients and sessions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attach-session [-dr] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: attach) <br>
If run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current
terminal and attach it to target-session. If used from
inside, switch the current client. If -d is specified, <br>
any other clients attached to the session are detached. -r
signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the
detach-client or switch-client commands have any <br>
effect)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no server is started,
attach-session will attempt to start it; this will fail
unless sessions are created in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target-session rules for
attach-session are slightly adjusted: if tmux needs to
select the most recently used session, it will prefer the
most recently used unattached <br>
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detach-client [-P] [-a] [-s
target-session] [-t target-client] <br>
(alias: detach) <br>
Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client
specified with -t, or all clients currently attached to the
session specified by -s. The -a option kills all but <br>
the client given with -t. If -P is given, send SIGHUP to the
parent process of the client, typically causing it to
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has-session [-t target-session]
<br>
(alias: has) <br>
Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session
does not exist. If it does exist, exit with 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-server <br>
Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-session <br>
[-a] [-t target-session] Destroy the given session, closing
any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and
detaching all clients attached to it. If -a is given, all
<br>
sessions but the specified one is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-clients [-F format] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: lsc) <br>
List all clients attached to the server. For the meaning of
the -F flag, see the FORMATS section. If target-session is
specified, list only clients connected to that ses&acirc;
<br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-commands <br>
(alias: lscm) <br>
List the syntax of all commands supported by tmux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-sessions [-F format] <br>
(alias: ls) <br>
List all sessions managed by the server. For the meaning of
the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-client [-t target-client]
<br>
(alias: lockc) <br>
Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-session [-t target-session]
<br>
(alias: locks) <br>
Lock all clients attached to target-session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-session [-AdDP] [-F format]
[-n window-name] [-s session-name] [-t target-session] [-x
width] [-y height] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: new) <br>
Create a new session with name session-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new session is attached to
the current terminal unless -d is given. window-name and
shell-command are the name of and shell command to execute
in the initial window. <br>
If -d is used, -x and -y specify the size of the initial
window (80 by 24 if not given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If run from a terminal, any
termios(4) special characters are saved and used for new
windows in the new session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A flag makes new-session
behave like attach-session if session-name already exists;
in the case, -D behaves like -d to attach-session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t is given, the new session
is grouped with target-session. This means they share the
same set of windows - all windows from target-session are
linked to the new ses&acirc; <br>
sion and any subsequent new windows or windows being closed
are applied to both sessions. The current and previous
window and any session options remain independent and <br>
either session may be killed without affecting the other.
Giving -n or shell-command are invalid if -t is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P option prints information
about the new session after it has been created. By default,
it uses the format &acirc;#{session_name}:&acirc; but a
different format may be specified <br>
with -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh-client [-S] [-t
target-client] <br>
(alias: refresh) <br>
Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single
client if one is given with -t. If -S is specified, only
update the client&rsquo;s status bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-session [-t
target-session] new-name <br>
(alias: rename) <br>
Rename the session to new-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-messages [-t target-client]
<br>
(alias: showmsgs) <br>
Any messages displayed on the status line are saved in a
per-client message log, up to a maximum of the limit set by
the message-limit session option for the session <br>
attached to that client. This command displays the log for
target-client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source-file path <br>
(alias: source) <br>
Execute commands from path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start-server <br>
(alias: start) <br>
Start the tmux server, if not already running, without
creating any sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suspend-client [-t
target-client] <br>
(alias: suspendc) <br>
Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch-client [-lnpr] [-c
target-client] [-t target-session] <br>
(alias: switchc) <br>
Switch the current session for client target-client to
target-session. If -l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved
to the last, next or previous session respectively. -r <br>
toggles whether a client is read-only (see the
attach-session command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOWS AND PANES <br>
A tmux window may be in one of several modes. The default
permits direct access to the terminal attached to the
window. The other is copy mode, which permits a section of a
win&acirc; <br>
dow or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later
insertion into another window. This mode is entered with the
copy-mode command, bound to &acirc;[&acirc; by default. It
is also <br>
entered when a command that produces output, such as
list-keys, is executed from a key binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keys available depend on
whether emacs or vi mode is selected (see the mode-keys
option). The following keys are supported as appropriate for
the mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function vi emacs <br>

Search forward / C-s <br>
Start of line 0 C-a <br>
Start selection Space C-Space <br>
Top of history g M-&gt; <br>
Transpose characters C-t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next and previous word keys
use space and the &acirc;-&acirc;, &acirc;_&acirc; and
&acirc;@&acirc; characters as word delimiters by default,
but this can be adjusted by setting the word-separators
session option. <br>
Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end
to the end of the next word and previous word to the start
of the previous word. The three next and previous space <br>
keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word
separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jump commands enable quick
movement within a line. For instance, typing &acirc;f&acirc;
followed by &acirc;/&acirc; will move the cursor to the next
&acirc;/&acirc; character on the current line. A
&acirc;;&acirc; will <br>
then jump to the next occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands in copy mode may be
prefaced by an optional repeat count. With vi key bindings,
a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the
Alt (meta) key and a number <br>
begins prefix entry. For example, to move the cursor forward
by ten words, use &acirc;M-1 0 M-f&acirc; in emacs mode, and
&acirc;10w&acirc; in vi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When copying the selection, the
repeat count indicates the buffer index to replace, if
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode key bindings are defined in
a set of named tables: vi-edit and emacs-edit for keys used
when line editing at the command prompt; vi-choice and
emacs-choice for keys used when <br>
choosing from lists (such as produced by the choose-window
command); and vi-copy and emacs-copy used in copy mode. The
tables may be viewed with the list-keys command and keys
<br>
modified or removed with bind-key and unbind-key. One
command accepts an argument, copy-pipe, which copies the
selection and pipes it to a command. For example the
following will <br>
bind &acirc;C-q&acirc; to copy the selection into /tmp as
well as the paste buffer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key -temacs-copy C-q
copy-pipe &quot;cat &gt;/tmp/out&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The paste buffer key pastes the
first line from the top paste buffer on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The synopsis for the copy-mode
command is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy-mode [-u] [-t target-pane]
<br>
Enter copy mode. The -u option scrolls one page up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each window displayed by tmux
may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes up a
certain area of the display and is a separate terminal. A
window may be split into panes <br>
using the split-window command. Windows may be split
horizontally (with the -h flag) or vertically. Panes may be
resized with the resize-pane command (bound to
&acirc;C-up&acirc;, &acirc;C-down&acirc; <br>
&acirc;C-left&acirc; and &acirc;C-right&acirc; by default),
the current pane may be changed with the select-pane command
and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands may be used to
swap panes without <br>
changing their position. Panes are numbered beginning from
zero in the order they are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of preset layouts are
available. These may be selected with the select-layout
command or cycled with next-layout (bound to
&acirc;Space&acirc; by default); once a layout is chosen,
<br>
panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following layouts are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even-horizontal <br>
Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">even-vertical <br>
Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-horizontal <br>
A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and
the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the
leftover space at the bottom. Use the main-pane-height <br>
window option to specify the height of the top pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-vertical <br>
Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on
the left and the others spread from top to bottom along the
right. See the main-pane-width window option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tiled Panes are spread out as
evenly as possible over the window in both rows and
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, select-layout may
be used to apply a previously used layout - the list-windows
command displays the layout of each window in a form
suitable for use with <br>
select-layout. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux list-windows <br>
0: ksh [159x48] <br>
layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0} <br>
$ tmux select-layout
bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux automatically adjusts the
size of the layout for the current window size. Note that a
layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than
that from which the layout was <br>
originally defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands related to windows and
panes are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break-pane [-dP] [-F format] [-t
target-pane] <br>
(alias: breakp) <br>
Break target-pane off from its containing window to make it
the only pane in a new window. If -d is given, the new
window does not become the current window. The -P <br>
option prints information about the new window after it has
been created. By default, it uses the format
&acirc;#{session_name}:#{window_index}&acirc; but a
different format may be <br>
specified with -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capture-pane [-aepPq] [-b
buffer-index] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t target-pane]
<br>
(alias: capturep) <br>
Capture the contents of a pane. If -p is given, the output
goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or
a new buffer if omitted. If -a is given, the <br>
alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.
If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned
unless -q is given. If -e is given, the output <br>
includes escape sequences for text and background
attributes. -C also escapes non-printable characters as
octal . -J joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces
<br>
at each line&rsquo;s end. -P captures only any output that
the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet
incomplete escape sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S and -E specify the starting
and ending line numbers, zero is the first line of the
visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.
The default is to capture <br>
only the visible contents of the pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-client [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to
be selected interactively from a list. After a client is
chosen, &acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the client pty(4)
path in <br>
template and the result executed as a command. If template
is not given, &quot;detach-client -t &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot;
is used. For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS
section. This <br>
command works only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-list [-l items] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into list choice mode, allowing items to be
selected. items can be a comma-separated list to display
more than one item. If an item has spaces, that entry <br>
must be quoted. After an item is chosen, &acirc;%%&acirc; is
replaced by the chosen item in the template and the result
is executed as a command. If template is not given,
&quot;run-shell <br>
&rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used. items also accepts format
specifiers. For the meaning of this see the FORMATS section.
This command works only if at least one client is
attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-session [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may
be selected interactively from a list. When one is chosen,
&acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the session name in template
and <br>
the result executed as a command. If template is not given,
&quot;switch-client -t &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used. For
the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section. This
command works <br>
only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-tree [-suw] [-b
session-template] [-c window-template] [-S format] [-W
format] [-t target-window] <br>
Put a window into tree choice mode, where either sessions or
windows may be selected interactively from a list. By
default, windows belonging to a session are indented to <br>
show their relationship to a session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the choose-window and
choose-session commands are wrappers around choose-tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -s is given, will show
sessions. If -w is given, will show windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the tree is
collapsed and sessions must be expanded to windows with the
right arrow key. The -u option will start with all sessions
expanded instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -b is given, will override
the default session command. Note that &acirc;%%&acirc; can
be used and will be replaced with the session name. The
default option if not specified is <br>
&quot;switch-client -t &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot;. If -c is
given, will override the default window command. Like -b,
&acirc;%%&acirc; can be used and will be replaced with the
session name and window index. <br>
When a window is chosen from the list, the session command
is run before the window command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -S is given will display the
specified format instead of the default session format. If
-W is given will display the specified format instead of the
default window for&acirc; <br>
mat. For the meaning of the -s and -w options, see the
FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command works only if at
least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-window [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be
chosen interactively from a list. After a window is
selected, &acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the session name
and window <br>
index in template and the result executed as a command. If
template is not given, &quot;select-window -t
&rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used. For the meaning of the -F
flag, see the FORMATS sec&acirc; <br>
tion. This command works only if at least one client is
attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-panes [-t target-client]
<br>
(alias: displayp) <br>
Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by
target-client. See the display-panes-time,
display-panes-colour, and display-panes-active-colour
session options. While <br>
the indicator is on screen, a pane may be selected with the
&acirc;0&acirc; to &acirc;9&acirc; keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find-window [-CNT] [-F format]
[-t target-window] match-string <br>
(alias: findw) <br>
Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window
names, titles, and visible content (but not history). The
flags control matching behavior: -C matches only visible
<br>
window contents, -N matches only the window name and -T
matches only the window title. The default is -CNT. If only
one window is matched, it&rsquo;ll be automatically <br>
selected, otherwise a choice list is shown. For the meaning
of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section. This command works
only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p
percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane] <br>
(alias: joinp) <br>
Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and
creating a new pane, split it and move src-pane into the
space. This can be used to reverse break-pane. The -b <br>
option causes src-pane to be joined to left of or above
dst-pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
<br>
(alias: killp) <br>
Destroy the given pane. If no panes remain in the containing
window, it is also destroyed. The -a option kills all but
the pane given with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill-window [-a] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: killw) <br>
Kill the current window or the window at target-window,
removing it from any sessions to which it is linked. The -a
option kills all but the window given with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last-pane [-t target-window]
<br>
(alias: lastp) <br>
Select the last (previously selected) pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last-window [-t target-session]
<br>
(alias: last) <br>
Select the last (previously selected) window. If no
target-session is specified, select the last window of the
current session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link-window [-dk] [-s
src-window] [-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: linkw) <br>
Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.
If dst-window is specified and no such window exists, the
src-window is linked there. If -k is given and <br>
dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is
generated. If -d is given, the newly linked window is not
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-t
target] <br>
(alias: lsp) <br>
If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the
server are listed. If -s is given, target is a session (or
the current session). If neither is given, target is a <br>
window (or the current window). For the meaning of the -F
flag, see the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-windows [-a] [-F format]
[-t target-session] <br>
(alias: lsw) <br>
If -a is given, list all windows on the server. Otherwise,
list windows in the current session or in target-session.
For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS sec&acirc;
<br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p
percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane] <br>
(alias: movep) <br>
Like join-pane, but src-pane and dst-pane may belong to the
same window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move-window [-rdk] [-s
src-window] [-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: movew) <br>
This is similar to link-window, except the window at
src-window is moved to dst-window. With -r, all windows in
the session are renumbered in sequential order, respecting
<br>
the base-index option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new-window [-adkP] [-c
start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t
target-window] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: neww) <br>
Create a new window. With -a, the new window is inserted at
the next index up from the specified target-window, moving
windows up if necessary, otherwise target-window is <br>
the new window location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -d is given, the session does
not make the new window the current window. target-window
represents the window to be created; if the target already
exists an error is <br>
shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is
destroyed. shell-command is the command to execute. If
shell-command is not specified, the value of the <br>
default-command option is used. -c specifies the working
directory in which the new window is created. It may have an
absolute path or one of the following values (or a <br>
subdirectory):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty string Current
pane&rsquo;s directory <br>
~ User&rsquo;s home directory <br>
- Where session was started <br>
. Where server was started</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the shell command
completes, the window closes. See the remain-on-exit option
to change this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TERM environment variable
must be set to &acirc;screen&acirc; for all programs running
inside tmux. New windows will automatically have
&acirc;TERM=screen&acirc; added to their environment, <br>
but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P option prints information
about the new window after it has been created. By default,
it uses the format
&acirc;#{session_name}:#{window_index}&acirc; but a
different format <br>
may be specified with -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next-layout [-t target-window]
<br>
(alias: nextl) <br>
Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to
fit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next-window [-a] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: next) <br>
Move to the next window in the session. If -a is used, move
to the next window with an alert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe-pane [-o] [-t target-pane]
[shell-command] <br>
(alias: pipep) <br>
Pipe any output sent by the program in target-pane to a
shell command. A pane may only be piped to one command at a
time, any existing pipe is closed before shell-command <br>
is executed. The shell-command string may contain the
special character sequences supported by the status-left
option. If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if
<br>
any) is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o option only opens a new
pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be
toggled with a single key, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o
&rsquo;cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">previous-layout [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: prevl) <br>
Move to the previous layout in the session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">previous-window [-a] [-t
target-session] <br>
(alias: prev) <br>
Move to the previous window in the session. With -a, move to
the previous window with an alert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rename-window [-t target-window]
new-name <br>
(alias: renamew) <br>
Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if
specified, to new-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resize-pane [-DLRUZ] [-t
target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment] <br>
(alias: resizep) <br>
Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with
-U, -D, -L or -R, or to an absolute size with -x or -y. The
adjustment is given in lines or cells (the default is <br>
1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -Z, the active pane is
toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of the window)
and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respawn-pane [-k] [-t
target-pane] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: respawnp) <br>
Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the
remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not
given, the command used when the pane was created is
exe&acirc; <br>
cuted. The pane must be already inactive, unless -k is
given, in which case any existing command is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respawn-window [-k] [-t
target-window] [shell-command] <br>
(alias: respawnw) <br>
Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the
remain-on-exit window option). If shell-command is not
given, the command used when the window was created is <br>
executed. The window must be already inactive, unless -k is
given, in which case any existing command is killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rotate-window [-DU] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: rotatew) <br>
Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either
upward (numerically lower) with -U or downward (numerically
higher).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-layout [-np] [-t
target-window] [layout-name] <br>
(alias: selectl) <br>
Choose a specific layout for a window. If layout-name is not
given, the last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied. -n
and -p are equivalent to the next-layout and <br>
previous-layout commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-pane [-lDLRU] [-t
target-pane] <br>
(alias: selectp) <br>
Make pane target-pane the active pane in window
target-window. If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used,
respectively the pane below, to the left, to the right, or
above the <br>
target pane is used. -l is the same as using the last-pane
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-window [-lnpT] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: selectw) <br>
Select the window at target-window. -l, -n and -p are
equivalent to the last-window, next-window and
previous-window commands. If -T is given and the selected
window is <br>
already the current window, the command behaves like
last-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">split-window [-dhvP] [-c
start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane]
[shell-command] [-F format] <br>
(alias: splitw) <br>
Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a
horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither is
specified, -v is assumed. The -l and -p options specify the
<br>
size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage,
respectively. All other options have the same meaning as for
the <br>
new-window command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap-pane [-dDU] [-s src-pane]
[-t dst-pane] <br>
(alias: swapp) <br>
Swap two panes. If -U is used and no source pane is
specified with -s, dst-pane is swapped with the previous
pane (before it numerically); -D swaps with the next pane
<br>
(after it numerically). -d instructs tmux not to change the
active pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap-window [-d] [-s src-window]
[-t dst-window] <br>
(alias: swapw) <br>
This is similar to link-window, except the source and
destination windows are swapped. It is an error if no window
exists at src-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlink-window [-k] [-t
target-window] <br>
(alias: unlinkw) <br>
Unlink target-window. Unless -k is given, a window may be
unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows
may not be linked to no sessions; if -k is specified <br>
and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked
and destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or
without a prefix key. When specifying keys, most represent
themselves (for example &acirc;A&acirc; to &acirc;Z&acirc;).
Ctrl keys may be prefixed <br>
with &acirc;C-&acirc; or &acirc;^&acirc;, and Alt (meta)
with &acirc;M-&acirc;. In addition, the following special
key names are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab,
DC (Delete), End, Enter, Escape, F1 to <br>
F20, Home, IC (Insert), NPage/PageDown/PgDn,
PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab. Note that to bind the
&acirc;&quot;&acirc; or &acirc;&rsquo;&acirc; keys,
quotation marks are necessary, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key &rsquo;&quot;&rsquo;
split-window <br>
bind-key &quot;&rsquo;&quot; new-window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands related to key bindings
are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind-key [-cnr] [-t key-table]
key command [arguments] <br>
(alias: bind) <br>
Bind key key to command. By default (without -t) the primary
key bindings are modified (those normally activated with the
prefix key); in this case, if -n is specified, it <br>
is not necessary to use the prefix key, command is bound to
key alone. The -r flag indicates this key may repeat, see
the repeat-time option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t is present, key is bound
in key-table: the binding for command mode with -c or for
normal mode without. To view the default bindings and
possible commands, see the <br>
list-keys command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-keys [-t key-table] <br>
(alias: lsk) <br>
List all key bindings. Without -t the primary key bindings -
those executed when preceded by the prefix key - are
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -t, the key bindings in
key-table are listed; this may be one of: vi-edit,
emacs-edit, vi-choice, emacs-choice, vi-copy or
emacs-copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send-keys [-lR] [-t target-pane]
key ... <br>
(alias: send) <br>
Send a key or keys to a window. Each argument key is the
name of the key (such as &acirc;C-a&acirc; or
&acirc;npage&acirc; ) to send; if the string is not
recognised as a key, it is sent as a <br>
series of characters. The -l flag disables key name lookup
and sends the keys literally. All arguments are sent
sequentially from first to last. The -R flag causes the <br>
terminal state to be reset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send-prefix [-2] [-t
target-pane] <br>
Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to
a window as if it was pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unbind-key [-acn] [-t key-table]
key <br>
(alias: unbind) <br>
Unbind the command bound to key. Without -t the primary key
bindings are modified; in this case, if -n is specified, the
command bound to key without a prefix (if any) is <br>
removed. If -a is present, all key bindings are removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t is present, key in
key-table is unbound: the binding for command mode with -c
or for normal mode without.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The appearance and behaviour of tmux may be modified by
changing the value of various options. There are three types
of option: server options, session options and window
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tmux server has a set of
global options which do not apply to any particular window
or session. These are altered with the set-option -s
command, or displayed with the <br>
show-options -s command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, each individual
session may have a set of session options, and there is a
separate set of global session options. Sessions which do
not have a particular option con&acirc; <br>
figured inherit the value from the global session options.
Session options are set or unset with the set-option command
and may be listed with the show-options command. The <br>
available server and session options are listed under the
set-option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, a set of window
options is attached to each window, and there is a set of
global window options from which any unset options are
inherited. Window options are altered <br>
with the set-window-option command and can be listed with
the show-window-options command. All window options are
documented with the set-window-option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tmux also supports user options
which are prefixed with a &acirc;@&acirc;. User options may
have any name, so long as they are prefixed with
&acirc;@&acirc;, and be set to any string. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux setw -q @foo
&quot;abc123&quot; <br>
$ tmux showw -v @foo <br>
abc123</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands which set options are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-option [-agoqsuw] [-t
target-session | target-window] option value <br>
(alias: set) <br>
Set a window option with -w (equivalent to the
set-window-option command), a server option with -s,
otherwise a session option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -g is specified, the global
session or window option is set. With -a, and if the option
expects a string, value is appended to the existing setting.
The -u flag unsets <br>
an option, so a session inherits the option from the global
options. It is not possible to unset a global option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -o flag prevents setting an
option that is already set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -q flag suppresses the

set).</p>

top of the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if
necessary to maintain this maximum length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape-time time <br>
Set the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an
escape is input to determine if it is part of a function or
meta key sequences. The default is 500 mil&acirc; <br>
liseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit-unattached [on | off] <br>
If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet [on | off] <br>
Enable or disable the display of various informational
messages (see also the -q command line flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-clipboard [on | off] <br>
Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the
\]52;... 07 xterm(1) escape sequences. This option is on by
default if there is an Ms entry in the <br>
terminfo(5) description for the client terminal. Note that
this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the
resource:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disallowedWindowOps:
20,21,SetXprop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or changing this property from
the xterm(1) interactive menu when required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Available session options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assume-paste-time milliseconds
<br>
If keys are entered faster than one in milliseconds, they
are assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and tmux
key bindings are not processed. The default is <br>
one millisecond and zero disables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">base-index index <br>

searched when a new window is created. The default is
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell-action [any | none |
current] <br>
Set action on window bell. any means a bell in any window
linked to a session causes a bell in the current window of
that session, none means all bells are ignored <br>
and current means only bells in windows other than the
current window are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bell-on-alert [on | off] <br>
If on, ring the terminal bell when an alert occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-command shell-command
<br>
Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when
the window is created) to shell-command, which may be any
sh(1) command. The default is an empty <br>
string, which instructs tmux to create a login shell using
the value of the default-shell option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-path path <br>
Set the default working directory for new panes. If empty
(the default), the working directory is determined from the
process running in the active pane, from the <br>
command line environment or from the working directory where
the session was created. Otherwise the same options are
available as for the -c flag to new-window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-shell path <br>
Specify the default shell. This is used as the login shell
for new windows when the default-command option is set to
empty, and must be the full path of the exe&acirc; <br>
cutable. When started tmux tries to set a default value from
the first suitable of the SHELL environment variable, the
shell returned by getpwuid(3), or /bin/sh. <br>
This option should be configured when tmux is used as a
login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-terminal terminal <br>
Set the default terminal for new windows created in this
session - the default value of the TERM environment
variable. For tmux to work correctly, this must be set <br>

setting applies only to new windows - existing window
histories are not resized and retain the limit <br>
at the point they were created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-after-time number <br>
Lock the session (like the lock-session command) after
number seconds of inactivity, or the entire server (all
sessions) if the lock-server option is set. The <br>
default is not to lock (set to 0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-command shell-command <br>
Command to run when locking each client. The default is to
run lock(1) with -np.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-server [on | off] <br>
If this option is on (the default), instead of each session
locking individually as each has been idle for
lock-after-time, the entire server will lock after all <br>
sessions would have locked. This has no effect as a session
option; it must be set as a global option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">message-attr attributes <br>
Set status line message attributes, where attributes is
either none or a comma-delimited list of one or more of:
bright (or bold), dim, underscore, blink, reverse, <br>

If on, tmux captures the mouse and allows panes to be
resized by dragging on their borders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mouse-select-pane [on | off]
<br>
If on, tmux captures the mouse and when a window is split
into multiple panes the mouse may be used to select the
current pane. The mouse click is also passed <br>
through to the application as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mouse-select-window [on | off]
<br>
If on, clicking the mouse on a window name in the status
line will select that window.</p>

Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renumber-windows [on | off] <br>
If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically
renumber the other windows in numerical order. This respects
the base-index option if it has been set. <br>
If off, do not renumber the windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repeat-time time <br>
Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the
prefix-key again in the specified time milliseconds (the
default is 500). Whether a key repeats may be <br>
set when it is bound using the -r flag to bind-key. Repeat
is enabled for the default keys bound to the resize-pane
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-remain-on-exit [on | off]
<br>
Set the remain-on-exit window option for any windows first
created in this session. When this option is true, windows
in which the running program has exited do <br>
not close, instead remaining open but inactivate. Use the
respawn-window command to reactivate such a window, or the
kill-window command to destroy it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-titles [on | off] <br>
Attempt to set the client terminal title using the tsl and
fsl terminfo(5) entries if they exist. tmux automatically
sets these to the \]2;... 07 sequence if the <br>
terminal appears to be an xterm. This option is off by
default. Note that elinks will only attempt to set the
window title if the STY environment variable is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-titles-string string <br>
String used to set the window title if set-titles is on.
Character sequences are replaced as for the status-left
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status [on | off] <br>
Show or hide the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-attr attributes <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-fg colour <br>
Set status line foreground colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-interval interval <br>
Update the status bar every interval seconds. By default,
updates will occur every 15 seconds. A setting of zero
disables redrawing at interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-justify [left | centre |
right] <br>
Set the position of the window list component of the status
line: left, centre or right justified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-keys [vi | emacs] <br>
Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for

the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables <br>
are set and contain the string &acirc;vi&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-left string <br>
Display string to the left of the status bar. string will be
passed through strftime(3) before being used. By default,
the session name is shown. string may con&acirc; <br>
tain any of the following special character sequences:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character pair Replaced with
<br>
#(shell-command) First line of the command&rsquo;s output
<br>
#[attributes] Colour or attribute change <br>
#H Hostname of local host <br>
#h Hostname of local host without the domain name <br>

#P Current pane index <br>
#S Session name <br>
#T Current pane title <br>
#W Current window name <br>
## A literal &acirc;#&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The #(shell-command) form
executes &acirc;shell-command&acirc; and inserts the first
line of its output. Note that shell commands are only
executed once at the interval speci&acirc; <br>
fied by the status-interval option: if the status line is
redrawn in the meantime, the previous result is used. Shell
commands are executed with the tmux global <br>
environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For details on how the names and
titles can be set see the NAMES AND TITLES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#[attributes] allows a
comma-separated list of attributes to be specified, these
may be &acirc;fg=colour&acirc; to set the foreground colour,
&acirc;bg=colour&acirc; to set the background <br>
colour, the name of one of the attributes (listed under the
message-attr option) to turn an attribute on, or an
attribute prefixed with &acirc;no&acirc; to turn one off,
for <br>
example nobright. Examples are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#(sysctl vm.loadavg) <br>
#[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where appropriate, special
character sequences may be prefixed with a number to specify
the maximum length, for example &acirc;#24T&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, UTF-8 in string is
not interpreted, to enable UTF-8, use the status-utf8
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-left-attr attributes <br>
Set the attribute of the left part of the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-left-bg colour <br>

bar. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-position [top | bottom]
<br>
Set the position of the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right string <br>
Display string to the right of the status bar. By default,
the current window title in double quotes, the date and the
time are shown. As with status-left, string <br>
will be passed to strftime(3), character pairs are replaced,
and UTF-8 is dependent on the status-utf8 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right-attr attributes
<br>
Set the attribute of the right part of the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right-bg colour <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-right-length length <br>
Set the maximum length of the right component of the status
bar. The default is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status-utf8 [on | off] <br>
Instruct tmux to treat top-bit-set characters in the
status-left and status-right strings as UTF-8; notably, this
is important for wide characters. This option <br>
defaults to off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">terminal-overrides string <br>
Contains a list of entries which override terminal
descriptions read using terminfo(5). string is a
comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated string
<br>
made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using
fnmatch(3)) and a set of name=value entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to set the
&acirc;clear&acirc; terminfo(5) entry to
&acirc;\[H\[2J&acirc; for all terminal types and the
&acirc;dch1&acirc; entry to &acirc;\[P&acirc; for the
&acirc;rxvt&acirc; terminal type, the option <br>
could be set to the string:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*:clear=\[H\[2J,rxvt:dch1=\[P&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The terminal entry value is
passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation. The
default value forcibly corrects the &acirc;colors&acirc;
entry for terminals which support 88 <br>
or 256 colours:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;*88col*:colors=88,*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-environment variables
<br>
Set a space-separated string containing a list of
environment variables to be copied into the session
environment when a new session is created or an existing
ses&acirc; <br>
sion is attached. Any variables that do not exist in the
source environment are set to be removed from the session
environment (as if -r was given to the <br>
set-environment command). The default is &quot;DISPLAY
SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_CONNECTION
WINDOWID XAUTHORITY&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-activity [on | off] <br>
If on, display a status line message when activity occurs in
a window for which the monitor-activity window option is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-bell [on | off] <br>
If this option is on, a message is shown on a bell instead
of it being passed through to the terminal (which normally
makes a sound). Also see the bell-action <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-content [on | off] <br>
Like visual-activity, display a message when content is
present in a window for which the monitor-content window
option is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visual-silence [on | off] <br>
If monitor-silence is enabled, prints a message after the
interval has expired on a given window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">word-separators string <br>
Sets the session&rsquo;s conception of what characters are
considered word separators, for the purposes of the next and
previous word commands in copy mode. The default <br>
is &acirc; -_@&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-window-option [-agqu] [-t
target-window] option value <br>
(alias: setw) <br>
Set a window option. The -a, -g, -q and -u flags work
similarly to the set-option command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported window options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aggressive-resize [on | off]
<br>
Aggressively resize the chosen window. This means that tmux
will resize the window to the size of the smallest session
for which it is the current window, rather <br>
than the smallest session to which it is attached. The
window may resize when the current window is changed on
another sessions; this option is good for full- <br>
screen programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for
interactive programs such as shells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-rename [on | off] <br>
Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal
escape sequence ( 33k... 33\). The default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternate-screen [on | off] <br>
This option configures whether programs running inside tmux
may use the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows
the smcup and rmcup terminfo(5) capabili&acirc; <br>
ties. The alternate screen feature preserves the contents of
the window when an interactive application starts and
restores it on exit, so that any output visible <br>
before the application starts reappears unchanged after it
exits. The default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">automatic-rename [on | off] <br>
Control automatic window renaming. When this setting is
enabled, tmux will attempt - on supported platforms - to
rename the window to reflect the command currently <br>
running in it. This flag is automatically disabled for an
individual window when a name is specified at creation with
new-window or new-session, or later with <br>
rename-window, or with a terminal escape sequence. It may be
switched off globally with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-window-option -g
automatic-rename off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c0-change-interval interval <br>
c0-change-trigger trigger <br>
These two options configure a simple form of rate limiting
for a pane. If tmux sees more than trigger C0 sequences that
modify the screen (for example, carriage <br>
returns, linefeeds or backspaces) in one millisecond, it
will stop updating the pane immediately and instead redraw
it entirely every interval milliseconds. This <br>
helps to prevent fast output (such as yes(1) overwhelming
the terminal). The default is a trigger of 250 and an
interval of 100. A trigger of zero disables the <br>
rate limiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock-mode-colour colour <br>
Set clock colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock-mode-style [12 | 24] <br>
Set clock hour format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force-height height <br>
force-width width <br>
Prevent tmux from resizing a window to greater than width or
height. A value of zero restores the default unlimited
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main-pane-height height <br>
main-pane-width width <br>
Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in
the main-horizontal or main-vertical layouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-attr attributes <br>
Set window modes attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-bg colour <br>
Set window modes background colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-fg colour <br>
Set window modes foreground colour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-keys [vi | emacs] <br>
Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy and choice modes.
As with the status-keys option, the default is emacs, unless
VISUAL or EDITOR contains &acirc;vi&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode-mouse [on | off |
copy-mode] <br>
Mouse state in modes. If on, the mouse may be used to enter
copy mode and copy a selection by dragging, to enter copy
mode and scroll with the mouse wheel, or to <br>
select an option in choice mode. If set to copy-mode, the
mouse behaves as set to on, but cannot be used to enter copy
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor-activity [on | off] <br>
Monitor for activity in the window. Windows with activity
are highlighted in the status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor-content match-string
<br>
Monitor content in the window. When fnmatch(3) pattern
match-string appears in the window, it is highlighted in the
status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">monitor-silence [interval] <br>
Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within
interval seconds. Windows that have been silent for the
interval are highlighted in the status line. An <br>
interval of zero disables the monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other-pane-height height <br>
Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the
main-horizontal layout. If this option is set to 0 (the
default), it will have no effect. If both the <br>
main-pane-height and other-pane-height options are set, the
main pane will grow taller to make the other panes the
specified height, but will never shrink to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other-pane-width width <br>
Like other-pane-height, but set the width of other panes in
the main-vertical layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pane-base-index index <br>
Like base-index, but set the starting index for pane
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remain-on-exit [on | off] <br>
A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the
program running in it exits. The window may be reactivated
with the respawn-window command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">synchronize-panes [on | off]
<br>
Duplicate input to any pane to all other panes in the same
window (only for panes that are not in any special
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf8 [on | off] <br>
Instructs tmux to expect UTF-8 sequences to appear in this
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window-status-bell-attr

The default is &acirc;#I:#W#F&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">window-status-separator string
<br>
Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status line.
The default is a single space character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xterm-keys [on | off] <br>
If this option is set, tmux will generate xterm(1) -style
function key sequences; these have a number included to
indicate modifiers such as Shift, Alt or Ctrl. <br>
The default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrap-search [on | off] <br>
If this option is set, searches will wrap around the end of
the pane contents. The default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-options [-gqsvw] [-t
target-session | target-window] [option] <br>
(alias: show) <br>
Show the window options (or a single window option if given)
with -w (equivalent to show-window-options), the server
options with -s, otherwise the session options for <br>
target session. Global session or window options are listed
if -g is used. -v shows only the option value, not the name.
If -q is set, no error will be returned if <br>
option is unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-window-options [-gv] [-t
target-window] [option] <br>
(alias: showw) <br>
List the window options or a single option for
target-window, or the global window options if -g is used.
-v shows only the option value, not the name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORMATS <br>
Certain commands accept the -F flag with a format argument.
This is a string which controls the output format of the
command. Special character sequences are replaced as
docu&acirc; <br>
mented under the status-left option and an additional long
form is accepted. Replacement variables are enclosed in
&acirc;#{&acirc; and &acirc;}&acirc;, for example
&acirc;#{session_name}&acirc; is equivalent to <br>
&acirc;#S&acirc;. Conditionals are also accepted by
prefixing with &acirc;?&acirc; and separating two
alternatives with a comma; if the specified variable exists
and is not zero, the first alternative is <br>
chosen, otherwise the second is used. For example
&acirc;#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}&acirc;
will include the string &acirc;attached&acirc; if the
session is attached and the string &acirc;not <br>
attached&acirc; if it is unattached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMES AND TITLES <br>
tmux distinguishes between names and titles. Windows and
sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in
targets and are displayed in the status line and various
lists: <br>
the name is the tmux identifier for a window or session.
Only panes have titles. A pane&rsquo;s title is typically
set by the program running inside the pane and is not
modified by <br>
tmux. It is the same mechanism used to set for example the
xterm(1) window title in an X(7) window manager. Windows
themselves do not have titles - a window&rsquo;s title is
the title <br>
of its active pane. tmux itself may set the title of the
terminal in which the client is running, see the set-titles
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session&rsquo;s name is set
with the new-session and rename-session commands. A
window&rsquo;s name is set with one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A command argument (such as
-n for new-window or new-session).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. An escape sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33kWINDOW_NAME
33\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Automatic renaming, which
sets the name to the active command in the window&rsquo;s
active pane. See the automatic-rename option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a pane is first created,
its title is the hostname. A pane&rsquo;s title can be set
via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33]2;My Title
33\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into
the global environment; in addition, each session has a
session environment. When a window is created, the session
and <br>
global environments are merged. If a variable exists in
both, the value from the session environment is used. The
result is the initial environment passed to the new
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The update-environment session
option may be used to update the session environment from
the client when a new session is created or an old
reattached. tmux also initialises the <br>
TMUX variable with some internal information to allow
commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM variable
with the correct terminal setting of
&acirc;screen&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands to alter and view the
environment are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-environment [-gru] [-t
target-session] name [value] <br>
(alias: setenv) <br>
Set or unset an environment variable. If -g is used, the
change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is
applied to the session environment for target-session. <br>
The -u flag unsets a variable. -r indicates the variable is
to be removed from the environment before starting a new
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-environment [-g] [-t
target-session] [variable] <br>
(alias: showenv) <br>
Display the environment for target-session or the global
environment with -g. If variable is omitted, all variables
are shown. Variables removed from the environment are <br>
prefixed with &acirc;-&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS LINE <br>
tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in
the bottom line of each terminal. By default, the status
line is enabled (it may be disabled with the status session
<br>
option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the
current session in square brackets; the window list; the
title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status line is made of three
parts: configurable left and right sections (which may
contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a
shell command, see the <br>
status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and
status-right-length options below), and a central window
list. By default, the window list shows the index, name and
(if any) <br>
flag of the windows present in the current session in
ascending numerical order. It may be customised with the
window-status-format and window-status-current-format
options. The <br>
flag is one of the following symbols appended to the window
name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbol Meaning <br>
* Denotes the current window. <br>
- Marks the last window (previously selected). <br>
# Window is monitored and activity has been detected. <br>
! A bell has occurred in the window. <br>
+ Window is monitored for content and it has appeared. <br>
~ The window has been silent for the monitor-silence
interval. <br>
Z The window&rsquo;s active pane is zoomed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The # symbol relates to the
monitor-activity and + to the monitor-content window
options. The window name is printed in inverted colours if
an alert (bell, activity or content) is <br>
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colour and attributes of the
status line may be configured, the entire status line using
the status-attr, status-fg and status-bg session options and
individual windows using <br>
the window-status-attr, window-status-fg and
window-status-bg window options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status line is automatically
refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be
controlled with the status-interval session option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands related to the status
line are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command-prompt [-I inputs] [-p
prompts] [-t target-client] [template] <br>
Open the command prompt in a client. This may be used from
inside tmux to execute commands interactively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If template is specified, it is
used as the command. If present, -I is a comma-separated
list of the initial text for each prompt. If -p is given,
prompts is a comma-sep&acirc; <br>
arated list of prompts which are displayed in order;
otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from
template if it is present, or &acirc;:&acirc; if not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both inputs and prompts may
contain the special character sequences supported by the
status-left option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before the command is executed,
the first occurrence of the string &acirc;%%&acirc; and all
occurrences of &acirc;%1&acirc; are replaced by the response
to the first prompt, the second &acirc;%%&acirc; and <br>
all &acirc;%2&acirc; are replaced with the response to the
second prompt, and so on for further prompts. Up to nine
prompt responses may be replaced (&acirc;%1&acirc; to
&acirc;%9&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">confirm-before [-p prompt] [-t
target-client] command <br>
(alias: confirm) <br>
Ask for confirmation before executing command. If -p is
given, prompt is the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt
is constructed from command. It may contain the special <br>
character sequences supported by the status-left option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command works only from
inside tmux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display-message [-p] [-c
target-client] [-t target-pane] [message] <br>
(alias: display) <br>
Display a message. If -p is given, the output is printed to
stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client
status line. The format of message is described in the <br>
FORMATS section; information is taken from target-pane if -t
is given, otherwise the active pane for the session attached
to target-client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUFFERS <br>
tmux maintains a stack of paste buffers. Up to the value of
the buffer-limit option are kept; when a new buffer is
added, the buffer at the bottom of the stack is removed.
Buf&acirc; <br>
fers may be added using copy-mode or the set-buffer command,
and pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A configurable history buffer is
also maintained for each window. By default, up to 2000
lines are kept; this can be altered with the history-limit
option (see the set-option com&acirc; <br>
mand above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The buffer commands are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">choose-buffer [-F format] [-t
target-window] [template] <br>
Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be
chosen interactively from a list. After a buffer is
selected, &acirc;%%&acirc; is replaced by the buffer index
in template <br>
and the result executed as a command. If template is not
given, &quot;paste-buffer -b &rsquo;%%&rsquo;&quot; is used.
For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS section.
This command <br>
works only if at least one client is attached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear-history [-t target-pane]
<br>
(alias: clearhist) <br>
Remove and free the history for the specified pane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete-buffer [-b buffer-index]
<br>
(alias: deleteb) <br>
Delete the buffer at buffer-index, or the top buffer if not
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-buffers [-F format] <br>
(alias: lsb) <br>
List the global buffers. For the meaning of the -F flag, see
the FORMATS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load-buffer [-b buffer-index]
path <br>
(alias: loadb) <br>
Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b
buffer-index] [-s separator] [-t target-pane] <br>
(alias: pasteb) <br>
Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified
pane. If not specified, paste into the current one. With -d,
also delete the paste buffer from the stack. When <br>
output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are
replaced with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).
A custom separator may be specified using the -s <br>
flag. The -r flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to
a separator of LF). If -p is specified, paste bracket
control codes are inserted around the buffer if the <br>
application has requested bracketed paste mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save-buffer [-a] [-b
buffer-index] path <br>
(alias: saveb) <br>
Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path. The
-a option appends to rather than overwriting the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set-buffer [-b buffer-index]
data <br>
(alias: setb) <br>
Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-buffer [-b buffer-index]
<br>
(alias: showb) <br>
Display the contents of the specified buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MISCELLANEOUS <br>
Miscellaneous commands are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clock-mode [-t target-pane] <br>
Display a large clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if-shell [-b] [-t target-pane]
shell-command command [command] <br>
(alias: if) <br>
Execute the first command if shell-command returns success
or the second command otherwise. Before being executed,
shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in <br>
the FORMATS section, including those relevant to
target-pane. With -b, shell-command is run in the
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-server <br>
(alias: lock) <br>
Lock each client individually by running the command
specified by the lock-command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run-shell -b [-t target-pane]
shell-command <br>
(alias: run) <br>
Execute shell-command in the background without creating a
window. Before being executed, shell-command is expanded
using the rules specified in the FORMATS section. With <br>
-b, the command is run in the background. After it finishes,
any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane
specified by -t or the current pane if omitted). <br>
If the command doesn&rsquo;t return success, the exit status
is also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server-info <br>
(alias: info) <br>
Show server information and terminal details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wait-for -LSU channel <br>
(alias: wait) <br>
When used without options, prevents the client from exiting
until woken using wait-for -S with the same channel. When -L
is used, the channel is locked and any clients <br>
that try to lock the same channel are made to wait until the
channel is unlocked with wait-for -U. This command only
works from outside tmux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINFO EXTENSIONS <br>
tmux understands some extensions to terminfo(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cc, Cr Set the cursor colour.
The first takes a single string argument and is used to set
the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the
default cursor colour. If <br>
set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the
cursor colour from inside tmux:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33]12;red
33\&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cs, Csr <br>
Change the cursor style. If set, a sequence such as this may
be used to change the cursor to an underline:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ printf &rsquo; 33[4
q&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Csr is set, it will be used
to reset the cursor style instead of Cs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ms This sequence can be used by
tmux to store the current buffer in the host
terminal&rsquo;s selection (clipboard). See the
set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROL MODE <br>
tmux offers a textual interface called control mode. This
allows applications to communicate with tmux using a simple
text-only protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In control mode, a client sends
tmux commands or command sequences terminated by newlines on
standard input. Each command will produce one block of
output on standard output. An <br>
output block consists of a %begin line followed by the
output (which may be empty). The output block ends with a
%end or %error. %begin and matching %end or %error have two
argu&acirc; <br>
ments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch) and command
number. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%begin 1363006971 2 <br>
0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2
(active) <br>
%end 1363006971 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In control mode, tmux outputs
notifications. A notification will never occur inside an
output block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following notifications are
defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%exit [reason] <br>
The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is
not attached to any session or an error occurred. If
present, reason describes why the client exited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%layout-change window-id
window-layout <br>
The layout of a window with ID window-id changed. The new
layout is window-layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%output pane-id value <br>
A window pane produced output. value escapes non-printable
characters and backslash as octal .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%session-changed session-id name
<br>
The client is now attached to the session with ID
session-id, which is named name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%session-renamed name <br>
The current session was renamed to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%sessions-changed <br>
A session was created or destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%unlinked-window-add window-id
<br>
The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked
to the current session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%window-add window-id <br>
The window with ID window-id was linked to the current
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%window-close window-id <br>
The window with ID window-id closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%window-renamed window-id name
<br>
The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To create a new tmux session running vi(1):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new-session vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most commands have a shorter
form, known as an alias. For new-session, this is new:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux new vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the shortest
unambiguous form of a command is accepted. If there are
several options, they are listed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux n <br>
ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window,
next-window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within an active session, a new
window may be created by typing &acirc;C-b c&acirc; (Ctrl
followed by the &acirc;b&acirc; key followed by the
&acirc;c&acirc; key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows may be navigated with:
&acirc;C-b 0&acirc; (to select window 0), &acirc;C-b
1&acirc; (to select window 1), and so on; &acirc;C-b
n&acirc; to select the next window; and &acirc;C-b p&acirc;
to select the previous window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A session may be detached using
&acirc;C-b d&acirc; (or by an external event such as ssh(1)
disconnection) and reattached with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ tmux attach-session</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing &acirc;C-b ?&acirc; lists
the current key bindings in the current window; up and down
