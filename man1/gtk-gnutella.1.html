<p>GTK-GNUTELLA(1) 1.1.8 GTK-GNUTELLA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gtk-gnutella - A Gnutella client for Gtk+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gtk-gnutella</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gtk-gnutella is a GTK+ Gnutella client for Unix. It supports
both searching and sharing with the 0.6 version of the
Gnutella protocol and includes support for numerous protocol
<br>
improvements and additions that have been added to the
Gnutella network since.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Gnutella network allows
users to search for files and to advertise files shared
locally, but is not handling file transfers which is done
through HTTP. The addition of <br>
Gnutella-specific HTTP headers makes each Gnutella client a
powerful file swarmer where even firewalled hosts can
contribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Great care has been devoted into
making gtk-gnutella powerful, efficient and reliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All the options can be abbreviated as long as the supplied
name is not ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compile-info <br>
Tell gtk-gnutella to output a list of variables describing
compile-time configuration information that was gathered
when the program was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemonize <br>
This options causes gtk-gnutella to become a daemon. It
detaches from the terminal (if started from one) and forks
itself into the background. It also changes it working <br>
directory to the root directory i.e., &quot;/&quot; so that
it doesn&rsquo;t block a mount point for example. This is
mainly meant for headless mode but you can also use it if
the Gtk+ <br>
GUI is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you do not start
gtk-gnutella from a terminal but from a window manager menu,
there&rsquo;s little reason to not daemonize gtk-gnutella.
Thus you might want to <br>
add the --daemonize option in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that when
gtk-gnutella is started as a daemon all output which is
normally send to the standard output and standard error
output (usually your terminal or a <br>
common log file such as ~/.xsession-errors), is sent to
/dev/null. The options --log-stderr and --log-stdout can be
used to redirect log output in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exec-on-crash path <br>
Execute command specified in path when gtk-gnutella
crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--geometry <br>
This option can be used to force the main window of the GUI
to a certain location on your screen and/or give it certain
dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following would
position the window in the lower right corner with a width
of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gtk-gnutella --geometry
800x600-0-0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that none of this can be
guaranteed, your window manager has the last word on this.
This option is a traditional command-line switch supported
by most X11 applica&acirc; <br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--minimized <br>
Launches gtk-gnutella with a minimized main window.
Recommended when starting gtk-gnutella in the background on
login.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show a summary of all
supported options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-stderr , --log-stdout <br>
These options allow you to log everything which is written
to stderr respectively stdout to some files. A typical use
would look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gtk-gnutella --daemonize
--log-stderr ~/logs/gtkg.stderr --log-stdout
~/logs/gtkg.stdout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redirecting these log messages
also works without --daemonize. Of course, log files can
become large and you might want to archive them or delete
them periodically. After <br>
moving or deleting the log files, you can send gtk-gnutella
a SIGHUP signal to create new log files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-supervise <br>
Redirects the logs for the supervisor process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-dbus <br>
Disable notifications of gtk-gnutella events to D-BUS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-restart <br>
Prevents gtk-gnutella from auto-restarting itself when
crashing on a platform where core dumps are not possible or
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-supervise <br>
Prevents gtk-gnutella from starting a supervising process
that will monitor the main process and automatically restart
a new instance when the previous one exits abnor&acirc; <br>
mally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-xshm <br>
Disable MIT shared memory extension, when running with the X
graphical user-interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pause-on-crash <br>
Pause the process on crash, so that a debugger may be
attached to inspect the current state for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping This option allows you to
check whether gtk-gnutella is currently running. This option
returns with a success code when gtk-gnutella is already
running, and with a failure <br>
code when it is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows you to use the
following code to start gtk-gnutella from a cron job or
window manager menu and avoid starting it twice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gtk-gnutella --ping ||
gtk-gnutella</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restart-on-crash <br>
Asks gtk-gnutella to auto-restart itself after crashing on a
platform where core dumps are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of core dumping
options, --no-restart will always prevent a restart whilst
--restart-on-crash will always request one if possible. It
is not allowed to supply <br>
both options at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell <br>
When this option is used to connect to an already running
gtk-gnutella process over a local unix domain socket. This
socket is located at
&quot;$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/ipc/socket&quot;, <br>
thus normally &quot;~/.gtk-gnutella/ipc/socket&quot;. The
socket is only accessible by the user running gtk-gnutella
which is enforced by filesystem permissions. The socket is
in a <br>
dedicated directory because apparently not all systems honor
the access permissions on sockets as seen through the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can disable this feature by
setting the property &quot;enable_local_socket&quot; to
FALSE. It is recommendable to use this local socket whenever
possible instead of the TCP <br>
socket to access the shell interface remotely. The reason is
that the authentication token is passed non-encrypted over
the network and everyone who can sniff the network <br>
is able to connect to the remote shell. This may not matter
over the loopback interface or a LAN, but it&rsquo;s a bad
idea to use this over the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the user-agent string used on the Gnutella network
which also holds the version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--topless <br>
Starts gtk-gnutella without the graphical
user-interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
When gtk-gnutella is first started, it will attempt to
connect to a well-known hosts server for some hosts to
connect to. If you know a host you want to connect to, you
can enter <br>
it in the box on the GnutellaNet tab and push the Add
button. When first connecting to the gnutella network, it
can take some time to establish a stable connection. Be
patient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCHING <br>
To search files just type your query in the search box at
the top of the screen. All searches, both active and
inactive, are shown in the sidebar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can have multiple searches
running at once. To start another search while the first one
is running, simply enter another search term into the edit
box at the top of the win&acirc; <br>
dow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To stop a particular search and
remove its tab from the search window, select the search by
clicking on its tab and click the &quot;Close search&quot;
button. If you want to clear the list <br>
for a particular search, but want to continue to see new
files that are received for this search, click the
&quot;Clear results&quot; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to apply
filtering to search results using the filter editor. Click
on &quot;Edit filters&quot; to access the editor. Use of the
filtering editor goes beyond the scope of <br>
this man page, but there is a tutorial on this topic on the
gtk-gnutella homepage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you find a file that you
want to download, select the file in the list and click
&quot;Download selected&quot;. This file will be placed in
the download queue. On the downloads view <br>
you can watch the download progress of the file(s) you are
downloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to select a
bunch of files for downloading at once. By holding down the
control or shift keys while clicking files, you can select
several files and then <br>
click &quot;Download selected&quot; to put them all in the
download queue at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Most of the configuration can be done via the
&quot;Preferences&quot; window that can be accesed using the
&quot;File -&gt; Preferences&quot; menu-option. You will
find several tabs there, each tab <br>
regrouping common information. But some specific information
pertaining to downloads or searches are directly available
on the &quot;Downloads&quot; and &quot;Uploads&quot;
panes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you linger your mouse over
each configuration parameter, a tooltip window will popup
explaining the meaning of that parameter. You may have to
press &quot;Enter&quot; after a text <br>
input, or move the focus to another parameter to validate
your entry. Items configured via spin buttons normally take
effect immediately, unless you type text instead of using
<br>
the spin buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/config_gnet <br>
Per-user configuration file, for core settings. This can be
edited when the program is not running, but it is best to
use the GUI to change configuration variables. <br>
gtk-gnutella saves this file every time the program is
exited normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/config_gui
<br>
GUI configuration. It is best to not edit this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/dmesh <br>
This is where the download mesh is persisted. You
don&rsquo;t need to worry about this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/dmesh_ban <br>
This is where temporarily banned download mesh entries are
stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/done.namesize
<br>
This file holds the name and size of files completely
downloaded by gtk-gnutella and which will now be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/done.sha1 <br>
This file holds the SHA1 of files completely downloaded by
gtk-gnutella and which will now be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/downloads <br>
This is where the download queue is persisted. Only the
direct downloads (i.e. non-pushed) can be saved, since they
don&rsquo;t need routing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/hosts <br>
This is the host cache. This is saved by gtk-gnutella on
exit and should not be edited by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/searches.xml
<br>
This is where the open searches and all the search filters
are saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/sha1_cache
<br>
This is where the cache of all the computed SHA1 is
stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/tth_cache <br>
This is the directory under which all the computed TTH trees
are stored. These files are binary data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/upload_stats
<br>
This file keeps track of the upload statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
gtk-gnutella searches GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR for configuration
files. If this variable is not set, HOME is used instead. If
HOME is not set, then no configuration information will be
<br>
saved when gtk-gnutella exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILING LISTS <br>
There are a couple of mailing lists for gtk-gnutella. See
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=4467 for more
info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
gtk-gnutella is production-quality software, but still has
minor bugs and incomplete or missing features. But which
software doesn&rsquo;t for its authors?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are probably other missing
features that should be listed here.</p>
