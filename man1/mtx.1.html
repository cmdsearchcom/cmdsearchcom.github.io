<p>MTX(1) General Commands Manual MTX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mtx - control SCSI media changer devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mtx [-f &lt;scsi-generic-device&gt;] [nobarcode] [invert]
[noattach] command [ command ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mtx command controls single or multi-drive SCSI media
changers such as tape changers, autoloaders, tape libraries,
or optical media jukeboxes. It can also be used with media
<br>
changers that use the &rsquo;ATTACHED&rsquo; API, presuming
that they properly report the MChanger bit as required by
the SCSI T-10 SMC specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The first argument, given following -f , is the SCSI generic
device corresponding to your media changer. Consult your
operating system&rsquo;s documentation for more information
(for <br>
example, under Linux these are generally /dev/sg0 through
/dev/sg15, under FreeBSD these are /dev/pass0 through
/dev/passX, under SunOS it may be a file under
/dev/rdsk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;invert&rsquo; option
will invert (flip) the media (for optical jukeboxes that
allow such) before inserting it into the drive or returning
it to the storage slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;noattach&rsquo;
option forces the regular media changer API even if the
media changer incorrectly reported that it uses the
&rsquo;ATTACHED&rsquo; API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;nobarcode&rsquo;
option forces the loader to not request barcodes even if the
loader is capable of reporting them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following these options there
may follow one or more robotics control commands. Note that
the &rsquo;invert&rsquo; and &rsquo;noattach&rsquo; options
apply to ALL of robotics control commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
--version Report the mtx version number (e.g. mtx 1.2.8) and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inquiry Report the product type
(Medium Changer, Tape Drive, etc.), Vendor ID, Product ID,
Revision, and whether this uses the Attached Changer API
(some tape drives use this <br>
rather than reporting a Medium Changer on a separate LUN or
SCSI address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noattach Make further commands
use the regular media changer API rather than the _ATTACHED
API, no matter what the &quot;Attached&quot; bit said in the
Inquiry info. Needed with some <br>
brain-dead changers that report Attached bit but don&rsquo;t
respond to _ATTACHED API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inventory Makes the robot arm go
and check what elements are in the slots. This is needed for
a few libraries like the Breece Hill ones that do not
automatically check the tape <br>
inventory at system startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Reports how many drives
and storage elements are contained in the device. For each
drive, reports whether it has media loaded in it, and if so,
from which storage slot <br>
the media originated. For each storage slot, reports whether
it is empty or full, and if the media changer has a bar
code, MIC reader, or some other way of uniquely <br>
identifying media without loading it into a drive, this
reports the volume tag and/or alternate volume tag for each
piece of media. For historical reasons drives are <br>
numbered from 0 and storage slots are numbered from 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load &lt;slotnum&gt; [
&lt;drivenum&gt; ] <br>
Load media from slot &lt;slotnum&gt; into drive
&lt;drivenum&gt;. Drive 0 is assumed if the drive number is
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unload [&lt;slotnum&gt;] [
&lt;drivenum&gt; ] <br>
Unloads media from drive &lt;drivenum&gt; into slot
&lt;slotnum&gt;. If &lt;drivenum&gt; is omitted, defaults to
drive 0 (as do all commands). If &lt;slotnum&gt; is omitted,
defaults to the <br>
slot that the drive was loaded from. Note that there&rsquo;s
currently no way to say &rsquo;unload drive 1&rsquo;s media
to the slot it came from&rsquo;, other than to explicitly
use that slot <br>
number as the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[eepos &lt;operation&gt;]
transfer &lt;slotnum&gt; &lt;slotnum&gt; <br>
Transfers media from one slot to another, assuming that your
mechanism is capable of doing so. Usually used to move media
to/from an import/export port. &rsquo;eepos&rsquo; is used
<br>
to extend/retract the import/export tray on certain
mid-range to high end tape libraries (if, e.g., the tray was
slot 32, you might say say &rsquo;eepos 1 transfer 32
32&rsquo; to <br>
extend the tray). Valid values for eepos &lt;operation&gt;
are 0 (do nothing to the import/export tray), 1, and 2 (what
1 and 2 do varies depending upon the library, consult <br>
your library&rsquo;s SCSI-level documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[eepos &lt;operation&gt;]
[invert] [invert2] exchange &lt;slotnum&gt; &lt;slotnum&gt;
[&lt;slotnum&gt;] <br>
Move medium from the first slot to the second slot, placing
the medium currently in the second slot either back into the
first slot or into the optional third slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first [&lt;drivenum&gt;] <br>
Loads drive &lt;drivenum&gt; from the first slot in the
media changer. Unloads the drive if there is already media
in it (note: you may need to eject the tape using your
OS&rsquo;s <br>
tape control commands first). Note that this command may not
be what you want on large tape libraries -- e.g. on Exabyte
220, the first slot is usually a cleaning <br>
tape. If &lt;drivenum&gt; is omitted, defaults to first
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last [&lt;drivenum&gt;] <br>
Loads drive &lt;drivenum&gt; from the last slot in the media
changer. Unloads the drive if there is already a tape in it.
(Note: you may need to eject the tape using your <br>
OS&rsquo;s tape control commands first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">previous [&lt;drivenum&gt;] <br>
Unloads the drive and loads the previous tape in sequence.
If the drive was empty, loads the first tape into the
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next [&lt;drivenum&gt;] <br>
Unloads the drive and loads the next tape in sequence. If
the drive was empty, loads the first tape into the
drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">position &lt;slotnum&gt; <br>
Positions the robot at a specific slot. Needed by some
changers to move to and open the import/export, or mailbox,
slot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eject Eject the tape currently
in the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
The original &rsquo;mtx&rsquo; program was written by
Leonard Zubkoff and extensively revised for large
multi-drive libraries with bar code readers by Eric Lee
Green &lt;eric@badtux.org&gt;. See <br>
&rsquo;mtx.c&rsquo; for other contributors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
You may need to do a &rsquo;mt offline&rsquo; on the tape
drive to eject the tape before you can issue the &rsquo;mtx
unload&rsquo; command. The Exabyte EZ-17 and 220 in
particular will happily sit <br>
there snapping the robot arm&rsquo;s claws around thin air
trying to grab a tape that&rsquo;s not there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some Linux distributions,
you may need to re-compile the kernel to scan SCSI
LUN&rsquo;s in order to detect the media changer. Check
/proc/scsi/scsi to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you try to unload a tape to
its &rsquo;source&rsquo; slot, and said slot is full, it
will instead put the tape into the first empty slot.
Unfortunately the list of empty slots is not <br>
updated between commands on the command line, so if you try
to unload another drive to a full &rsquo;source&rsquo; slot
during the same invocation of &rsquo;mtx&rsquo;, it will try
to unload to the same <br>
(no longer empty) slot and will urp with a SCSI error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program reads the Mode
Sense Element Address Assignment Page (SCSI) and requests
data on all available elements. For larger libraries (more
than a couple dozen elements) <br>
this sets a big Allocation_Size in the SCSI command block
for the REQUEST_ELEMENT_STATUS command in order to be able
to read the entire result of a big tape library. Some
operat&acirc; <br>
ing systems may not be able to handle this. Versions of
Linux earlier than 2.2.6, in particular, may fail this
request due to inability to find contiguous pages of memory
for the <br>
SCSI transfer (later versions of Linux &rsquo;sg&rsquo;
device do scatter-gather so that this should no longer be a
problem).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The eepos command remains in
effect for all further commands on a command line. Thus you
might want to follow eepos 1 transfer 32 32 with eepos 0 as
the next command (which <br>
clears the eepos bits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Need a better name for
&rsquo;eepos&rsquo; command! (&rsquo;eepos&rsquo; is the
name of the bit field in the actual low-level SCSI command,
and has nothing to do with what it does).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program has only been
tested on Linux with a limited number of tape loaders (a
dual-drive Exabyte 220 tape library, with bar-code reader
and 21 slots, an Exabyte EZ-17 <br>
7-slot autoloader, and a Seagate DDS-4 autochanger with 6
slots). It may not work on other operating systems with
larger libraries, due to the big SCSI request size. Please
see <br>
the projecdt page http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx for
information on reporting bugs, requesting features and the
mailing list for peer support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS <br>
Under Linux, cat /proc/scsi/scsi will tell you what SCSI
devices you have. You can then refer to them as /dev/sga,
/dev/sgb, etc. by the order they are reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under FreeBSD, camcontrol
devlist will tell you what SCSI devices you have, along with
which pass device controls them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under Solaris, set up your
&rsquo;sgen&rsquo; driver so that it&rsquo;ll look for tape
changers (see /kernel/drv/sgen.conf and the sgen man page),
type touch /reconfigure then reboot. You can find <br>
your changer in /devices by typing /usr/sbin/devfsadm -C to
clean out no-longer-extant entries in your /devices
directory, then find /devices -name &acirc;changer -print to
find the <br>
device name. Set the symbolic link /dev/changer to point to
that device name (if it is not doing so already).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With BRU, set your mount and
unmount commands as described on the BRU web site at
http://www.bru.com to move to the next tape when backing up
or restoring. With GNU tar, see <br>
mtx.doc for an example of how to use tar and mtx to make
multi-tape backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
This version of mtx is currently being maintained by Robert
Nelson &lt;robertnelson@users.sourceforge.net&gt; . The
&rsquo;mtx&rsquo; home page is http://mtx.sourceforge.net
and the actual code <br>
is currently available there and via SVN from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx.</p>
