<p>catdoc(1) General Commands Manual catdoc(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
catdoc - reads MS-Word file and puts its content as plain
text on standard output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
catdoc [-vlu8btawxV] [-m number] [ -s charset] [ -d charset]
[ -f output-format] file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
catdoc behaves much like cat(1) but it reads MS-Word file
and produces human-readable text on standard output.
Optionally it can use latex(1) escape sequences for
characters <br>
which have special meaning for LaTeX. It also makes some
effort to recognize MS-Word tables, although it never tries
to write correct headers for LaTeX tabular environment. <br>
Additional output formats, such is HTML can be easily
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catdoc doesn&rsquo;t attempt to
extract formatting information other than tables from
MS-Word document, so different output modes means mainly
that different characters should be <br>
escaped and different ways used to represent characters,
missing from output charset. See CHARACTER SUBSTITUTION
below</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catdoc uses internal unicode(4)
representation of text, so it is able to convert texts when
charset in source document doesn&rsquo;t match charset on
target system. See CHARACTER SETS <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file names supplied,
catdoc processes its standard input unless it is terminal.
It is unlikely that somebody could type Word document from
keyboard, so if catdoc invoked <br>
without arguments and stdin is not redirected, it prints
brief usage message and exits. Processing of standard input
(even among other files) can be forced using dash
&rsquo;-&rsquo; as <br>
file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, catdoc wraps lines
which are more than 72 chars long and separates paragraphs
by blank lines. This behavior can be turned of by -w switch.
In wide mode catdoc prints <br>
each paragraph as one long line, suitable for import into
word processors that perform word wrapping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a - shortcut for -f ascii. Produces ASCII text as output.
Separates table columns with TAB</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b - process broken MS-Word
file. Normally, catdoc checks if first 8 bytes of file is
Microsoft OLE signature. If so, it processes file, otherwise
it just copies it to <br>
stdin. It is intended to use catdoc as filter for viewing
all files with .doc extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dcharset <br>
- specifies destination charset name. Charset file has
format described in CHARACTER SETS below and should have
.txt extension and reside in catdoc library directory ( <br>
${prefix}/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/catdoc). By default, current
locale charset is used if langinfo support compiled in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fformat <br>
- specifies output format as described in CHARACTER
SUBSTITUTION below. catdoc comes with two output formats -
ascii and tex. You can add your own if you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Causes catdoc to list names
of available charsets to the stdout and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnumber <br>
Specifies right margin for text (default 72). -m 0 is
equivalent to -w</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scharset <br>
Specifies source charset. (one used in Word document), if
Word document doesn&rsquo;t contain UTF-16 text. When
reading rtf documents, it is typically not necessary,
because <br>
rtf documents contain ansicpg specification. But it can be
set wrong by Word (I&rsquo;ve seen RTF documents on Russian,
where cp1252 was specified). In this case this option <br>
would take precedence over charset, specified in the
document. But source_charset statement in the configuration
file have less priority than charset in the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t - shortcut for -f tex <br>
converts all printable chars, which have special meaning for
LaTeX(1) into appropriate control sequences. Separates table
columns by &amp;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u - declares that Word document
contain UNICODE (UTF-16) representation of text (as some
Word-97 documents). If catdoc fails to correct Word document
with default <br>
charset, try this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8 - declares is Word document
is 8 bit. Just in case that catdoc <br>
recognizes file format incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w disables word wrapping. By
default catdoc output is split into lines not longer than 72
(or number, specified by -m option) characters and
paragraphs are separated by <br>
blank line. With this option each paragraph is one long
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x causes catdoc to output
unknown UNICODE character as NN, instead of question
marks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v causes catdoc to print some
useless information about word document structure to stdout
before actual start of text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V outputs catdoc version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHARACTER SETS <br>
When processing MS-Word file catdoc uses information about
two character sets, typically different <br>
- input and output. They are stored in plain text files in
catdoc library directory. Character set files should contain
two whitespace-separated hexadecimal numbers - 8-bit <br>
code in character set and 16-bit Unicode code. Anything from
hash mark to end of line is ignored, as well as blank
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catdoc distribution includes
some of these character sets. Additional character set
definitions, directly usable by catdoc can be obtained from
ftp.unicode.org. Charset files <br>
have .txt suffix, which shouldn&rsquo;t be specified in
command-line or configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that catdoc is distributed
with Cyrillic charsets as default. If you are not Russian,
you probably don&rsquo;t want it, an should reconfigure
catdoc at compile time or in runtime <br>
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dealing with documents with
charsets other than default, remember that Microsoft never
uses ISO charsets. While letters in, say cp1252 are at the
same position as in <br>
ISO-8859-1, some punctuation signs would be lost, if you
specify ISO-8859-1 as input charset. If you use cp1252,
catdoc would deal with those signs as described in CHARACTER
SUB&acirc; <br>
STITUTION below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHARACTER SUBSTITUTION <br>
catdoc converts MS-Word file into following internal Unicode
representation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Paragraphs are separated by
ASCII Line Feed symbol (0x000A)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Table cells within row are
separated by ASCII Field Separator symbol <br>
(0x001C)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Table rows are separated by
ASCII Record Separator (0x001E)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. All printable characters,
including whitespace are represented with their <br>
respective UNICODE codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This UNICODE representation is
subsequently converted into 8-bit text in target character
set using following four-step algorithm:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. List of special characters is
searched for given Unicode character. <br>
If found, then appropriate multi-character sequence is
output instead of character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If there is an equivalent in
target character set, it is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Otherwise, replacement list
is searched and, if there is multi-character <br>
substitution for this UNICODE char, it is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If all above fails,
&quot;Unknown char&quot; symbol (question mark) is
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists of special characters and
list of substitution are character set-independent, because
special chars should be escaped regardless of their
existence in target character set <br>
(usually, they are parts of US-ASCII, and therefore exist in
any character set) and replacement list is searched only for
those characters, which are not found in target
charac&acirc; <br>
ter set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These lists are stored in catdoc
library directory in files with prefix of format name. These
files have following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line can be either comment
(starting with hash mark) or contain hexadecimal UNICODE
value, separated by whitespace from string, which would be
substituted instead of it. If <br>
string contain no whitespace it can be used as is, otherwise
it should be enclosed in single or double quotes. Usual
backslash sequences like &rsquo;0,&rsquo;&rsquo; can be used
in these <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME CONFIGURATION <br>
Upon startup catdoc reads its system-wide configuration file
( catdocrc in catdoc library directory) and then
user-specific configuration file ${HOME}/.catdocrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These files can contain
following directives:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_charset = charset-name
<br>
Sets default source charset, which would be used if no -s
option specified. Consult configuration of nearby windows
workstation to find one you need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_charset = charset-name
<br>
Sets default output charset. You probably know, which one
you use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charset_path = directory-list
<br>
colon-separated list of directories, which are searched for
charset files. This allows you to install additional
charsets in your home directory. If first directory <br>
component of path is ~ it is replaced by contents of HOME
environment variable. On MS-DOS platform, if directory name
starts with %s, it is replaced with directory of <br>
executable file. Empty element in list (i.e. two consequitve
colons) is considered current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">map_path = directory-list <br>
colon-separated list of directories, which are searched for
special character map and replacement map. Same substitution
rules as in charset_path are applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format = format name <br>
Output format which would be used by default. catdoc comes
with two formats - ascii and tex but nothing prevents you
from writing your own format (set two map files - <br>
special character map and replacement map).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknown_char = character
specification <br>
sets character to output instead of unknown Unicode
character (default &rsquo;?&rsquo;) Character specification
can have one of two form - character enclosed in single
quotes or <br>
hexadecimal code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_locale =(yes|no) <br>
Enables or disables automatic selection of output charset
(default yes), <br>
based on system locale settings (if enabled at compile
time). If automatic detection is enabled, than output
charset settings in the configuration files (but not in the
<br>
command line) are ignored, and current system locale charset
is used instead. There are no automatic choice of input
charset, based of locale language, because most mod&acirc;
<br>
ern Word files (since Word 97) are Unicode anyway</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Doesn&rsquo;t handle fast-saves properly. Prints footnotes
as separate paragraphs at the end of file, instead of
producing correct LaTeX commands. Cannot distinguish between
empty ta&acirc; <br>
ble cell and end of table row.</p>
