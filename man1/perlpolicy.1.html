perlpolicy - Various and sundry policies and commitments related to the Perl
  core
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document is the master document which records all written policies about
  how the Perl 5 Porters collectively develop and maintain the Perl core.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GOVERNANCE"><a class="selflink" href="#GOVERNANCE">GOVERNANCE</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Perl_5_Porters"><a class="selflink" href="#Perl_5_Porters">Perl
  5 Porters</a></h2>
Subscribers to perl5-porters (the porters themselves) come in several flavours.
  Some are quiet curious lurkers, who rarely pitch in and instead watch the
  ongoing development to ensure they're forewarned of new changes or features in
  Perl. Some are representatives of vendors, who are there to make sure that
  Perl continues to compile and work on their platforms. Some patch any reported
  bug that they know how to fix, some are actively patching their pet area
  (threads, Win32, the regexp -engine), while others seem to do nothing but
  complain. In other words, it's your usual mix of technical people.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Over this group of porters presides Larry Wall. He has the final word in what
  does and does not change in any of the Perl programming languages. These days,
  Larry spends most of his time on Perl 6, while Perl 5 is shepherded by a
  &quot;pumpking&quot;, a porter responsible for deciding what goes into each
  release and ensuring that releases happen on a regular basis.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Larry sees Perl development along the lines of the US government: there's the
  Legislature (the porters), the Executive branch (the -pumpking), and the
  Supreme Court (Larry). The legislature can discuss and submit patches to the
  executive branch all they like, but the executive branch is free to veto them.
  Rarely, the Supreme Court will side with the executive branch over the
  legislature, or the legislature over the executive branch. Mostly, however,
  the legislature and the executive branch are supposed to get along and work
  out their differences without impeachment or court cases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might sometimes see reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2. Larry's power as Supreme
  Court is expressed in The Rules:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should
      behave. This means he has final veto power on the core functionality.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a
      later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong. It's rare to see either
  Rule exercised, but they are often alluded to.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MAINTENANCE_AND_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#MAINTENANCE_AND_SUPPORT">MAINTENANCE
  AND SUPPORT</a></h1>
Perl 5 is developed by a community, not a corporate entity. Every change
  contributed to the Perl core is the result of a donation. Typically, these
  donations are contributions of code or time by individual members of our
  community. On occasion, these donations come in the form of corporate or
  organizational sponsorship of a particular individual or project.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a volunteer organization, the commitments we make are heavily dependent on
  the goodwill and hard work of individuals who have no obligation to contribute
  to Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
That being said, we value Perl's stability and security and have long had an
  unwritten covenant with the broader Perl community to support and maintain
  releases of Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This document codifies the support and maintenance commitments that the Perl
  community should expect from Perl's developers:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">We &quot;officially&quot; support the two most recent
      stable release series. 5.12.x and earlier are now out of support. As of
      the release of 5.18.0, we will &quot;officially&quot; end support for Perl
      5.14.x, other than providing security updates as described below.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To the best of our ability, we will attempt to fix critical
      issues in the two most recent stable 5.x release series. Fixes for the
      current release series take precedence over fixes for the previous release
      series.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To the best of our ability, we will provide
      &quot;critical&quot; security patches / releases for any major version of
      Perl whose 5.x.0 release was within the past three years. We can only
      commit to providing these for the most recent .y release in any 5.x.y
      series.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">As a vendor, you may have a requirement to backport
      security fixes beyond our 3 year support commitment. We can provide
      limited support and advice to you as you do so and, where possible will
      try to apply those patches to the relevant -maint branches in git, though
      we may or may not choose to make numbered releases or &quot;official&quot;
      patches available. Contact us at &lt;perl5-security-report@perl.org&gt; to
      begin that process.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_AND_DEPRECATION"><a class="selflink" href="#BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_AND_DEPRECATION">BACKWARD
  COMPATIBILITY AND DEPRECATION</a></h1>
Our community has a long-held belief that backward-compatibility is a virtue,
  even when the functionality in question is a design flaw.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We would all love to unmake some mistakes we've made over the past decades.
  Living with every design error we've ever made can lead to painful stagnation.
  Unwinding our mistakes is very, very difficult. Doing so without actively
  harming our users is nearly impossible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lately, ignoring or actively opposing compatibility with earlier versions of
  Perl has come into vogue. Sometimes, a change is proposed which wants to usurp
  syntax which previously had another meaning. Sometimes, a change wants to
  improve previously-crazy semantics.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Down this road lies madness.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Requiring end-user programmers to change just a few language constructs, even
  language constructs which no well-educated developer would ever intentionally
  use is tantamount to saying &quot;you should not upgrade to a new release of
  Perl unless you have 100% test coverage and can do a full manual audit of your
  codebase.&quot; If we were to have tools capable of reliably upgrading Perl
  source code from one version of Perl to another, this concern could be
  significantly mitigated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We want to ensure that Perl continues to grow and flourish in the coming years
  and decades, but not at the expense of our user community.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Existing syntax and semantics should only be marked for destruction in very
  limited circumstances. If a given language feature's continued inclusion in
  the language will cause significant harm to the language or prevent us from
  making needed changes to the runtime, then it may be considered for
  deprecation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any language change which breaks backward-compatibility should be able to be
  enabled or disabled lexically. Unless code at a given scope declares that it
  wants the new behavior, that new behavior should be disabled. Which
  backward-incompatible changes are controlled implicitly by a 'use v5.x.y' is a
  decision which should be made by the pumpking in consultation with the
  community.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a backward-incompatible change can't be toggled lexically, the decision to
  change the language must be considered very, very carefully. If it's possible
  to move the old syntax or semantics out of the core language and into XS-land,
  that XS module should be enabled by default unless the user declares that they
  want a newer revision of Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Historically, we've held ourselves to a far higher standard than
  backward-compatibility -- bugward-compatibility. Any accident of
  implementation or unintentional side-effect of running some bit of code has
  been considered to be a feature of the language to be defended with the same
  zeal as any other feature or functionality. No matter how frustrating these
  unintentional features may be to us as we continue to improve Perl, these
  unintentional features often deserve our protection. It is very important that
  existing software written in Perl continue to work correctly. If end-user
  developers have adopted a bug as a feature, we need to treat it as such.
<div class="Pp"></div>
New syntax and semantics which don't break existing language constructs and
  syntax have a much lower bar. They merely need to prove themselves to be
  useful, elegant, well designed, and well tested.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Terminology"><a class="selflink" href="#Terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
To make sure we're talking about the same thing when we discuss the removal of
  features or functionality from the Perl core, we have specific definitions for
  a few words and phrases.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">experimental</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If something in the Perl core is marked as
      <b>experimental</b>, we may change its behaviour, deprecate or remove it
      without notice. While we'll always do our best to smooth the transition
      path for users of experimental features, you should contact the
      perl5-porters mailinglist if you find an experimental feature useful and
      want to help shape its future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">deprecated</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If something in the Perl core is marked as
      <b>deprecated</b>, we may remove it from the core in the next stable
      release series, though we may not. As of Perl 5.12, deprecated features
      and modules warn the user as they're used. If you use a deprecated feature
      and believe that its removal from the Perl core would be a mistake, please
      contact the perl5-porters mailinglist and plead your case. We don't
      deprecate things without a good reason, but sometimes there's a
      counterargument we haven't considered. Historically, we did not
      distinguish between &quot;deprecated&quot; and &quot;discouraged&quot;
      features.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">discouraged</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">From time to time, we may mark language constructs and
      features which we consider to have been mistakes as <b>discouraged</b>.
      Discouraged features aren't candidates for removal in the next major
      release series, but we may later deprecate them if they're found to stand
      in the way of a significant improvement to the Perl core.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">removed</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Once a feature, construct or module has been marked as

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Getting_changes_into_a_maint_branch"><a class="selflink" href="#Getting_changes_into_a_maint_branch">Getting
  changes into a maint branch</a></h2>
Historically, only the pumpking cherry-picked changes from bleadperl into
  maintperl. This has...scaling problems. At the same time, maintenance branches
  of stable versions of Perl need to be treated with great care. To that end,
  we're going to try out a new process for maint-5.12.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any committer may cherry-pick any commit from blead to maint-5.12 if they send
  mail to perl5-porters announcing their intent to cherry-pick a specific commit
  along with a rationale for doing so and at least two other committers respond
  to the list giving their assent. (This policy applies to current and former
  pumpkings, as well as other committers.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONTRIBUTED_MODULES"><a class="selflink" href="#CONTRIBUTED_MODULES">CONTRIBUTED
  MODULES</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="A_Social_Contract_about_Artistic_Control"><a class="selflink" href="#A_Social_Contract_about_Artistic_Control">A
  Social Contract about Artistic Control</a></h2>
What follows is a statement about artistic control, defined as the ability of
  authors of packages to guide the future of their code and maintain control
  over their work. It is a recognition that authors should have control over
  their work, and that it is a responsibility of the rest of the Perl community
  to ensure that they retain this control. It is an attempt to document the
  standards to which we, as Perl developers, intend to hold ourselves. It is an
  attempt to write down rough guidelines about the respect we owe each other as
  Perl developers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This statement is not a legal contract. This statement is not a legal document
  in any way, shape, or form. Perl is distributed under the GNU Public License
  and under the Artistic License; those are the precise legal terms. This
  statement isn't about the law or licenses. It's about community, mutual
  respect, trust, and good-faith cooperation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We recognize that the Perl core, defined as the software distributed with the
  heart of Perl itself, is a joint project on the part of all of us. From time
  to time, a script, module, or set of modules (hereafter referred to simply as
  a &quot;module&quot;) will prove so widely useful and/or so integral to the
  correct functioning of Perl itself that it should be distributed with the Perl
  core. This should never be done without the author's explicit consent, and a
  clear recognition on all parts that this means the module is being distributed
  under the same terms as Perl itself. A module author should realize that
  inclusion of a module into the Perl core will necessarily mean some loss of
  control over it, since changes may occasionally have to be made on short
  notice or for consistency with the rest of Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a module has been included in the Perl core, however, everyone involved in
  maintaining Perl should be aware that the module is still the property of the
  original author unless the original author explicitly gives up their ownership
  of it. In particular:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The version of the module in the Perl core should still be
      considered the work of the original author. All patches, bug reports, and
      so forth should be fed back to them. Their development directions should
      be respected whenever possible.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Patches may be applied by the pumpkin holder without the
      explicit cooperation of the module author if and only if they are very
      minor, time-critical in some fashion (such as urgent security fixes), or
      if the module author cannot be reached. Those patches must still be given
      back to the author when possible, and if the author decides on an
      alternate fix in their version, that fix should be strongly preferred
      unless there is a serious problem with it. Any changes not endorsed by the
      author should be marked as such, and the contributor of the change
      acknowledged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The version of the module distributed with Perl should,
      whenever possible, be the latest version of the module as distributed by
      the author (the latest non-beta version in the case of public Perl
      releases), although the pumpkin holder may hold off on upgrading the
      version of the module distributed with Perl to the latest version until
      the latest version has had sufficient testing.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In other words, the author of a module should be considered to have final say on
  modifications to their module whenever possible (bearing in mind that it's
  expected that everyone involved will work together and arrive at reasonable
  compromises when there are disagreements).
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a last resort, however:
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the author's vision of the future of their module is sufficiently different
  from the vision of the pumpkin holder and perl5-porters as a whole so as to
  cause serious problems for Perl, the pumpkin holder may choose to formally
  fork the version of the module in the Perl core from the one maintained by the
  author. This should not be done lightly and should <b>always</b> if at all
  possible be done only after direct input from Larry. If this is done, it must
  then be made explicit in the module as distributed with the Perl core that it
  is a forked version and that while it is based on the original author's work,
  it is no longer maintained by them. This must be noted in both the
  documentation and in the comments in the source of the module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Again, this should be a last resort only. Ideally, this should never happen, and
  every possible effort at cooperation and compromise should be made before
  doing this. If it does prove necessary to fork a module for the overall health
  of Perl, proper credit must be given to the original author in perpetuity and
  the decision should be constantly re-evaluated to see if a remerging of the
  two branches is possible down the road.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In all dealings with contributed modules, everyone maintaining Perl should keep
  in mind that the code belongs to the original author, that they may not be on
  perl5-porters at any given time, and that a patch is not official unless it
  has been integrated into the author's copy of the module. To aid with this,
  and with points #1, #2, and #3 above, contact information for the authors of
  all contributed modules should be kept with the Perl distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the Perl community as a whole recognizes that respect for ownership of
  code, respect for artistic control, proper credit, and active effort to
  prevent unintentional code skew or communication gaps is vital to the health
  of the community and Perl itself. Members of a community should not normally
  have to resort to rules and laws to deal with each other, and this document,
  although it contains rules so as to be clear, is about an attitude and general
  approach. The first step in any dispute should be open communication, respect
  for opposing views, and an attempt at a compromise. In nearly every
  circumstance nothing more will be necessary, and certainly no more drastic
  measure should be used until every avenue of communication and discussion has
  failed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DOCUMENTATION"><a class="selflink" href="#DOCUMENTATION">DOCUMENTATION</a></h1>
Perl's documentation is an important resource for our users. It's incredibly
  important for Perl's documentation to be reasonably coherent and to accurately
  reflect the current implementation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Just as P5P collectively maintains the codebase, we collectively maintain the
  documentation. Writing a particular bit of documentation doesn't give an
  author control of the future of that documentation. At the same time, just as
  source code changes should match the style of their surrounding blocks, so
  should documentation changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples in documentation should be illustrative of the concept they're
  explaining. Sometimes, the best way to show how a language feature works is
  with a small program the reader can run without modification. More often,
  examples will consist of a snippet of code containing only the
  &quot;important&quot; bits. The definition of &quot;important&quot; varies
  from snippet to snippet. Sometimes it's important to declare &quot;use
  strict&quot; and &quot;use warnings&quot;, initialize all variables and fully
  catch every error condition. More often than not, though, those things obscure
  the lesson the example was intended to teach.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As Perl is developed by a global team of volunteers, our documentation often
  contains spellings which look funny to <i>somebody</i>. Choice of
  American/British/Other spellings is left as an exercise for the author of each
  bit of documentation. When patching documentation, try to emulate the
  documentation around you, rather than changing the existing prose.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, documentation should describe what Perl does &quot;now&quot; rather
  than what it used to do. It's perfectly reasonable to include notes in
  documentation about how behaviour has changed from previous releases, but,
  with very few exceptions, documentation isn't &quot;dual-life&quot; -- it
  doesn't need to fully describe how all old versions used to work.
