<p>PERLPOLICY(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLPOLICY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlpolicy - Various and sundry policies and commitments
related to the Perl core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document is the master document which records all
written policies about how the Perl 5 Porters collectively
develop and maintain the Perl core.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GOVERNANCE <br>
Perl 5 Porters <br>
Subscribers to perl5-porters (the porters themselves) come
in several flavours. Some are quiet curious lurkers, who
rarely pitch in and instead watch the ongoing development to
<br>
ensure they&rsquo;re forewarned of new changes or features
in Perl. Some are representatives of vendors, who are there
to make sure that Perl continues to compile and work on
their <br>
platforms. Some patch any reported bug that they know how to
fix, some are actively patching their pet area (threads,
Win32, the regexp -engine), while others seem to do nothing
<br>
but complain. In other words, it&rsquo;s your usual mix of
technical people.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Over this group of porters
presides Larry Wall. He has the final word in what does and
does not change in any of the Perl programming languages.
These days, Larry spends most <br>
of his time on Perl 6, while Perl 5 is shepherded by a
&quot;pumpking&quot;, a porter responsible for deciding what
goes into each release and ensuring that releases happen on
a regular <br>
basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Larry sees Perl development
along the lines of the US government: there&rsquo;s the
Legislature (the porters), the Executive branch (the
-pumpking), and the Supreme Court (Larry). The <br>
legislature can discuss and submit patches to the executive
branch all they like, but the executive branch is free to
veto them. Rarely, the Supreme Court will side with the <br>
executive branch over the legislature, or the legislature
over the executive branch. Mostly, however, the legislature
and the executive branch are supposed to get along and work
<br>
out their differences without impeachment or court
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might sometimes see
reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2. Larry&rsquo;s power as
Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Larry is always by definition
right about how Perl should behave. This means he has final
veto power on the core functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Larry is allowed to change
his mind about any matter at a later date, regardless of
whether he previously invoked Rule 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Got that? Larry is always right,
even when he was wrong. It&rsquo;s rare to see either Rule
exercised, but they are often alluded to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT <br>
Perl 5 is developed by a community, not a corporate entity.
Every change contributed to the Perl core is the result of a
donation. Typically, these donations are contributions of
<br>
code or time by individual members of our community. On
occasion, these donations come in the form of corporate or
organizational sponsorship of a particular individual or
<br>
project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a volunteer organization, the
commitments we make are heavily dependent on the goodwill
and hard work of individuals who have no obligation to
contribute to Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That being said, we value
Perl&rsquo;s stability and security and have long had an
unwritten covenant with the broader Perl community to
support and maintain releases of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document codifies the
support and maintenance commitments that the Perl community
should expect from Perl&rsquo;s developers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We
&quot;officially&quot; support the two most recent stable
release series. 5.12.x and earlier are now out of support.
As of the release of 5.18.0, we will &quot;officially&quot;
end support <br>
for Perl 5.14.x, other than providing security updates as
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To the best of
our ability, we will attempt to fix critical issues in the
two most recent stable 5.x release series. Fixes for the
current release series take precedence <br>
over fixes for the previous release series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To the best of
our ability, we will provide &quot;critical&quot; security
patches / releases for any major version of Perl whose 5.x.0
release was within the past three years. We can <br>
only commit to providing these for the most recent .y
release in any 5.x.y series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We will not
provide security updates or bug fixes for development
releases of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We encourage
vendors to ship the most recent supported release of Perl at
the time of their code freeze.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As a vendor, you
may have a requirement to backport security fixes beyond our
3 year support commitment. We can provide limited support
and advice to you as you do so and, <br>
where possible will try to apply those patches to the
relevant -maint branches in git, though we may or may not
choose to make numbered releases or &quot;official&quot;
patches <br>
available. Contact us at
&lt;perl5-security-report@perl.org&gt; to begin that
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY AND
DEPRECATION <br>
Our community has a long-held belief that
backward-compatibility is a virtue, even when the
functionality in question is a design flaw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We would all love to unmake some
mistakes we&rsquo;ve made over the past decades. Living with
every design error we&rsquo;ve ever made can lead to painful
stagnation. Unwinding our <br>
mistakes is very, very difficult. Doing so without actively
harming our users is nearly impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lately, ignoring or actively
opposing compatibility with earlier versions of Perl has
come into vogue. Sometimes, a change is proposed which wants
to usurp syntax which <br>
previously had another meaning. Sometimes, a change wants to
improve previously-crazy semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Down this road lies madness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requiring end-user programmers
to change just a few language constructs, even language
constructs which no well-educated developer would ever
intentionally use is tantamount to <br>
saying &quot;you should not upgrade to a new release of Perl
unless you have 100% test coverage and can do a full manual
audit of your codebase.&quot; If we were to have tools
capable of <br>
reliably upgrading Perl source code from one version of Perl
to another, this concern could be significantly
mitigated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We want to ensure that Perl
continues to grow and flourish in the coming years and
decades, but not at the expense of our user community.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Existing syntax and semantics
should only be marked for destruction in very limited
circumstances. If a given language feature&rsquo;s continued
inclusion in the language will cause <br>
significant harm to the language or prevent us from making
needed changes to the runtime, then it may be considered for
deprecation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any language change which breaks
backward-compatibility should be able to be enabled or
disabled lexically. Unless code at a given scope declares
that it wants the new behavior, <br>
that new behavior should be disabled. Which
backward-incompatible changes are controlled implicitly by a
&rsquo;use v5.x.y&rsquo; is a decision which should be made
by the pumpking in <br>
consultation with the community.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a backward-incompatible
change can&rsquo;t be toggled lexically, the decision to
change the language must be considered very, very carefully.
If it&rsquo;s possible to move the old <br>
syntax or semantics out of the core language and into
XS-land, that XS module should be enabled by default unless
the user declares that they want a newer revision of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, we&rsquo;ve held
ourselves to a far higher standard than
backward-compatibility -- bugward-compatibility. Any
accident of implementation or unintentional side-effect of
<br>
running some bit of code has been considered to be a feature
of the language to be defended with the same zeal as any
other feature or functionality. No matter how frustrating
<br>
these unintentional features may be to us as we continue to
improve Perl, these unintentional features often deserve our
protection. It is very important that existing software <br>
written in Perl continue to work correctly. If end-user
developers have adopted a bug as a feature, we need to treat
it as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New syntax and semantics which
don&rsquo;t break existing language constructs and syntax
have a much lower bar. They merely need to prove themselves
to be useful, elegant, well <br>
designed, and well tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminology <br>
To make sure we&rsquo;re talking about the same thing when
we discuss the removal of features or functionality from the
Perl core, we have specific definitions for a few words and
<br>
phrases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">experimental <br>
If something in the Perl core is marked as experimental, we
may change its behaviour, deprecate or remove it without
notice. While we&rsquo;ll always do our best to smooth the
<br>
transition path for users of experimental features, you
should contact the perl5-porters mailinglist if you find an
experimental feature useful and want to help shape its <br>
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deprecated <br>
If something in the Perl core is marked as deprecated, we
may remove it from the core in the next stable release
series, though we may not. As of Perl 5.12, deprecated <br>
features and modules warn the user as they&rsquo;re used. If
you use a deprecated feature and believe that its removal
from the Perl core would be a mistake, please contact the
<br>
perl5-porters mailinglist and plead your case. We
don&rsquo;t deprecate things without a good reason, but
sometimes there&rsquo;s a counterargument we haven&rsquo;t
considered. Historically, <br>
we did not distinguish between &quot;deprecated&quot; and
&quot;discouraged&quot; features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discouraged <br>
From time to time, we may mark language constructs and
features which we consider to have been mistakes as
discouraged. Discouraged features aren&rsquo;t candidates
for removal in <br>
the next major release series, but we may later deprecate
them if they&rsquo;re found to stand in the way of a
significant improvement to the Perl core.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removed <br>
Once a feature, construct or module has been marked as
deprecated for a stable release cycle, we may remove it from
the Perl core. Unsurprisingly, we say we&rsquo;ve removed
these <br>
things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAINTENANCE BRANCHES <br>
&Acirc;&middot; New releases of maint should contain as few
changes as possible. If there is any question about whether
a given patch might merit inclusion in a maint release, then
it <br>
almost certainly should not be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Portability
fixes, such as changes to Configure and the files in hints/
are acceptable. Ports of Perl to a new platform,
architecture or OS release that involve changes to <br>
the implementation are NOT acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Acceptable
documentation updates are those that correct factual errors,
explain significant bugs or deficiencies in the current
implementation, or fix broken markup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches that add
new warnings or errors or deprecate features are not
acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches that fix
crashing bugs that do not otherwise change Perl&rsquo;s
functionality or negatively impact performance are
acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches that fix
CVEs or security issues are acceptable, but should be run
through the perl5-security-report@perl.org mailing list
rather than applied directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches that fix
regressions in perl&rsquo;s behavior relative to previous
releases are acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Updates to
dual-life modules should consist of minimal patches to fix
crashing or security issues (as above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Minimal patches
that fix platform-specific test failures or installation
issues are acceptable. When these changes are made to
dual-life modules for which CPAN is canonical, <br>
any changes should be coordinated with the upstream
author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New versions of
dual-life modules should NOT be imported into maint. Those
belong in the next stable series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches that add
or remove features are not acceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches that
break binary compatibility are not acceptable. (Please talk
to a pumpking.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Getting changes into a maint
branch <br>
Historically, only the pumpking cherry-picked changes from
bleadperl into maintperl. This has...scaling problems. At
the same time, maintenance branches of stable versions of
<br>
Perl need to be treated with great care. To that end,
we&rsquo;re going to try out a new process for
maint-5.12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any committer may cherry-pick
any commit from blead to maint-5.12 if they send mail to
perl5-porters announcing their intent to cherry-pick a
specific commit along with a <br>
rationale for doing so and at least two other committers
respond to the list giving their assent. (This policy
applies to current and former pumpkings, as well as other
<br>
committers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTRIBUTED MODULES <br>
A Social Contract about Artistic Control <br>
What follows is a statement about artistic control, defined
as the ability of authors of packages to guide the future of
their code and maintain control over their work. It is a
<br>
recognition that authors should have control over their
work, and that it is a responsibility of the rest of the
Perl community to ensure that they retain this control. It
is an <br>
attempt to document the standards to which we, as Perl
developers, intend to hold ourselves. It is an attempt to
write down rough guidelines about the respect we owe each
other <br>
as Perl developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This statement is not a legal
contract. This statement is not a legal document in any way,
shape, or form. Perl is distributed under the GNU Public
License and under the <br>
Artistic License; those are the precise legal terms. This
statement isn&rsquo;t about the law or licenses. It&rsquo;s
about community, mutual respect, trust, and good-faith
cooperation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We recognize that the Perl core,
defined as the software distributed with the heart of Perl
itself, is a joint project on the part of all of us. From
time to time, a script, <br>
module, or set of modules (hereafter referred to simply as a
&quot;module&quot;) will prove so widely useful and/or so
integral to the correct functioning of Perl itself that it
should be <br>
distributed with the Perl core. This should never be done
without the author&rsquo;s explicit consent, and a clear
recognition on all parts that this means the module is being
<br>
distributed under the same terms as Perl itself. A module
author should realize that inclusion of a module into the
Perl core will necessarily mean some loss of control over
it, <br>
since changes may occasionally have to be made on short
notice or for consistency with the rest of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a module has been included
in the Perl core, however, everyone involved in maintaining
Perl should be aware that the module is still the property
of the original author <br>
unless the original author explicitly gives up their
ownership of it. In particular:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The version of
the module in the Perl core should still be considered the
work of the original author. All patches, bug reports, and
so forth should be fed back to them. <br>
Their development directions should be respected whenever
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patches may be
applied by the pumpkin holder without the explicit
cooperation of the module author if and only if they are
very minor, time-critical in some fashion (such as <br>
urgent security fixes), or if the module author cannot be
reached. Those patches must still be given back to the
author when possible, and if the author decides on an <br>
alternate fix in their version, that fix should be strongly
preferred unless there is a serious problem with it. Any
changes not endorsed by the author should be marked as <br>
such, and the contributor of the change acknowledged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The version of
the module distributed with Perl should, whenever possible,
be the latest version of the module as distributed by the
author (the latest non-beta version in <br>
the case of public Perl releases), although the pumpkin
holder may hold off on upgrading the version of the module
distributed with Perl to the latest version until the <br>
latest version has had sufficient testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, the author of a
module should be considered to have final say on
modifications to their module whenever possible (bearing in
mind that it&rsquo;s expected that everyone <br>
involved will work together and arrive at reasonable
compromises when there are disagreements).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a last resort, however:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the author&rsquo;s vision of
the future of their module is sufficiently different from
the vision of the pumpkin holder and perl5-porters as a
whole so as to cause serious problems <br>
for Perl, the pumpkin holder may choose to formally fork the
version of the module in the Perl core from the one
maintained by the author. This should not be done lightly
and <br>
should always if at all possible be done only after direct
input from Larry. If this is done, it must then be made
explicit in the module as distributed with the Perl core
that <br>
it is a forked version and that while it is based on the
original author&rsquo;s work, it is no longer maintained by
them. This must be noted in both the documentation and in
the <br>
comments in the source of the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Again, this should be a last
resort only. Ideally, this should never happen, and every
possible effort at cooperation and compromise should be made
before doing this. If it <br>
does prove necessary to fork a module for the overall health
of Perl, proper credit must be given to the original author
in perpetuity and the decision should be constantly re- <br>
evaluated to see if a remerging of the two branches is
possible down the road.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all dealings with contributed
modules, everyone maintaining Perl should keep in mind that
the code belongs to the original author, that they may not
be on perl5-porters at any <br>
given time, and that a patch is not official unless it has
been integrated into the author&rsquo;s copy of the module.
To aid with this, and with points #1, #2, and #3 above,
contact <br>
information for the authors of all contributed modules
should be kept with the Perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the Perl community as a
whole recognizes that respect for ownership of code, respect
for artistic control, proper credit, and active effort to
prevent unintentional code <br>
skew or communication gaps is vital to the health of the
community and Perl itself. Members of a community should not
normally have to resort to rules and laws to deal with each
<br>
other, and this document, although it contains rules so as
to be clear, is about an attitude and general approach. The
first step in any dispute should be open communication, <br>
respect for opposing views, and an attempt at a compromise.
In nearly every circumstance nothing more will be necessary,
and certainly no more drastic measure should be used <br>
until every avenue of communication and discussion has
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOCUMENTATION <br>
Perl&rsquo;s documentation is an important resource for our
users. It&rsquo;s incredibly important for Perl&rsquo;s
documentation to be reasonably coherent and to accurately
reflect the current <br>
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Just as P5P collectively
maintains the codebase, we collectively maintain the
documentation. Writing a particular bit of documentation
doesn&rsquo;t give an author control of the <br>
future of that documentation. At the same time, just as
source code changes should match the style of their
surrounding blocks, so should documentation changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples in documentation should
be illustrative of the concept they&rsquo;re explaining.
Sometimes, the best way to show how a language feature works
is with a small program the <br>
reader can run without modification. More often, examples
will consist of a snippet of code containing only the
&quot;important&quot; bits. The definition of
&quot;important&quot; varies from <br>
snippet to snippet. Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to
declare &quot;use strict&quot; and &quot;use warnings&quot;,
initialize all variables and fully catch every error
condition. More often than not, <br>
though, those things obscure the lesson the example was
intended to teach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As Perl is developed by a global
team of volunteers, our documentation often contains
spellings which look funny to somebody. Choice of
American/British/Other spellings is left <br>
as an exercise for the author of each bit of documentation.
When patching documentation, try to emulate the
documentation around you, rather than changing the existing
prose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, documentation should
describe what Perl does &quot;now&quot; rather than what it
used to do. It&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to include notes
in documentation about how behaviour <br>
has changed from previous releases, but, with very few
exceptions, documentation isn&rsquo;t &quot;dual-life&quot;
-- it doesn&rsquo;t need to fully describe how all old
versions used to work.</p>
