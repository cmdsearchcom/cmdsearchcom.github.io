<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep has been almost
entirely rewritten in this new incarnation. Here is the
short list of new architectural changes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.1. New high performance and
high quality image handling engine has been developed to
fulfill GUI needs. It includes different image
transformations, such as scaling, <br>
tiling, cropping, blurring, blending of arbitrary number of
layers, in-memory image compression, support for 12
different file formats, including its own parser/writer of
<br>
XPM files, capable of achieving much better performance then
default libXpm. Supported image formats are :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XPM, PNG, JPEG, XCF(GIMP image
format), PPM, PNM, BMP, ICO, CUR, GIF, TIFF, and XML
scripts. Where XML scripts allow for user to create script
of transformations to be <br>
performed on the image at the time when it gets
loaded./para&gt; libAfterImage also provides support for TTF
fonts ( using libfreetype ) and smoothed standard X raster
fonts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.2. Window hints handling has
been rewritten and reorganized, and most of the Extended WM
specs has been incorporated, as well, as better support for
Motif, ICCCM and old <br>
GNOME hints has been implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.3. All the GUI rendering code
has been aggregated into libAfterStep and now all the GUI
elements are rendered using consistent approach in every
module and every part of <br>
the AfterStep proper. From now on interface is build from so
called TBars. TBar is rectangular area that may be
focused(hilited) or unfocused and pressed or unpressed. <br>
Each TBar has the following structure :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the background of the TBar,
which is defined by MyStyle and state of the bar - there are
two MyStyles assigned to each TBar - one for focused and one
for unfocused <br>
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- tiles of the TBar. Tiles are
smaller features that gets arranged inside the bar according
to its size, alignment, position and order. Tiles could be
static icons ( can&acirc; <br>
not be pressed ); blocks of buttons - each having two shapes
- pressed and normal; Text labels; Empty space tiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There could be up to 256 tiles,
each residing on one of the cells in 16x16 grid. Several
tiles could reside in single cell, in which case they get
superimposed on top of <br>
each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- bevel of the TBar. When TBar
is rendered all of its tiles are superimposed on top of its
background, and resulting image will have a 3D bevel drawn
on it, using colors <br>
from same MyStyle as used for background. Bevel could be
switched off partially or entirely. Respective configuration
options has been added where appropriate. When TBar <br>
is pressed - its bevel is inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When TBar is rendered all of its
elements gets superimposed on top of each other using one of
13 blending methods supported by libAfterImage, with default
being simple <br>
alphablending. See MyFrame configuration for more details.
This is refrred to as &quot;Composition Method&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.4. Due to the fact that
AfterStep is using compression to store images in memory -
there is no need to have separate root background handler,
and so asetroot has been <br>
discontinued and afterstep proper now does all the root
background loading. You could simply copy-and-paste your
asteroot config into your look file. This has an added <br>
advantage of simplifing theme support for root
backgrounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.5. Significant work has been
done to create libAfterConf which provides easy means for
reading configuration options, and facilitates
implementation of any configuration <br>
tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.6. Some work has been done to
improve support for themes. AfterStep proper and modules now
load configuration files is this order :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#1 - base config; #2 - look,
feel, menu, database, autoexec and module specific config;
#3 - theme file; #4 - theme override file;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Theme override file is needed so
that user may have a list of critical options that he/she
does not want to be changed by any theme. What is missing
here is a comprehen&acirc; <br>
sive theme building tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.7. AfterStep now make
extensive use of X shaped extensions ( where available )
Everything could be shaped now - titlebars, Pager, Wharf,
etc. To make some element shaped <br>
- MyStyle with BackPixmap type 125 or 126 should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.8. Menus are now treated same
as regular windows. They could be configured in database
file using preset Style &quot;ASMenu&quot; to have different
titlebar buttons, frame decora&acirc; <br>
tions, stickiness, etc. MenuPinOn has been changed to be
just another titlebar button, with PinMenu function assigned
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.9. AfterStep no longer uses
fixed scheme of 5 titlebar buttons on each side, and order
of buttons could be configured in look. There is still
limitation to have no more <br>
then 10 buttons total.</p>
