<p>PCRE2GREP(1) General Commands Manual PCRE2GREP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pcre2grep - a grep with Perl-compatible regular
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pcre2grep [options] [long options] [pattern] [path1 path2
...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcre2grep searches files for
character patterns, in the same way as other grep commands
do, but it uses the PCRE2 regular expression library to
support patterns that are compati&acirc; <br>
ble with the regular expressions of Perl 5. See
pcre2syntax(3) for a quick-reference summary of pattern
syntax, or pcre2pattern(3) for a full description of the
syntax and seman&acirc; <br>
tics of the regular expressions that PCRE2 supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patterns, whether supplied on
the command line or in a separate file, are given without
delimiters. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcre2grep Thursday /etc/motd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you attempt to use delimiters
(for example, by surrounding a pattern with slashes, as is
common in Perl scripts), they are interpreted as part of the
pattern. Quotes can of <br>
course be used to delimit patterns on the command line
because they are interpreted by the shell, and indeed quotes
are required if a pattern contains white space or shell <br>
metacharacters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first argument that follows
any option settings is treated as the single pattern to be
matched when neither -e nor -f is present. Conversely, when
one or both of these <br>
options are used to specify patterns, all arguments are
treated as path names. At least one of -e, -f, or an
argument pattern must be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no files are specified,
pcre2grep reads the standard input. The standard input can
also be referenced by a name consisting of a single hyphen.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcre2grep some-pattern file1 -
file3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input files are searched line by
line. By default, each line that matches a pattern is copied
to the standard output, and if there is more than one file,
the file name is output <br>
at the start of each line, followed by a colon. However,
there are options that can change how pcre2grep behaves. In
particular, the -M option makes it possible to search for
<br>
strings that span line boundaries. What defines a line
boundary is controlled by the -N (--newline) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of memory used for
buffering files that are being scanned is controlled by
parameters that can be set by the --buffer-size and
--max-buffer-size options. The first of <br>
these sets the size of buffer that is obtained at the start
of processing. If an input file contains very long lines, a
larger buffer may be needed; this is handled by
automati&acirc; <br>
cally extending the buffer, up to the limit specified by
--max-buffer-size. The default values for these parameters
are specified when pcre2grep is built, with the default <br>
defaults being 20K and 1M respectively. An error occurs if a
line is too long and the buffer can no longer be
expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The block of memory that is
actually used is three times the &quot;buffer size&quot;, to
allow for buffering &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;
lines. If the buffer size is too small, fewer than <br>
requested &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; lines may
be output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patterns can be no longer than
8K or BUFSIZ bytes, whichever is the greater. BUFSIZ is
defined in &lt;stdio.h&gt;. When there is more than one
pattern (specified by the use of -e <br>
and/or -f), each pattern is applied to each line in the
order in which they are defined, except that all the -e
patterns are tried before the -f patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, as soon as one
pattern matches a line, no further patterns are considered.
However, if --colour (or --color) is used to colour the
matching substrings, or if --only- <br>
matching, --file-offsets, or --line-offsets is used to
output only the part of the line that matched (either shown
literally, or as an offset), scanning resumes immediately
fol&acirc; <br>
lowing the match, so that further matches on the same line
can be found. If there are multiple patterns, they are all
tried on the remainder of the line, but patterns that follow
<br>
the one that matched are not tried on the earlier part of
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This behaviour means that the
order in which multiple patterns are specified can affect
the output when one of the above options is used. This is no
longer the same behaviour as <br>
GNU grep, which now manages to display earlier matches for
later patterns (as long as there is no overlap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patterns that can match an empty
string are accepted, but empty string matches are never
recognized. An example is the pattern
&quot;(super)?(man)?&quot;, in which all components are <br>
optional. This pattern finds all occurrences of both
&quot;super&quot; and &quot;man&quot;; the output differs
from matching with &quot;super|man&quot; when only the
matching substrings are being shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE
environment variable is set, pcre2grep uses the value to set
a locale when calling the PCRE2 library. The --locale option
can be used to override this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to compile
pcre2grep so that it uses libz or libbz2 to read files whose
names end in .gz or .bz2, respectively. You can find out
whether your binary has support <br>
for one or both of these file types by running it with the
--help option. If the appropriate support is not present,
files are treated as plain text. The standard input is
always <br>
so treated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINARY FILES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, a file that contains
a binary zero byte within the first 1024 bytes is identified
as a binary file, and is processed specially. (GNU grep also
identifies binary files <br>
in this manner.) See the --binary-files option for a means
of changing the way binary files are handled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order in which some of the
options appear can affect the output. For example, both the
-h and -l options affect the printing of file names.
Whichever comes later in the com&acirc; <br>
mand line will be the one that takes effect. Similarly,
except where noted below, if an option is given twice, the
later setting is used. Numerical values for options may be
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by K or M, to signify multiplication by 1024 or
1024*1024 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- This terminates the list of
options. It is useful if the next item on the command line
starts with a hyphen but is not an option. This allows for
the processing of pat&acirc; <br>
terns and file names that start with hyphens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A number,
--after-context=number <br>
Output up to number lines of context after each matching
line. Fewer lines are output if the next match or the end of
the file is reached, or if the processing buffer <br>
size has been set too small. If file names and/or line
numbers are being output, a hyphen separator is used instead
of a colon for the context lines. A line containing <br>
&quot;--&quot; is output between each group of lines, unless
they are in fact contiguous in the input file. The value of
number is expected to be relatively small. When -c is <br>
used, -A is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --text <br>
Treat binary files as text. This is equivalent to
--binary-files=text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B number,
--before-context=number <br>
Output up to number lines of context before each matching
line. Fewer lines are output if the previous match or the
start of the file is within number lines, or if the <br>
processing buffer size has been set too small. If file names
and/or line numbers are being output, a hyphen separator is
used instead of a colon for the context lines. <br>
A line containing &quot;--&quot; is output between each
group of lines, unless they are in fact contiguous in the
input file. The value of number is expected to be relatively
<br>
small. When -c is used, -B is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary-files=word <br>
Specify how binary files are to be processed. If the word is
&quot;binary&quot; (the default), pattern matching is
performed on binary files, but the only output is
&quot;Binary file <br>
&lt;name&gt; matches&quot; when a match succeeds. If the
word is &quot;text&quot;, which is equivalent to the -a or
--text option, binary files are processed in the same way as
any other <br>
file. In this case, when a match succeeds, the output may be
binary garbage, which can have nasty effects if sent to a
terminal. If the word is &quot;without-match&quot;, which
<br>
is equivalent to the -I option, binary files are not
processed at all; they are assumed not to be of interest and
are skipped without causing any output or affecting <br>
the return code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--buffer-size=number <br>
Set the parameter that controls how much memory is obtained
at the start of processing for buffering files that are
being scanned. See also --max-buffer-size below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C number, --context=number <br>
Output number lines of context both before and after each
matching line. This is equivalent to setting both -A and -B
to the same value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --count <br>
Do not output lines from the files that are being scanned;
instead output the number of lines that would have been
shown, either because they matched, or, if -v is set, <br>
because they failed to match. By default, this count is
exactly the same as the number of lines that would have been
output, but if the -M (multiline) option is used <br>
(without -v), there may be more suppressed lines than the
count (that is, the number of matches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no lines are selected, the
number zero is output. If several files are are being
scanned, a count is output for each of them and the -t
option can be used to cause a <br>
total to be output at the end. However, if the
--files-with-matches option is also used, only those files
whose counts are greater than zero are listed. When -c is
<br>
used, the -A, -B, and -C options are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colour, --color <br>
If this option is given without any data, it is equivalent
to &quot;--colour=auto&quot;. If data is required, it must
be given in the same shell item, separated by an equals <br>
sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--colour=value, --color=value
<br>
This option specifies under what circumstances the parts of
a line that matched a pattern should be coloured in the
output. By default, the output is not coloured. The <br>
value (which is optional, see above) may be
&quot;never&quot;, &quot;always&quot;, or &quot;auto&quot;.
In the latter case, colouring happens only if the standard
output is connected to a terminal. <br>
More resources are used when colouring is enabled, because
pcre2grep has to search for all possible matches in a line,
not just one, in order to colour them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colour that is used can be
specified by setting one of the environment variables
PCRE2GREP_COLOUR, PCRE2GREP_COLOR, PCREGREP_COLOUR, or
PCREGREP_COLOR, which are <br>
checked in that order. If none of these are set, pcre2grep
looks for GREP_COLORS or GREP_COLOR (in that order). The
value of the variable should be a string of two num&acirc;
<br>
bers, separated by a semicolon, except in the case of
GREP_COLORS, which must start with &quot;ms=&quot; or
&quot;mt=&quot; followed by two semicolon-separated colours,
terminated by the <br>
end of the string or by a colon. If GREP_COLORS does not
start with &quot;ms=&quot; or &quot;mt=&quot; it is ignored,
and GREP_COLOR is checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the string obtained from one
of the above variables contains any characters other than
semicolon or digits, the setting is ignored and the default
colour is used. <br>
The string is copied directly into the control string for
setting colour on a terminal, so it is your responsibility
to ensure that the values make sense. If no rele&acirc; <br>
vant environment variable is set, the default is
&quot;1;31&quot;, which gives red.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D action, --devices=action <br>
If an input path is not a regular file or a directory,
&quot;action&quot; specifies how it is to be processed.
Valid values are &quot;read&quot; (the default) or
&quot;skip&quot; (silently skip the <br>
path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d action, --directories=action
<br>
If an input path is a directory, &quot;action&quot;
specifies how it is to be processed. Valid values are
&quot;read&quot; (the default in non-Windows environments,
for compatibility with <br>
GNU grep), &quot;recurse&quot; (equivalent to the -r
option), or &quot;skip&quot; (silently skip the path, the
default in Windows environments). In the &quot;read&quot;
case, directories are read as <br>
if they were ordinary files. In some operating systems the
effect of reading a directory like this is an immediate
end-of-file; in others it may provoke an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e pattern, --regex=pattern,
--regexp=pattern <br>
Specify a pattern to be matched. This option can be used
multiple times in order to specify several patterns. It can
also be used as a way of specifying a single pat&acirc; <br>
tern that starts with a hyphen. When -e is used, no argument
pattern is taken from the command line; all arguments are
treated as file names. There is no limit to the <br>
number of patterns. They are applied to each line in the
order in which they are defined until one matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -f is used with -e, the
command line patterns are matched first, followed by the
patterns from the file(s), independent of the order in which
these options are spec&acirc; <br>
ified. Note that multiple use of -e is not the same as a
single pattern with alternatives. For example, X|Y finds the
first character in a line that is X or Y, whereas <br>
if the two patterns are given separately, with X first,
pcre2grep finds X if it is present, even if it follows Y in
the line. It finds Y only if there is no X in the <br>
line. This matters only if you are using -o or --colo(u)r to
show the part(s) of the line that matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude=pattern <br>
Files (but not directories) whose names match the pattern
are skipped without being processed. This applies to all
files, whether listed on the command line, obtained <br>
from --file-list, or by scanning a directory. The pattern is
a PCRE2 regular expression, and is matched against the final
component of the file name, not the entire <br>
path. The -F, -w, and -x options do not apply to this
pattern. The option may be given any number of times in
order to specify multiple patterns. If a file name matches
<br>
both an --include and an --exclude pattern, it is excluded.
There is no short form for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-from=filename <br>
Treat each non-empty line of the file as the data for an
--exclude option. What constitutes a newline when reading
the file is the operating system&rsquo;s default. The <br>
--newline option has no effect on this option. This option
may be given more than once in order to specify a number of
files to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-dir=pattern <br>
Directories whose names match the pattern are skipped
without being processed, whatever the setting of the
--recursive option. This applies to all directories, whether
<br>
listed on the command line, obtained from --file-list, or by
scanning a parent directory. The pattern is a PCRE2 regular
expression, and is matched against the final <br>
component of the directory name, not the entire path. The
-F, -w, and -x options do not apply to this pattern. The
option may be given any number of times in order to <br>
specify more than one pattern. If a directory matches both
--include-dir and --exclude-dir, it is excluded. There is no
short form for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fixed-strings <br>
Interpret each data-matching pattern as a list of fixed
strings, separated by newlines, instead of as a regular
expression. What constitutes a newline for this purpose <br>
is controlled by the --newline option. The -w (match as a
word) and -x (match whole line) options can be used with -F.
They apply to each of the fixed strings. A line <br>
is selected if any of the fixed strings are found in it
(subject to -w or -x, if present). This option applies only
to the patterns that are matched against the con&acirc; <br>
tents of files; it does not apply to patterns specified by
any of the --include or --exclude options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename, --file=filename
<br>
Read patterns from the file, one per line, and match them
against each line of input. What constitutes a newline when
reading the file is the operating system&rsquo;s <br>
default. The --newline option has no effect on this option.
Trailing white space is removed from each line, and blank
lines are ignored. An empty file contains no pat&acirc; <br>
terns and therefore matches nothing. See also the comments
about multiple patterns versus a single pattern with
alternatives in the description of -e above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is given more
than once, all the specified files are read. A data line is
output if any of the patterns match it. A file name can be
given as &quot;-&quot; to <br>
refer to the standard input. When -f is used, patterns
specified on the command line using -e may also be present;
they are tested before the file&rsquo;s patterns. However,
<br>
no other pattern is taken from the command line; all
arguments are treated as the names of paths to be
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file-list=filename <br>
Read a list of files and/or directories that are to be
scanned from the given file, one per line. Trailing white
space is removed from each line, and blank lines are <br>
ignored. These paths are processed before any that are
listed on the command line. The file name can be given as
&quot;-&quot; to refer to the standard input. If --file and
<br>
--file-list are both specified as &quot;-&quot;, patterns
are read first. This is useful only when the standard input
is a terminal, from which further lines (the list of files)
<br>
can be read after an end-of-file indication. If this option
is given more than once, all the specified files are
read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file-offsets <br>
Instead of showing lines or parts of lines that match, show
each match as an offset from the start of the file and a
length, separated by a comma. In this mode, no con&acirc;
<br>
text is shown. That is, the -A, -B, and -C options are
ignored. If there is more than one match in a line, each of
them is shown separately. This option is mutually <br>
exclusive with --line-offsets and --only-matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --with-filename <br>
Force the inclusion of the file name at the start of output
lines when searching a single file. By default, the file
name is not shown in this case. For matching <br>
lines, the file name is followed by a colon; for context
lines, a hyphen separator is used. If a line number is also
being output, it follows the file name. When the -M <br>
option causes a pattern to match more than one line, only
the first is preceded by the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --no-filename <br>
Suppress the output file names when searching multiple
files. By default, file names are shown when multiple files
are searched. For matching lines, the file name is <br>
followed by a colon; for context lines, a hyphen separator
is used. If a line number is also being output, it follows
the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Output a help message,
giving brief details of the command options and file type
support, and then exit. Anything else on the command line is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Ignore binary files. This is
equivalent to --binary-files=without-match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore upper/lower case distinctions during comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include=pattern <br>
If any --include patterns are specified, the only files that
are processed are those that match one of the patterns (and
do not match an --exclude pattern). This option <br>
does not affect directories, but it applies to all files,
whether listed on the command line, obtained from
--file-list, or by scanning a directory. The pattern is a
<br>
PCRE2 regular expression, and is matched against the final
component of the file name, not the entire path. The -F, -w,
and -x options do not apply to this pattern. The <br>
option may be given any number of times. If a file name
matches both an --include and an --exclude pattern, it is
excluded. There is no short form for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-from=filename <br>
Treat each non-empty line of the file as the data for an
--include option. What constitutes a newline for this
purpose is the operating system&rsquo;s default. The
--newline <br>
option has no effect on this option. This option may be
given any number of times; all the files are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-dir=pattern <br>
If any --include-dir patterns are specified, the only
directories that are processed are those that match one of
the patterns (and do not match an --exclude-dir pat&acirc;
<br>
tern). This applies to all directories, whether listed on
the command line, obtained from --file-list, or by scanning
a parent directory. The pattern is a PCRE2 regular <br>
expression, and is matched against the final component of
the directory name, not the entire path. The -F, -w, and -x
options do not apply to this pattern. The option <br>
may be given any number of times. If a directory matches
both --include-dir and --exclude-dir, it is excluded. There
is no short form for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --files-without-match <br>
Instead of outputting lines from the files, just output the
names of the files that do not contain any lines that would
have been output. Each file name is output once, <br>
on a separate line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --files-with-matches <br>
Instead of outputting lines from the files, just output the
names of the files containing lines that would have been
output. Each file name is output once, on a sepa&acirc; <br>
rate line. Searching normally stops as soon as a matching
line is found in a file. However, if the -c (count) option
is also used, matching continues in order to obtain <br>
the correct count, and those files that have at least one
match are listed along with their counts. Using this option
with -c is a way of suppressing the listing of <br>
files with no matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--label=name <br>
This option supplies a name to be used for the standard
input when file names are being output. If not supplied,
&quot;(standard input)&quot; is used. There is no short form
for <br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-buffered <br>
When this option is given, input is read and processed line
by line, and the output is flushed after each write. By
default, input is read in large chunks, unless <br>
pcre2grep can determine that it is reading from a terminal
(which is currently possible only in Unix-like
environments). Output to terminal is normally automatically
<br>
flushed by the operating system. This option can be useful
when the input or output is attached to a pipe and you do
not want pcre2grep to buffer up large amounts of <br>
data. However, its use will affect performance, and the -M
(multiline) option ceases to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-offsets <br>
Instead of showing lines or parts of lines that match, show
each match as a line number, the offset from the start of
the line, and a length. The line number is termi&acirc; <br>
nated by a colon (as usual; see the -n option), and the
offset and length are separated by a comma. In this mode, no
context is shown. That is, the -A, -B, and -C <br>
options are ignored. If there is more than one match in a
line, each of them is shown separately. This option is
mutually exclusive with --file-offsets and --only- <br>
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--locale=locale-name <br>
This option specifies a locale to be used for pattern
matching. It overrides the value in the LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE
environment variables. If no locale is specified, the <br>
PCRE2 library&rsquo;s default (usually the &quot;C&quot;
locale) is used. There is no short form for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--match-limit=number <br>
Processing some regular expression patterns can require a
very large amount of memory, leading in some cases to a
program crash if not enough is available. Other pat&acirc;
<br>
terns may take a very long time to search for all possible
matching strings. The pcre2_match() function that is called
by pcre2grep to do the matching has two parame&acirc; <br>
ters that can limit the resources that it uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --match-limit option
provides a means of limiting resource usage when processing
patterns that are not going to match, but which have a very
large number of possi&acirc; <br>
bilities in their search trees. The classic example is a
pattern that uses nested unlimited repeats. Internally,
PCRE2 uses a function called match() which it calls <br>
repeatedly (sometimes recursively). The limit set by
--match-limit is imposed on the number of times this
function is called during a match, which has the effect of
<br>
limiting the amount of backtracking that can take place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --recursion-limit option is
similar to --match-limit, but instead of limiting the total
number of times that match() is called, it limits the depth
of recursive <br>
calls, which in turn limits the amount of memory that can be
used. The recursion depth is a smaller number than the total
number of calls, because not all calls to <br>
match() are recursive. This limit is of use only if it is
set smaller than --match-limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no short forms for
these options. The default settings are specified when the
PCRE2 library is compiled, with the default default being 10
million.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-buffer-size=number <br>
This limits the expansion of the processing buffer, whose
initial size can be set by --buffer-size. The maximum buffer
size is silently forced to be no smaller than the <br>
starting buffer size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --multiline <br>
Allow patterns to match more than one line. When this option
is set, the PCRE2 library is called in &quot;multiline&quot;
mode. This allows a matched string to extend past the <br>
end of a line and continue on one or more subsequent lines.
Patterns used with -M may usefully contain literal newline
characters and internal occurrences of ^ and $ <br>
characters. The output for a successful match may consist of
more than one line. The first line is the line in which the
match started, and the last line is the line in <br>
which the match ended. If the matched string ends with a
newline sequence, the output ends at the end of that line.
If -v is set, none of the lines in a multi-line <br>
match are output. Once a match has been handled, scanning
restarts at the beginning of the line after the one in which
the match ended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newline sequence that
separates multiple lines must be matched as part of the
pattern. For example, to find the phrase &quot;regular
expression&quot; in a file where &quot;regu&acirc; <br>
lar&quot; might be at the end of a line and
&quot;expression&quot; at the start of the next line, you
could use this command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcre2grep -M
&rsquo;regularpression&rsquo; &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The escape sequence matches any
white space character, including newlines, and is followed
by + so as to match trailing white space on the first line
as well as pos&acirc; <br>
sibly handling a two-character newline sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a limit to the number
of lines that can be matched, imposed by the way that
pcre2grep buffers the input file as it scans it. With a
sufficiently large process&acirc; <br>
ing buffer, this should not be a problem, but the -M option
does not work when input is read line by line (see
--line-buffered.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N newline-type,
--newline=newline-type <br>
The PCRE2 library supports five different conventions for
indicating the ends of lines. They are the single-character
sequences CR (carriage return) and LF (linefeed), <br>
the two-character sequence CRLF, an &quot;anycrlf&quot;
convention, which recognizes any of the preceding three
types, and an &quot;any&quot; convention, in which any
Unicode line ending <br>
sequence is assumed to end a line. The Unicode sequences are
the three just mentioned, plus VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF
(form feed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), <br>
LS (line separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator,
U+2029).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the PCRE2 library is built,
a default line-ending sequence is specified. This is
normally the standard sequence for the operating system.
Unless otherwise speci&acirc; <br>
fied by this option, pcre2grep uses the library&rsquo;s
default. The possible values for this option are CR, LF,
CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY. This makes it possible to use <br>
pcre2grep to scan files that have come from other
environments without having to modify their line endings. If
the data that is being scanned does not agree with the <br>
convention set by this option, pcre2grep may behave in
strange ways. Note that this option does not apply to files
specified by the -f, --exclude-from, or --include- <br>
from options, which are expected to use the operating
system&rsquo;s standard newline sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --line-number <br>
Precede each output line by its line number in the file,
followed by a colon for matching lines or a hyphen for
context lines. If the file name is also being output, it
<br>
precedes the line number. When the -M option causes a
pattern to match more than one line, only the first is
preceded by its line number. This option is forced if <br>
--line-offsets is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-jit If the PCRE2 library is
built with support for just-in-time compiling (which speeds
up matching), pcre2grep automatically makes use of this,
unless it was explicitly <br>
disabled at build time. This option can be used to disable
the use of JIT at run time. It is provided for testing and
working round problems. It should never be needed <br>
in normal use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --only-matching <br>
Show only the part of the line that matched a pattern
instead of the whole line. In this mode, no context is
shown. That is, the -A, -B, and -C options are ignored. If
<br>
there is more than one match in a line, each of them is
shown separately, on a separate line of output. If -o is
combined with -v (invert the sense of the match to find <br>
non-matching lines), no output is generated, but the return
code is set appropriately. If the matched portion of the
line is empty, nothing is output unless the file <br>
name or line number are being printed, in which case they
are shown on an otherwise empty line. This option is
mutually exclusive with --file-offsets and --line-off&acirc;
<br>
sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-onumber, --only-matching=number
<br>
Show only the part of the line that matched the capturing
parentheses of the given number. Up to 32 capturing
parentheses are supported, and -o0 is equivalent to -o <br>
without a number. Because these options can be given without
an argument (see above), if an argument is present, it must
be given in the same shell item, for example, <br>
-o3 or --only-matching=2. The comments given for the
non-argument case above also apply to this case. If the
specified capturing parentheses do not exist in the
pat&acirc; <br>
tern, or were not set in the match, nothing is output unless
the file name or line number are being output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is given multiple
times, multiple substrings are output for each match, in the
order the options are given, and all on one line. For
example, -o3 -o1 -o3 <br>
causes the substrings matched by capturing parentheses 3 and
1 and then 3 again to be output. By default, there is no
separator (but see the next option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--om-separator=text <br>
Specify a separating string for multiple occurrences of -o.
The default is an empty string. Separating strings are never
coloured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Work quietly, that is, display nothing except error
messages. The exit status indicates whether or not any
matches were found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recursive <br>
If any given path is a directory, recursively scan the files
it contains, taking note of any --include and --exclude
settings. By default, a directory is read as a nor&acirc;
<br>
mal file; in some operating systems this gives an immediate
end-of-file. This option is a shorthand for setting the -d
option to &quot;recurse&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recursion-limit=number <br>
See --match-limit above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --no-messages <br>
Suppress error messages about non-existent or unreadable
files. Such files are quietly skipped. However, the return
code is still 2, even if matches were found in other <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --total-count <br>
This option is useful when scanning more than one file. If
used on its own, -t suppresses all output except for a grand
total number of matching lines (or non-matching <br>
lines if -v is used) in all the files. If -t is used with
-c, a grand total is output except when the previous output
is just one line. In other words, it is not output <br>
when just one file&rsquo;s count is listed. If file names
are being output, the grand total is preceded by
&quot;TOTAL:&quot;. Otherwise, it appears as just another
number. The -t <br>
option is ignored when used with -L (list files without
matches), because the grand total would always be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --utf-8 <br>
Operate in UTF-8 mode. This option is available only if
PCRE2 has been compiled with UTF-8 support. All patterns
(including those for any --exclude and --include <br>
options) and all subject lines that are scanned must be
valid strings of UTF-8 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Write the version numbers of pcre2grep and the PCRE2 library
to the standard output and then exit. Anything else on the
command line is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --invert-match <br>
Invert the sense of the match, so that lines which do not
match any of the patterns are the ones that are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --word-regex, --word-regexp
<br>
Force the patterns to match only wholea words. This is
equivalent to having tthe start and end of the pattern. This
option applies only to the patterns that are <br>
matched against the contents of files; it does not apply to
patterns specified by any of the --include or --exclude
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --line-regex, --line-regexp
<br>
Force the patterns to be anchored (each must start matching
at the beginning of a line) and in addition, require them to
match entire lines. In multiline mode the match <br>
may be more than one line. This is equivalent to having
1characterat the start and end of each alternative top-level
branch in every pattern. This option <br>
applies only to the patterns that are matched against the
contents of files; it does not apply to patterns specified
by any of the --include or --exclude options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variables LC_ALL
and LC_CTYPE are examined, in that order, for a locale. The
first one that is set is used. This can be overridden by the
--locale option. If no <br>
locale is set, the PCRE2 library&rsquo;s default (usually
the &quot;C&quot; locale) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NEWLINES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -N (--newline) option allows
pcre2grep to scan files with different newline conventions
from the default. Any parts of the input files that are
written to the standard output <br>
are copied identically, with whatever newline sequences they
have in the input. However, the setting of this option does
not affect the interpretation of files specified by the <br>
-f, --exclude-from, or --include-from options, which are
assumed to use the operating system&rsquo;s standard newline
sequence, nor does it affect the way in which pcre2grep
writes <br>
informational messages to the standard error and output
streams. For these it uses the string &quot;0 to indicate
newlines, relying on the C I/O library to convert this to an
appro&acirc; <br>
priate sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS COMPATIBILITY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the short and long forms
of pcre2grep&rsquo;s options are the same as in the GNU grep
program. Any long option of the form --xxx-regexp (GNU
terminology) is also available as <br>
--xxx-regex (PCRE2 terminology). However, the --file-list,
--file-offsets, --include-dir, --line-offsets, --locale,
--match-limit, -M, --multiline, -N, --newline,
--om-separator, <br>
--recursion-limit, -u, and --utf-8 options are specific to
pcre2grep, as is the use of the --only-matching option with
a capturing parentheses number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although most of the common
options work the same way, a few are different in pcre2grep.
For example, the --include option&rsquo;s argument is a glob
for GNU grep, but a regular <br>
expression for pcre2grep. If both the -c and -l options are
given, GNU grep lists only file names, without counts, but
pcre2grep gives the counts as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS WITH DATA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four different ways in
which an option with data can be specified. If a short form
option is used, the data may follow immediately, or (with
one exception) in the next <br>
command line item. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f/some/file <br>
-f /some/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exception is the -o option,
which may appear with or without data. Because of this, if
data is present, it must follow immediately in the same
item, for example -o3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a long form option is used,
the data may appear in the same command line item, separated
by an equals character, or (with two exceptions) it may
appear in the next command <br>
line item. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--file=/some/file <br>
--file /some/file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, however, that if you want
to supply a file name beginning with ~ as data in a shell
command, and have the shell expand ~ to a home directory,
you must separate the file <br>
name from the option, because the shell does not treat ~
specially unless it is at the start of an item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exceptions to the above are
the --colour (or --color) and --only-matching options, for
which the data is optional. If one of these options does
have data, it must be given in <br>
the first form, using an equals character. Otherwise
pcre2grep will assume that it has no data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CALLING EXTERNAL SCRIPTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcre2grep has, by default,
support for calling external programs or scripts during
matching by making use of PCRE2&rsquo;s callout facility.
However, this support can be disabled when <br>
pcre2grep is built. You can find out whether your binary has
support for callouts by running it with the --help option.
If the support is not enabled, all callouts in patterns <br>
are ignored by pcre2grep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A callout in a PCRE2 pattern is
of the form (?C&lt;arg&gt;) where the argument is either a
number or a quoted string (see the pcre2callout
documentation for details). Numbered callouts <br>
are ignored by pcre2grep. String arguments are parsed as a
list of substrings separated by pipe (vertical bar)
characters. The first substring must be an executable name,
with <br>
the following substrings specifying arguments:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">executable_name|arg1|arg2|...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any substring (including the
executable name) may contain escape sequences started by a
dollar character: $&lt;digits&gt; or ${&lt;digits&gt;} is
replaced by the captured substring of the <br>
given decimal number, which must be greater than zero. If
the number is greater than the number of capturing
substrings, or if the capture is unset, the replacement is
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other character is
substituted by itself. In particular, $$ is replaced by a
single dollar and $| is replaced by a pipe character. Here
is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo -e &quot;abcde02345&quot; |
pcre2grep &rsquo;(?x)(.)(..(.)) <br>
(?C&quot;/bin/echo|Arg1: [$1] [$2] [$3]|Arg2: $|${1}$|
($4)&quot;)()&rsquo; -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arg1: [a] [bcd] [d] Arg2: |a| ()
<br>
abcde <br>
Arg1: [1] [234] [4] Arg2: |1| () <br>
12345</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters for the execv()
system call that is used to run the program or script are
zero-terminated strings. This means that binary zero
characters in the callout argument <br>
will cause premature termination of their substrings, and
therefore should not be present. Any syntax errors in the
string (for example, a dollar not followed by another
charac&acirc; <br>
ter) cause the callout to be ignored. If running the program
fails for any reason (including the non-existence of the
executable), a local matching failure occurs and the matcher
<br>
backtracks in the normal way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MATCHING ERRORS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to supply a
regular expression that takes a very long time to fail to
match certain lines. Such patterns normally involve nested
indefinite repeats, for example: <br>
(a+)* when matched against a line of a&rsquo;s with no final
digit. The PCRE2 matching function has a resource limit that
causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this happens,
<br>
pcre2grep outputs an error message and the line that caused
the problem to the standard error stream. If there are more
than 20 such errors, pcre2grep gives up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --match-limit option of
pcre2grep can be used to set the overall resource limit;
there is a second option called --recursion-limit that sets
a limit on the amount of memory <br>
(usually stack) that is used (see the discussion of these
options above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit status is 0 if any matches
were found, 1 if no matches were found, and 2 for syntax
errors, overlong lines, non-existent or inaccessible files
(even if matches were found in <br>
other files) or too many matching errors. Using the -s
option to suppress error messages about inaccessible files
does not affect the return code.</p>
