<p>ColorScheme(1x) AfterStep X11 window manager
ColorScheme(1x)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ColorScheme - defines color values for standard set of
internal color names, to be used in other configuration
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
Active</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color that will be used for
background of different focused elemets, such as focused
window&rsquo;s titlebar, selected menu item, etc. This color
should be contrasting with <br>
Base, Inactive1 and Inactive2 in hue, but similar in
saturation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveDark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This color should have slightly
lesser value then Active (be 5-10% darker). This is useful
when background of focused titlebar is a gradient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveLight</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This color should have slightly
higher value then Active (be 5-10% lighter). This is useful
when background of focused titlebar is a gradient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ActiveText</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color of the text on focused
titlebars. It should be in high value contrast with Active
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Angle</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines angle on the hue circle
between Inactive1, Base and Inactive2 colors in color
schemes, that are automagically calculated by AfterStep.
Default angle is 30 degrees. <br>
Use smaller angle to make Inactive and Base colors more
similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Base</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This color is defining color of
the color scheme. It will be used for desktop background.
When AfterStep is allowed to calculate color scheme
automagically - it will use <br>
this color in conjunction with the Angle value as base of
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BaseDark</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color that should be about 10%
darker then the Base color, but have similar hue and
saturation. Useful for drawing gradiented desktop
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
AfterStep color schemes are supposed to ease the pain of
assembling set of colors that go well with each other, while
providing additional flexibility while designing custom <br>
looks/themes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep Colorscheme is a
standard set of color names, that may have different color
values assigned to them. This color names are used in
defining Look and in XML images. By <br>
assigning different color values to the same color names it
is possible to instantly change colors throughout entire
Look, without altering any images or configuration
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all of the Colorscheme
colors have to be explicitly defined. Only the Base color is
important. AfterStep is capable of autogeneration of
good-looking colorscheme, from this <br>
single color. Explicit color definition in colorscheme file
will override any automatic choice. Example of this is the
NeXTish colorscheme, where all of the colors are
custom&acirc; <br>
ized. If grayscale color is chosen for Base - it will
generate grayscale colorscheme, where different shades of
gray are used for different colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected colorscheme file is
loaded by all modules and afterstep proper. Whenever new
colorscheme is selected - it triggers reloading of the Look
file and all image files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the supplied Look files
had been written to take advantage of the AfterStep
colorschemes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please read below for more
details on how colorschemes are generated and other
color-related topics :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HARMONIOUS COLORS Task of
selecting a set of matching colors is a serious matter, and
it was studied by artists and designers for centuries. AS
the result there are certain rules <br>
developed to simplify this task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly, instead of selecting
colors in Red/Green/Blue colorspace, matching colors should
be selected using Hue/Saturation/Value (HSV) colorspace.
Color hues are the most impor&acirc; <br>
tant characteristic of the color, and is measured in degrees
from 0(red hue) to 60(yellow hue) to 120(green hue) to
180(cyan hue) to 240(blue hue) to 300(purple hue) and then
to <br>
360 which is the same hue as 0 - red. Hues could be placed
on a so called color circle, making it easier to choose
matching colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two main approaches to
selecting color scheme - single hue, or several hues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single hue colors differ in its
saturation, and usually allow for a soothing, simple theme.
Such theme could be pleasant to look at, but it lacks in
excitement, and makes it dif&acirc; <br>
ficult to distinguish between different elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using several hues makes theme a
bit more exciting, and adds more visual cues to the screen,
providing for easier operation, and allowing user to relax
eye muscles, resulting in <br>
better ergonomics. Accordingly this is the approach that
should be used for user interface colors. Now how to select
hues that compose harmonious theme? The rule of the thumb is
<br>
that hues that are close to each other on color circle go
well with each other, while those, located on opposing sides
of the circle, create contrasting effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep addresses the task of
selecting harmonious colors, by generating a set of colors
from a single color using designer rules. IMAGE HUES Look of
the screen (aka Theme), <br>
includes numerous images, such as icons, backgrounds, bars,
etc. Each such image may have one or several dominating
hues, which brings us back to the task of matching hues, in
<br>
order to achieve harmonious look.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule of the thumb to follow
here is that, each image on any particular interface
element, such as titlebar, should have at least one
dominating hue to be the same as the hue <br>
of the background of this element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several way to make
sure that hue of the image matches that of the background
:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tinting <br>
If an image has single dominating hue, it could be converted
to grayscale and then tinted with the color of the
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hue rotation <br>
If an image has several hues, or a hue and some grayscale
parts - its hues could be rotated, by converting image into
HSV colorspace, changing range of hues, and then con&acirc;
<br>
verting image back into RGB colorspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">superimposition <br>
Also image hues may be altered by superimposing it over the
background image using allanon composition method, where
each pixel is substituted with the average of image&rsquo;s
<br>
pixel value and background&rsquo;s pixel value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AfterStep addresses the task of
changing hues of images using XML image scripting. See
asimagexml for more on that. COLOR NAMES AfterStep
Colorscheme color names could be <br>
separated in several categories :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Foreground and Background <br>
Foreground colors are used to render text, while background
colors make up a backdrop for that text. Now there are
several constraints on foreground colors - they should <br>
be contrasting with backgrounds, and it is always better to
constrain foreground colors to black and white, as colored
text tends to &quot;bleed&quot; ontop background, making it
<br>
less eligible. Another problem with foreground being
colorful is that it increases strain on user&rsquo;s eyes,
forcing them to adapt to too many different contrasting
colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Base, Active and Inactive <br>
General color theme of the screen is determined by
background. Accordingly we term it a Base color, and
determine the rest of the colors as relation to it. Now at
any <br>
given time there could be one element that is focused and
active, while other are off focus and should assume lower
visibility. We define Active colors to be used with <br>
focused items (should be contrasting with the Base color).
We also define Inactive colors to be used with off-focus
items (its a good idea to make them analogues to the <br>
Base color). Now as we may have 2 kinds of off-focus windows
(sticky and non-sticky ), we actually define 2 Inactive
colors: Inactive1 and Inactive2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gradient colors <br>
Gradients create very appealing look when used to color
titlebars and other interface elements. Generally its a good
idea to use colors of the same hue, but having differ&acirc;
<br>
ent intensity. To denote colors designated for gradients we
add Dark/Light postfix to color names. COLOR VALUES
AfterStep supports extremely flexible and extensive ways
<br>
to define color value. Standard approach is to use #RRGGBB
notation. In addition to that, AfterStep supports the
following notations :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#RGB Same as #RRGGBB, only using
4bit values for components. For example #F84 is the same as
#F08040.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ARGB This is the same as #RGB
plus Alpha value is added (Alpha value defines opacity of
the color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#AARRGGBB <br>
This is the same as #RRGGBB plus 8-bit Alpha value is
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hsv(hue,saturation,value) <br>
Defines color using HSV colorspace hue is measured from 0 to
360 degrees, saturation and value are measured from 0 to
100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rgb(red,green,blue) <br>
Defines color in RGB colorspace. Similar to #RRGGBB form,
but values are not in hex, but in decimals (from 0 to 255).
It also allows for nested expressions, such as : <br>
rgb(128,128,blue(Base)).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ahsv(alpha,hue,saturation,value)
<br>
Same as hsv(), but also adds Alpha channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argb(alpha,red,green,blue) <br>
Same as argb(), but also adds Alpha channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hue(hue,color) <br>
Alters hue of the given predefined color, preserving its
saturation and value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sat(saturation,color) <br>
Alters saturation of the given predefined color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">val(value,color) <br>
Alters value of the given predefined color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alpha(alpha,color) <br>
Alters alpha of the given predefined color. This is useful
to make colors from colorscheme semi-transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">red(red,color) <br>
Alters red channel value of the given predefined color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">green(green,color) <br>
Alters green channel value of the given predefined
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blue(blue,color) <br>
Alters blue channel value of the given predefined color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example : <br>
#This could be used in colorscheme definition :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inactive1 #FF5C5B66 # or
ahsv(255,245,10,40) or argb(255,92,91,102)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#This could be used in MyStyle
definition in the look. #That makes Sticky window&rsquo;s
titlebar semi-transparent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BackMultiGradient 6
alpha(50,Inactive2Dark) 0.0 alpha(50,Inactive2Light) 1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actuall usage of colors is
defined in AfterStep look file, in MyStyle definitions. Also
all ColorScheme colors could be used in AfterStep XML
images, similarly to standard <br>
X color aliases. It is also possible to use different
aspects of each color - red, green, blue and alpha, hue,
saturation and value individualy. For each color there are 6
<br>
variables defined using following sytax:
$ascs.colorname.component . For example $ascs.Active.hue
represents hue of the Active color. This is useful while
doing transfor&acirc; <br>
mations (tinting, hsv, etc ) in AfterStep XML images.</p>
