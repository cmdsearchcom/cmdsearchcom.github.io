<p>SCHISMTRACKER(1) General Commands Manual
SCHISMTRACKER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
schismtracker - tracked music editor based on Impulse
Tracker</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
schismtracker [options] [directory] [file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
schismtracker is a tracked music module editor that aims to
match the look and feel of Impulse Tracker as closely as
possible. It can load most common tracker formats, supports
<br>
saving as IT and S3M, and can also export to WAV and
AIFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --audio-driver=DRIVER[:DEVICE] <br>
Audio device configuration. driver is the SDL driver to use,
e.g. alsa (ALSA), dma or dsp (OSS); device is the name of
the device itself, for example hw:2 or /dev/dsp1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --video-driver=DRIVER <br>
SDL video driver, such as x11, dga, or fbcon. Note that this
is different from the video driver setting within the
program, and is unlikely to be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--video-yuvlayout=LAYOUT <br>
Specific YUV layout to use: YUY2, YV12, RGBA, etc. This is
probably best left alone under normal circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--video-size=WIDTHxHEIGHT <br>
Set the size of the video display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--video-stretch=VALUE <br>
Fix the aspect ratio. (Probably does nothing!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--video-gl-path=PATH <br>
Specify path of OpenGL library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--video-depth=DEPTH <br>
Specify display depth, in bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--video-fb-device=DEVICE <br>
Specify path to framebuffer. Typical value is /dev/fb0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--network, --no-network <br>
Enable/disable networking (on by default). Used for MIDI
over IP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--classic, --no-classic <br>
Start Schism Tracker in &quot;classic&quot; mode, or
don&rsquo;t. This is mostly cosmetic, although it does
change the program&rsquo;s behavior slightly in a few
places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display=DISPLAY <br>
X11 display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, -F, --fullscreen,
--no-fullscreen <br>
Enable/disable fullscreen mode at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, -P, --play, --no-play <br>
Start playing after loading song on command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diskwrite=FILENAME <br>
Render output to a file, and then exit. WAV or AIFF writer
is auto-selected based on file extension. Include %c
somewhere in the name to write each channel separately. <br>
This is meaningless if no initial filename is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--font-editor, --no-font-editor
<br>
Run the font editor (itf). This can also be accessed by
pressing Shift-F12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hooks, --no-hooks <br>
Run hooks. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug=FLAGS <br>
Enable some debugging flags (separated by commas). You
probably don&rsquo;t need this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version information and build date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a summary of available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A filename supplied on the
command line will be loaded at startup. Additionally, if
either a file or directory name is given, the default
module, sample, and instrument paths <br>
will be set accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
A detailed discussion of how to use Schism Tracker is far
beyond the scope of this document, but here is a very brief
rundown of the basics. Context-sensitive help can be <br>
accessed at any time while running the program by pressing
F1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The F3 key will bring you to the
sample list. Press enter here to open a file browser,
navigate in the list using the up/down arrow keys, and hit
enter again to load a sample. <br>
You will likely want to get some samples to work with. You
can also &quot;rip&quot; from existing modules; see for
example http://www.modarchive.org/ for a very large
selection of modules. <br>
(Keep in mind, however, that some authors don&rsquo;t
appreciate having their samples ripped!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that you&rsquo;ve loaded a
sample, press F2 to get to the pattern editor. This is where
the majority of the composition takes place. In short, the
song is laid out vertically, with <br>
each row representing 1/16 note; to play multiple notes
simultaneously, they are placed in different channels. The
four sub-columns of each channel are the note, sample
number, <br>
volume, and effect. A list of effects is available in the
pattern editor help, but you can safely ignore that column
for now. Assuming a US keymap, notes are entered with the
<br>
keyboard as follows: <br>
(Note) C# D# F# G# A# C# D# F# G# A# C# D# <br>
| | || | | | || || | | | || | | | || || | | | || | | <br>
| | || | | | || || | | | || | | | || || | | | || | | <br>
(What you | |S||D| | |G||H||J| | |2||3| | |5||6||7| | |9||0|
| <br>
type) | &rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo; |
&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo; |
&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo; |
&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo; |
&rsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;-&rsquo; | <br>
| Z| X| C| V| B| N| M| Q| W| E| R| T| Y| U| I| O| P| <br>

&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;--&rsquo;
<br>
(Note) C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E <br>
(Octave 0) (Octave 1) (Octave 2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;/&quot; and
&quot;*&quot; keys on the numeric keypad change octaves, and
the current octave is displayed near the top of the screen.
Try typing &quot;qwerty&quot; into the pattern - it will
enter an <br>
ascending note sequence, and you&rsquo;ll hear the notes as
they&rsquo;re entered. (of course, assuming you loaded a
sample!) Press F6 to play your pattern, and F8 to stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other important keys for the
pattern editor include Ins/Del to shift notes up and down
within a channel, Shift-Arrows to mark a block, Alt-C/Alt-P
to copy and paste, and Alt-U to <br>
clear the mark. There are well over a hundred key bindings
for the pattern editor; it is well worth the effort to learn
them all eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that you have something in
your pattern, you&rsquo;ll need to set up an orderlist.
Press F11 to switch to the orderlist page, and type 0 to add
the pattern you created. Now press <br>
F5 to start playing. The song will begin at the first order,
look up the pattern number and play that pattern, then
advance to the next order, and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, having only one
pattern isn&rsquo;t all that interesting, so go back to the
pattern editor and press the + key to change to the next
pattern. Now you can write another four <br>
bars of music and add the new pattern to the orderlist, and
the next time you play the song, your two patterns will play
in sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may wish to give your song a
title; press F12 and type a name in the box at the top. You
can also adjust the tempo and a number of other settings on
this page, but for now, <br>
most of them are fine at their default values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save your new song, press
F10, type a filename, and hit enter. You can load it again
later by pressing F9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This tutorial has deliberately
omitted the instrument editor (on F4), for the purposes of
brevity and simplicity. You may want to experiment with it
once you have a feel for how <br>
the program works. (Select &quot;instruments&quot; on F12 to
enable instrument mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Storlek began studying Impulse Tracker&rsquo;s design in
2002, noting subtle details of the design and
implementation. Posts on the Modplug forums about rewriting
Impulse Tracker were <br>
met with ridicule and mockery. &quot;It can&rsquo;t be
done,&quot; they said.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Schism Tracker v0.031a was
released in July 2003, though very little worked at that
point, and it was more of a player with primitive editing
capabilities. File saving was hard- <br>
coded to write to &quot;test.it&quot; in the current
directory, and there was no way to load a sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first version that was more
or less usable was 0.15a, from December 2004.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From 2005 through 2009, Mrs.
Brisby did most of the development, and implemented tons of
features, including MIDI support, mouse support, and disk
writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Storlek &quot;took over&quot;
development again in 2009, and has been incrementally
rewriting much of the code since then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.schism/config <br>
Program settings, stored in an INI-style format. Most
options are accessible from within Schism Tracker&rsquo;s
interface, but there are a few &quot;hidden&quot;
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.schism/startup-hook,
~/.schism/exit-hook, ~/.schism/diskwriter-hook <br>
Optional files to execute upon certain events. (Must be
executable)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.schism/fonts/ <br>
font.cfg, and any .itf files found in this directory, are
displayed in the file browser of the font editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Schism Tracker is able to save
modules in IT and S3M format, sample data as ITS, S3I, AIFF,
AU, WAV, and RAW, and instruments as ITI. Additionally, it
can render to WAV and AIFF <br>
(optionally writing each channel to a separate file), and
can export MID files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Schism Tracker was written by Storlek and Mrs. Brisby, with
player code from Modplug by Olivier Lapicque. Based on
Impulse Tracker by Jeffrey Lim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional code and data has
been contributed by many others; refer to the file AUTHORS
in the source distribution for a more complete list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keyboard diagram in this
manual page was adapted from the one used in the
documentation for Impulse Tracker, which in turn borrowed it
from Scream Tracker 3.</p>
