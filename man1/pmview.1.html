<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmview is a generalized 3D performance metrics visualization
tool for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmview is the base utility
behind performance metrics visualization tools such as
dkvis(1), mpvis(1), osvis(1) and nfsvis(1), It is also used
by a range of related tools that are <br>
specific to optional Performance Domain Agents (PMDA) and/or
PCP add-on products. pmview may also be used to construct
customized 3D performance displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmview displays performance
metrics as colored blocks and cylinders arranged on
monochrome base planes. Each object may represent a single
performance metric, or a stack of sev&acirc; <br>
eral performance metrics. Since the objects are modulated by
the value of the metric they represent, only numerical
metrics may be visualized. Objects representing a single
<br>
metric may be modulated in terms of height, color, or height
and color. Objects in a stack may only be height modulated,
but the stack can be normalized to the maximum height. <br>
Labels may be added to the scene to help identify groups of
metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A configuration file (as
specified by the -c option, or read from standard input) is
used to specify the position, color, maximum value and
labels of metrics and metric instances <br>
in the scene. The maximum value acts as a normalization
factor and is used to scale the object height and/or color
in proportion to the metric values. Metric values which <br>
exceed the associated maximum value are displayed as solid
white objects. If a metric is unavailable, the object will
have minimum height and will be colored grey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the tool operates in
&lsquo;&lsquo;live&rsquo;&rsquo; mode where performance
metrics are fetched in real-time. The user can view metrics
from any host running pmcd(1). pmview can also replay <br>
archives of performance metrics (see pmlogger(1)) and allow
the user to interactively control the current replay time
and rate using the VCR paradigm. This is particularly
use&acirc; <br>
ful for retrospective comparisons and for post-mortem
analysis of performance problems where a remote system is
not accessible or a performance analyst is not available
on-site.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All metrics in the Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS) with numeric value semantics from
any number of hosts or archives may be visualized. pmview
examines the semantics of <br>
the metrics and where sensible, converts metric values to a
rate before scaling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The -S, -T, -O and -A options may be used to define a time
window to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial
origin within the time window, or specify a
&lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; align&acirc; <br>
ment of the sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other available options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a archive[,archive,...]] <br>
Specify an archive from which metrics can be obtained for a
particular host. archive is the basename of an archive, or
the name of a directory conytaining archives, pre&acirc;
<br>
viously created by pmlogger(1). Multiple sets of archives
(separated by commas or in different -a options) from
different hosts may be given, but an error will occur if
<br>
there is more than one set of archives from the same host.
Any metrics that are not associated with a specific host or
archive in the configuration file will use the first <br>
set of archives as their source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Parse the configuration file
and exit before displaying the pmview window. Any errors in
the configuration file are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c configfile <br>
Load the configuration from configfile rather than standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host <br>
Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
the default localhost. Implies that pmview will run in live
mode, so no archives can be specified on the com&acirc; <br>
mand line or in the configuration file. Only one -h option
may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n pmnsfile <br>
Normally pmview operates on the distributed Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
<br>
pmnsfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Connect to the time controls (see pmtime(1)) on this port.
Used when a tool launches another tool so that they can
connect to the same time controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R logconfig <br>
Use logconfig as the pmlogger(1) config when recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r addconfig <br>
Append addconfig onto the pmlogger(1) config generated by
pmview when recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval <br>
The update interval used to fetch metrics from the live or
archive sources. The interval argument follows the syntax
described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form <br>
may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this case
are seconds). The default is 2.0 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x version <br>
Use the specified version of the pmlaunch(5) specification.
The versions currently supported are
&lsquo;&lsquo;1.0&rsquo;&rsquo; and the default version
&lsquo;&lsquo;2.0&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z timezone <br>
By default, pmview reports the time of day according to the
local timezone on the system where pmview is run. The -Z
option changes the default timezone to timezone which <br>
should be in the format of the environment variable TZ as
described in environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Change the reporting timezone
to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as identified via either the -h option,
or the first -a <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
-display display <br>
-name name <br>
-title title <br>
-xrm &quot;resourceName: value&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most standard X(1) command line
arguments may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOW <br>
The pmview window is comprised of a menu bar, time and scale
controls, metric and time values, and an
&lsquo;&lsquo;examiner&rsquo;&rsquo; viewer (see ivview(1)),
which displays the 3D scene.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMINER VIEWER <br>
The left, right and bottom edges of the examiner viewer
contain a variety of thumb wheels and buttons that can be
used to adjust the visualization of the 3D scene. The Rotx
and <br>
Roty thumb wheels allow the user to rotate the scene about
the x and y axes, respectively. The dolly thumb wheel moves
the virtual camera closer and further from the scene <br>
allowing the user to examine specific parts in detail or
view the entire scene. On the right edge of the viewer are
eight buttons which affect the way the user can interact
with <br>
the scene.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pointer <br>
Changes the cursor to a pointer which allows blocks to be
selected in the scene. See the Metric Selection section
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hand <br>
Changes the cursor to a hand which allows the scene to be
rotated, translated and dollied using a combination of mouse
buttons. The left mouse button can be used to rotate <br>
the scene in the direction of the mouse. Releasing the left
mouse button before the mouse has stopped moving will cause
the scene to continue to rotate, which can be stopped <br>
by pressing the left mouse button again. The middle mouse
button will &lsquo;&lsquo;pan&rsquo;&rsquo; the scene, and
both mouse buttons act as a dolly for the virtual
camera.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Question Mark <br>
Displays the SGI Help information for the examiner
viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home <br>
Changes the scene back to its original position, unless the
home position has been changed by the home pointer
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home Pointer <br>
Changes the home position of the scene to be the scene
currently in view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eye Resizes the scene so that it
completely fits into the 3D viewing area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cross-hairs <br>
Moves the object under the cursor to the center of the
viewing area, if the hand cursor has been selected. Pressing
the &lsquo;&lsquo;s&rsquo;&rsquo; key while the cursor is
over an object has the <br>
same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perspective Box <br>
Switches the display between perspective and orthogonal
projections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the right mouse button
within the scene window will bring up a menu of options
which affect how the 3D scene is drawn. The options include
drawing the blocks as wire <br>
frames, and turning on stereo viewing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METRIC SELECTION <br>
When the pointer cursor is active, more information about
the 3D scene can be obtained. Text describing the metric
represented by the block under the cursor will be displayed
in <br>
the top text box of the pmview window. The text contains the
source and name of the metric, current value and units, and
the percentage of the expected maximum (or normaliza&acirc;
<br>
tion) value. The text box is updated whenever the scene is
updated with the latest metric values or when the cursor is
moved over another block in the scene. Moving the cursor
<br>
over a base plane block, text or the surrounding space will
clear the text box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking the left mouse button
on a block will bind the text box on that metric instance so
that the metric can be monitored while performing other
actions with the mouse. The <br>
block will be highlighted with a red wire frame. Clicking
the left mouse button on text or the space surrounding the
scene will unselect the object, causing the text box to <br>
revert to the original behavior of showing the metric
underneath the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting a base plane instead
of a modulated block will cause all the blocks on that base
plane to be selected. When more than one object is selected,
the text box behaves as <br>
if nothing is selected, so the metric displayed is the
metric currently under the cursor. Multiple selections are
also possible by pressing the SHIFT key while selecting an
<br>
object with the left mouse button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS <br>
There are four menus in pmview&rsquo;s user interface which
allow scenes to be recorded, saved and printed (File),
access to the time controls (Options), launching other tools
(Launch) <br>
and online help (Help).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File/Record <br>
When in &lsquo;&lsquo;live&rsquo;&rsquo; mode, this option
will launch pmlogger(1) processes to record the current
scene into an archive folio (see pmafm(1)) so that it may be
replayed at a later <br>
time. This option is not available in
&lsquo;&lsquo;replay&rsquo;&rsquo; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When File/Record is selected, a
file chooser dialog will prompt for the name of the new
archive folio. If the directory to the folio does not exist,
pmview will attempt to <br>
create it. It is usually convenient to keep each folio
within its own directory as there will be several other
files associated with the folio, including the generated
ar&acirc; <br>
chives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a valid folio has been
created, pmview will launch a pmlogger(1) process for each
host to collect the metrics required from that host in the
current scene. The current <br>
selections do not affect the set of metrics that are
recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While recording is in progress,
a red dot will appear in the time controls button in the top
left-hand corner of the pmview window. The File/Record
option will also change <br>
to File/Stop Recording as only one recording session is
possible at any one time. Selecting blocks or launching
other tools will have no affect on the recording
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The record session may be
terminated by selecting File/Stop Recording. This will
display dialogs for each pmlogger(1) instance describing the
size and location of the ar&acirc; <br>
chive files before terminating each process. When all
pmlogger(1) processes have been terminated, the red dot is
removed from the time controls button, and the menu reverts
<br>
back to File/Record to allow another recording session to
take place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the application exists while
recording, a dialog will appear allowing you to terminate
each pmlogger(1) process, or leave it running
unattached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An archive folio may be replayed
using the command: &lsquo;&lsquo;pmafm folio
replay&rsquo;&rsquo;. See pmafm(1) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not uncommon for a
front-end script which generates a pmview scene to use
metrics that are not contained in the scene. For example,
osvis(1) uses several hinv metrics <br>
to determine the size and layout of some objects. As these
metrics are also needed when replaying the generated archive
with the front-end script, a complete pmlogger(1) <br>
config can be specified (-R) that overrides the pmview
generated config, or an additional config can be appended
(-r) to the pmview generated config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File/Save <br>
Saves the current scene to a human-readable Open Inventor
file (see inventor(1)). A file dialog will prompt for the
location of the file. The default file extension is <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;.iv&rsquo;&rsquo; which is recognized by
ivview(1) and some Web browsers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File/Print <br>
Outputs the current scene to a printer. A print dialog will
be displayed allowing a specific printer to be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File/Quit <br>
pmview immediately exits. If recording was active, dialogs
will be displayed for each pmlogger(1) process so that they
may be terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options/Show Time Control <br>
Displays the time controls (see pmtime(1)) that are driving
this instance of pmview. The time controls may be shared by
other tools, including pmchart(1), that have been <br>
launched by other instances of pmview and oview(1).
Therefore, this menu item may appear to have no affect if
the time controls are already visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options/New Time Control <br>
Disconnect with the current time controls (which may be
shared by other tools, see pmtime(1)) and use a new time
control that is not connected to any other tools. The new
<br>
time control will be immediately displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Launch <br>
The launch menu is generated from a menu specification file
(see pmlaunch(5)). The menu contains tools that may be
launched based on the sources and names of the selected <br>
metrics in the scene. For example, if the selected metrics
are from three different hosts, then three copies of a tool
may be launched, one for each host. The behavior of a <br>
launch depends on the selected metrics and the tools being
launched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On selection of a Launch menu
item pmview generates state information in the pmlaunch(5)
metrics specification format. This provides a description of
the selected metrics <br>
(or if there are no selections, all the metrics) in the
scene without any geometry information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tools which can monitor multiple
hosts and user specified metrics may be launched only once
for those metrics (eg pmdumptext(1)). Other tools which have
a fixed view for one <br>
host (eg mpvis(1)), may be launched multiple times, once for
each host in the selected metric list. If the launched tools
have time controls, they will share the time con&acirc; <br>
trols with the launching pmview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set of launched tools is
configurable, and may include IRIX and user applications.
See pmlaunch(5) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help/... <br>
If pcp.books.help has been installed, then the insight(1)
books for pmview are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME CONTROLS <br>
In addition to the menu options for time controls, the
current direction of the time controls (see pmtime(1)) is
shown in a button in the top-left corner of the pmview
window. <br>
Pressing this button will display the time control and is
identical in behavior to Options/Show Time Control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCALE CONTROLS <br>
Above the examiner window is a thumb wheel and an editable
text box which allow the user to apply a multiplier to all
values represented in the scene. Spinning the wheel to the
<br>
right and/or increasing the text value for the scale will
increase the height of the bars. Spinning the wheel to the
left and/or lowering the text value will decrease the height
<br>
of the bars. The button to the right of the thumb wheel will
reset the scale so that the bars appear at the original
height for their current value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME INFORMATION <br>
Beside the scale controls is another text box which displays
the time of the fetched metrics. The time will change with
the time controller (see pmtime(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The default face of the 3D font in the pmview window can be
altered via PMVIEW_FONT environment variable which can be
set to the base name of a Type1 font file in the default
<br>
Inventor fonts directory.</p>
