<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gerbv - Gerber Viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gerbv [OPTIONS] [gerberfile[s]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gerbv is a viewer for RS274-X, commonly known as Gerber,
files. RS274-X files are generated from different PCB CAD
programs and are used in the printed circuit board
manufactur&acirc; <br>
ing process. gerbv also supports Excellon/NC drill files as
well as XY (centroid) files produced by the program PCB
(http://pcb.geda-project.org/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Warning! On some platforms, which hasn&rsquo;t long option
available, only short options are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gerbv General options: <br>
-V|--version Print the version number of gerbv and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h|--help <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b&lt;hex&gt;|--background=&lt;hex&gt;
<br>
Use background color &lt;hex&gt;. &lt;hex&gt; is specified

<br>
Use foreground color &lt;hex&gt;. &lt;hex&gt; is specified
as an html-color code, e.g. #00FF00 for Green. If a user
also wants to set the alpha (rendering with Cairo) it can be
speci&acirc; <br>
fied as an #RRGGBBAA code. Use multiple -f flags to set the
color for multiple layers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l
&lt;filename&gt;|--log=&lt;filename&gt; <br>
All error messages etc are stored in a file with filename
&lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t

Read Excellon tools from the file &lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;project
filename&gt;|--project=&lt;project filename&gt; <br>
Load a stored project. Please note that the project file
must be stored in the same directory as the gerber
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gerbv Export-specific options:

the default 72 DPI also changes in that case). If a
resolu&acirc; <br>
tion is specified, it will clip the image to this size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL <br>
When you start gerbv you can give the files to be loaded on
the command line, either as each file separated with a space
or by using wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user interface is graphical.
Simply press and drag middle mouse button (scroll wheel) and
the image will pan as you move the mouse. To manipulate a
layer, right-click on one <br>
of the rightmost list items. That will bring up a pop-up
menu where you can select what you want to do with that
layer (reload file, change color, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you hold the mouse button
over one the rightmost button a tooltips will show you the
name of the file loaded on that layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTIVATION AND DEACTIVATION OF
LAYERS <br>
You can load several files at one time. You can then turn
displaying of the layers on and off by clicking on one of
check boxes near the layer names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also control this from
the keyboard. Press Ctrl, enter the number on the layer you
want activate/deactivate on the numerical keypad and then
release the Ctrl key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZOOMING <br>
Zooming can be handled by either menu choices, keypressing
or mouse scroll wheel. If you press z you will zoom in and
if you press Shift+z (i.e. Z) you will zoom out. Scroll <br>
wheel works if you enabled that in your X server and mapped
it to button 4 and 5. You can make the image fit by pressing
f (there is also a menu alternative for this). If Pan, <br>
Zoom, or Measure Tool is selected you can press right mouse
button for zoom in, and if you press Shift and right mouse
button you will zoom out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also do zooming by
outline. Select Zoom Tool, press mouse button, draw,
release. The dashed line shows how the zooming will be
dependent on the resolution of the window. <br>
The non-dashed outline will show what you actually selected.
If you change your mind when started to mark outline, you
can always abort by pressing escape. By holding down the
<br>
Shift key when you press the mouse button, you will select
an area where the point you started at will be the center of
your selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEASUREMENTS <br>
You can do measurement on the image displayed. Select
Measure Tool, the cursor changes to a plus. By using left
mouse button you can draw the lines that you want to
measure. The <br>
result of the last measurement is also displayed on the
statusbar. All measurements are in the drawing until you
select other Tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The statusbar shows the current
mouse position on the layer in the same coordinates as in
the file. I.e. if you have (0,0) in the middle of the image
in the gerber files, the <br>
statusbar will show (0,0) at the same place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPERIMPOSING <br>
When you load several Gerber files, you can display them
&quot;on top of each other&quot;, i.e. superimposing. The
general way to display them are that upper layers cover the
layers <br>
beneath, which is called copy (GTK+ terms).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other ways selectable are
and, or, xor and invert. They map directly to corresponding
functions in GTK. In GTK they are described as: &quot;For
colored images, only GDK_COPY, <br>
GDK_XOR and GDK_INVERT are generally useful. For bitmaps,
GDK_AND and GDK_OR are also useful.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROJECTS <br>
gerbv can also handle projects. A project consist of bunch
of loaded layers with their resp. color and the background
color. The easiest way to create a project is to load all
<br>
files you want into the layer you want, set all the colors
etc and do a &quot;Save Project As...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You load a project either from
the menu bar or by using the commandline switches -p or
--project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there is a limit in
that the project file must be in the same directory as the
gerber files to be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCHEME <br>
The project files are simple Scheme programs that is
interpreted by a built in Scheme interpreter. The Scheme
interpreter is TinyScheme and needs a Scheme program called
init.scm <br>
to initialize itself. The search path for init.scm is (in
the following order) /usr/share/gerbv/scheme, the directory
with the executable gerbv, the directory gerbv was invoked
<br>
from and finally according to the environment variable
GERBV_SCHEMEINIT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOOLS FILE <br>
Not every Excellon drill file is self-sufficient. Some CADs
produce .drd files where tools are only referenced, but
never defined (such as what diameter of the tool is.) Eagle
<br>
CAD is one of such CADs, and there are more since many board
houses require Tools files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Tools file is a plain text
file which you create in an editor. Each line of the file
describes one tool (the name and the diameter, in
inches):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T01 0.024 <br>
T02 0.040 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the same tools (T01
etc.) that are used in the Drill file. A standard practice
with Eagle is to create an empty Tools file, run the CAM
processor, and the error report <br>
tells you which tools you &quot;forgot&quot;. Then you put
these tools into the file and rerun the CAM processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You load a tool file by using
the commandline switches -t or --tools. The file can have
any name you wish, but Eagle expects the file type to be
&quot;.drl&quot;, so it makes sense to <br>
keep it this way. Some board houses are still using CAM
software from DOS era, so you may want to excercise caution
before going beyond the 8.3 naming convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When gerbv reads the Tools file
it also checks that there are no duplicate definitions of
tools. This does happen from time to time as you edit the
file by hand, especially if <br>
you, during design, add or remove parts from the board and
then have to add new tools into the Tools file. The
duplicate tools are a very serious error which will stop
(HOLD) <br>
your board until you fix the Tools file and maybe the
Excellon file. gerbv will detect duplicate tools if they are
present, and will exit immediately to indicate such a fatal
<br>
error in a very obvious way. A message will also be printed
to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your Excellon file does not
contain tool definitions then gerbv will preconfigure the
tools by deriving the diameter of the drill bit from the
tool number. This is probably <br>
not what you want, and you will see warnings printed on the
console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
GERBV_SCHEMEINIT <br>
Defines where the init.scm file is stored. Used by scheme
interpreter, which is used by the project reader.</p>
