<p style="margin-top: 1em">wxGUI 3D View Mode DESCRIPTION
<br>
Note: wxNviz is currently under development. Not all planned
functionality is already implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wxNviz is a wxGUI 3D view mode
which allows users to realistically render multiple surfaces
(2D raster maps) in a 3D space, optionally using thematic
coloring, draping 2D vector <br>
data or different 2D raster data over the surfaces,
displaying 3D vector data in the space, and visualization of
3D rasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To start the wxGUI 3D view mode,
choose &acirc;3D view&acirc; from the map toolbar. You can
switch between 2D and 3D view. The region in 3D view is
updated according to displayed region in <br>
2D view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wxNviz is emphasized on the ease
and speed of viewer positioning and provided flexibility for
using a wide range of data. A low resolution surface or wire
grid (optional) pro&acirc; <br>
vides real-time viewer positioning capabilities. Coarse and
fine resolution controls allow the user to further refine
drawing speed and detail as needed. Continuous scaling of
<br>
elevation provides the ability to use various data types for
the vertical dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each session of wxNviz, you
might want the same set of 2D/3D raster and vector data,
view parameters, or other attributes. For consistency
between sessions, you can store <br>
this information in the GRASS workspace file (gxw).
Workspace contains information to restore &quot;state&quot;
of the system in 2D and if wxNviz is enabled also in the 3D
display mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D View Layer Manager Toolbox
<br>
The 3D view toolbox is integrated in the Layer Manager. The
toolbox has several tabs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; View for view
controlling,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Data for data
properties,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Appearance for
appearance settings (lighting, fringes, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Analysis for
various data analyses (only cutting planes so far).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Animation for
creating simple animations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View <br>
You can use this panel to set the position, direction, and
perspective of the view. The position box shows a puck with
a direction line pointing to the center. The direction line
<br>
indicates the look direction (azimuth). You click and drag
the puck to change the current eye position. Another way to
change eye position is to press the buttons around the <br>
position box representing cardinal and ordinal
directions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four other buttons for
view control in the bottom of this panel (following label
Look:):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; here requires
you to click on Map Display Window to determine the point to
look at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; center changes
the point you are looking at to the center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; top moves the
current eye position above the map center.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; reset returns
all current view settings to their default values. <br>
You can adjust the viewer&acirc;s height above the scene,
perspective and twist value to rotate the scene about the
horizontal axis. An angle of 0 is flat. The scene rotates
between <br>
-90 and 90 degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also adjusts the
vertical exaggeration of the surface. As an example, if the
easting and northing are in meters and the elevation in
feet, a vertical exaggeration of <br>
0.305 would produce a true (unexaggerated) surface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View parameters can be
controlled by sliders or edited directly in the text boxes.
It is possible to enter values which are out of
slider&acirc;s range (and it will then adjust to the <br>
new range).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fly-through mode <br>
View can be changed in fly-through mode (can be activated in
Map Display toolbar), which enables to change the view
smoothly and therefore it is suitable for creating animation
<br>
(see below). To start flying, press left mouse button and
hold it down to continue flying. Flight direction is
controlled by mouse cursor position on screen. Flight speed
can be <br>
increased/decreased stepwise by keys PageUp/PageDown,
Home/End or Up/Down arrows. Speed is increased multiple
times while Shift key is held down. Holding down Ctrl key
switches <br>
flight mode in the way that position of viewpoint is changed
(not the direction).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data properties <br>
This tab controls the parameters related to map layers. It
consists of four collapsible panels - Surface, Constant
surface, Vector and 3D raster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Surface <br>
Each active raster map layer from the current layer tree is
displayed as surface in the 3D space. This panel controls
how loaded surfaces are drawn. To change parameters of a
<br>
surface, it must be selected in the very top part of the
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The top half of the panel has
drawing style options. Surface can be drawn as a wire mesh
or using filled polygons (most realistic). You can set draw
mode to coarse (fast display <br>
mode), fine (draws surface as filled polygons with fine
resolution) or both (which combines coarse and fine mode).
Additionally set coarse style to wire to draw the surface as
<br>
wire mesh (you can also choose color of the wire) or surface
to draw the surface using coarse resolution filled polygons.
This is a low resolution version of the polygon surface <br>
style. E.g. surface is drawn as a wire mesh if you set mode
to coarse and style to wire. Note that it differs from the
mesh drawn in fast display mode because hidden lines are
<br>
not drawn. To draw the surface using filled polygons, but
with wire mesh draped over it, choose mode both and style
wire. Beside mode and style you can also choose style of
<br>
shading used for the surface. Gouraud style draws the
surfaces with a smooth shading to blend individual cell
colors together, flat draws the surfaces with flat shading
with one <br>
color for every two cells. The surface appears faceted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set given draw settings for
all loaded surfaces press button &quot;Set to all&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bottom half of the panel has
options to set, unset or modify attributes of the current
surface. Separate raster data or constants can be used for
various attributes of the <br>
surface:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; color - raster
map or constant color to drape over the current surface.
This option is useful for draping imagery such as aerial
photography over a DEM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mask - raster
map that controls the areas displayed from the current
surface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; transparency -
raster map or constant value that controls the transparency
of the current surface. The default is completely opaque.
Range from 0 (opaque) to 100 (trans&acirc; <br>
parent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; shininess -
raster map or constant value that controls the shininess
(reflectivity) of the current surface. Range from 0 to
100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the very bottom part of the
panel position of surface can be set. To move the surface
right (looking from the south) choose X axis and set some
positive value. To reset the <br>
surface position press Reset button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constant surface <br>
It is possible to add constant surface and set its
properties like fine resolution, value (height), color and
transparency. It behaves similarly to surface but it has
less <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector <br>
2D vector data can be draped on the selected surfaces with
various markers to represent point data; you can use
attribute of vector features to determine size, color, shape
of <br>
glyph. 3D vector data including volumes (closed group of
faces with one kernel inside) is also supported. This panel
controls how loaded 2D or 3D vector data are drawn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can define the width (in
pixels) of the line features, the color used for lines or
point markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If vector map is 2D you can
display vector features as flat at a specified elevation or
drape it over a surface(s) at a specified height. Use the
height control to set the flat <br>
elevation or the drape height above the surface(s). In case
of multiple surfaces it is possible to specify which
surfaces is the vector map draped over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For display purposes, it is
better to set the height slightly above the surface. If the
height is set at zero, portions of the vector may disappear
into the surface(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 2D/3D vector points you can
also set the size of the markers. Currently are implemented
these markers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; x sets the
current points markers to a 2D &quot;X&quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sphere - solid
3D sphere,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; diamond - solid
3D diamond,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cube - solid 3D
cube,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; box - hollow 3D
cube,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; gyroscope -
hollow 3D sphere,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; asterisk - 3D
line-star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thematic mapping can be used to
determine marker color and size (and line color and
width).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D rasters <br>
3D raster maps (volumes, voxel models) can be displayed
either as isosurfaces or slices. Similarly to surface panel
you can define draw shading - gouraud (draws the 3D rasters
<br>
with a smooth shading to blend individual cell colors
together) and flat (draws the 3D rasters with flat shading
with one color for every two cells. The 3D raster appears
<br>
faceted). As mentioned above currently are supported two
visualization modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; isosurface - the
levels of values for drawing the 3D raster(s) as
isosurfaces,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; and slice -
drawing the 3D raster as cross-sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The middle part of the panel has
controls to add, delete, move up/down selected isosurface or
slice. The bottom part differs for isosurface and slice.
When choosing an isosur&acirc; <br>
face, this part the of panel has options to set, unset or
modify attributes of the current isosurface. Various
attributes of the isosurface can be defined, similarly to
surface <br>
attributes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; isosurface value
- reference isosurface value (height in map units).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; color - raster
map or constant color to drape over the current 3D
raster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mask - raster
map that controls the areas displayed from the current 3D
raster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; transparency -
raster map or constant value that controls the transparency
of the current 3D raster. The default is completely opaque.
Range from 0 (opaque) to 100 <br>
(transparent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; shininess -
raster map or constant value that controls the shininess
(reflectivity) of the current 3D raster. Range from 0 to
100. <br>
In case of 3D raster slice the bottom part of the panel
controls the slice attributes (which axis is slice parallel
to, position of slice edges, transparency). Press button
Reset <br>
to reset slice position attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3D rasters can be moved the same
way like surfaces do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Analysis <br>
Analysis tab contains Cutting planes panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cutting planes <br>
Cutting planes allow cutting surfaces along a plane. You can
switch between six planes; to disable cutting planes switch
to None. Initially the plane is vertical, you can change
<br>
it to horizontal by setting tilt 90 degrees. The X and Y
values specify the rotation center of plane. You can see
better what X and Y do when changing rotation. The Height
<br>
parameter applies only when changing tilt concurrently.
Press the Reset button to reset the current cutting
plane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of multiple surfaces you
can visualize the cutting plane by Shading. Shading is
visible only when more than one surface is loaded and these
surfaces must have the same <br>
fine resolution set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Appearance <br>
Appearance tab consists of three collapsible panels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lighting for
adjusting light source</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fringe for
drawing fringes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Decorations to
display north arrow and scale bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lighting panel enables to
change the position of light source, light color, brightness
and ambient. Light position is controlled similarly to eye
position. If option Show <br>
light model is enabled light model is displayed to visualize
the light settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Fringe panel allows you to
draw fringes in different directions (North &amp; East,
South &amp; East, South &amp; West, North &amp; West). It is
possible to set the fringe color and height of <br>
the bottom edge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Decorations panel enables to
display north arrow and simple scale bar. North arrow and
scale bar length is determined in map units. You can display
more than one scale bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Animation <br>
Animation panel enables to create a simple animation as a
sequence of images. Press &acirc;Record&acirc; button and
start changing the view. Views are recorded in given
interval (FPS - <br>
Frames Per Second). After recording, the animation can be
replayed. To save the animation, fill in the directory and
file prefix, choose image format (PPM or TIF) and then press
<br>
&acirc;Save&acirc;. Now wait until the last image is
generated. It is recommended to record animations using
fly-through mode to achieve smooth motion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings <br>
This panel has controls which allows user to set default
surface, vector and 3D raster data attributes. You can also
modify default view parameters, or to set the background
<br>
color of the Map Display Window (the default color is
white).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be implemented <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Labels, decoration, etc. (Implemented, but
not fully functional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Surface - mask
by zero/elevation, more interactive positioning</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Vector points -
implement display mode flat/surface for 2D points</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
wxNviz is under active development and distributed as
&quot;Experimental Prototype&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that with wxGTK port
of wxPython (Linux systems), a problem might appear during
wxNviz initialization (nothing is rendered at all) or when
rendering vectors (bad <br>
order of rendering surfaces and vectors). If you encounter
such problems, try to change a depth buffer number in wxGUI
Settings &gt; Preferences &gt; Map Display &gt; Advanced
(possible <br>
numbers are 0, 16, 24, 32). It is currently not possible to
automatically determine the right number which is working
for your computer.</p>
