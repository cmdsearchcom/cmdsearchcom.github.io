<p>PDFPC(1) General Commands Manual PDFPC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pdfpc - PDF presenter console with multi-monitor support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pdfpc [options] PDF-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pdfpc is a GTK-based presentation viewer which uses
Keynote-like multi-monitor output to provide meta
information to the speaker during the presentation. It is
able to show a <br>
normal presentation window on one screen while showing a
more sophisticated overview on the other one, providing
information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the
time <br>
left in the presentation. pdfpc processes PDF documents,
which can be created using nearly all modern presentation
software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the presenter view
appears in the primary monitor and the presentation view in
the second monitor (provided you have two monitors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See pdfpcrc(5) if you want to
customize the keybindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
Caching / Pre-rendering <br>
To allow fast changes between the different slides of the
presentation the PDF pages are pre-rendered to memory. The
progress bar on the bottom of the presenter screen indicates
<br>
how many percent of the slides have been pre-rendered
already. During the initial rendering phase this will slow
down slide changes, as most CPU power is used for the
rendering <br>
process in the background. After the cache is fully primed
however the changing of slides should be much faster, as
with normal PDF viewers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the pre-rendering takes a lot
of memory it can be disabled using the --disable-cache
switch at the cost of speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It it also possible to store the
pre-rendered slides on the disk (see --persist-cache). This
speeds up the start of the program if the slide-set is used
for a second time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cache compression <br>
The pre-rendered and cached slides can be compressed in
memory to save up some memory. Without compression a set of
about 100 PDF pages can easily grow up to about 1.5 GB size.
<br>
Netbooks with only 1 GB of memory would swap themselves to
death if pre-rendering is enabled in such a situation. The
compression is enabled by default as it does not harm
ren&acirc; <br>
dering speed in a noticeable way on most systems. It does
however slow down pre-rendering by about a factor of two. If
you have got enough memory and want to ensure the fastest
<br>
possible pre-rendering you can disable slide compression by
using the -z switch. But be warned using the uncompressed
pre-rendering storage will use about 30 times the memory the
<br>
new compressed storage utilizes (e.g. 50 MB will become
about 1.5 GB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timer <br>
If a duration is given (-d option), the timer will show a
countdown with the given parameters. If no duration is
specified (or if a value of 0 is given to the -d option),
the <br>
timer will show how much time has been spent. The duration
is stored automatically, so you do not need to repeat it for
every invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The timer is started if you are
navigating away from the first page for the first time. This
feature is quite useful as you may want to show the title
page of your presentation <br>
while people are still entering the room and the
presentation has not really begun yet. If you want to start
over you can use the &rsquo;r&rsquo; key which will make the
presenter reset the <br>
timer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a duration is given, at the
moment the timer reaches the defined last-minutes value it
will change color to indicate your talk is nearing its end.
As soon as the timer <br>
reaches the zero mark (00:00:00) it will turn red and count
further down showing a negative time, to provide information
on how many minutes you are overtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes <br>
Textual notes can be displayed for each slide. While in the
presentation, pressing &rsquo;n&rsquo; will allow you to
take notes for the screen. To go out of editing mode, press
the Escape <br>
key. Note that while editing a note the keybindings stop
working, i.e. you are not able to change slides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The notes are stored in the
given file in a plain text format, easy to edit also from
outside the program. See the section about the pdfpc format
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview mode <br>
Pressing tab you can enter the overview mode, where
miniatures for the slides are shown. You can select one
slide to jump to with the mouse or with the arrow keys. You
can also <br>
define overlays and the end slide (see next sections) in
this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overlays <br>
Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e. sets
of slides that are logically grouped together as a single,
changing slide. Examples include enumerations where the <br>
single items are displayed one after another or rough
&quot;animations&quot;, where parts of a picture change from
slide to slide. Pdfpc includes facilities for dealing with
such overlays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this description, we will
differentiate between slides (i.e. pages in the PDF
document) and &quot;user slides&quot;, that are the logical
slides. The standard forward movement command <br>
(page down, enter, etc.) moves through one slide at a time,
as expected. That means that every step in the overlay is
traversed. The backward movement command works differently
<br>
depending if the current and previous slides are part of an
overlay:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the current
slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previous
slide. That means that we are in the middle of an overlay we
can jump forward and backward through the <br>
single steps of it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the current
slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first one),
but the previous slides are, we jump to the previous user
slide. This means that when going back in <br>
the presentation you do not have to go through every step of
the overlay, pdfpc just shows the first slide of the each
overlay. As you normally only go back in a presentation <br>
when looking for a concrete slide, this is more
convenient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The up and down cursor keys work
on a user slide basis. You can use them to skip the rest of
an overlay or to jump to the previous user slide, ignoring
the state of the current <br>
slide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When going through an overlay,
two additional previews may be activated in the presenter
view, just below the main view, showing the next and the
previous slide in an overlay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pdfpc tries to find these
overlays automatically by looking into the page labels in
the PDF file. For LaTeX this works correctly at least with
the beamer class and also modify&acirc; <br>
ing the page numbers manually (compiling with pdflatex). If
your preferred slide-producing method does not work
correctly with this detection, you can supply this
information <br>
using the &rsquo;o&rsquo; key for each slide that is part of
an overlay (except the first one!). The page numbering is
also adapted. This information is automatically stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End slide <br>
Some people like to have some additional, backup slides
after the last slide in the actual presentation. Things like
bibliographic references or slides referring to specialized
<br>
questions are typical examples. Pdfpc lets you define which
is the last slide in the actual presentation via the
&rsquo;e&rsquo; key. This just changes the progress display
in the presen&acirc; <br>
ter screen, as to have a better overview of how many slides
are left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Movies <br>
Pdfpc can play back movies included in the PDF file. Movies
may be started and stopped by clicking within their area.
For the presenter, a progress bar is drawn along the
bot&acirc; <br>
tom of the movie. This expands when the mouse hovers over
it, allowing one to seek by clicking or dragging within the
progress bar. Switching slides automatically stops
play&acirc; <br>
back, and movies will be reset after leaving and returning
to a slide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Movies may be included in PDF
files as &quot;screen annotations&quot;. pdfpc does not yet
support options that modify the playback of these movies. In
LaTeX, such movies may be added to <br>
a presentation with the &quot;movie15&quot; or
&quot;multimedia&quot; package. Note that the poster,
autoplay, and repeat options are not yet supported. (Also,
run ps2pdf with the -dNOSAFER flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a perhaps simpler option,
pdfpc will play back movies linked from a hyperlink of type
&quot;launch&quot;. A query string may be added to the URL
of the movie to enable the &quot;autostart&quot;, <br>
&quot;loop&quot; and &quot;noprogress&quot; properties, if
necessary. (E.g., a link to
&quot;movie.avi?autostart&amp;loop&amp;noprogress&quot; will
add a video that starts playing automatically, loops when it
<br>
reaches the end, and does not show the progress bar.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In LaTeX, such links are created
with</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sepackage{hyperref} <br>
f{run:&lt;movie file&gt;}{&lt;placeholder content&gt;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The movie will playback in the
area taken by the placeholder content. Using a frame of the
movie will ensure the correct aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See our website
&acirc;&uml;http://pdfpc.github.io/demo/pdfpc-video-example.zip&acirc;&copy;
for a full example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pointer Mode <br>
If needed it is possible to turn on a pointer which draws a
red dot in the place pointed by mouse cursor on both -
presenter and presentation screens. It is also possible to
<br>
increase and decrease the pointer size. Additionally when
the pointer is enabled it is possible to drag &amp; drop
some area of the presenter screen causing it to be
highlighted in <br>
both views as well. Area outside the selected region will be
dimmed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdfpc Files <br>
The several additional information are stored in a file with
the extension &quot;pdfpc&quot;. When pdfpc is invoked with
a PDF file, it automatically checks for and loads the
associated <br>
pdfpc file, if it exists. This means that you normally do
not have to deal with this kind of files explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beside internal configiration,
the following user contributed command line options are
stored within the pdfpc file for later usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; duration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; end_time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; last_minutes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; notes
(position)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; start_time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are however cases where
you may want to edit the files manually. The most typical
case is if you add or remove some slides after you have
edited notes or defined overlays. <br>
It may be quicker to edit the pdfpc file than to re-enter
the whole information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files are plain-text files
that should be fairly self-explanatory. A couple of things
to note:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The slide
numbers of the notes refer to user slides</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Slide indexes
start at 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Appearance <br>
With GTK3 it is possible to modify the appearance of pdfpc.
There are two locations where pdfpc is looking for files.
The default location is /usr/share/pixmaps/pdfpc/pdfpc.css.
<br>
A user can copy it to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pdfpc/pdfpc.css and
change the attributes as he likes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integration with other tools
<br>
Pdfpc provides a dbus interface that other tools can use to
execute any action listed by --list-actions. The interface
appears on the session bus as io.github.pdfpc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
