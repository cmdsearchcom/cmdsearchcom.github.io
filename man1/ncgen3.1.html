<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncgen3 - From a CDL file generate a netCDF classic or 64 bit
classicfile, a C program, or a Fortran program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncgen3 [-b] [-c] [-f] [-k kind_of_file] [-x] [-n] [-o
netcdf_filename] input_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncgen3 generates either a netCDF file, or C or Fortran
source code to create a netCDF file. The input to ncgen3 is
a description of a netCDF file in a small language known as
<br>
CDL (network Common Data form Language), described below. If
no options are specified in invoking ncgen3, it merely
checks the syntax of the input CDL file, producing error
mes&acirc; <br>
sages for any violations of CDL syntax. Other options can be
used to create the corresponding netCDF file, to generate a
C program that uses the netCDF C interface to create the
<br>
netCDF file, or to generate a Fortran program that uses the
netCDF Fortran interface to create the same netCDF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncgen3 may be used with the
companion program ncdump to perform some simple operations
on netCDF files. For example, to rename a dimension in a
netCDF file, use ncdump to get a <br>
CDL version of the netCDF file, edit the CDL file to change
the name of the dimensions, and use ncgen3 to generate the
corresponding netCDF file from the edited CDL file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Create a (binary) netCDF file. If the -o option is
absent, a default file name will be constructed from the
netCDF name (specified after the netcdf keyword in the
input) <br>
by appending the &lsquo;.nc&rsquo; extension. If a file
already exists with the specified name, it will be
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Generate C source code that
will create a netCDF file matching the netCDF specification.
The C source code is written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Generate Fortran source code
that will create a netCDF file matching the netCDF
specification. The Fortran source code is written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o netcdf_file <br>
Name for the binary netCDF file created. If this option is
specified, it implies the &quot;-b&quot; option. (This
option is necessary because netCDF files cannot be written
di&acirc; <br>
rectly to standard output, since standard output is not
seekable.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k kind_of_file <br>
Using -k2 or -k &quot;64-bit offset&quot; specifies that
generated file (or program) should use version 2 of format
that employs 64-bit file offsets. The default is to use
version <br>
1 (&quot;classic&quot;) format with 32-bit file offsets,
although this limits the size of the netCDF file, variables,
and records to the sizes supported by the classic format.
<br>
(NetCDF-4 will support additional kinds of netCDF files,
&quot;netCDF-4&quot; and &quot;netCDF-4 classic
model&quot;.) Note: -v is also accepted to mean the same
thing as -k for backward <br>
compatibility, but -k is preferred, to match the
corresponding ncdump option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Don&rsquo;t initialize data
with fill values. This can speed up creation of large netCDF
files greatly, but later attempts to read unwritten data
from the generated file will <br>
not be easily detectable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Check the syntax of the CDL file &lsquo;foo.cdl&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncgen3 foo.cdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the CDL file
&lsquo;foo.cdl&rsquo;, generate an equivalent binary netCDF
file named &lsquo;x.nc&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncgen3 -o x.nc foo.cdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the CDL file
&lsquo;foo.cdl&rsquo;, generate a C program containing the
netCDF function invocations necessary to create an
equivalent binary netCDF file named &lsquo;x.nc&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ncgen3 -c -o x.nc foo.cdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
CDL Syntax Summary <br>
Below is an example of CDL syntax, describing a netCDF file
with several named dimensions (lat, lon, and time),
variables (Z, t, p, rh, lat, lon, time), variable attributes
<br>
(units, long_name, valid_range, _FillValue), and some data.
CDL keywords are in boldface. (This example is intended to
illustrate the syntax; a real CDL file would have a more
<br>
complete set of attributes so that the data would be more
completely self-describing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netcdf foo { // an example
netCDF specification in CDL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dimensions: <br>
lat = 10, lon = 5, time = unlimited ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variables: <br>
long lat(lat), lon(lon), time(time); <br>
float Z(time,lat,lon), t(time,lat,lon); <br>
double p(time,lat,lon); <br>
long rh(time,lat,lon);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// variable attributes <br>
lat:long_name = &quot;latitude&quot;; <br>
lat:units = &quot;degrees_north&quot;; <br>
lon:long_name = &quot;longitude&quot;; <br>
lon:units = &quot;degrees_east&quot;; <br>
time:units = &quot;seconds since 1992-1-1 00:00:00&quot;;
<br>
Z:units = &quot;geopotential meters&quot;; <br>
Z:valid_range = 0., 5000.; <br>
p:_FillValue = -9999.; <br>
rh:_FillValue = -1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data: <br>
lat = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90; <br>
lon = -140, -118, -96, -84, -52; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All CDL statements are
terminated by a semicolon. Spaces, tabs, and newlines can be
used freely for readability. Comments may follow the
characters &lsquo;//&rsquo; on any line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A CDL description consists of
three optional parts: dimensions, variables, and data,
beginning with the keyword dimensions:, variables:, and
data, respectively. The variable <br>
part may contain variable declarations and attribute
assignments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A netCDF dimension is used to
define the shape of one or more of the multidimensional
variables contained in the netCDF file. A netCDF dimension
has a name and a size. At most <br>
one dimension in a netCDF file can have the unlimited size,
which means a variable using this dimension can grow to any
length (like a record number in a file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variable represents a
multidimensional array of values of the same type. A
variable has a name, a data type, and a shape described by
its list of dimensions. Each variable <br>
may also have associated attributes (see below) as well as
data values. The name, data type, and shape of a variable
are specified by its declaration in the variable section of
<br>
a CDL description. A variable may have the same name as a
dimension; by convention such a variable is one-dimensional
and contains coordinates of the dimension it names.
Dimen&acirc; <br>
sions need not have corresponding variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A netCDF attribute contains
information about a netCDF variable or about the whole
netCDF dataset. Attributes are used to specify such
properties as units, special values, maxi&acirc; <br>
mum and minimum valid values, scaling factors, offsets, and
parameters. Attribute information is represented by single
values or arrays of values. For example, &quot;units&quot;
is an <br>
attribute represented by a character array such as
&quot;celsius&quot;. An attribute has an associated
variable, a name, a data type, a length, and a value. In
contrast to variables that <br>
are intended for data, attributes are intended for metadata
(data about data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In CDL, an attribute is
designated by a variable and attribute name, separated by
&lsquo;:&rsquo;. It is possible to assign global attributes
not associated with any variable to the netCDF <br>
as a whole by using &lsquo;:&rsquo; before the attribute
name. The data type of an attribute in CDL is derived from
the type of the value assigned to it. The length of an
attribute is the <br>
number of data values assigned to it, or the number of
characters in the character string assigned to it. Multiple
values are assigned to non-character attributes by
separating <br>
the values with commas. All values assigned to an attribute
must be of the same type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names for CDL dimensions,
variables, and attributes must begin with an alphabetic
character or &lsquo;_&rsquo;, and subsequent characters may
be alphanumeric or &lsquo;_&rsquo; or &lsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional data section of a
CDL specification is where netCDF variables may be
initialized. The syntax of an initialization is simple: a
variable name, an equals sign, and a <br>
comma-delimited list of constants (possibly separated by
spaces, tabs and newlines) terminated with a semicolon. For
multi-dimensional arrays, the last dimension varies fastest.
<br>
Thus row-order rather than column order is used for
matrices. If fewer values are supplied than are needed to
fill a variable, it is extended with a type-dependent
&lsquo;fill value&rsquo;, <br>
which can be overridden by supplying a value for a
distinguished variable attribute named
&lsquo;_FillValue&rsquo;. The types of constants need not
match the type declared for a variable; <br>
coercions are done to convert integers to floating point,
for example. The constant &lsquo;_&rsquo; can be used to
designate the fill value for a variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Primitive Data Types <br>
char characters <br>
byte 8-bit data <br>
short 16-bit signed integers <br>
long 32-bit signed integers <br>
int (synonymous with long) <br>
float IEEE single precision floating point (32 bits) <br>
real (synonymous with float) <br>
double IEEE double precision floating point (64 bits)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for the added data-type
byte and the lack of unsigned, CDL supports the same
primitive data types as C. The names for the primitive data
types are reserved words in CDL, <br>
so the names of variables, dimensions, and attributes must
not be type names. In declarations, type names may be
specified in either upper or lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bytes differ from characters in
that they are intended to hold a full eight bits of data,
and the zero byte has no special significance, as it does
for character data. ncgen3 <br>
converts byte declarations to char declarations in the
output C code and to the nonstandard BYTE declaration in
output Fortran code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shorts can hold values between
-32768 and 32767. ncgen3 converts short declarations to
short declarations in the output C code and to the
nonstandard INTEGER*2 declaration in <br>
output Fortran code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Longs can hold values between
-2147483648 and 2147483647. ncgen3 converts long
declarations to long declarations in the output C code and
to INTEGER declarations in output For&acirc; <br>
tran code. int and integer are accepted as synonyms for long
in CDL declarations. Now that there are platforms with
64-bit representations for C longs, it may be better to use
<br>
the int synonym to avoid confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floats can hold values between
about -3.4+38 and 3.4+38. Their external representation is
as 32-bit IEEE normalized single-precision floating point
numbers. ncgen3 converts <br>
float declarations to float declarations in the output C
code and to REAL declarations in output Fortran code. real
is accepted as a synonym for float in CDL declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Doubles can hold values between
about -1.7+308 and 1.7+308. Their external representation is
as 64-bit IEEE standard normalized double-precision floating
point numbers. ncgen3 <br>
converts double declarations to double declarations in the
output C code and to DOUBLE PRECISION declarations in output
Fortran code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDL Constants <br>
Constants assigned to attributes or variables may be of any
of the basic netCDF types. The syntax for constants is
similar to C syntax, except that type suffixes must be
append&acirc; <br>
ed to shorts and floats to distinguish them from longs and
doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A byte constant is represented
by a single character or multiple character escape sequence
enclosed in single quotes. For example, <br>
&rsquo;a&rsquo; // ASCII &lsquo;a&rsquo; <br>
&rsquo; &rsquo; // a zero byte <br>
&rsquo;0 // ASCII newline character <br>
&rsquo;33&rsquo; // ASCII escape character (33 octal) <br>
&rsquo;b&rsquo; // ASCII plus (2b hex) <br>
&rsquo;377&rsquo; // 377 octal = 255 decimal, non-ASCII</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character constants are enclosed
in double quotes. A character array may be represented as a
string enclosed in double quotes. The usual C string escape
conventions are hon&acirc; <br>
ored. For example <br>
&quot;a&quot; // ASCII &lsquo;a&rsquo; <br>
&quot;Two0ines0 // a 10-character string with two embedded
newlines <br>
&quot;a bell: 07&quot; // a string containing an ASCII bell
<br>
Note that the netCDF character array &quot;a&quot; would fit
in a one-element variable, since no terminating NULL
character is assumed. However, a zero byte in a character
array is inter&acirc; <br>
preted as the end of the significant characters by the
ncdump program, following the C convention. Therefore, a
NULL byte should not be embedded in a character string
unless at <br>
the end: use the byte data type instead for byte arrays that
contain the zero byte. NetCDF and CDL have no string type,
but only fixed-length character arrays, which may be
mul&acirc; <br>
ti-dimensional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short integer constants are
intended for representing 16-bit signed quantities. The form
of a short constant is an integer constant with an
&lsquo;s&rsquo; or &lsquo;S&rsquo; appended. If a short
con&acirc; <br>
stant begins with &lsquo;0&rsquo;, it is interpreted as
octal, except that if it begins with &lsquo;0x&rsquo;, it is
interpreted as a hexadecimal constant. For example: <br>
-2s // a short -2 <br>
0123s // octal <br>
0x7ffs //hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long integer constants are
intended for representing 32-bit signed quantities. The form
of a long constant is an ordinary integer constant, although
it is acceptable to append <br>
an optional &lsquo;l&rsquo; or &lsquo;L&rsquo;. If a long
constant begins with &lsquo;0&rsquo;, it is interpreted as
octal, except that if it begins with &lsquo;0x&rsquo;, it is
interpreted as a hexadecimal constant. Exam&acirc; <br>
ples of valid long constants include: <br>
-2 <br>
1234567890L <br>
0123 // octal <br>
0x7ff // hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating point constants of type
float are appropriate for representing floating point data
with about seven significant digits of precision. The form
of a float constant is the <br>
same as a C floating point constant with an &lsquo;f&rsquo;
or &lsquo;F&rsquo; appended. For example the following are
all acceptable float constants: <br>
-2.0f <br>
3.14159265358979f // will be truncated to less precision
<br>
1.f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating point constants of type
double are appropriate for representing floating point data
with about sixteen significant digits of precision. The form
of a double constant is <br>
the same as a C floating point constant. An optional
&lsquo;d&rsquo; or &lsquo;D&rsquo; may be appended. For
example the following are all acceptable double constants:
<br>
-2.0 <br>
3.141592653589793 <br>
1.0e-20 <br>
1.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The programs generated by ncgen3 when using the -c or -f use
initialization statements to store data in variables, and
will fail to produce compilable programs if you try to use
<br>
them for large datasets, since the resulting statements may
exceed the line length or number of continuation statements
permitted by the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The CDL syntax makes it easy to
assign what looks like an array of variable-length strings
to a netCDF variable, but the strings will simply be
concatenated into a single array <br>
of characters, since netCDF cannot represent an array of
variable-length strings in one netCDF variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NetCDF and CDL do not yet
support a type corresponding to a 64-bit integer.</p>
