<p>FIND(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
FIND(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
find &acirc; find files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
find [&acirc;H|&acirc;L] path... [operand_expression...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The find utility shall recursively descend the directory
hierarchy from each file specified by path, evaluating a
Boolean expression composed of the primaries described in
the <br>
OPERANDS section for each file encountered. Each path
operand shall be evaluated unaltered as it was provided,
including all trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters; all
pathnames for other <br>
files encountered in the hierarchy shall consist of the
concatenation of the current path operand, a &lt;slash&gt;
if the current path operand did not end in one, and the
filename rel&acirc; <br>
ative to the path operand. The relative portion shall
contain no dot or dot-dot components, no trailing
&lt;slash&gt; characters, and only single &lt;slash&gt;
characters between pathname <br>
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The find utility shall be able
to descend to arbitrary depths in a file hierarchy and shall
not fail due to path length limitations (unless a path
operand specified by the appli&acirc; <br>
cation exceeds {PATH_MAX} requirements).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The find utility shall detect
infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited
directory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered.
When it detects an infinite <br>
loop, find shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy
or terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file is removed from or
added to the directory hierarchy being searched it is
unspecified whether or not find includes that file in its
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The find utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;H Cause the file
information and file type evaluated for each symbolic link
encountered as a path operand on the command line to be
those of the file referenced by the <br>
link, and not the link itself. If the referenced file does
not exist, the file information and type shall be for the
link itself. File information and type for symbolic <br>
links encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy
shall be that of the link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L Cause the file
information and file type evaluated for each symbolic link
encountered as a path operand on the command line or
encountered during the traversal of a <br>
file hierarchy to be those of the file referenced by the
link, and not the link itself. If the referenced file does
not exist, the file information and type shall be <br>
for the link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
mutually-exclusive options &acirc;H and &acirc;L shall not
be considered an error. The last option specified shall
determine the behavior of the utility. If <br>
neither the &acirc;H nor the &acirc;L option is specified,
then the file information and type for symbolic links
encountered as a path operand on the command line or
encountered during the <br>
traversal of a file hierarchy shall be that of the link
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first operand and subsequent
operands up to but not including the first operand that
starts with a &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, or is a &rsquo;!&rsquo;
or a &rsquo;(&rsquo;, shall be interpreted as path operands.
If the <br>
first operand starts with a &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, or is a
&rsquo;!&rsquo; or a &rsquo;(&rsquo;, the behavior is
unspecified. Each path operand is a pathname of a starting
point in the file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first operand that starts
with a &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, or is a &rsquo;!&rsquo; or a
&rsquo;(&rsquo;, and all subsequent arguments shall be
interpreted as an expression made up of the following
primaries and opera&acirc; <br>
tors. In the descriptions, wherever n is used as a primary
argument, it shall be interpreted as a decimal integer
optionally preceded by a plus (&rsquo;+&rsquo;) or
minus-sign (&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;) sign, as <br>
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+n More than n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Exactly n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n Less than n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following primaries shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;name pattern <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of the
current pathname matches pattern using the pattern matching
notation described in Section 2.13, Pattern Match&acirc;
<br>
ing Notation. The additional rules in Section 2.13.3,
Patterns Used for Filename Expansion do not apply as this is
a matching operation, not an expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;path pattern <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the current pathname
matches pattern using the pattern matching notation
described in Section 2.13, Pattern Matching Notation. <br>
The additional rules in Section 2.13.3, Patterns Used for
Filename Expansion do not apply as this is a matching
operation, not an expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;nouser The primary shall
evaluate as true if the file belongs to a user ID for which
the getpwuid() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 (or equiv&acirc; <br>
alent) returns NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;nogroup The primary shall
evaluate as true if the file belongs to a group ID for which
the getgrgid() function defined in the System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 (or <br>
equivalent) returns NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;xdev The primary shall
always evaluate as true; it shall cause find not to continue
descending past directories that have a different device ID
(st_dev, see the stat() func&acirc; <br>
tion defined in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008). If any &acirc;xdev primary is
specified, it shall apply to the entire expression even if
the &acirc;xdev primary <br>
would not normally be evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;prune The primary shall
always evaluate as true; it shall cause find not to descend
the current pathname if it is a directory. If the
&acirc;depth primary is specified, the &acirc;prune <br>
primary shall have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;perm [&acirc;]mode <br>
The mode argument is used to represent file mode bits. It
shall be identical in format to the symbolic_mode operand
described in chmod, and shall be interpreted as fol&acirc;
<br>
lows. To start, a template shall be assumed with all file
mode bits cleared. An op symbol of &rsquo;+&rsquo; shall set
the appropriate mode bits in the template;
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; shall clear <br>
the appropriate bits; &rsquo;=&rsquo; shall set the
appropriate mode bits, without regard to the contents of the
file mode creation mask of the process. The op symbol of
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; cannot <br>
be the first character of mode; this avoids ambiguity with
the optional leading &lt;hyphen&gt;. Since the initial mode
is all bits off, there are not any symbolic modes that <br>
need to use &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; as the first
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &lt;hyphen&gt; is
omitted, the primary shall evaluate as true when the file
permission bits exactly match the value of the resulting
template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, if mode is prefixed
by a &lt;hyphen&gt;, the primary shall evaluate as true if
at least all the bits in the resulting template are set in
the file permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;perm [&acirc;]onum <br>
If the &lt;hyphen&gt; is omitted, the primary shall evaluate
as true when the file mode bits exactly match the value of
the octal number onum (see the description of the <br>
octal mode in chmod). Otherwise, if onum is prefixed by a
&lt;hyphen&gt;, the primary shall evaluate as true if at
least all of the bits specified in onum are set. In both
<br>
cases, the behavior is unspecified when onum exceeds
07777.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;type c The primary shall
evaluate as true if the type of the file is c, where c is
&rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;c&rsquo;, &rsquo;d&rsquo;,
&rsquo;l&rsquo;, &rsquo;p&rsquo;, &rsquo;f&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;s&rsquo; for block special file, character special
file, direc&acirc; <br>
tory, symbolic link, FIFO, regular file, or socket,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;links n The primary shall
evaluate as true if the file has n links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;user uname <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to
the user uname. If uname is a decimal integer and the
getpwnam() (or equivalent) function does not return a <br>
valid user name, uname shall be interpreted as a user
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;group gname <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs to
the group gname. If gname is a decimal integer and the
getgrnam() (or equivalent) function does not return a <br>
valid group name, gname shall be interpreted as a group
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;size n[c] <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the file size in
bytes, divided by 512 and rounded up to the next integer, is
n. If n is followed by the character &rsquo;c&rsquo;, the
size <br>
shall be in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;atime n The primary shall
evaluate as true if the file access time subtracted from the
initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder
discarded), is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;ctime n The primary shall
evaluate as true if the time of last change of file status
information subtracted from the initialization time, divided
by 86400 (with any remainder <br>
discarded), is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;mtime n The primary shall
evaluate as true if the file modification time subtracted
from the initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any
remainder discarded), is n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;exec utility_name
[argument ...] ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;exec utility_name
[argument ...] {} + <br>
The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated by a
&lt;semicolon&gt; or by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;. Only a
&lt;plus-sign&gt; that immediately follows an argument
containing only the <br>
two characters &quot;{}&quot; shall punctuate the end of the
primary expression. Other uses of the &lt;plus-sign&gt;
shall not be treated as special.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the primary expression is
punctuated by a &lt;semicolon&gt;, the utility utility_name
shall be invoked once for each pathname and the primary
shall evaluate as true if the <br>
utility returns a zero value as exit status. A utility_name
or argument containing only the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; shall be replaced by the current pathname. If
a util&acirc; <br>
ity_name or argument string contains the two characters
&quot;{}&quot;, but not just the two characters
&quot;{}&quot;, it is implementation-defined whether find
replaces those two charac&acirc; <br>
ters or uses the string without change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the primary expression is
punctuated by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, the primary shall always
evaluate as true, and the pathnames for which the primary is
evaluated shall be <br>
aggregated into sets. The utility utility_name shall be
invoked once for each set of aggregated pathnames. Each
invocation shall begin after the last pathname in the <br>
set is aggregated, and shall be completed before the find
utility exits and before the first pathname in the next set
(if any) is aggregated for this primary, but it is <br>
otherwise unspecified whether the invocation occurs before,
during, or after the evaluations of other primaries. If any
invocation returns a non-zero value as exit sta&acirc; <br>
tus, the find utility shall return a non-zero exit status.
An argument containing only the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; shall be replaced by the set of aggregated
pathnames, <br>
with each pathname passed as a separate argument to the
invoked utility in the same order that it was aggregated.
The size of any set of two or more pathnames shall be <br>
limited such that execution of the utility does not cause
the system&rsquo;s {ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more
than one argument containing the two characters
&quot;{}&quot; is <br>
present, the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current directory for the
invocation of utility_name shall be the same as the current
directory when the find utility was started. If the
utility_name names any of <br>
the special built-in utilities (see Section 2.14, Special
Built-In Utilities), the results are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;ok utility_name [argument
...] ; <br>
The &acirc;ok primary shall be equivalent to &acirc;exec,
except that the use of a &lt;plus-sign&gt; to punctuate the
end of the primary expression need not be supported, and
find shall <br>
request affirmation of the invocation of utility_name using
the current file as an argument by writing to standard error
as described in the STDERR section. If the <br>
response on standard input is affirmative, the utility shall
be invoked. Otherwise, the command shall not be invoked and
the value of the &acirc;ok operand shall be false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;print The primary shall
always evaluate as true; it shall cause the current pathname
to be written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;newer file <br>
The primary shall evaluate as true if the modification time
of the current file is more recent than the modification
time of the file named by the pathname file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;depth The primary shall
always evaluate as true; it shall cause descent of the
directory hierarchy to be done so that all entries in a
directory are acted on before the <br>
directory itself. If a &acirc;depth primary is not
specified, all entries in a directory shall be acted on
after the directory itself. If any &acirc;depth primary is
specified, it <br>
shall apply to the entire expression even if the
&acirc;depth primary would not normally be evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primaries can be combined
using the following operators (in order of decreasing
precedence):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( expression ) <br>
True if expression is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! expression <br>
Negation of a primary; the unary NOT operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression [&acirc;a] expression
<br>
Conjunction of primaries; the AND operator is implied by the
juxtaposition of two primaries or made explicit by the
optional &acirc;a operator. The second expression shall <br>
not be evaluated if the first expression is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression &acirc;o expression
<br>
Alternation of primaries; the OR operator. The second
expression shall not be evaluated if the first expression is
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no expression is present,
&acirc;print shall be used as the expression. Otherwise, if
the given expression does not contain any of the primaries
&acirc;exec, &acirc;ok, or &acirc;print, the given <br>
expression shall be effectively replaced by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( given_expression )
&acirc;print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;user, &acirc;group,
and &acirc;newer primaries each shall evaluate their
respective arguments only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the file type evaluated for
the current file is a symbolic link, the results of
evaluating the &acirc;perm primary are
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
If the &acirc;ok primary is used, the response shall be read
from the standard input. An entire line shall be read as the
response. Otherwise, the standard input shall not be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of find:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence
classes, and multi-character collating elements used in the
pattern matching notation for the &acirc;n option and <br>
in the extended regular expression defined for the yesexpr
locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE This variable
determines the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte
as opposed to multi-byte charac&acirc; <br>
ters in arguments), the behavior of character classes within
the pattern matching notation used for the &acirc;n option,
and the behavior of character classes within regular <br>
expressions used in the extended regular expression defined
for the yesexpr locale keyword in the LC_MESSAGES
category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale used to process affirmative responses,
and the locale used to affect the format and contents of
diagnostic messages and prompts written to standard <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the location of
the utility_name for the &acirc;exec and &acirc;ok
primaries, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 8, Environment Vari&acirc; <br>
ables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The &acirc;print primary shall cause the current pathnames
to be written to standard output. The format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s0, &lt;path&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The &acirc;ok primary shall write a prompt to standard error
containing at least the utility_name to be invoked and the
current pathname. In the POSIX locale, the last
non-&lt;blank&gt; in <br>
the prompt shall be &rsquo;?&rsquo;. The exact format used
is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the standard error
shall be used only for diagnostic messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All path operands were
traversed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
When used in operands, pattern matching notation,
&lt;semicolon&gt;, &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;, and
&lt;right-parenthesis&gt; characters are special to the
shell and must be quoted (see Section <br>
2.2, Quoting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bit that is traditionally
used for sticky (historically 01000) is specified in the
&acirc;perm primary using the octal number argument form.
Since this bit is not defined by this <br>
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, applications must not assume
that it actually refers to the traditional sticky bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following commands are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . <br>
find . &acirc;print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They both write out the entire
directory hierarchy from the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / &acirc;name tmp &acirc;o
&acirc;name &rsquo;*.xx&rsquo; &acirc;atime +7 &acirc;exec
rm {} ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removes all files named tmp or
ending in .xx that have not been accessed for seven or more
24-hour periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . &acirc;perm
&acirc;o+w,+s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints (&acirc;print is assumed)
the names of all files in or below the current directory,
with all of the file permission bits S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and
S_IWOTH set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . &acirc;name SCCS
&acirc;prune &acirc;o &acirc;print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recursively prints pathnames of
all files in the current directory and below, but skips
directories named SCCS and files in them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . &acirc;print &acirc;name
SCCS &acirc;prune</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">behaves as in the previous
example, but prints the names of the SCCS directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The following command is
roughly equivalent to the &acirc;nt extension to test:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ &acirc;n &quot;$(find file1
&acirc;prune &acirc;newer file2)&quot; ]; then <br>
printf %s\n &quot;file1 is newer than file2&quot; <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. The descriptions of
&acirc;atime, &acirc;ctime, and &acirc;mtime use the
terminology n &lsquo;&lsquo;86400 second periods
(days)&rsquo;&rsquo;. For example, a file accessed at 23:59
is selected by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . &acirc;atime &acirc;1
&acirc;print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">at 00:01 the next day (less than
24 hours later, not more than one day ago); the midnight
boundary between days has no effect on the 24-hour
calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. The following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . ! &acirc;name .
&acirc;prune &acirc;name &rsquo;*.old&rsquo; &acirc;exec sh
&acirc;c &rsquo;mv &quot;$@&quot; ../old/&rsquo; sh {} +</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">performs the same task as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv ./*.old ./.old ./.*.old
../old/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while avoiding an
&lsquo;&lsquo;Argument list too long&rsquo;&rsquo; error if
there are a large number of files ending with .old and
without running mv if there are no such files (and avoiding
&lsquo;&lsquo;No <br>
such file or directory&rsquo;&rsquo; errors if ./.old does
not exist or no files match ./*.old or ./.*.old).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternative:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . ! &acirc;name .
&acirc;prune &acirc;name &rsquo;*.old&rsquo; &acirc;exec mv
{} ../old/ ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is less efficient if there are
many files to move because it executes one mv command per
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. On systems configured to
mount removable media on directories under /media, the
following command searches the file hierarchy for files
larger than 100000 KB without search&acirc; <br>
ing any mounted removable media:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / &acirc;path /media
&acirc;prune &acirc;o &acirc;size +200000 &acirc;print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10. Except for the root
directory, and &quot;//&quot; on implementations where
&quot;//&quot; does not refer to the root directory, no
pattern given to &acirc;name will match a &lt;slash&gt;,
because trailing <br>
&lt;slash&gt; characters are ignored when computing the
basename of the file under evaluation. Given two empty
directories named foo and bar, the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find foo/// bar/// &acirc;name
foo &acirc;o &acirc;name &rsquo;bar?*&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints only the line
&quot;foo///&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The &acirc;a operator was retained as an optional operator
for compatibility with historical shell scripts, even though
it is redundant with expression concatenation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The descriptions of the
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; modifier on the mode and onum
arguments to the &acirc;perm primary agree with historical
practice on BSD and System V implementations. System V and
BSD doc&acirc; <br>
umentation both describe it in terms of checking additional
bits; in fact, it uses the same bits, but checks for having
at least all of the matching bits set instead of having <br>
exactly the matching bits set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exact format of the
interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature
of the contents of prompts are specified because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Implementations may desire
more descriptive prompts than those used on historical
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Since the historical prompt
strings do not terminate with &lt;newline&gt; characters,
there is no portable way for another program to interact
with the prompts of this utility via <br>
pipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore, an application using
this prompting option relies on the system to provide the
most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the
general guidelines specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;name file operand was
changed to use the shell pattern matching notation so that
find is consistent with other utilities using pattern
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;size operand refers
to the size of a file, rather than the number of blocks it
may occupy in the file system. The intent is that the
st_size field defined in the System <br>
Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 should be used, not
the st_blocks found in historical implementations. There are
at least two reasons for this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. In both System V and BSD,
find only uses st_size in size calculations for the operands
specified by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. (BSD uses
st_blocks only when processing the <br>
&acirc;ls primary.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Users usually think of file
size in terms of bytes, which is also the unit used by the
ls utility for the output from the &acirc;l option. (In both
System V and BSD, ls uses <br>
st_size for the &acirc;l option size field and uses
st_blocks for the ls &acirc;s calculations. This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not specify ls &acirc;s.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The descriptions of
&acirc;atime, &acirc;ctime, and &acirc;mtime were changed
from the SVID description of n
&lsquo;&lsquo;days&rsquo;&rsquo; to n being the result of
the integer division of the time difference in sec&acirc;
<br>
onds by 86400. The description is also different in terms of
the exact timeframe for the n case (versus the +n or
&acirc;n), but it matches all known historical
implementations. It <br>
refers to one 86400 second period in the past, not any time
from the beginning of that period to the current time. For
example, &acirc;atime 2 is true if the file was accessed any
time <br>
in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations do
not modify &quot;{}&quot; when it appears as a substring of
an &acirc;exec or &acirc;ok utility_name or argument string.
There have been numerous user requests for this <br>
extension, so this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 allows the
desired behavior. At least one recent implementation does
support this feature, but encountered several problems in
managing <br>
memory allocation and dealing with multiple occurrences of
&quot;{}&quot; in a string while it was being developed, so
it is not yet required behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming the presence of
&acirc;print was added to correct a historical pitfall that
plagues novice users, it is entirely upwards-compatible from
the historical System V find utility. <br>
In its simplest form (find directory), it could be confused
with the historical BSD fast find. The BSD developers agreed
that adding &acirc;print as a default expression was the
cor&acirc; <br>
rect decision and have added the fast find functionality
within a new utility called locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the &acirc;L
option was implemented using the primary &acirc;follow. The
&acirc;H and &acirc;L options were added for two reasons.
First, they offer a finer granularity of control and <br>
consistency with other programs that walk file hierarchies.
Second, the &acirc;follow primary always evaluated to true.
As they were historically really global variables that took
<br>
effect before the traversal began, some valid expressions
had unexpected results. An example is the expression
&acirc;print &acirc;o &acirc;follow. Because &acirc;print
always evaluates to true, the <br>
standard order of evaluation implies that &acirc;follow
would never be evaluated. This was never the case.
Historical practice for the &acirc;follow primary, however,
is not consistent. Some <br>
implementations always follow symbolic links on the command
line whether &acirc;follow is specified or not. Others
follow symbolic links on the command line only if
&acirc;follow is speci&acirc; <br>
fied. Both behaviors are provided by the &acirc;H and
&acirc;L options, but scripts using the current
&acirc;follow primary would be broken if the &acirc;follow
option is specified to work either way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the &acirc;L option
resolves all symbolic links and the &acirc;type l primary is
true for symbolic links that still exist after symbolic
links have been resolved, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find &acirc;L . &acirc;type
l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints a list of symbolic links
reachable from the current directory that do not resolve to
accessible files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A feature of SVR4&rsquo;s find
utility was the &acirc;exec primary&rsquo;s + terminator.
This allowed filenames containing special characters
(especially &lt;newline&gt; characters) to be grouped <br>
together without the problems that occur if such filenames
are piped to xargs. Other implementations have added other
ways to get around this problem, notably a &acirc;print0
primary <br>
that wrote filenames with a null byte terminator. This was
considered here, but not adopted. Using a null terminator
meant that any utility that was going to process
find&rsquo;s <br>
&acirc;print0 output had to add a new option to parse the
null terminators it would now be reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;&acirc;exec...{}+&quot; syntax adopted was a result of
IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted
that this is an incompatible change to IEEE Std
1003.2&acirc;1992. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple, the following command printed all files with a
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; after their name if they are regular
files, and a &rsquo;+&rsquo; otherwise:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / &acirc;type f &acirc;exec
echo {} &acirc; &rsquo;;&rsquo; &acirc;o &acirc;exec echo {}
+ &rsquo;;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The change invalidates usage
like this. Even though the previous standard stated that
this usage would work, in practice many did not support it
and the standard developers felt <br>
it better to now state that this was not allowable.</p>
