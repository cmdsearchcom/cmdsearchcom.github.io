<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ssh-keygen generates, manages and converts authentication
keys for ssh(1). ssh-keygen can create keys for use by SSH
protocol versions 1 and 2. Protocol 1 should not be used and
<br>
is only offered to support legacy devices. It suffers from a
number of cryptographic weaknesses and doesn&rsquo;t support
many of the advanced features available for protocol 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of key to be generated
is specified with the -t option. If invoked without any
arguments, ssh-keygen will generate an RSA key for use in
SSH protocol 2 connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh-keygen is also used to
generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman group exchange
(DH-GEX). See the MODULI GENERATION section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, ssh-keygen can be used
to generate and update Key Revocation Lists, and to test
whether given keys have been revoked by one. See the KEY
REVOCATION LISTS section for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally each user wishing to
use SSH with public key authentication runs this once to
create the authentication key in ~/.ssh/identity,
~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, <br>
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 or ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Additionally, the system
administrator may use this to generate host keys, as seen in
/etc/rc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally this program generates
the key and asks for a file in which to store the private
key. The public key is stored in a file with the same name
but &acirc;.pub&acirc; appended. The pro&acirc; <br>
gram also asks for a passphrase. The passphrase may be empty
to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an empty
passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length. A
<br>
passphrase is similar to a password, except it can be a
phrase with a series of words, punctuation, numbers,
whitespace, or any string of characters you want. Good
passphrases are <br>
10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or otherwise
easily guessable (English prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy
per character, and provides very bad passphrases), and <br>
contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and
non-alphanumeric characters. The passphrase can be changed
later by using the -p option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to recover a
lost passphrase. If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, a
new key must be generated and the corresponding public key
copied to other machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For RSA1 keys and keys stored in
the newer OpenSSH format, there is also a comment field in
the key file that is only for convenience to the user to
help identify the key. The <br>
comment can tell what the key is for, or whatever is useful.
The comment is initialized to &acirc;user@host&acirc; when
the key is created, but can be changed using the -c
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After a key is generated,
instructions below detail where the keys should be placed to
be activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A For each of the key types
(rsa1, rsa, dsa, ecdsa and ed25519) for which host keys do
not exist, generate the host keys with the default key file
path, an empty passphrase, <br>
default bits for the key type, and default comment. This is
used by /etc/rc to generate new host keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a rounds <br>
When saving a new-format private key (i.e. an ed25519 key or
any SSH protocol 2 key when the -o flag is set), this option
specifies the number of KDF (key derivation func&acirc; <br>
tion) rounds used. Higher numbers result in slower
passphrase verification and increased resistance to
brute-force password cracking (should the keys be
stolen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When screening DH-GEX candidates
( using the -T command). This option specifies the number of
primality tests to perform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Show the bubblebabble digest
of specified private or public key file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bits <br>
Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA
keys, the minimum size is 1024 bits and the default is 2048
bits. Generally, 2048 bits is considered suffi&acirc; <br>
cient. DSA keys must be exactly 1024 bits as specified by
FIPS 186-2. For ECDSA keys, the -b flag determines the key
length by selecting from one of three elliptic curve <br>
sizes: 256, 384 or 521 bits. Attempting to use bit lengths
other than these three values for ECDSA keys will fail.
Ed25519 keys have a fixed length and the -b flag will <br>
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C comment <br>
Provides a new comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Requests changing the comment
in the private and public key files. This operation is only
supported for RSA1 keys and keys stored in the newer OpenSSH
format. The program <br>
will prompt for the file containing the private keys, for
the passphrase if the key has one, and for the new
comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D pkcs11 <br>
Download the RSA public keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared
library pkcs11. When used in combination with -s, this
option indicates that a CA key resides in a PKCS#11 <br>
token (see the CERTIFICATES section for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E fingerprint_hash <br>
Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key
fingerprints. Valid options are: &acirc;md5&acirc; and
&acirc;sha256&acirc;. The default is
&acirc;sha256&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e This option will read a
private or public OpenSSH key file and print to stdout the
key in one of the formats specified by the -m option. The
default export format is <br>
&acirc;RFC4716&acirc;. This option allows exporting OpenSSH
keys for use by other programs, including several commercial
SSH implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F hostname <br>
Search for the specified hostname in a known_hosts file,
listing any occurrences found. This option is useful to find
hashed host names or addresses and may also be used <br>
in conjunction with the -H option to print found keys in a
hashed format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Specifies the filename of the key file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G output_file <br>
Generate candidate primes for DH-GEX. These primes must be
screened for safety (using the -T option) before use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Use generic DNS format when
printing fingerprint resource records using the -r
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Hash a known_hosts file. This
replaces all hostnames and addresses with hashed
representations within the specified file; the original
content is moved to a file with a <br>
.old suffix. These hashes may be used normally by ssh and
sshd, but they do not reveal identifying information should
the file&rsquo;s contents be disclosed. This option will
<br>
not modify existing hashed hostnames and is therefore safe
to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h When signing a key, create a
host certificate instead of a user certificate. Please see
the CERTIFICATES section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I certificate_identity <br>
Specify the key identity when signing a public key. Please
see the CERTIFICATES section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This option will read an
unencrypted private (or public) key file in the format
specified by the -m option and print an OpenSSH compatible
private (or public) key to std&acirc; <br>
out. This option allows importing keys from other software,
including several commercial SSH implementations. The
default import format is &acirc;RFC4716&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J num_lines <br>
Exit after screening the specified number of lines while
performing DH candidate screening using the -T option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j start_line <br>
Start screening at the specified line number while
performing DH candidate screening using the -T option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K checkpt <br>
Write the last line processed to the file checkpt while
performing DH candidate screening using the -T option. This
will be used to skip lines in the input file that have <br>
already been processed if the job is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Generate a KRL file. In this
mode, ssh-keygen will generate a KRL file at the location
specified via the -f flag that revokes every key or
certificate presented on the <br>
command line. Keys/certificates to be revoked may be
specified by public key file or using the format described
in the KEY REVOCATION LISTS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Prints the contents of one or
more certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Show fingerprint of specified
public key file. Private RSA1 keys are also supported. For
RSA and DSA keys ssh-keygen tries to find the matching
public key file and prints <br>
its fingerprint. If combined with -v, a visual ASCII art
representation of the key is supplied with the
fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M memory <br>
Specify the amount of memory to use (in megabytes) when
generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m key_format <br>
Specify a key format for the -i (import) or -e (export)
conversion options. The supported key formats are:
&acirc;RFC4716&acirc; (RFC 4716/SSH2 public or private key),
&acirc;PKCS8&acirc; (PEM <br>
PKCS8 public key) or &acirc;PEM&acirc; (PEM public key). The
default conversion format is &acirc;RFC4716&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N new_passphrase <br>
Provides the new passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n principals <br>
Specify one or more principals (user or host names) to be
included in a certificate when signing a key. Multiple
principals may be specified, separated by commas. Please
<br>
see the CERTIFICATES section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O option <br>
Specify a certificate option when signing a key. This option
may be specified multiple times. Please see the CERTIFICATES
section for details. The options that are valid <br>
for user certificates are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear Clear all enabled
permissions. This is useful for clearing the default set of
permissions so permissions may be added individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force-command=command <br>
Forces the execution of command instead of any shell or
command specified by the user when the certificate is used
for authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-agent-forwarding <br>
Disable ssh-agent(1) forwarding (permitted by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-port-forwarding <br>
Disable port forwarding (permitted by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-pty Disable PTY allocation
(permitted by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-user-rc <br>
Disable execution of ~/.ssh/rc by sshd(8) (permitted by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-x11-forwarding <br>
Disable X11 forwarding (permitted by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permit-agent-forwarding <br>
Allows ssh-agent(1) forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permit-port-forwarding <br>
Allows port forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permit-pty <br>
Allows PTY allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permit-user-rc <br>
Allows execution of ~/.ssh/rc by sshd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">permit-x11-forwarding <br>
Allows X11 forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source-address=address_list <br>
Restrict the source addresses from which the certificate is
considered valid. The address_list is a comma-separated list
of one or more address/netmask pairs in <br>
CIDR format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At present, no options are valid
for host keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Causes ssh-keygen to save
private keys using the new OpenSSH format rather than the
more compatible PEM format. The new format has increased
resistance to brute-force <br>
password cracking but is not supported by versions of
OpenSSH prior to 6.5. Ed25519 keys always use the new
private key format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P passphrase <br>
Provides the (old) passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Requests changing the
passphrase of a private key file instead of creating a new
private key. The program will prompt for the file containing
the private key, for the old <br>
passphrase, and twice for the new passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Test whether keys have been
revoked in a KRL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Silence ssh-keygen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R hostname <br>
Removes all keys belonging to hostname from a known_hosts
file. This option is useful to delete hashed hosts (see the
-H option above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r hostname <br>
Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named hostname
for the specified public key file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S start <br>
Specify start point (in hex) when generating candidate
moduli for DH-GEX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s ca_key <br>
Certify (sign) a public key using the specified CA key.
Please see the CERTIFICATES section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating a KRL, -s
specifies a path to a CA public key file used to revoke
certificates directly by key ID or serial number. See the
KEY REVOCATION LISTS section <br>
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T output_file <br>
Test DH group exchange candidate primes (generated using the
-G option) for safety.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t dsa | ecdsa | ed25519 | rsa |
rsa1 <br>
Specifies the type of key to create. The possible values are
&acirc;rsa1&acirc; for protocol version 1 and
&acirc;dsa&acirc;, &acirc;ecdsa&acirc;,
&acirc;ed25519&acirc;, or &acirc;rsa&acirc; for protocol
version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Update a KRL. When specified
with -k, keys listed via the command line are added to the
existing KRL rather than a new KRL being created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V validity_interval <br>
Specify a validity interval when signing a certificate. A
validity interval may consist of a single time, indicating
that the certificate is valid beginning now and expir&acirc;
<br>
ing at that time, or may consist of two times separated by a
colon to indicate an explicit time interval. The start time
may be specified as a date in YYYYMMDD format, a <br>
time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format or a relative time (to the
current time) consisting of a minus sign followed by a
relative time in the format described in the TIME FORMATS
<br>
section of sshd_config(5). The end time may be specified as
a YYYYMMDD date, a YYYYMMDDHHMMSS time or a relative time
starting with a plus character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:
&acirc;+52w1d&acirc; (valid from now to 52 weeks and one day
from now), &acirc;-4w:+4w&acirc; (valid from four weeks ago
to four weeks from now),
&acirc;20100101123000:20110101123000&acirc; <br>
(valid from 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2010 to 12:30 PM, January
1st, 2011), &acirc;-1d:20110101&acirc; (valid from yesterday
to midnight, January 1st, 2011).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Causes
ssh-keygen to print debugging messages about its progress.
This is helpful for debugging moduli generation. Multiple -v
options increase the ver&acirc; <br>
bosity. The maximum is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W generator <br>
Specify desired generator when testing candidate moduli for
DH-GEX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y This option will read a
private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key
to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z serial_number <br>
Specifies a serial number to be embedded in the certificate
to distinguish this certificate from others from the same
CA. The default serial number is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating a KRL, the -z
flag is used to specify a KRL version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULI GENERATION <br>
ssh-keygen may be used to generate groups for the
Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange (DH-GEX) protocol. Generating
these groups is a two-step process: first, candidate primes
are gen&acirc; <br>
erated using a fast, but memory intensive process. These
candidate primes are then tested for suitability (a
CPU-intensive process).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generation of primes is
performed using the -G option. The desired length of the
primes may be specified by the -b option. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ssh-keygen -G
moduli-2048.candidates -b 2048</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the search for
primes begins at a random point in the desired length range.
This may be overridden using the -S option, which specifies
a different start point (in <br>
hex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a set of candidates have
been generated, they must be screened for suitability. This
may be performed using the -T option. In this mode
ssh-keygen will read candidates from <br>
standard input (or a file specified using the -f option).
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ssh-keygen -T moduli-2048 -f
moduli-2048.candidates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, each candidate will
be subjected to 100 primality tests. This may be overridden
using the -a option. The DH generator value will be chosen
automatically for the prime <br>
under consideration. If a specific generator is desired, it
may be requested using the -W option. Valid generator values
are 2, 3, and 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screened DH groups may be
installed in /etc/gsissh/moduli. It is important that this
file contains moduli of a range of bit lengths and that both
ends of a connection share common <br>
moduli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CERTIFICATES <br>
ssh-keygen supports signing of keys to produce certificates
that may be used for user or host authentication.
Certificates consist of a public key, some identity
information, zero <br>
or more principal (user or host) names and a set of options
that are signed by a Certification Authority (CA) key.
Clients or servers may then trust only the CA key and verify
its <br>
signature on a certificate rather than trusting many
user/host keys. Note that OpenSSH certificates are a
different, and much simpler, format to the X.509
certificates used in <br>
ssl(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh-keygen supports two types of
certificates: user and host. User certificates authenticate
users to servers, whereas host certificates authenticate
server hosts to users. To <br>
generate a user certificate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key
-I key_id /path/to/user_key.pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resultant certificate will
be placed in /path/to/user_key-cert.pub. A host certificate
requires the -h option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key
-I key_id -h /path/to/host_key.pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The host certificate will be
output to /path/to/host_key-cert.pub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to sign using a
CA key stored in a PKCS#11 token by providing the token
library using -D and identifying the CA key by providing its
public half as an argument to <br>
-s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key.pub -D
libpkcs11.so -I key_id user_key.pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all cases, key_id is a
&quot;key identifier&quot; that is logged by the server when
the certificate is used for authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certificates may be limited to
be valid for a set of principal (user/host) names. By
default, generated certificates are valid for all users or
hosts. To generate a certificate <br>
for a specified set of principals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id
-n user1,user2 user_key.pub <br>
$ ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I key_id -h -n host.domain
host_key.pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional limitations on the
validity and use of user certificates may be specified
through certificate options. A certificate option may
disable features of the SSH session, may <br>
be valid only when presented from particular source
addresses or may force the use of a specific command. For a
list of valid certificate options, see the documentation for
the -O <br>
option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, certificates may be
defined with a validity lifetime. The -V option allows
specification of certificate start and end times. A
certificate that is presented at a time <br>
outside this range will not be considered valid. By default,
certificates are valid from UNIX Epoch to the distant
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For certificates to be used for
user or host authentication, the CA public key must be
trusted by sshd(8) or ssh(1). Please refer to those manual
pages for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY REVOCATION LISTS <br>
ssh-keygen is able to manage OpenSSH format Key Revocation
Lists (KRLs). These binary files specify keys or
certificates to be revoked using a compact format, taking as
little as <br>
one bit per certificate if they are being revoked by serial
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KRLs may be generated using the
-k flag. This option reads one or more files from the
command line and generates a new KRL. The files may either
contain a KRL specification (see <br>
below) or public keys, listed one per line. Plain public
keys are revoked by listing their hash or contents in the
KRL and certificates revoked by serial number or key ID (if
the <br>
serial is zero or not available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revoking keys using a KRL
specification offers explicit control over the types of
record used to revoke keys and may be used to directly
revoke certificates by serial number or key <br>
ID without having the complete original certificate on hand.
A KRL specification consists of lines containing one of the
following directives followed by a colon and some
direc&acirc; <br>
tive-specific information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">serial:
serial_number[-serial_number] <br>
Revokes a certificate with the specified serial number.
Serial numbers are 64-bit values, not including zero and may
be expressed in decimal, hex or octal. If two serial <br>
numbers are specified separated by a hyphen, then the range
of serial numbers including and between each is revoked. The
CA key must have been specified on the ssh-keygen <br>
command line using the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id: key_id <br>
Revokes a certificate with the specified key ID string. The
CA key must have been specified on the ssh-keygen command
line using the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key: public_key <br>
Revokes the specified key. If a certificate is listed, then
it is revoked as a plain public key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sha1: public_key <br>
Revokes the specified key by its SHA1 hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KRLs may be updated using the -u
flag in addition to -k. When this option is specified, keys
listed via the command line are merged into the KRL, adding

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible, given a
KRL, to test whether it revokes a particular key (or keys).
The -Q flag will query an existing KRL, testing each key
specified on the command line. <br>
If any key listed on the command line has been revoked (or
an error encountered) then ssh-keygen will exit with a
non-zero exit status. A zero exit status will only be
returned if <br>
no key was revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.ssh/identity <br>
Contains the protocol version 1 RSA authentication identity
of the user. This file should not be readable by anyone but
the user. It is possible to specify a passphrase <br>
when generating the key; that passphrase will be used to
encrypt the private part of this file using 3DES. This file
is not automatically accessed by ssh-keygen but it is <br>
offered as the default file for the private key. ssh(1) will
read this file when a login attempt is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/identity.pub <br>
Contains the protocol version 1 RSA public key for
authentication. The contents of this file should be added to
~/.ssh/authorized_keys on all machines where the user <br>
wishes to log in using RSA authentication. There is no need
to keep the contents of this file secret.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/id_dsa <br>
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa <br>
~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <br>
~/.ssh/id_rsa <br>
Contains the protocol version 2 DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA
authentication identity of the user. This file should not be
readable by anyone but the user. It is possible to <br>
specify a passphrase when generating the key; that
passphrase will be used to encrypt the private part of this
file using 128-bit AES. This file is not automatically <br>
accessed by ssh-keygen but it is offered as the default file
for the private key. ssh(1) will read this file when a login
attempt is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub <br>
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub <br>
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub <br>
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <br>
Contains the protocol version 2 DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA
public key for authentication. The contents of this file
should be added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on all <br>
machines where the user wishes to log in using public key
authentication. There is no need to keep the contents of
this file secret.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/gsissh/moduli <br>
Contains Diffie-Hellman groups used for DH-GEX. The file
format is described in moduli(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG <br>
The reseeding of the OpenSSL random generator is usually
done from /dev/urandom. If the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG
environment variable is set to value other than 0 the
OpenSSL <br>
random generator is reseeded from /dev/random. The number of
bytes read is defined by the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG value.
Minimum is 14 bytes. This setting is not recommended <br>
on the computers without the hardware random generator
because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be
blocked until enough entropy is available.</p>
