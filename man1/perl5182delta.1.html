PERL5182DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5182delta - what is new for perl v5.18.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.18.1
release and the 5.18.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read perl5181delta,
which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.18.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; B has been upgraded from version 1.42_01 to
1.42_02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fix for [perl #118525]
introduced a regression in the behaviour of
&quot;B::CV::GV&quot;, changing the return value from a
&quot;B::SPECIAL&quot; object on a &quot;NULL&quot;
&quot;CvGV&quot; to &quot;undef&quot;. <br>
&quot;B::CV::GV&quot; again returns a &quot;B::SPECIAL&quot;
object in this case. [perl #119413]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; B::Concise has
been upgraded from version 0.95 to 0.95_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This fixes a bug in dumping
unexpected SPECIALs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; English has been
upgraded from version 1.06 to 1.06_01. This fixes an error
about the performance of &quot;$&lsquo;&quot;, $&amp;, and
&quot;$&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; File::Glob has
been upgraded from version 1.20 to 1.20_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Changes to Existing Documentation <br>
&Acirc;&middot; perlrepository has been restored with a
pointer to more useful pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlhack has
been updated with the latest changes from blead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.1 introduced a regression along
with a bugfix for lexical subs. Some B::SPECIAL results from
B::CV::GV became undefs instead. This broke Devel::Cover
among other <br>
libraries. This has been fixed. [perl #119351]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.0
introduced a regression whereby &quot;[:^ascii:]&quot;, if
used in the same character class as other qualifiers, would
fail to match characters in the Latin-1 block. This <br>
has been fixed. [perl #120799]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.0
introduced a regression when using -&gt;SUPER::method with
AUTOLOAD by looking up AUTOLOAD from the current package,
rather than the current packageXs superclass. <br>
This has been fixed. [perl #120694]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.18.0
introduced a regression whereby &quot;-bareword&quot; was no
longer permitted under the &quot;strict&quot; and
&quot;integer&quot; pragmata when used together. This has
been fixed. [perl <br>
#120288]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Previously
PerlIOBase_dup didn&rsquo;t check if pushing the new layer
succeeded before (optionally) setting the utf8 flag. This
could cause segfaults-by-nullpointer. This has been <br>
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A buffer
overflow with very long identifiers has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression
from 5.16 in the handling of padranges led to assertion
failures if a keyword plugin declined to handle the second
XmyX, but only after creating a padop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This affected, at least,
Devel::CallParser under threaded builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The construct
&quot;$r=qr/.../; /$r/p&quot; is now handled properly, an
issue which had been worsened by changes 5.18.0. [perl
#118213]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.18.2 represents approximately 3 months of development
since Perl 5.18.1 and contains approximately 980 lines of
changes across 39 files from 4 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.18.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Craig A. Berry, David Mitchell,
Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
