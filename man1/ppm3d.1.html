<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppm3d - convert two PPM images into an anaglyph (red/blue 3d
glasses) PPM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppm3d [-color] [-offset=horizontal_offset] leftppmfile
rightppmfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated optional 3rd
argument: horizontal_offset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppm3d reads two PPM images as
input and produces a PPM as output, with the images
overlapping by the specified number of pixels in
blue-green/red format. The idea is that if you <br>
look at the image with 3-D glasses (glasses that admit only
red through one eye and only green or blue through the
other), you see an image with depth. This is called an <br>
anaglyph stereogram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppm3d can produce either of two
kinds of anaglyph stereogram: monochrome or color. Use the
-color option to choose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the monochrome version, ppm3d
ignores any color (actually, chrominance) in the input
images and produces a result which is monochrome. Viewed
through red-green glasses it is <br>
yellow, but without any other color in the field, your brain
tends to see it as grayscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the color version, ppm3d
generates a result which is close to the color of the
original. It&rsquo;s not great, though, due to the fact that
each eye necessarily cannot see the <br>
entire spectrum. Red and cyan don&rsquo;t work well, but
most other colors -- especially when heavily saturated --
come out quite well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To view a color anaglyph
stereogram, you need glasses with a left lens that admits
only red light and a right lens that admits only blue and
green light. (The right lens may be <br>
called a cyan lens because that is its pigment in white
light; don&rsquo;t be misled into thinking that cyan is the
only color that gets through it). Your brain is wired so
that even <br>
though the components of light are coming in through
different eyes, they mix in your brain to form the same
sensation as if you were looking at the combined light with
both <br>
eyes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input PPMs must be the same
dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make a different kind of
stereogram, use pamstereogram. That makes a stereogram that
you view without special glasses, just by letting your eyes
unfocus so that each eye sees <br>
different parts of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
The mandatory arguments are file names of the left and right
input images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional third argument
specifies the same thing as the value of the -offset
argument, but is deprecated because -offset is easier to use
and read. Before Netpbm 10.38 (March <br>
2007), this third argument is the only way to specify the
offset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-offset=horizontal_offset <br>
This option indicates the amount, in pixels, by which the
left and image is offset to the right of the right image in
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of this option is to
move the entire image forward (positive numbers) or backward
(negative numbers). With a zero offset, the main subject of
the picture <br>
appears in the plane of the picture (i.e. if the image is
projected on a screen, the location of the screen). The main
subject is the subject at the location where the <br>
line of sight of the left camera intersects the line of
sight of the right camera -- the main subject appears at the
same location in both the left and right images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.38 (March 2007). Before that, use the third argument
instead. Also, before Netpbm 10.38 the default is +30
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-color This option causes ppm3d
to generate a color anaglyph stereogram. By default, it
generates monochrome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.38 (March 2007).</p>
