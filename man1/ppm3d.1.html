This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppm3d</b> reads two PPM images as input and produces a PPM as output, with
  the images overlapping by the specified number of pixels in blue-green/red
  format. The idea is that if you look at the image with 3-D glasses (glasses
  that admit only red through one eye and only green or blue through the other),
  you see an image with depth. This is called an anaglyph stereogram.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ppm3d</b> can produce either of two kinds of anaglyph stereogram: monochrome
  or color. Use the <b>-color</b> option to choose.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the monochrome version, <b>ppm3d</b> ignores any color (actually,
  chrominance) in the input images and produces a result which is monochrome.
  Viewed through red-green glasses it is yellow, but without any other color in
  the field, your brain tends to see it as grayscale.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the color version, <b>ppm3d</b> generates a result which is close to the
  color of the original. It's not great, though, due to the fact that each eye
  necessarily cannot see the entire spectrum. Red and cyan don't work well, but
  most other colors -- especially when heavily saturated -- come out quite well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To view a color anaglyph stereogram, you need glasses with a left lens that
  admits only red light and a right lens that admits only blue and green light.
  (The right lens may be called a cyan lens because that is its pigment in white
  light; don't be misled into thinking that cyan is the only color that gets
  through it). Your brain is wired so that even though the components of light
  are coming in through different eyes, they mix in your brain to form the same
  sensation as if you were looking at the combined light with both eyes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input PPMs must be the same dimensions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To make a different kind of stereogram, use <b>pamstereogram</b>. That makes a
  stereogram that you view without special glasses, just by letting your eyes
  unfocus so that each eye sees different parts of the image.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
The mandatory arguments are file names of the left and right input images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An optional third argument specifies the same thing as the value of the
  <b>-offset</b> argument, but is deprecated because -offset is easier to use
  and read. Before Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007), this third argument is the only
  way to specify the offset.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-offset=</b><i>horizontal_offset</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option indicates the amount, in pixels, by which the
      left and image is offset to the right of the right image in the output.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The effect of this option is to move the entire image forward (positive
      numbers) or backward (negative numbers). With a zero offset, the main
      subject of the picture appears in the plane of the picture (i.e. if the
      image is projected on a screen, the location of the screen). The main
      subject is the subject at the location where the line of sight of the left
      camera intersects the line of sight of the right camera -- the main
      subject appears at the same location in both the left and right images.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Default is zero.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007). Before that, use the third
      argument instead. Also, before Netpbm 10.38 the default is +30 pixels.
