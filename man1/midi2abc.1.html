<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
midi2abc takes a MIDI format file and converts it to
something as close as possible to abc text format. The user
then has to add text fields not present in the MIDI header
and <br>
possibly tidy up the abc note output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of midi2abc is
printed to the screen. To save it to a file, use the
redirection operator, (e.g. midi2abc -f file.mid &gt;
file.abc) or specify the output file using the <br>
-o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use only one or none of the
options -u -gu, -b and -Q. Midi2abc normally converts the
MIDI time units into quantum units normally corresponding to
the abc 1/16th note or 1/32nd <br>
note. If none of these is present, the program will use the
PPQN information in the MIDI header to compute the suitable
conversion factor. For most MIDI files on the web, it is
<br>
recommended to rely on the MIDI header information and not
use any of the options other than the formatting
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will extract the
time signature information from the MIDI file if it is
present. Otherwise it will assume 4/4 or you could specify
it with -m. option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the tune has an anacrusis,
you can use either the -ga or -xa option to estimate the its
length. Alternatively, you can specify its value using the
-a option. The anacrusis is <br>
specified in half unit lengths, where the unit length is
defined by the L: field. For example if L: 1/8, then a
quarter note would be indicated by the value 4, (4 1/16
units).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a acbeats <br>
where acbeats specifies the anacrusis in half unit
lengths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xa extract the anacrusis from
file by finding the first strong note</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ga guess the anacrusis by
minimizing the number of ties across bars</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m time signature <br>
time signature</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bars <br>
number of bars wanted in output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q tempo <br>
tempo in quarter-notes per minute</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u pulses <br>
Allows you to specify directly the number of midi pulses per
abc time unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppu parts per abc unit length
<br>
Normally, the smallest note unit that midi2abc can extract
is half the L: unit length.This is called the quantum unit.
Thus for L: 1/8, midi2abc can extract 1/16 notes <br>
but not 1/32 notes. You can change this by specifying -ppu 4
for example. The number of parts should be a power of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aul denominator of abc unit
length <br>
Normally midi2abc chooses a unit length of 1/8 or 1/16
depending upon the time signature. For time signatures
smaller than 3/4 the L: 1/16 is used and for larger time
sig&acirc; <br>
natures L: 1/8 is used. You can specify the unit length to
be used using this parameter. Thus -aul 32 will cause
midi2abc to use a unit length of 1/32 nd note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gu Tells midi2abc to estimate
the number of midi pulses per abc time unit from the note
duration or spacing in the MIDI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gk Tells midi2abc to guess the
key signature by minimizing the number of accidentals even
if the key signature is already specified in the MIDI file.
By default the key sig&acirc; <br>
nature is the one specified in the MIDI file. If it is not
specified, then the program guesses the key signature by
minimizing accidentals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k key key signature: -6 to 6
sharps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c channel <br>
select only this midi channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f infile <br>
input file in midi format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output file <br>
specifies the output abc file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s do not discard very short
notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sr quantum units <br>
do not notate a short rest smaller than the specified size
after a note. If the size (in quantum units) is zero,
nothing is done. For larger values, the rest is absorbed
<br>
into the preceding note. In other words, the preceding note
is lengthened to include that rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sum print a short summary of
the input midi file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nb do not look for broken
rhythms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nt do not look for triplets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-obpl Print only one bar per
line instead of 4. For complex music this improves the
readability and avoids some problems with some abc to
postscript converters. This option is <br>
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nogr (No note grouping.)
Inserts a space between all notes. It makes a less pretty
postscript file but it is easier to edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bpl nbars <br>
Print nbars of music on every line followed by a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bps nbars <br>
When nbars have been printed (including those lines joined
by a backslash continuation) go to a new line (with no
backslash).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-splitbars <br>
This parameter changes the way midi2abc prints chords
composed of notes of unequal length (polyphonic chords).
Normally, midi2abc joins the longer notes to the notes in
<br>
the following chord using ties. A more readable output, can
be obtained if the measure is split into separate parts
using the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; feature in abc notation. The
algorithm <br>
for dividing the notes in a polyphonic chord to separate
voices (label_splits in midi2abc.c) needs some improvement.
I welcome any assistance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-splitvoices <br>
This parameter like above handles polyphonic chords by
splitting an entire voice into multi voices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-midigram <br>
When this option appears, all other options are ignored and
no abc file is produced. Instead a list of all notes in the
MIDI file are printed in a fixed format. Each line <br>
represents a pair of MIDI note on/off event. The line
contains the on/off time of the note, its track number,
channel number, midi pitch and midi velocity. The last
record <br>
indicates the duration of the MIDI file in MIDI pulse units.
The output is designed to go into a graphical user interface
which will produce a graphical representation <br>
(piano roll).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mftext <br>
When this option appears, all other options are ignored and
no abc file is produced. Instead a list of all the MIDI
commands are printed. The output is designed to go into <br>
a graphical user interface provided by runabc.tcl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-title string <br>
Replaces the default title field following T: with the given
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-origin string <br>
Adds an O: field with the given string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
* The key is chosen so as to minimize the number of
accidentals. Alternatively, the user can specify the key
numerically (a positive number is the number of sharps, a
negative <br>
number is minus the number of flats).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Note length can be set by
specifying the total number of bars or the tempo of the
piece. Alternatively the note length can be read from the
file. However, by default it is <br>
deduced in a heuristic manner from the inter-note distances.
This means that you do not have to use the MIDI clock as a
metronome when playing in a tune from a keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Barlines are automatically
inserted. The user specifies the number of measures in the
anacrusis before the first barline and the time
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program can guess how the
length of the anacrusis, either by looking for the first
strong note or minimizing the number of notes split by a tie
across a barline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Where a note extends beyond a
bar break, it is split into two tied notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The output has 4 bars per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Enough accidental signs are
put in the music to ensure that no pitch errors occur if a
barline is added or deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The program attempts to group
notes sensibly in each bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Triplets and broken rhythm
(a&gt;b) are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Chords are identified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Text information from the
original MIDI file is included as comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -c option can be used to
select only 1 MIDI channel. Events on other channels are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
midi2abc does not ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Supply tune title, composer or
any other field apart from X: , K:, Q:, M: and L: - these
must be added by hand afterwards, though they may have been
included in the text of the <br>
MIDI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Support duplets, quadruplets,
other esoteric features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Support mid-tune key or time
signature changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Deduce repeats. The output is
just the notes in the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Recover an abc tune as
supplied to abc2midi. However, if you want to do this,
&quot;midi2abc -xa -f file.mid&quot; comes close.</p>
