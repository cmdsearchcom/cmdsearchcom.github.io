<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program does surgical and filtering operations on Subversion dump files.
  While it is is not as flexible as <b>reposurgeon</b>(1), it can perform
  Subversion-specific transformations that reposurgeon cannot, and can be useful
  for processing Subversion repositories into a form suitable for conversion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(As a matter of possible historical interest, the reason for the partial
  functional overlap between repocutter and reposurgeon is that repocutter was
  first written earlier and became a testbed for some of the design concepts in
  reposurgeon. After reposurgeon was written, the author learned that it could
  not naturally support some useful operations very specific to Subversion, and
  enhanced repocutter to do those.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In all commands, the -r (or --range) option limits the selection of revisions
  over which an operation will be performed. A selection consists of one or more
  comma-separated ranges. A range may consist of an integer revision number or
  the special name HEAD for the head revision. Or it may be a colon-separated
  pair of integers, or an integer followed by a colon followed by HEAD.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally, each subcommand produces a progress spinner on standard error; each
  turn means another revision has been filtered. The -q (or --quiet) option
  suppresses this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generally, if you need to use this program at all, you will find that you need
  to pipe your dump file through multiple instances of it doing one kind of
  operation each. This is not as expensive as it sounds; with the exception of
  the reduce subcommand, the working set of this program is bounded by the size
  of the largest commit metadata item. It does not need to hold the entire repo
  metadata in memory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following subcommands are available:
<div class="Pp"></div>
help
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Without arguments, list available commands.
  With a command-name argument, show detailed help for that subcommand.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
select
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The 'select' subcommand selects a range and
  permits only revisions in that range to pass to standard output. A range
  beginning with 0 includes the dumpfile header.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
propset
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Set a property to a value. May be restricted
  by a revision selection. You may specify multiple property settings. See the
  embedded help for syntax details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
propdel
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Delete the named property. May be restricted
  by a revision selection. You may specify multiple properties to be deleted.
  See the embedded help for syntax details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
proprename
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Rename a property. May be restricted by a
  revision selection. You may specify multiple properties to be renamed. See the
  embedded help for syntax details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
log
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">enerate a log report, same format as the
  output of svn log on a repository, to standard output.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
setlog
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Replace the log entries in the input dumpfile
  with the corresponding entries in a specified file, which should be in the
  format of an svn log output. Replacements may be restricted to a specified
  range. See the embedded help for syntax details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
squash
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The 'squash' subcommand merges adjacent
  commits that have the same author and log text and were made within 5 minutes
  of each other. This can be helpful in cleaning up after migrations from
  file-oriented revision control systems, or if a developer has been using a
  pre-2006 version of Emacs VC. See the embedded help for syntax details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
strip
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Replace content with unique generated cookies
  on all node paths matching the specified regular expressions; if no
  expressions are given, match all paths. Useful when you need to examine a
  particularly complex node structure.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
expunge
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Delete all operations with Node-path headers
  matching specified Python regular expressions. Any revision left with no Node
  records after this filtering has its Revision record removed as well.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
pathrename
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Modify Node-path and Node-copyfrom-path
  headers matching a specified Python regular expression; replace with a given
  string. The string may contain Python backreferences to parenthesized portions
  of the pattern. See the embedded help for syntax details.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
renumber
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Renumber all revisions, patching Node-copyfrom
  headers as required. Any selection option is ignored. Takes no
  arguments.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
reduce
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Strip revisions out of a dump so the only
  parts left those likely to be relevant to a conversion problem. See the
  embedded help for syntax details and the relevance filter.</div>

Under the name &#x201C;snvcutter&#x201D;, an ancestor of this program traveled
  in the contrib/ director of the Subversion distribution. It had functional
  overlap with <b>reposurgeon</b>(1) because it was directly ancestral to that
  code. It was moved to the <b>reposurgeon</b>(1) distribution in January 2016.

Suppose you have a Subversion repository with the following semi-pathological
  structure:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
Directory1/ (with unrelated content)
Directory2/ (with unrelated content)
TheDirIWantToMigrate/
                branches/
                               crazy-feature/
                                               UnrelatedApp1/
                                               TheAppIWantToMigrate/
                tags/
                               v1.001/
                                               UnrelatedApp1/
                                               UnrelatedApp2/
                                               TheAppIWantToMigrate/
                trunk/
                               UnrelatedApp1/
                               UnrelatedApp2/
                               TheAppIWantToMigrate/
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You want to transform the dump file so that TheAppIWantToMigrate can be subject
  to a regular branchy lift. A way to dissect out the code of interest would be
  with the following series of filters applied:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
repocutter expunge '^Directory1' '^Directory2'
repocutter pathrename '^TheDirIWantToMigrate/' ''
repocutter expunge '^branches/crazy-feature/UnrelatedApp1/
repocutter pathrename 'branches/crazy-feature/TheAppIWantToMigrate/' 'branches/crazy-feature/'
repocutter expunge '^tags/v1.001/UnrelatedApp1/'
repocutter expunge '^tags/v1.001/UnrelatedApp2/'
repocutter pathrename '^tags/v1.001/TheAppIWantToMigrate/' 'tags/v1.001/'
repocutter expunge '^trunk/UnrelatedApp1/'
repocutter expunge '^trunk/UnrelatedApp2/'
repocutter pathrename '^trunk/TheAppIWantToMigrate/' 'trunk/'
</pre>
