<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
repocutter - surgical and filtering operations on Subversion
dump files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
repocutter [-q] [-r selection] subcommand</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program does surgical and filtering operations on
Subversion dump files. While it is is not as flexible as
reposurgeon(1), it can perform Subversion-specific
transformations <br>
that reposurgeon cannot, and can be useful for processing
Subversion repositories into a form suitable for
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(As a matter of possible
historical interest, the reason for the partial functional
overlap between repocutter and reposurgeon is that
repocutter was first written earlier and <br>
became a testbed for some of the design concepts in
reposurgeon. After reposurgeon was written, the author
learned that it could not naturally support some useful
operations very <br>
specific to Subversion, and enhanced repocutter to do
those.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all commands, the -r (or
--range) option limits the selection of revisions over which
an operation will be performed. A selection consists of one
or more comma-separated <br>
ranges. A range may consist of an integer revision number or
the special name HEAD for the head revision. Or it may be a
colon-separated pair of integers, or an integer followed
<br>
by a colon followed by HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, each subcommand
produces a progress spinner on standard error; each turn
means another revision has been filtered. The -q (or
--quiet) option suppresses this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generally, if you need to use
this program at all, you will find that you need to pipe
your dump file through multiple instances of it doing one
kind of operation each. This is <br>
not as expensive as it sounds; with the exception of the
reduce subcommand, the working set of this program is
bounded by the size of the largest commit metadata item. It
does <br>
not need to hold the entire repo metadata in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following subcommands are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Without arguments, list available commands. With a
command-name argument, show detailed help for that
subcommand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select <br>
The &rsquo;select&rsquo; subcommand selects a range and
permits only revisions in that range to pass to standard
output. A range beginning with 0 includes the dumpfile
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">propset <br>
Set a property to a value. May be restricted by a revision
selection. You may specify multiple property settings. See
the embedded help for syntax details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">propdel <br>
Delete the named property. May be restricted by a revision
selection. You may specify multiple properties to be
deleted. See the embedded help for syntax details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proprename <br>
Rename a property. May be restricted by a revision
selection. You may specify multiple properties to be
renamed. See the embedded help for syntax details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log <br>
enerate a log report, same format as the output of svn log
on a repository, to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setlog <br>
Replace the log entries in the input dumpfile with the
corresponding entries in a specified file, which should be
in the format of an svn log output. Replacements may be <br>
restricted to a specified range. See the embedded help for
syntax details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">squash <br>
The &rsquo;squash&rsquo; subcommand merges adjacent commits
that have the same author and log text and were made within
5 minutes of each other. This can be helpful in cleaning up
after <br>
migrations from file-oriented revision control systems, or
if a developer has been using a pre-2006 version of Emacs
VC. See the embedded help for syntax details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strip <br>
Replace content with unique generated cookies on all node
paths matching the specified regular expressions; if no
expressions are given, match all paths. Useful when you need
<br>
to examine a particularly complex node structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expunge <br>
Delete all operations with Node-path headers matching
specified Python regular expressions. Any revision left with
no Node records after this filtering has its Revision <br>
record removed as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pathrename <br>
Modify Node-path and Node-copyfrom-path headers matching a
specified Python regular expression; replace with a given
string. The string may contain Python backreferences to <br>
parenthesized portions of the pattern. See the embedded help
for syntax details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">renumber <br>
Renumber all revisions, patching Node-copyfrom headers as
required. Any selection option is ignored. Takes no
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reduce <br>
Strip revisions out of a dump so the only parts left those
likely to be relevant to a conversion problem. See the
embedded help for syntax details and the relevance
filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Under the name &acirc;snvcutter&acirc;, an ancestor of this
program traveled in the contrib/ director of the Subversion
distribution. It had functional overlap with reposurgeon(1)
because it <br>
was directly ancestral to that code. It was moved to the
reposurgeon(1) distribution in January 2016.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
reposurgeon(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Suppose you have a Subversion repository with the following
semi-pathological structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory1/ (with unrelated
content) <br>
Directory2/ (with unrelated content) <br>
TheDirIWantToMigrate/ <br>
branches/ <br>
crazy-feature/ <br>
UnrelatedApp1/ <br>
TheAppIWantToMigrate/ <br>
tags/ <br>
v1.001/ <br>
UnrelatedApp1/ <br>
UnrelatedApp2/ <br>
TheAppIWantToMigrate/ <br>
trunk/ <br>
UnrelatedApp1/ <br>
UnrelatedApp2/ <br>
TheAppIWantToMigrate/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You want to transform the dump
file so that TheAppIWantToMigrate can be subject to a
regular branchy lift. A way to dissect out the code of
interest would be with the following <br>
series of filters applied:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repocutter expunge
&rsquo;^Directory1&rsquo; &rsquo;^Directory2&rsquo; <br>
repocutter pathrename &rsquo;^TheDirIWantToMigrate/&rsquo;
&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
repocutter expunge
&rsquo;^branches/crazy-feature/UnrelatedApp1/ <br>
repocutter pathrename
&rsquo;branches/crazy-feature/TheAppIWantToMigrate/&rsquo;
&rsquo;branches/crazy-feature/&rsquo; <br>
repocutter expunge &rsquo;^tags/v1.001/UnrelatedApp1/&rsquo;
<br>
repocutter expunge &rsquo;^tags/v1.001/UnrelatedApp2/&rsquo;
<br>
repocutter pathrename
&rsquo;^tags/v1.001/TheAppIWantToMigrate/&rsquo;
&rsquo;tags/v1.001/&rsquo; <br>
repocutter expunge &rsquo;^trunk/UnrelatedApp1/&rsquo; <br>
repocutter expunge &rsquo;^trunk/UnrelatedApp2/&rsquo; <br>
repocutter pathrename
&rsquo;^trunk/TheAppIWantToMigrate/&rsquo;
&rsquo;trunk/&rsquo;</p>
