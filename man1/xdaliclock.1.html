<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xdaliclock - melting digital clock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xdaliclock [-toolkitoption ...] [-option ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xdaliclock program displays a digital clock; when a
digit changes, it &lsquo;&lsquo;melts&rsquo;&rsquo; into its
new shape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program was inspired by the
Alto and Macintosh programs of the same name, written by
Steve Capps in 1983 or 1984.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
xdaliclock accepts all of the standard toolkit options, and
also accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print a brief summary of
the allowed options on the standard error output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-12 Use a twelve hour clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-24 Use a twenty-four hour
clock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-seconds <br>
Update every second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noseconds <br>
Update once per minute; don&rsquo;t display seconds at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cycle Do color-cycling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocycle <br>
Don&rsquo;t do color-cycling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font fontname <br>
Specifies the X font to use; xdaliclock can correctly
animate any font that contains all the digits plus colon and
slash, and in which the letters aren&rsquo;t excessively
<br>
curly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xdaliclock program also
contains four builtin bitmapped fonts, which are larger and
more attractive than the standard X fonts. One of these
fonts will be used if the <br>
-font option is given one of the fontnames BUILTIN0,
BUILTIN1, BUILTIN2, or BUILTIN3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-builtin0 <br>
This is the same as specifying -font BUILTIN0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-builtin1 <br>
This is the same as specifying -font BUILTIN1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-builtin2 or -builtin <br>
This is the same as specifying -font BUILTIN2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-builtin3 <br>
This is the same as specifying -font BUILTIN3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fullscreen <br>
Make the window take up the whole screen. When -fullscreen
is specified, the displayed time will wander around a
little, to prevent any pixels from being on continuously
<br>
and causing phosphor burn-in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-root Display the clock on the
root window instead of in its own window. This makes the
digits wander around too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-window-id window <br>
Render the clock on a window created by some other
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-visual visual <br>
Specify which visual to use. Legal values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default Use the screen&rsquo;s
default visual (the visual of the root window.) This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">best Use the visual which
supports the most writable color cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class One of StaticGray,
StaticColor, TrueColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor, or
DirectColor. Selects the deepest visual of the given
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number A number (decimal or hex)
is interpreted as a visual id number, as reported by the
xdpyinfo(1) program; in this way you can select a shallower
visual if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t have a 24-bit
system, using a visual other than the default one may cause
colormap flashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transparent <br>
Causes the background of the window to be transparent, if
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the server supports overlay
planes, then they will be used (this is the case on SGIs,
and on certain HP, DEC, and IBM systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If overlay planes are not
available, but the server supports the Shape extension, then
that will be used instead. However, the Shape extension is
very inefficient: it <br>
will cause your X server to use up a lot of cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, if the Shape extension is
used, you will probably need to configure your window
manager to not put a titlebar on the XDaliClock window.
(This is the case at least <br>
with twm, tvtwm, and mwm.) If you don&rsquo;t do this, then
the window will flicker constantly, as the window manager
tries to add and remove the titlebar ten times each
sec&acirc; <br>
ond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None of these problems occur if
overlay planes are used (or if the -transparent option is
not requested.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nontransparent <br>
Don&rsquo;t make the window&rsquo;s background be
transparent. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memory low <br>
Use high-bandwidth, low-memory mode. If you have a very fast
connection between the machine this program is running on
and the X server it is displaying on, then xdali&acirc; <br>
clock can work correctly by simply making the drawing
requests it needs when it needs them. This is the elegant
method. However, the amount of data necessary to animate
<br>
the display ends up being a bit over 10 kilobytes worth of X
Protocol per second. On a fast machine with a local display,
or over a fast network, that&rsquo;s almost negligi&acirc;
<br>
ble, but (for example) an NCD X Terminal at 38.4 kbps
can&rsquo;t keep up. That is the reason for:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memory medium <br>
Use high-memory, low-bandwidth mode. In this mode,
xdaliclock precomputes most of the frames that it will ever
need. This is the sleazy copout method. The bandwidth <br>
requirements are drastically reduced, because instead of
telling the server what bits to draw where, it merely tells
it what pixmaps to copy into the window. Aside from <br>
the fact that I consider this to be cheating, the only
downside of this method is that those pixmaps (about 170 of
them, each the size of one character) are consuming <br>
server-memory. This probably isn&rsquo;t a very big deal,
unless you&rsquo;re using an exceptionally large font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memory high <br>
With memory set to high, the cache is twice as large (the n
-&gt; n+2 transitions are cached as well as the n -&gt; n+1
ones). Even with memory set to medium, this program can <br>
seem sluggish when using a large font over a very slow
connection to the display server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-countdown date <br>
Instead of displaying the current time, display a countdown
to the specified date (if the date has already passed, count
up from it.) The date can take two forms: either <br>
a time_t (an integer, the number of seconds past &quot;Jan 1
00:00:00 GMT 1970&quot;); or, a string of the form &quot;Mmm
DD HH:MM:SS YYYY&quot;, for example, &quot;Jan 1 00:00:00
2000&quot;. This <br>
string is interpreted in the local time zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To count up from the current
time, do this: <br>
xdaliclock -countdown &quot;&lsquo;date &rsquo;+%b %d %T
%Y&rsquo;&lsquo;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following standard X Toolkit
command line arguments are commonly used with
xdaliclock:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display host:dpy <br>
This option specifies the X server to contact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the
clock window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bg color <br>
This option specifies the color to use for the background of
the window. The default is
&lsquo;&lsquo;white.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fg color <br>
This option specifies the color to use for the foreground of
the window. The default is
&lsquo;&lsquo;black.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bd color <br>
This option specifies the color to use for the border of the
window. The default is the same as the foreground color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rv This option indicates that
reverse video should be simulated by swapping the foreground
and background colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bw number <br>
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border
surrounding the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xrm resourcestring <br>
This option specifies a resource string to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Clicking and holding any mouse button in the xdaliclock
window will cause it to display the date while the button is
held.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing
&lsquo;&lsquo;space&rsquo;&rsquo; at the xdaliclock window
will toggle between a twelve hour and twenty-four hour
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typing
&lsquo;&lsquo;q&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;^C&rsquo;&rsquo; at the window quits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the xdaliclock window is
iconified or otherwise unmapped, it will go to sleep until
it is mapped again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X RESOURCES <br>
xdaliclock understands all of the core resource names and
classes as well as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode (class Mode) <br>
Whether to display 12-hour or 24-hour time. If 12, this is
the same as the -12 command line argument; if 24, this is
the same as -24.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">datemode (class DateMode) <br>
Specifies how the date should be printed when a mouse button
is held down. This may be one of the strings mm/dd/yy,
dd/mm/yy, yy/mm/dd, yy/dd/mm, mm/yy/dd, or dd/yy/mm. <br>
The default is mm/dd/yy. If seconds are not being displayed,
then only the first four digits will ever be displayed
(mm/dd instead of mm/dd/yy, for example.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seconds (class Seconds) <br>
Whether to display seconds. If true, this is the same as the
-seconds command line argument; if false, this is the same
as -noseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cycle (class Cycle) <br>
Whether to do color cycling. If true, this is the same as
the -cycle command line argument; if false, this is the same
as -nocycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font (class Font) <br>
The same as the -font command line option: the font to melt.
If this is one of the strings BUILTIN0, BUILTIN1, BUILTIN2,
or BUILTIN3, then one of the large builtin fonts <br>
will be used. Otherwise, this must be the name of a valid X
font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fullScreen (class FullScreen)
<br>
The same as the -fullscreen command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">root (class Root) <br>
The same as the -root command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visualID (class VisualID) <br>
The same as the -visual command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transparent (class Transparent)
<br>
Whether to make the window&rsquo;s background be
transparent, if possible. If true, this is the same as the
-transparent command line argument; if false, this is the
same as <br>
-nontransparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory (class Memory) <br>
This must be high, medium, or low, the same as the -memory
command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">countdown (class Countdown) <br>
Same as the -countdown command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY <br>
to get the default host and display number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XENVIRONMENT <br>
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global
resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ to get the current time zone.
If you want to force the clock to display some other time
zone, set this variable before starting it. For example:
<br>
sh: TZ=GMT0 xdaliclock <br>
csh: ( setenv TZ PST8PDT ; xdaliclock ) <br>
You may notice that the format of the TZ variable (which is
used by the C library ctime(3) and localtime(3) routines) is
not actually documented anywhere. The fourth charac&acirc;
<br>
ter (the digit) is the only thing that really matters: it is
the offset in hours from GMT. The first three characters are
ignored. The last three characters are used to <br>
flag daylight savings time: their presence effectively adds
1 to the zone offset. (I am not making this up...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Other system load will sometimes cause the second-display to
increment by more than one second at a time, in order to
remain synchronized to the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -memory option is disgusting
and shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary, but I&rsquo;m not clever
enough to eliminate it. It has been said that hacking
graphics in X is like finding sqrt(pi) with <br>
roman numerals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using a small font (less
than 48x56 or so) it&rsquo;s possible that shipping a bitmap
to the server would be more efficient than sending a
DrawSegments request (since the end&acirc; <br>
points are specified using 16 bits each, when all that we
really need is 6 or 7 bits.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for the Shared Memory
Extension would be a good thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should display the day of the
week somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The color cycling should be less
predictable; it should vary saturation and intensity as
well, and should be more careful that foreground and
background contrast well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The correct default datemode
should be extracted from the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should have a -analog mode
(maybe someday...)</p>
