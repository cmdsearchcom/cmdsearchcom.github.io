<p>XPROP(1) General Commands Manual XPROP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xprop - property displayer for X</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xprop [-help] [-grammar] [-id id] [-root] [-name name]
[-frame] [-font font] [-display display] [-len n] [-notype]
[-fs file] [-remove property-name] [-set property-name
value] <br>
[-spy] [-f atom format [dformat]]* [format [dformat]
atom]*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUMMARY <br>
The xprop utility is for displaying window and font
properties in an X server. One window or font is selected
using the command line arguments or possibly in the case of
a win&acirc; <br>
dow, by clicking on the desired window. A list of properties
is then given, possibly with formatting information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-help Print out a summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grammar <br>
Print out a detailed grammar for all command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-id id This argument allows the
user to select window id on the command line rather than
using the pointer to select the target window. This is very
useful in debugging X <br>
applications where the target window is not mapped to the
screen or where the use of the pointer might be impossible
or interfere with the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name name <br>
This argument allows the user to specify that the window
named name is the target window on the command line rather
than using the pointer to select the target window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-font font <br>
This argument allows the user to specify that the properties
of font font should be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-root This argument specifies
that X&rsquo;s root window is the target window. This is
useful in situations where the root window is completely
obscured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display <br>
This argument allows you to specify the server to connect
to; see X(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-len n Specifies that at most n
bytes of any property should be read or displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notype Specifies that the type
of each property should not be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fs file <br>
Specifies that file file should be used as a source of more
formats for properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frame Specifies that when
selecting a window by hand (i.e. if none of -name, -root, or
-id are given), look at the window manager frame (if any)
instead of looking for the <br>
client window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remove property-name <br>
Specifies the name of a property to be removed from the
indicated window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-set property-name value <br>
Specifies the name of a property and a property value, to be
set on the indicated window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-spy Examine window properties
forever, looking for property change events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f name format [dformat] <br>
Specifies that the format for name should be format and that
the dformat for name should be dformat. If dformat is
missing, &quot; = $0+0 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
For each of these properties, its value on the selected
window or font is printed using the supplied formatting
information if any. If no formatting information is
supplied, <br>
internal defaults are used. If a property is not defined on
the selected window or font, &quot;not defined&quot; is
printed as the value for that property. If no property list
is given, <br>
all the properties possessed by the selected window or font
are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A window may be selected in one
of four ways. First, if the desired window is the root
window, the -root argument may be used. If the desired
window is not the root window, it <br>
may be selected in two ways on the command line, either by
id number such as might be obtained from xwininfo, or by
name if the window possesses a name. The -id argument
selects <br>
a window by id number in either decimal or hex (must start
with 0x) while the -name argument selects a window by
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last way to select a window
does not involve the command line at all. If none of -font,
-id, -name, and -root are specified, a crosshairs cursor is
displayed and the user is <br>
allowed to choose any visible window by pressing any pointer
button in the desired window. If it is desired to display
properties of a font as opposed to a window, the -font <br>
argument must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other than the above four
arguments and the -help argument for obtaining help, and the
-grammar argument for listing the full grammar for the
command line, all the other command <br>
line arguments are used in specifying both the format of the
properties to be displayed and how to display them. The -len
n argument specifies that at most n bytes of any given <br>
property will be read and displayed. This is useful for
example when displaying the cut buffer on the root window
which could run to several pages if displayed in full.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally each property name is
displayed by printing first the property name then its type
(if it has one) in parentheses followed by its value. The
-notype argument specifies <br>
that property types should not be displayed. The -fs
argument is used to specify a file containing a list of
formats for properties while the -f argument is used to
specify the <br>
format for one property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The formatting information for a
property actually consists of two parts, a format and a
dformat. The format specifies the actual formatting of the
property (i.e., is it made up <br>
of words, bytes, or longs?, etc.) while the dformat
specifies how the property should be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following paragraphs
describe how to construct formats and dformats. However, for
the vast majority of users and uses, this should not be
necessary as the built in defaults <br>
contain the formats and dformats necessary to display all
the standard properties. It should only be necessary to
specify formats and dformats if a new property is being
dealt <br>
with or the user dislikes the standard display format. New
users especially are encouraged to skip this part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A format consists of one of 0,
8, 16, or 32 followed by a sequence of one or more format
characters. The 0, 8, 16, or 32 specifies how many bits per
field there are in the prop&acirc; <br>
erty. Zero is a special case meaning use the field size
information associated with the property itself. (This is
only needed for special cases like type INTEGER which is
actu&acirc; <br>
ally three different types depending on the size of the
fields of the property.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A value of 8 means that the
property is a sequence of bytes while a value of 16 would
mean that the property is a sequence of words. The
difference between these two lies in the <br>
fact that the sequence of words will be byte swapped while
the sequence of bytes will not be when read by a machine of
the opposite byte order of the machine that originally <br>
wrote the property. For more information on how properties
are formatted and stored, consult the Xlib manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the size of the fields has
been specified, it is necessary to specify the type of each
field (i.e., is it an integer, a string, an atom, or what?)
This is done using one <br>
format character per field. If there are more fields in the
property than format characters supplied, the last character
will be repeated as many times as necessary for the <br>
extra fields. The format characters and their meaning are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a The field holds an atom
number. A field of this type should be of size 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b The field is an boolean. A 0
means false while anything else means true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c The field is an unsigned
number, a cardinal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i The field is a signed
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m The field is a set of bit
flags, 1 meaning on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The field is an array of
icons, packed as a sequence of 32 bit numbers consisting of
the width, height and ARGB pixel values, as defined for the
_NET_WM_ICON property in <br>
the Extended Window Manager Hints specification. A field of
this type must be of size 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s This field and the next ones
until either a 0 or the end of the property represent a
sequence of bytes. This format character is only usable with
a field size of 8 and is <br>
most often used to represent a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t This field and the next ones
until either a 0 or the end of the property represent an
internationalized text string. This format character is only
usable with a field size <br>
of 8. The string is assumed to be in an ICCCM compliant
encoding and is converted to the current locale encoding
before being output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u This field and the next ones
until either a 0 or the end of the property represent an
UTF-8 encoded unicode string. This format character is only
usable with a field size <br>
of 8. If the string is found to be an invalid character, the
type of encoding violation is printed instead, followed by
the string formatted using &rsquo;s&rsquo;. When in an
environ&acirc; <br>
ment not capable of displaying UTF-8 encoded string,
behaviour is identical to &rsquo;s&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x The field is a hex number
(like &rsquo;c&rsquo; but displayed in hex - most useful for
displaying window ids and the like)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example format is 32ica which
is the format for a property of three fields of 32 bits
each, the first holding a signed integer, the second an
unsigned integer, and the third <br>
an atom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of a dformat unlike
that of a format is not so rigid. The only limitations on a
dformat is that one may not start with a letter or a dash.
This is so that it can be <br>
distinguished from a property name or an argument. A dformat
is a text string containing special characters instructing
that various fields be printed at various points in a <br>
manner similar to the formatting string used by printf. For
example, the dformat &quot; is ( $0, $1 0 would render the
POINT 3, -4 which has a format of 32ii as &quot; is ( 3, -4
<br>
)0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any character other than a $, ?,
or a ( in a dformat prints as itself. To print out one of $,
?, or ( precede it by a . For example, to print out a $, use
Several <br>
special backslash sequences are provided as shortcuts. will
cause a newline to be displayed while will cause a tab to be
displayed. eo is an octal number will <br>
display character number o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A $ followed by a number n
causes field number n to be displayed. The format of the
displayed field depends on the formatting character used to
describe it in the corresponding <br>
format. I.e., if a cardinal is described by &rsquo;c&rsquo;
it will print in decimal while if it is described by a
&rsquo;x&rsquo; it is displayed in hex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the field is not present in
the property (this is possible with some properties),
&lt;field not available&gt; is displayed instead. $n+ will
display field number n then a comma <br>
then field number n+1 then another comma then ... until the
last field defined. If field n is not defined, nothing is
displayed. This is useful for a property that is a list of
<br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A ? is used to start a
conditional expression, a kind of if-then statement.
?exp(text) will display text if and only if exp evaluates to
non-zero. This is useful for two <br>
things. First, it allows fields to be displayed if and only
if a flag is set. And second, it allows a value such as a
state number to be displayed as a name rather than as just
<br>
a number. The syntax of exp is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exp ::= term | term=exp |
!exp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">term ::= n | $n | mn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ! operator is a logical
&lsquo;&lsquo;not&rsquo;&rsquo;, changing 0 to 1 and any
non-zero value to 0. = is an equality operator. Note that
internally all expressions are evaluated as 32 bit
num&acirc; <br>
bers so -1 is not equal to 65535. = returns 1 if the two
values are equal and 0 if not. n represents the constant
value n while $n represents the value of field number n. mn
<br>
is 1 if flag number n in the first field having format
character &rsquo;m&rsquo; in the corresponding format is 1,
0 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples: ?m3(count: $30
displays field 3 with a label of count if and only if flag
number 3 (count starts at 0!) is on.
?$2=0(True)?!$2=0(False) displays the inverted value <br>
of field 2 as a boolean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to display a property,
xprop needs both a format and a dformat. Before xprop uses
its default values of a format of 32x and a dformat of
&quot; = { $0+ }0, it searches <br>
several places in an attempt to find more specific formats.
First, a search is made using the name of the property. If
this fails, a search is made using the type of the
prop&acirc; <br>
erty. This allows type STRING to be defined with one set of
formats while allowing property WM_NAME which is of type
STRING to be defined with a different format. In this way,
<br>
the display formats for a given type can be overridden for
specific properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The locations searched are in
order: the format if any specified with the property name
(as in 8x WM_NAME), the formats defined by -f options in
last to first order, the contents <br>
of the file specified by the -fs option if any, the contents
of the file specified by the environmental variable
XPROPFORMATS if any, and finally xprop&rsquo;s built in file
of for&acirc; <br>
mats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the files referred
to by the -fs argument and the XPROPFORMATS variable is one
or more lines of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name format [dformat]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where name is either the name of
a property or the name of a type, format is the format to be
used with name and dformat is the dformat to be used with
name. If dformat is not <br>
present, &quot; = $0+0 is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To display the name of the root window: xprop -root
WM_NAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display the window manager
hints for the clock: xprop -name xclock WM_HINTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display the start of the cut
buffer: xprop -root -len 100 CUT_BUFFER0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display the point size of the
fixed font: xprop -font fixed POINT_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display all the properties of
window # 0x200007: xprop -id 0x200007</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set a simple string property:
xprop -root -format MY_ATOM_NAME 8s -set MY_ATOM_NAME
&quot;my_value&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY To get default display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XPROPFORMATS <br>
Specifies the name of a file from which additional formats
are to be obtained.</p>
