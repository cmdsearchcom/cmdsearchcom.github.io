<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
autogen - The Automated Program Generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
autogen [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name[[=| ]value]]... [
&lt;def-file&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoGen creates text files from
templates using external definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
AutoGen is designed for generating program files that
contain repetitive text with varied substitutions. The goal
is to simplify the maintenance of programs that contain
large <br>
amounts of repetitious text. This is especially valuable if
there are several blocks of such text that must be kept
synchronized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One common example is the
problem of maintaining the code required for processing
program options. Processing options requires a minimum of
four different constructs be kept in <br>
proper order in different places in your program. You need
at least: The flag character in the flag string, code to
process the flag when it is encountered, a global state
vari&acirc; <br>
able or two, and a line in the usage text. You will need
more things besides this if you choose to implement long
option names, configuration file processing, environment
vari&acirc; <br>
ables and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of this can be done
mechanically; with the proper templates and this
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options select definitions, templates and
scheme functions to use <br>
-L dir, --templ-dirs=dir <br>
Search for templates in DIR. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add a directory to the list of
directories autogen searches when opening a template, either
as the primary template or an included one. The last entry
has the highest <br>
priority in the search list. That is to say, they are
searched in reverse order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T tpl-file,
--override-tpl=tpl-file <br>
Use TPL-FILE for the template. This option may not be preset
with environment variables or in initialization (rc)
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Definition files specify the
standard template that is to be expanded. This option will
override that name and expand a different template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l tpl-file,
--lib-template=tpl-file <br>
Load AutoGen macros from TPL-FILE. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINE macros are saved from
this template file for use in processing the main macro
file. Template text aside from the DEFINE macros is is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use this. Instead, use
the INCLUDE macro in your template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: THIS OPTION IS
DEPRECATED</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--definitions=file,
--no-definitions <br>
Read definitions from FILE. The no-definitions form will
disable the option. This option is enabled by default. This
option may not be preset with environment variables <br>
or in initialization (rc) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this argument to specify the
input definitions file with a command line option. If you do
not specify this option, then there must be a command line
argument that <br>
specifies the file, even if only to specify stdin with a
hyphen (-). Specify, --no-definitions when you wish to
process a template without any active AutoGen
definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell=shell <br>
name or path name of shell to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, when AutoGen is
built, the configuration is probed for a reasonable
Bourne-like shell to use for shell script processing. If a
particular template needs an <br>
alternate shell, it must be specified with this option on
the command line, with an environment variable (SHELL) or in
the configuration/initialization file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --no-fmemopen <br>
Do not use in-mem streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the local C library supports
&quot;fopencookie(3GNU)&quot;, or &quot;funopen(3BSD)&quot;
then AutoGen prefers to use in-memory stream buffer opens
instead of anonymous files. This may <br>
lead to problems if there is a shortage of virtual memory.
If, for a particular application, you run out of memory,
then specify this option. This is unlikely in a mod&acirc;
<br>
ern 64-bit virtual memory environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms without these
functions, the option is accepted but ignored.
fmemopen(POSIX) is not adequate because its string buffer is
not reallocatable. open_mem&acirc; <br>
stream(POSIX) is also not adequate because the stream is
only opened for output. AutoGen needs a reallocatable buffer
available for both reading and writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--equate=char-list <br>
characters considered equivalent. The default char-list for
this option is: <br>
_-^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will alter the list
of characters considered equivalent. The default are the
three characters, &quot;_-^&quot;. (The last is conventional
on a Tandem/HP-NonStop, and I <br>
used to do a lot of work on Tandems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options modify how
output is handled <br>
-b name, --base-name=name <br>
Specify NAME as the base name for output. This option may
not be preset with environment variables or in
initialization (rc) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A template may specify the exact
name of the output file. Normally, it does not. Instead, the
name is composed of the base name of the definitions file
with suffixes <br>
appended. This option will override the base name derived
from the definitions file name. This is required if there is
no definitions file and advisable if definitions <br>
are being read from stdin. If the definitions are being read
from standard in, the base name defaults to stdin. Any
leading directory components in the name will be <br>
silently removed. If you wish the output file to appear in a
particular directory, it is recommended that you
&quot;cd&quot; into that directory first, or use directory
names in <br>
the format specification for the output suffix lists, see:
pseudo macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source-time, --no-source-time
<br>
set mod times to latest source. The no-source-time form will
disable the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you stamp your output files
with the DNE macro output, then your output files will
always be different, even if the content has not really
changed. If you use this <br>
option, then the modification time of the output files will
change only if the input files change. This will help reduce
unneeded builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--writable, --not-writable <br>
Allow output files to be writable. The not-writable form
will disable the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will leave output
files writable. Normally, output files are read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are often
useful while debugging new templates <br>
They specify limits that prevent the template from taking
overly long or producing more output than expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--loop-limit=lim <br>
Limit on increment loops. This option takes an integer
number as its argument. The value of lim is constrained to
being: <br>
exactly -1, or <br>
in the range 1 through 0x1000000 <br>
The default lim for this option is: <br>
256</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option prevents runaway
loops. For example, if you accidentally specify, &quot;FOR x
(for-from 1) (for-to -1) (for-by 1)&quot;, it will take a
long time to finish. If you do <br>
have more than 256 entries in tables, you will need to
specify a new limit with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t seconds, --timeout=seconds
<br>
Limit server shell operations to SECONDS. This option takes
an integer number as its argument. The value of seconds is
constrained to being: <br>
in the range 0 through 3600</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoGen works with a shell
server process. Most normal commands will complete in less
than 10 seconds. If, however, your commands need more time
than this, use this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid range is 0 to 3600
seconds (1 hour). Zero will disable the server time
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace=level <br>
tracing level of detail. This option takes a keyword as its
argument. The argument sets an enumeration value that can be
tested by comparing them against the option <br>
value macro. The available keywords are: <br>
nothing debug-message server-shell <br>
templates block-macros expressions <br>
everything <br>
or their numeric equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default level for this
option is: <br>
nothing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will cause AutoGen
to display a trace of its template processing. There are six
levels, each level including messages from the previous
levels:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nothing Does no tracing at all
(default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug-message Print messages
from the &quot;DEBUG&quot; AutoGen macro (see: DEBUG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server-shell Traces all input
and output to the server shell. This includes a shell
&quot;independent&quot; initialization script about 30 lines
long. Its output is discarded and <br>
not inserted into any template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">templates Traces the invocation
of DEFINEd macros and INCLUDEs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">block-macros Traces all block
macros. The above, plus IF, FOR, CASE and WHILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expressions Displays the results
of expression evaluations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">everything Displays the
invocation of every AutoGen macro, even TEXT macros (i.e.
the text outside of macro quotes). Additionally, if you
rebuild the &lsquo;&lsquo;expr.ini&rsquo;&rsquo; file <br>
with debugging enabled, then all calls to AutoGen defined
scheme functions will also get logged: <br>
cd ${top_builddir}/agen5 <br>
DEBUG_ENABLED=true bash bootstrap.dir expr.ini <br>
make CFLAGS=&rsquo;-g -DDEBUG_ENABLED=1&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that you cannot rebuild
this source in this way without first having installed the
autogen executable in your search path. Because of this,
&quot;expr.ini&quot; is in the <br>
distributed source list, and not in the dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trace-out=file <br>
tracing output file or filter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output specified may be a
file name, a file that is appended to, or, if the option
argument begins with the pipe operator (|), a command that
will receive the tracing <br>
output as standard in. For example, --traceout=&rsquo;|
less&rsquo; will run the trace output through the less
program. Appending to a file is specified by preceeding the
file name <br>
with two greater-than characters (&gt;&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-defs <br>
Show the definition tree. This option may not be preset with
environment variables or in initialization (rc) files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will print out the complete
definition tree before processing the template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--used-defines <br>
Show the definitions used. This option may not be preset
with environment variables or in initialization (rc)
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will print out the names of
definition values searched for during the processing of the
template, whether actually found or not. There may be other
referenced defi&acirc; <br>
nitions in a template in portions of the template not
evaluated. Some of the names listed may be computed names
and others AutoGen macro arguments. This is not a means <br>
for producing a definitive, all-encompassing list of all and
only the values used from a definition file. This is
intended as an aid to template documentation only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --core <br>
Leave a core dump on a failure exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many systems default to a zero
sized core limit. If the system has the sys/resource.h
header and if this option is supplied, then in the failure
exit path, autogen will <br>
attempt to set the soft core limit to whatever the hard core
limit is. If that does not work, then an administrator must
raise the hard core size limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options can be used to
control what gets processed <br>
in the definitions files and template files&quot; They
specify which outputs and parts of outputs to produce.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s suffix, --skip-suffix=suffix
<br>
Skip the file with this SUFFIX. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times. This option may not be preset
with environment variables or in initialization (rc) <br>
files. This option must not appear in combination with any
of the following options: select-suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Occasionally, it may not be
desirable to produce all of the output files specified in
the template. (For example, only the .h header file, but not
the .c program text.) <br>
To do this specify --skip-suffix=c on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o suffix,
--select-suffix=suffix <br>
specify this output suffix. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times. This option may not be preset
with environment variables or in initialization (rc) <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to override the
suffix specifications in the template, you can use one or
more copies of this option. See the suffix specification in
the @ref{pseudo macro} <br>
section of the info doc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D value, --define=value <br>
name to add to definition list. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AutoGen define names are
used for the following purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sections of the AutoGen
definitions may be enabled or disabled by using C-style
#ifdef and #ifndef directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When defining a value for a
name, you may specify the index for a particular value. That
index may be a literal value, a define option or a value
#define-d in the defini&acirc; <br>
tions themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of a file may be
prefixed with $NAME/. The $NAME part of the name string will
be replaced with the define-d value for NAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When AutoGen is finished loading
the definitions, the defined values are exported to the
environment with, putenv(3). These values can then be used
in shell scripts with <br>
${NAME@} references and in templates with (getenv
&quot;NAME&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While processing a template, you
may specify an index to retrieve a specific value. That
index may also be a define-d value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is entirely equivalent to
place this name in the exported environment. Internally,
that is what AutoGen actually does with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U name-pat, --undefine=name-pat
<br>
definition list removal pattern. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times. This option may not be preset
with environment variables or in initialization (rc) <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similar to &rsquo;C&rsquo;,
AutoGen uses #ifdef/#ifndef preprocessing directives. This
option will cause the matching names to be removed from the
list of defined values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is used to automate
dependency tracking <br>
-M type, --make-dep[=type] <br>
emit make dependency file. This option may appear an
unlimited number of times. This option may not be preset
with environment variables or in initialization (rc)
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option behaves fairly
closely to the way the -M series of options work with the
gcc compiler, except that instead of just emitting the
predecessor dependencies, this <br>
also emits the successor dependencies (output target files).
By default, the output dependency information will be placed
in &lt;base-name&gt;.d, but may also be specified with <br>
-MF&lt;file&gt;. The time stamp on this file will be
manipulated so that it will be one second older than the
oldest primary output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target in this dependency
file will normally be the dependency file name, but may also
be overridden with -MT&lt;targ-name&gt;. AutoGen will not
alter the contents of that <br>
file, but it may create it and it will adjust the
modification time to match the start time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NB: these second letters are
part of the option argument, so -MF &lt;file&gt; must have
the space character quoted or omitted, and -M &quot;F
&lt;file&gt;&quot; is acceptable because the F is <br>
part of the option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M may be followed by any of the
letters M, F, P, T, Q, D, or G. However, only F, Q, T and P
are meaningful. All but F have somewhat different meanings.
-MT&lt;name&gt; is <br>
interpreted as meaning &lt;name&gt; is a sentinel file that
will depend on all inputs (templates and definition files)
and all the output files will depend on this sentinel <br>
file. It is suitable for use as a real make target. Q is
treated identically to T, except dollar characters
(&rsquo;$&rsquo;) are doubled. P causes a special clean
(clobber) phoney <br>
rule to be inserted into the make file fragment. An empty
rule is always created for building the list of targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the recommended usage:
<br>
-MFwhatever-you-like.dep -MTyour-sentinel-file -MP <br>
and then in your Makefile, make the autogen rule: <br>
-include whatever-you-like.dep <br>
clean_targets += clean-your-sentinel-file <br>
.sp <br>
your-sentinel-file: <br>
autogen -MT$@@ -MF$*.d ..... <br>
.sp <br>
local-clean : <br>
rm -f $(clean_targets)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The modification time on the
dependency file is adjusted to be one second before the
earliest time stamp of any other output file. Consequently,
it is suitable for use as <br>
the sentinel file testifying to the fact the program was
successfully run. (-include is the GNU make way of
specifying &quot;include it if it exists&quot;. Your make
must support <br>
that feature or your bootstrap process must create the
file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of this may also be
specified using the DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT or AUTOGEN_MAKE_DEP
environment variables. If defined, dependency information
will be output. If defined <br>
with white space free text that is something other than
true, false, yes, no, 0 or 1, then the string is taken to be
an output file name. If it contains a string of white <br>
space characters, the first token is as above and the second
token is taken to be the target (sentinel) file as -MT in
the paragraphs above. DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT will be <br>
ignored if there are multiple sequences of white space
characters or if its contents are, specifically, false, no
or 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help, version and option
handling <br>
-?, --help <br>
Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-!, --more-help <br>
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&gt; [cfgfile],
--save-opts[=cfgfile] <br>
Save the option state to cfgfile. The default is the last
configuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section,
below. The command will exit after updating the config <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt; cfgfile,
--load-opts=cfgfile, --no-load-opts <br>
Load options from cfgfile. The no-load-opts form will
disable the loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.
--no-load-opts is handled early, out of order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v [{v|c|n}],
--version[={v|c|n}] <br>
Output version of program and exit. The default mode is
&lsquo;v&rsquo;, a simple version. The &lsquo;c&rsquo; mode
will print copyright information and &lsquo;n&rsquo; will
print the full copyright <br>
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION PRESETS <br>
Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be
preset by loading values from configuration (&quot;RC&quot;
or &quot;.INI&quot;) file(s) and values from environment
variables named: <br>
AUTOGEN_&lt;option-name&gt; or AUTOGEN <br>
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed
later than) the configuration files. The homerc files are
&quot;$HOME&quot;, and &quot;.&quot;. If any of these are
directories, then the <br>
file .autogenrc is searched for within those
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
See OPTION PRESETS for configuration environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
See OPTION PRESETS for configuration files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here is how the man page is produced: <br>
autogen -Tagman-cmd.tpl -MFman-dep -MTstamp-man opts.def</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command produced this man
page from the AutoGen option definition file. It overrides
the template specified in opts.def (normally options.tpl)
and uses agman-cmd.tpl. It <br>
also sets the make file dependency output to man-dep and the
sentinel file (time stamp file) to man-stamp. The base of
the file name is derived from the defined prog-name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The texi invocation document is
produced via: <br>
autogen -Tagtexi-cmd.tpl -MFtexi-dep -MTtexi-stamp
opts.def</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
One of the following exit values will be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) <br>
Successful program execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 (EXIT_OPTION_ERROR) <br>
The command options were misconfigured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 (EXIT_BAD_TEMPLATE) <br>
An error was encountered processing the template.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 (EXIT_BAD_DEFINITIONS) <br>
The definitions could not be deciphered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 (EXIT_LOAD_ERROR) <br>
An error was encountered during the load phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128 (EXIT_SIGNAL) <br>
autogen exited due to catching a signal. If your template
includes string formatting, a number argument to a
&quot;%s&quot; formatting element will trigger a
segmentation fault. <br>
Autogen will catch the seg fault signal and exit with
AUTOGEN_EXIT_SIGNAL(5). Alternatively, AutoGen may have been
interrupted with a kill(2) signal. Subtract 128 from <br>
the actual exit code to detect the signal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">66 (EX_NOINPUT) <br>
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">70 (EX_SOFTWARE) <br>
libopts had an internal operational error. Please report it
to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net. Thank you.</p>
