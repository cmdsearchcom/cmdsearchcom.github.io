<p>GPG(1) GNU Privacy Guard 1.4 GPG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpg - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpg [--homedir dir] [--options file] [options] command
[args]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpg is the OpenPGP only version of the GNU Privacy Guard
(GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and
signing services using the OpenPGP standard. gpg features
com&acirc; <br>
plete key management and all bells and whistles you can
expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the standalone version
of gpg. For desktop use you should consider using gpg2 from
the GnuPG-2 package <br>
([On some platforms gpg2 is installed under the name
gpg]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least
a signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good*
passphrase to protect your secret key. This passphrase is
the weakest part of the whole system. Programs to do
dictionary <br>
attacks on your secret keyring are very easy to write and so
you should protect your &quot;~/.gnupg/&quot; directory very
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind that, if this
program is used over a network (telnet), it is *very* easy
to spy out your passphrase!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are going to verify
detached signatures, make sure that the program knows about
it; either give both filenames on the command line or use
&rsquo;-&rsquo; to specify STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTEROPERABILITY <br>
GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the
OpenPGP standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of
the optional parts of the standard, such as the SHA-512
hash, <br>
and the ZLIB and BZIP2 compression algorithms. It is
important to be aware that not all OpenPGP programs
implement these optional algorithms and that by forcing
their use via the <br>
--cipher-algo, --digest-algo, --cert-digest-algo, or
--compress-algo options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a
perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read
by <br>
the intended recipient.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are dozens of variations
of OpenPGP programs available, and each supports a slightly
different subset of these optional algorithms. For example,
until recently, no <br>
(unhacked) version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher
algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read
by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
<br>
preferences system that will always do the right thing and
create messages that are usable by all recipients,
regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override
this <br>
safe default if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you absolutely must override
the safe default, or if the preferences on a given key are
invalid for some reason, you are far better off using the
--pgp6, --pgp7, or --pgp8 <br>
options. These options are safe as they do not force any
particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather
reduce the available algorithms to a &quot;PGP-safe&quot;
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Commands are not distinguished from options except for the
fact that only one command is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg may be run with no commands,
in which case it will perform a reasonable action depending
on the type of file it is given as input (an encrypted
message is decrypted, a signa&acirc; <br>
ture is verified, a file containing keys is listed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please remember that option as
well as command parsing stops as soon as a non-option is
encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the
special option --.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands not specific to the
function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the program version and licensing information. Note
that you cannot abbreviate this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
-h Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command
line options. Note that you cannot abbreviate this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warranty <br>
Print warranty information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-options <br>
Print a list of all available options and commands. Note
that you cannot abbreviate this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands to select the type of
operation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign <br>
-s Make a signature. This command may be combined with
--encrypt (for a signed and encrypted message), --symmetric
(for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), or <br>
--encrypt and --symmetric together (for a signed message
that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). The
key to be used for signing is chosen by default or <br>
can be set with the --local-user and --default-key
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clearsign <br>
Make a clear text signature. The content in a clear text
signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP
software is only needed to verify the signature. <br>
Clear text signatures may modify end-of-line whitespace for
platform independence and are not intended to be reversible.
The key to be used for signing is chosen by <br>
default or can be set with the --local-user and
--default-key options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach-sign <br>
-b Make a detached signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encrypt <br>
-e Encrypt data. This option may be combined with --sign
(for a signed and encrypted message), --symmetric (for a
message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a <br>
passphrase), or --sign and --symmetric together (for a
signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
passphrase).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--symmetric <br>
-c Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The
default symmetric cipher used is AES128, but may be chosen
with the --cipher-algo option. This option may be com&acirc;
<br>
bined with --sign (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted
message), --encrypt (for a message that may be decrypted via
a secret key or a passphrase), or --sign and <br>
--encrypt together (for a signed message that may be
decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--store <br>
Store only (make a simple RFC1991 literal data packet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--decrypt <br>
-d Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if
no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file
specified with --output). If the decrypted file is <br>
signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs
from the default operation, as it never writes to the
filename which is included in the file and it rejects <br>
files which don&rsquo;t begin with an encrypted message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify <br>
Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify
it without generating any output. With no arguments, the
signature packet is read from STDIN. If only a one <br>
argument is given, it is expected to be a complete
signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With more than 1 argument, the
first should be a detached signature and the remaining files
ake up the the signed data. To read the signed data from
STDIN, use &rsquo;-&rsquo; as the <br>
second filename. For security reasons a detached signature
cannot read the signed material from STDIN without denoting
it in the above way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If the option --batch is
not used, gpg may assume that a single argument is a file
with a detached signature and it will try to find a matching
data file by strip&acirc; <br>
ping certain suffixes. Using this historical feature to
verify a detached signature is strongly discouraged; always
specify the data file too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When verifying a cleartext
signature, gpg verifies only what makes up the cleartext
signed data and not any extra data outside of the cleartext
signature or header <br>
lines following directly the dash marker line. The option
--output may be used to write out the actual signed data;
but there are other pitfalls with this format as well. <br>
It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in favor of
detached signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multifile <br>
This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple
files for processing on the command line or read from STDIN
with each filename on a separate line. This allows for <br>
many files to be processed at once. --multifile may
currently be used along with --verify, --encrypt, and
--decrypt. Note that --multifile --verify may not be used
with <br>
detached signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify-files <br>
Identical to --multifile --verify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encrypt-files <br>
Identical to --multifile --encrypt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--decrypt-files <br>
Identical to --multifile --decrypt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-keys <br>
-k <br>
--list-public-keys <br>
List all keys from the public keyrings, or just the keys
given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k is slightly different from
--list-keys in that it allows only for one argument and
takes the second argument as the keyring to search. This is
for command line compat&acirc; <br>
ibility with PGP 2 and has been removed in gpg2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid using the output of this
command in scripts or other programs as it is likely to
change as GnuPG changes. See --with-colons for a
machine-parseable key listing com&acirc; <br>
mand that is appropriate for use in scripts and other
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-secret-keys <br>
-K List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones
given on the command line. A # after the letters sec means
that the secret key is not usable (for example, if it <br>
was created via --export-secret-subkeys).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-sigs <br>
Same as --list-keys, but the signatures are listed too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each signature listed, there
are several flags in between the &quot;sig&quot; tag and
keyid. These flags give additional information about each
signature. From left to right, <br>
they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see
--ask-cert-level), &quot;L&quot; for a local or
non-exportable signature (see --lsign-key), &quot;R&quot;
for a nonRevocable signa&acirc; <br>
ture (see the --edit-key command &quot;nrsign&quot;),
&quot;P&quot; for a signature that contains a policy URL
(see --cert-policy-url), &quot;N&quot; for a signature that
contains a notation (see <br>
--cert-notation), &quot;X&quot; for an eXpired signature
(see --ask-cert-expire), and the numbers 1-9 or
&quot;T&quot; for 10 and above to indicate trust signature
levels (see the --edit-key <br>
command &quot;tsign&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-sigs <br>
Same as --list-sigs, but the signatures are verified. Note
that for performance reasons the revocation status of a
signing key is not shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The status of the verification
is indicated by a flag directly following the
&quot;sig&quot; tag (and thus before the flags described
above for --list-sigs). A &quot;!&quot; indicates that <br>
the signature has been successfully verified, a
&quot;-&quot; denotes a bad signature and a &quot;%&quot; is
used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g.
a non supported algo&acirc; <br>
rithm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fingerprint <br>
List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their
fingerprints. This is the same output as --list-keys but
with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint.
<br>
May also be combined with --list-sigs or --check-sigs. If
this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all
secondary keys are listed too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-packets <br>
List only the sequence of packets. This is mainly useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--card-edit <br>
Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand
&quot;help&quot; provides an overview on available commands.
For a detailed description, please see the Card HOWTO at
<br>
https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--card-status <br>
Show the content of the smart card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--change-pin <br>
Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard.
This functionality is also available as the subcommand
&quot;passwd&quot; with the --card-edit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-key name <br>
Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either
--yes is required or the key must be specified by
fingerprint. This is a safeguard against accidental deletion
of <br>
multiple keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-secret-key name <br>
Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key
must be specified by fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-secret-and-public-key
name <br>
Same as --delete-key, but if a secret key exists, it will be
removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by
fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export <br>
Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings
and those registered via option --keyring), or if at least
one name is given, those of the given name. The <br>
exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given
with option --output. Use together with --armor to mail
those keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--send-keys key IDs <br>
Similar to --export but sends the keys to a keyserver.
Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Option
--keyserver must be used to give the name of this keyserver.
<br>
Don&rsquo;t send your complete keyring to a keyserver ---
select only those keys which are new or changed by you. If
no key IDs are given, gpg does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-secret-keys <br>
--export-secret-subkeys <br>
Same as --export, but exports the secret keys instead. The
exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given
with option --output. This command is often used <br>
along with the option --armor to allow easy printing of the
key for paper backup; however the external tool paperkey
does a better job for creating backups on paper. Note <br>
that exporting a secret key can be a security risk if the
exported keys are send over an insecure channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second form of the command
has the special property to render the secret part of the
primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and
other implementations <br>
can not be expected to successfully import such a key. Its
intended use is to generated a full key with an additional
signing subkey on a dedicated machine and then using <br>
this command to export the key without the primary key to
the main machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the option
--simple-sk-checksum if you want to import an exported
secret key into ancient OpenPGP implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import <br>
--fast-import <br>
Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring.
The fast version is currently just a synonym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few other options
which control how this command works. Most notable here is
the --import-options merge-only option which does not insert
new keys but does <br>
only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and
subkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recv-keys key IDs <br>
Import the keys with the given key IDs from a keyserver.
Option --keyserver must be used to give the name of this
keyserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh-keys <br>
Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist
on the local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with
the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling <br>
this with no arguments will refresh the entire keyring.
Option --keyserver must be used to give the name of the
keyserver for all keys that do not have preferred key&acirc;
<br>
servers set (see --keyserver-options
honor-keyserver-url).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--search-keys names <br>
Search the keyserver for the given names. Multiple names
given here will be joined together to create the search
string for the keyserver. Option --keyserver must be used
<br>
to give the name of this keyserver. Keyservers that support
different search methods allow using the syntax specified in
&quot;How to specify a user ID&quot; below. Note that
dif&acirc; <br>
ferent keyserver types support different search methods.
Currently only LDAP supports them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fetch-keys URIs <br>
Retrieve keys located at the specified URIs. Note that
different installations of GnuPG may support different
protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update-trustdb <br>
Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over
all keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive
command because it may have to ask for the &quot;own&acirc;
<br>
ertrust&quot; values for keys. The user has to give an
estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed
key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks
<br>
for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to
a key. Using the --edit-key menu, the assigned value can be
changed at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-trustdb <br>
Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From
time to time the trust database must be updated so that
expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes <br>
in the Web of Trust can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will
calculate when this is required and do it automatically
unless --no-auto-check-trustdb is set. This command can be
<br>
used to force a trust database check at any time. The
processing is identical to that of --update-trustdb but it
skips keys with a not yet defined
&quot;ownertrust&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For use with cron jobs, this
command can be used together with --batch in which case the
trust database check is done only if a check is needed. To
force a run even in <br>
batch mode add the option --yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-ownertrust <br>
Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for
backup purposes as these values are the only ones which
can&rsquo;t be re-created from a corrupted trustdb. Example:
<br>
gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import-ownertrust <br>
Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in
files (or STDIN if not given); existing values will be
overwritten. In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if
<br>
you have a recent backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in
the file &acirc;otrust.txt&acirc;, you may re-create the
trustdb using these commands: <br>
cd ~/.gnupg <br>
rm trustdb.gpg <br>
gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rebuild-keydb-caches <br>
When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command
should be used to create signature caches in the keyring. It
might be handy in other situations too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-md algo <br>
--print-mds <br>
Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files
or STDIN. With the second form (or a deprecated
&quot;*&quot; as algo) digests for all available algorithms
are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gen-random 0|1|2 count <br>
Emit count random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or
2. If count is not given or zero, an endless sequence of
random bytes will be emitted. If used with --armor the <br>
output will be base64 encoded. PLEASE, don&rsquo;t use this
command unless you know what you are doing; it may remove
precious entropy from the system!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gen-prime mode bits <br>
Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is still subject
to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enarmor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dearmor <br>
Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII
armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general
not very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to manage your keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section explains the main
commands for key management</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gen-key <br>
Generate a new key pair using the current default
parameters. This is the standard command to create a new
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a feature which
allows you to create keys in batch mode. See the the manual
section &lsquo;&lsquo;Unattended key
generation&rsquo;&rsquo; on how to use this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gen-revoke name <br>
Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key. To
revoke a subkey or a signature, use the --edit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--desig-revoke name <br>
Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This
allows a user (with the permission of the keyholder) to
revoke someone else&rsquo;s key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edit-key <br>
Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key
management related tasks. It expects the specification of a
key on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid n Toggle selection of user
ID or photographic user ID with index n. Use * to select all
and 0 to deselect all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key n Toggle selection of subkey
with index n. Use * to select all and 0 to deselect all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sign Make a signature on key of
user name If the key is not yet signed by the default user
(or the users given with -u), the program displays the
information of the key <br>
again, together with its fingerprint and asks whether it
should be signed. This question is repeated for all users
specified with -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsign Same as &quot;sign&quot;
but the signature is marked as non-exportable and will
therefore never be used by others. This may be used to make
keys valid only in the local envi&acirc; <br>
ronment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nrsign Same as &quot;sign&quot;
but the signature is marked as non-revocable and can
therefore never be revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsign Make a trust signature.
This is a signature that combines the notions of
certification (like a regular signature), and trust (like
the &quot;trust&quot; command). It is gen&acirc; <br>
erally only useful in distinct communities or groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;l&quot; (for
local / non-exportable), &quot;nr&quot; (for non-revocable,
and &quot;t&quot; (for trust) may be freely mixed and
prefixed to &quot;sign&quot; to create a signature of any
type <br>
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delsig Delete a signature. Note
that it is not possible to retract a signature, once it has
been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver). In that case
you better use <br>
revsig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revsig Revoke a signature. For
every signature which has been generated by one of the
secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate
should be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Check the signatures on
all selected user IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adduid Create an additional user
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addphoto <br>
Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG
file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a
very large JPEG will make for a very large key. <br>
Also note that some programs will display your JPEG
unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in
a dialog box (PGP).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showphoto <br>
Display the selected photographic user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deluid Delete a user ID or
photographic user ID. Note that it is not possible to
retract a user id, once it has been send to the public (i.e.
to a keyserver). In that <br>
case you better use revuid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revuid Revoke a user ID or
photographic user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">primary <br>
Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the
primary user id flag from all other user ids and sets the
timestamp of all affected self-signatures one <br>
second ahead. Note that setting a photo user ID as primary
makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a
regular user ID as primary makes it primary <br>
over other regular user IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyserver <br>
Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s). This
allows other users to know where you prefer they get your
key from. See --keyserver-options honor-key&acirc; <br>
server-url for more on how this works. Setting a value of
&quot;none&quot; removes an existing preferred
keyserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notation <br>
Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s). See
--cert-notation for more on how this works. Setting a value
of &quot;none&quot; removes all notations, setting a <br>
notation prefixed with a minus sign (-) removes that
notation, and setting a notation name (without the =value)
prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations <br>
with that name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pref List preferences from the
selected user ID. This shows the actual preferences, without
including any implied preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">showpref <br>
More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID.
This shows the preferences in effect by including the
implied preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1 <br>
(digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are not
already included in the preference list. In addition, the
preferred keyserver and signature notations (if <br>
any) are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setpref string <br>
Set the list of user ID preferences to string for all (or
just the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no
arguments sets the preference list to the default <br>
(either built-in or set via --default-preference-list), and
calling setpref with &quot;none&quot; as the argument sets
an empty preference list. Use gpg --version to get a <br>
list of available algorithms. Note that while you can change
the preferences on an attribute user ID (aka &quot;photo
ID&quot;), GnuPG does not select keys via attribute user
<br>
IDs so these preferences will not be used by GnuPG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When setting preferences, you
should list the algorithms in the order which you&rsquo;d
like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a
message to your key. If <br>
you don&rsquo;t include 3DES, it will be automatically added
at the end. Note that there are many factors that go into
choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may <br>
not be the only recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP
application being used to send to you may or may not follow
your exact chosen order for a given message. It <br>
will, however, only choose an algorithm that is present on
the preference list of every recipient key. See also the
INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS <br>
section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addkey Add a subkey to this
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addcardkey <br>
Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keytocard <br>
Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if
no subkey has been selected) to a smartcard. The secret key
in the keyring will be replaced by a stub if <br>
the key could be stored successfully on the card and you use
the save command later. Only certain key types may be
transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to <br>
select on what card to store the key. Note that it is not
possible to get that key back from the card - if the card
gets broken your secret key will be lost unless <br>
you have a backup somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bkuptocard file <br>
Restore the given file to a card. This command may be used
to restore a backup key (as generated during card
initialization) to a new card. In almost all cases this <br>
will be the encryption key. You should use this command only
with the corresponding public key and make sure that the
file given as argument is indeed the backup to <br>
restore. You should then select 2 to restore as encryption
key. You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of the
backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the <br>
card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delkey Remove a subkey
(secondart key). Note that it is not possible to retract a
subkey, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a
keyserver). In that case you bet&acirc; <br>
ter use revkey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revkey Revoke a subkey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expire Change the key or subkey
expiration time. If a subkey is selected, the expiration
time of this subkey will be changed. With no selection, the
key expiration of the <br>
primary key is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trust Change the owner trust
value for the key. This updates the trust-db immediately and
no save is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable <br>
enable Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can
not normally be used for encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addrevoker <br>
Add a designated revoker to the key. This takes one optional
argument: &quot;sensitive&quot;. If a designated revoker is
marked as sensitive, it will not be exported by <br>
default (see export-options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwd Change the passphrase of
the secret key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toggle Toggle between public and
secret key listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean Compact (by removing all
signatures except the selfsig) any user ID that is no longer
usable (e.g. revoked, or expired). Then, remove any
signatures that are not <br>
usable by the trust calculations. Specifically, this removes
any signature that does not validate, any signature that is
superseded by a later signature, revoked <br>
signatures, and signatures issued by keys that are not
present on the keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimize <br>
Make the key as small as possible. This removes all
signatures from each user ID except for the most recent
self-signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cross-certify <br>
Add cross-certification signatures to signing subkeys that
may not currently have them. Cross-certification signatures
protect against a subtle attack against sign&acirc; <br>
ing subkeys. See --require-cross-certification. All new keys
generated have this signature by default, so this option is
only useful to bring older keys up to <br>
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save Save all changes to the key
rings and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Quit the program without
updating the key rings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listing shows you the key
with its secondary keys and all user ids. The primary user
id is indicated by a dot, and selected keys or user ids are
indicated by an <br>
asterisk. The trust value is displayed with the primary key:
the first is the assigned owner trust and the second is the
calculated trust value. Letters are used for the <br>
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- No ownertrust assigned / not
yet calculated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Trust calculation has failed;
probably due to an expired key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Not enough information for
calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Never trust this key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Marginally trusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Fully trusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Ultimately trusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign-key name <br>
Signs a public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut
version of the subcommand &quot;sign&quot; from --edit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lsign-key name <br>
Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as
non-exportable. This is a shortcut version of the subcommand
&quot;lsign&quot; from --edit-key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
gpg features a bunch of options to control the exact
behaviour and to change the default configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long options can be put in an
options file (default &quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;). Short
option names will not work - for example, &quot;armor&quot;
is a valid option for the options file, while <br>
&quot;a&quot; is not. Do not write the 2 dashes, but simply
the name of the option and any required arguments. Lines
with a hash (&rsquo;#&rsquo;) as the first non-white-space
character are ignored. <br>
Commands may be put in this file too, but that is not
generally useful as the command will execute automatically
with every execution of gpg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please remember that option
parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you
can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option
--.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to change the
configuration</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are used to change
the configuration and are usually found in the option
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-key name <br>
Use name as the default key to sign with. If this option is
not used, the default key is the first key found in the
secret keyring. Note that -u or --local-user overrides <br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-recipient name <br>
Use name as default recipient if option --recipient is not
used and don&rsquo;t ask if this is a valid one. name must
be non-empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-recipient-self <br>
Use the default key as default recipient if option
--recipient is not used and don&rsquo;t ask if this is a
valid one. The default key is the first one from the secret
keyring <br>
or the one set with --default-key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-default-recipient <br>
Reset --default-recipient and --default-recipient-self.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Give more information during processing. If used twice, the
input data is listed in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-verbose <br>
Reset verbose level to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--batch <br>
--no-batch <br>
Use batch mode. Never ask, do not allow interactive
commands. --no-batch disables this option. This option is
commonly used for unattended operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: Unattended operation
bears a higher risk of being exposed to security attacks. In
particular any unattended use of GnuPG which involves the
use of secret keys <br>
should take care not to provide an decryption oracle. There
are several standard pre-cautions against being used as an
oracle. For example never return detailed error <br>
messages or any diagnostics printed by your software to the
remote site. Consult with an expert in case of doubt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that even with a filename
given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from
STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a
detached signature and <br>
no data file has been specified). Thus if you do not want to
feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
&acirc;/dev/null&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tty <br>
Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any
output. This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG
sometimes prints warnings to the TTY even if --batch is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--yes Assume &quot;yes&quot; on
most questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no Assume &quot;no&quot; on
most questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-options parameters <br>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options
used when listing keys and signatures (that is, --list-keys,
--list-sigs, --list-public-keys, --list-secret- <br>
keys, and the --edit-key functions). Options can be
prepended with a no- (after the two dashes) to give the
opposite meaning. The options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-photos <br>
Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs, --list-public-keys, and
--list-secret-keys to display any photo IDs attached to the
key. Defaults to no. See also --photo-viewer. <br>
Does not work with --with-colons: see --attribute-fd for the
appropriate way to get photo data for scripts and other
frontends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-usage <br>
Show usage information for keys and subkeys in the standard
key listing. This is a list of letters indicating the
allowed usage for a key (E=encryption, S=signing, <br>
C=certification, A=authentication). Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-policy-urls <br>
Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs or --check-sigs
listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-notations <br>
show-std-notations <br>
show-user-notations <br>
Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations
in the --list-sigs or --check-sigs listings. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-keyserver-urls <br>
Show any preferred keyserver URL in the --list-sigs or
--check-sigs listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-uid-validity <br>
Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key
listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-unusable-uids <br>
Show revoked and expired user IDs in key listings. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-unusable-subkeys <br>
Show revoked and expired subkeys in key listings. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-keyring <br>
Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show
which keyring a given key resides on. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-sig-expire <br>
Show signature expiration dates (if any) during --list-sigs
or --check-sigs listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-sig-subpackets <br>
Include signature subpackets in the key listing. This option
can take an optional argument list of the subpackets to
list. If no argument is passed, list all sub&acirc; <br>
packets. Defaults to no. This option is only meaningful when
using --with-colons along with --list-sigs or
--check-sigs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify-options parameters <br>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options
used when verifying signatures. Options can be prepended
with a &lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give the opposite meaning. The
<br>
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-photos <br>
Display any photo IDs present on the key that issued the
signature. Defaults to no. See also --photo-viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-policy-urls <br>
Show policy URLs in the signature being verified. Defaults
to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-notations <br>
show-std-notations <br>
show-user-notations <br>
Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations
in the signature being verified. Defaults to IETF
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-keyserver-urls <br>
Show any preferred keyserver URL in the signature being
verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-uid-validity <br>
Display the calculated validity of the user IDs on the key
that issued the signature. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-unusable-uids <br>
Show revoked and expired user IDs during signature
verification. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show-primary-uid-only <br>
Show only the primary user ID during signature verification.
That is all the AKA lines as well as photo Ids are not shown
with the signature verification status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pka-lookups <br>
Enable PKA lookups to verify sender addresses. Note that PKA
is based on DNS, and so enabling this option may disclose
information on when and what signatures are <br>
verified or to whom data is encrypted. This is similar to
the &quot;web bug&quot; described for the auto-key-retrieve
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pka-trust-increase <br>
Raise the trust in a signature to full if the signature
passes PKA validation. This option is only meaningful if
pka-lookups is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-large-rsa <br>
--disable-large-rsa <br>
With --gen-key and --batch, enable the creation of larger
RSA secret keys than is generally recommended (up to 8192
bits). These large keys are more expensive to use, and <br>
their signatures and certifications are also larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-dsa2 <br>
--disable-dsa2 <br>
Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA
Keys up to 1024 bit. This is also the default with
--openpgp. Note that older versions of GnuPG also required
<br>
this flag to allow the generation of DSA larger than 1024
bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--photo-viewer string <br>
This is the command line that should be run to view a photo
ID. &quot;%i&quot; will be expanded to a filename containing
the photo. &quot;%I&quot; does the same, except the file
will not be <br>
deleted once the viewer exits. Other flags are
&quot;%k&quot; for the key ID, &quot;%K&quot; for the long
key ID, &quot;%f&quot; for the key fingerprint,
&quot;%t&quot; for the extension of the image type (e.g.
<br>
&quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the MIME type of the
image (e.g. &quot;image/jpeg&quot;), &quot;%v&quot; for the
single-character calculated validity of the image being
viewed (e.g. &quot;f&quot;), &quot;%V&quot; for the
cal&acirc; <br>
culated validity as a string (e.g. &quot;full&quot;),
&quot;%U&quot; for a base32 encoded hash of the user ID, and
&quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or
%I are present, then the <br>
photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default viewer is
&quot;xloadimage -fork -quiet -title &rsquo;KeyID
0x%k&rsquo; STDIN&quot;. Note that if your image viewer
program is not secure, then executing it from GnuPG does not
make <br>
it secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exec-path string <br>
Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers and
keyserver helpers. If not provided, keyserver helpers use
the compiled-in default directory, and photo viewers <br>
use the $PATH environment variable. Note, that on W32 system
this value is ignored when searching for keyserver
helpers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyring file <br>
Add file to the current list of keyrings. If file begins
with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME
directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it <br>
is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory
(&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this adds a keyring to
the current list. If the intent is to use the specified
keyring alone, use --keyring along with
--no-default-keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--secret-keyring file <br>
Same as --keyring but for the secret keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--primary-keyring file <br>
Designate file as the primary public keyring. This means
that newly imported keys (via --import or keyserver
--recv-from) will go to this keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trustdb-name file <br>
Use file instead of the default trustdb. If file begins with
a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME
directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it <br>
is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory
(&acirc;~/.gnupg&acirc; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME is not
used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--homedir dir <br>
Set the name of the home directory to dir. If this option is
not used, the home directory defaults to
&acirc;~/.gnupg&acirc;. It is only recognized when given on
the command line. <br>
It also overrides any home directory stated through the
environment variable &acirc;GNUPGHOME&acirc; or (on Windows
systems) by means of the Registry entry HKCUt&acirc; <br>
wareGNUGnuPG:HomeDir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows systems it is
possible to install GnuPG as a portable application. In this
case only this command line option is considered, all other
ways to set a home <br>
directory are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To install GnuPG as a portable
application under Windows, create an empty file name
&acirc;gpgconf.ctl&acirc; in the same directory as the tool
&acirc;gpgconf.exe&acirc;. The root of the instal&acirc;
<br>
lation is than that directory; or, if
&acirc;gpgconf.exe&acirc; has been installed directly below
a directory named &acirc;bin&acirc;, its parent directory.
You also need to make sure that the <br>
following directories exist and are writable:
&acirc;ROOT/home&acirc; for the GnuPG home and
&acirc;ROOT/var/cache/gnupg&acirc; for internal cache
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pcsc-driver file <br>
Use file to access the smartcard reader. The current default
is &lsquo;libpcsclite.so.1&rsquo; for GLIBC based systems,
&lsquo;/System/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/PCSC&rsquo;
for MAC OS X, <br>
&lsquo;winscard.dll&rsquo; for Windows and
&lsquo;libpcsclite.so&rsquo; for other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-ccid <br>
Disable the integrated support for CCID compliant readers.
This allows falling back to one of the other drivers even if
the internal CCID driver can handle the reader. <br>
Note, that CCID support is only available if libusb was
available at build time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reader-port number_or_string
<br>
This option may be used to specify the port of the card
terminal. A value of 0 refers to the first serial device;
add 32768 to access USB devices. The default is 32768 <br>
(first USB device). PC/SC or CCID readers might need a
string here; run the program in verbose mode to get a list
of available readers. The default is then the first <br>
reader found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display-charset name <br>
Set the name of the native character set. This is used to
convert some informational strings like user IDs to the
proper UTF-8 encoding. Note that this has nothing to do <br>
with the character set of data to be encrypted or signed;
GnuPG does not recode user-supplied data. If this option is
not used, the default character set is determined <br>
from the current locale. A verbosity level of 3 shows the
chosen set. Valid values for name are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso-8859-1 <br>
This is the Latin 1 set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso-8859-2 <br>
The Latin 2 set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso-8859-15 <br>
This is currently an alias for the Latin 1 set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">koi8-r The usual Russian set
(rfc1489).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf-8 Bypass all translations
and assume that the OS uses native UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--utf8-strings <br>
--no-utf8-strings <br>
Assume that command line arguments are given as UTF8
strings. The default (--no-utf8-strings) is to assume that
arguments are encoded in the character set as specified by
<br>
--display-charset. These options affect all following
arguments. Both options may be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--options file <br>
Read options from file and do not try to read them from the
default options file in the homedir (see --homedir). This
option is ignored if used in an options file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-options <br>
Shortcut for --options /dev/null. This option is detected
before an attempt to open an option file. Using this option
will also prevent the creation of a &acirc;~/.gnupg&acirc;
home&acirc; <br>
dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z n <br>
--compress-level n <br>
--bzip2-compress-level n <br>
Set compression level to n for the ZIP and ZLIB compression
algorithms. The default is to use the default compression
level of zlib (normally 6). --bzip2-compress-level <br>
sets the compression level for the BZIP2 compression
algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is a different
option from --compress-level since BZIP2 uses a significant
<br>
amount of memory for each additional compression level. -z
sets both. A value of 0 for n disables compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bzip2-decompress-lowmem <br>
Use a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed
files. This alternate method uses a bit more than half the
memory, but also runs at half the speed. This is use&acirc;
<br>
ful under extreme low memory circumstances when the file was
originally compressed at a high --bzip2-compress-level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mangle-dos-filenames <br>
--no-mangle-dos-filenames <br>
Older version of Windows cannot handle filenames with more
than one dot. --mangle-dos-filenames causes GnuPG to replace
(rather than add to) the extension of an output <br>
filename to avoid this problem. This option is off by
default and has no effect on non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-cert-level <br>
--no-ask-cert-level <br>
When making a key signature, prompt for a certification
level. If this option is not specified, the certification
level used is set via --default-cert-level. See <br>
--default-cert-level for information on the specific levels
and how they are used. --no-ask-cert-level disables this
option. This option defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-cert-level n <br>
The default to use for the check level when signing a
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 means you make no particular
claim as to how carefully you verified the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 means you believe the key is
owned by the person who claims to own it but you could not,
or did not verify the key at all. This is useful for a
&quot;persona&quot; verification, <br>
where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 means you did casual
verification of the key. For example, this could mean that
you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on
the key against a photo ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 means you did extensive
verification of the key. For example, this could mean that
you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key
in person, and that you <br>
checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a photo
ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner
matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally <br>
that you verified (by exchange of email) that the email
address on the key belongs to the key owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the examples given
above for levels 2 and 3 are just that: examples. In the
end, it is up to you to decide just what &quot;casual&quot;
and &quot;extensive&quot; mean to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option defaults to 0 (no
particular claim).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-cert-level <br>
When building the trust database, treat any signatures with
a certification level below this as invalid. Defaults to 2,
which disregards level 1 signatures. Note that <br>
level 0 &quot;no particular claim&quot; signatures are
always accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trusted-key long key ID <br>
Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a full
8 byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of your own secret
keys. This option is useful if you don&rsquo;t want to <br>
keep your secret keys (or one of them) online but still want
to be able to check the validity of a given
recipient&rsquo;s or signator&rsquo;s key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trust-model
pgp|classic|direct|always|auto <br>
Set what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pgp This is the Web of Trust
combined with trust signatures as used in PGP 5.x and later.
This is the default trust model when creating a new trust
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">classic <br>
This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direct Key validity is set
directly by the user and not calculated via the Web of
Trust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">always Skip key validation and
assume that used keys are always fully valid. You generally
won&rsquo;t use this unless you are using some external
validation scheme. This option <br>
also suppresses the &quot;[uncertain]&quot; tag printed with
signature checks when there is no evidence that the user ID
is bound to the key. Note that this trust model <br>
still does not allow the use of expired, revoked, or
disabled keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto Select the trust model
depending on whatever the internal trust database says. This
is the default model if such a database already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-key-locate parameters
<br>
--no-auto-key-locate <br>
GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed
using this option. This happens when encrypting to an email
address (in the &quot;user@example.com&quot; form), and
there <br>
are no user@example.com keys on the local keyring. This
option takes any number of the following mechanisms, in the
order they are to be tried:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cert Locate a key using DNS
CERT, as specified in rfc4398.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pka Locate a key using DNS
PKA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ldap Using DNS Service
Discovery, check the domain in question for any LDAP
keyservers to use. If this fails, attempt to locate the key
using the PGP Universal method <br>
of checking &rsquo;ldap://keys.(thedomain)&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyserver <br>
Locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using the
--keyserver option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyserver-URL <br>
In addition, a keyserver URL as used in the --keyserver
option may be used here to query that particular
keyserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">local Locate the key using the
local keyrings. This mechanism allows the user to select the
order a local key lookup is done. Thus using
&rsquo;--auto-key-locate local&rsquo; is <br>
identical to --no-auto-key-locate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodefault <br>
This flag disables the standard local key lookup, done
before any of the mechanisms defined by the
--auto-key-locate are tried. The position of this mechanism
in <br>
the list does not matter. It is not required if local is
also used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear Clear all defined
mechanisms. This is useful to override mechanisms given in a
config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyid-format
short|0xshort|long|0xlong <br>
Select how to display key IDs. &quot;short&quot; is the
traditional 8-character key ID. &quot;long&quot; is the more
accurate (but less convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an
&quot;0x&quot; to either <br>
to include an &quot;0x&quot; at the beginning of the key ID,
as in 0x99242560. Note that this option is ignored if the
option --with-colons is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyserver name <br>
Use name as your keyserver. This is the server that
--recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will communicate
with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for <br>
keys on. The format of the name is a URI:
&lsquo;scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]&rsquo; The scheme is
the type of keyserver: &quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or
compatible) keyservers, &quot;ldap&quot; for <br>
the LDAP keyservers, or &quot;mailto&quot; for the Graff
email keyserver. Note that your particular installation of
GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as well.
Keyserver <br>
schemes are case-insensitive. After the keyserver name,
optional keyserver configuration options may be provided.
These are the same as the global --keyserver-options from
<br>
below, but apply only to this particular keyserver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most keyservers synchronize with
each other, so there is generally no need to send keys to
more than one server. The keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net
uses round robin DNS to <br>
give a different keyserver each time you use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keyserver-options name=value1
<br>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options
for the keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a
&lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give the opposite meaning. Valid
import-options or <br>
export-options may be used here as well to apply to
importing (--recv-key) or exporting (--send-key) a key from
a keyserver. While not all options are available for all
<br>
keyserver types, some common options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include-revoked <br>
When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys
that are marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that not
all keyservers differentiate between revoked <br>
and unrevoked keys, and for such keyservers this option is
meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do not have
cryptographic verification of key revocations, <br>
and so turning this option off may result in skipping keys
that are incorrectly marked as revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include-disabled <br>
When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys
that are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that this
option is not used with HKP keyservers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auto-key-retrieve <br>
This option enables the automatic retrieving of keys from a
keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are
not on the local keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option makes a
&quot;web bug&quot; like behavior possible. Keyserver
operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you
a message signed by a brand <br>
new key (which you naturally will not have on your local
keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the
time when you verified the signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">honor-keyserver-url <br>
When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a
preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver
to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto- <br>
key-retrieve is set, and the signature being verified has a
preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver
to fetch the key from. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">honor-pka-record <br>
If auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being
verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA information to
fetch the key. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include-subkeys <br>
When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets.
Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as
they do not support retrieving keys by subkey <br>
id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-temp-files <br>
On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG communicates with the
keyserver helper program via pipes, which is the most
efficient method. This option forces GnuPG to use <br>
temporary files to communicate. On some platforms (such as
Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep-temp-files <br>
If using &lsquo;use-temp-files&rsquo;, do not delete the
temp files after using them. This option is useful to learn
the keyserver communication protocol by reading the
tempo&acirc; <br>
rary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
Tell the keyserver helper program to be more verbose. This
option can be repeated multiple times to increase the
verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout <br>
Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in seconds) to
try and perform a keyserver action before giving up. Note
that performing multiple actions at the same <br>
time uses this timeout value per action. For example, when
retrieving multiple keys via --recv-keys, the timeout
applies separately to each key retrieval, and not <br>
to the --recv-keys command as a whole. Defaults to 30
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http-proxy=value <br>
Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers. This
overrides the &quot;http_proxy&quot; environment variable,
if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cert-size <br>
When retrieving a key via DNS CERT, only accept keys up to
this size. Defaults to 16384 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Turn on debug output in
the keyserver helper program. Note that the details of debug
output depends on which keyserver helper program is being
used, and in turn, <br>
on any libraries that the keyserver helper program uses
internally (libcurl, openldap, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check-cert <br>
Enable certificate checking if the keyserver presents one
(for hkps or ldaps). Defaults to on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ca-cert-file <br>
Provide a certificate store to override the system default.
Only necessary if check-cert is enabled, and the keyserver
is using a certificate that is not present <br>
in a system default certificate list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that depending on the SSL
library that the keyserver helper is built with, this may
actually be a directory or a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--completes-needed n <br>
Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new key
signer (defaults to 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--marginals-needed n <br>
Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new key
signer (defaults to 3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-cert-depth n <br>
Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--simple-sk-checksum <br>
Secret keys are integrity protected by using a SHA-1
checksum. This method is part of the upcoming enhanced
OpenPGP specification but GnuPG already uses it as a
counter&acirc; <br>
measure against certain attacks. Old applications
don&rsquo;t understand this new format, so this option may
be used to switch back to the old behaviour. Using this
option <br>
bears a security risk. Note that using this option only
takes effect when the secret key is encrypted - the simplest
way to make this happen is to change the passphrase on <br>
the key (even changing it to the same value is
acceptable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sig-cache <br>
Do not cache the verification status of key signatures.
Caching gives a much better performance in key listings.
However, if you suspect that your public keyring is not <br>
save against write modifications, you can use this option to
disable the caching. It probably does not make sense to
disable it because all kind of damage can be done if <br>
someone else has write access to your public keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sig-create-check <br>
This options is obsolete. It has no function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto-check-trustdb <br>
--no-auto-check-trustdb <br>
If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of Trust
has to be updated, it automatically runs the --check-trustdb
command internally. This may be a time consuming <br>
process. --no-auto-check-trustdb disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-agent <br>
--no-use-agent <br>
Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first
tries to connect to the agent before it asks for a
passphrase. --no-use-agent disables this option. Note, that
<br>
the tool gpg-preset-passphrase, which comes with GnuPG-2,
cannot be used to preset a passphrase for this version of
GnuPG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gpg-agent-info <br>
Override the value of the environment variable
&rsquo;GPG_AGENT_INFO&rsquo;. This is only used when
--use-agent has been given. Given that this option is not
anymore used by gpg2, it <br>
should be avoided if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-once <br>
Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested and do
not release the lock until the process terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-multiple <br>
Release the locks every time a lock is no longer needed. Use
this to override a previous --lock-once from a config
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lock-never <br>
Disable locking entirely. This option should be used only in
very special environments, where it can be assured that only
one process is accessing those files. A bootable <br>
floppy with a stand-alone encryption system will probably
use this. Improper usage of this option may lead to data and
key corruption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exit-on-status-write-error
<br>
This option will cause write errors on the status FD to
immediately terminate the process. That should in fact be
the default but it never worked this way and thus we need
<br>
an option to enable this, so that the change won&rsquo;t
break applications which close their end of a status fd
connected pipe too early. Using this option along with
--enable- <br>
progress-filter may be used to cleanly cancel long running
gpg operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--limit-card-insert-tries n <br>
With n greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert
a smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg
won&rsquo;t at all ask to insert a card if none has been
<br>
inserted at startup. This option is useful in the
configuration file in case an application does not know
about the smartcard support and waits ad infinitum for an
<br>
inserted card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-random-seed-file <br>
GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over
invocations. This makes random generation faster; however
sometimes write operations are not desired. This option <br>
can be used to achieve that with the cost of slower random
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-greeting <br>
Suppress the initial copyright message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-secmem-warning <br>
Suppress the warning about &quot;using insecure
memory&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-permission-warning <br>
Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory
(--homedir) permissions. Note that the permission checks
that GnuPG performs are not intended to be authorita&acirc;
<br>
tive, but rather they simply warn about certain common
permission problems. Do not assume that the lack of a
warning means that your system is secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the warning for unsafe
--homedir permissions cannot be suppressed in the gpg.conf
file, as this would allow an attacker to place an unsafe
gpg.conf file in <br>
place, and use this file to suppress warnings about itself.
The --homedir permissions warning may only be suppressed on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-mdc-warning <br>
Suppress the warning about missing MDC integrity
protection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--require-secmem <br>
--no-require-secmem <br>
Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory. Defaults to
no (i.e. run, but give a warning).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--require-cross-certification
<br>
--no-require-cross-certification <br>
When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that
the cross certification &quot;back signature&quot; on the
subkey is present and valid. This protects against a subtle
<br>
attack against subkeys that can sign. Defaults to
--require-cross-certification for gpg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--expert <br>
--no-expert <br>
Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or
&quot;silly&quot; things like signing an expired or revoked
key, or certain potentially incompatible things like
generating unusual key <br>
types. This also disables certain warning messages about
potentially incompatible actions. As the name implies, this
option is for experts only. If you don&rsquo;t fully
under&acirc; <br>
stand the implications of what it allows you to do, leave
this off. --no-expert disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key related options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recipient name <br>
-r Encrypt for user id name. If this option or
--hidden-recipient is not specified, GnuPG asks for the
user-id unless --default-recipient is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hidden-recipient name <br>
-R Encrypt for user ID name, but hide the key ID of this
user&rsquo;s key. This option helps to hide the receiver of
the message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic
<br>
analysis. If this option or --recipient is not specified,
GnuPG asks for the user ID unless --default-recipient is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--encrypt-to name <br>
Same as --recipient but this one is intended for use in the
options file and may be used with your own user-id as an
&quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These keys are only used when
there <br>
are other recipients given either by use of --recipient or
by the asked user id. No trust checking is performed for
these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hidden-encrypt-to name <br>
Same as --hidden-recipient but this one is intended for use
in the options file and may be used with your own user-id as
a hidden &quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;. These keys are only
<br>
used when there are other recipients given either by use of
--recipient or by the asked user id. No trust checking is
performed for these user ids and even disabled keys <br>
can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-encrypt-to <br>
Disable the use of all --encrypt-to and --hidden-encrypt-to
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group name=value1 <br>
Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email
programs. Any time the group name is a recipient (-r or
--recipient), it will be expanded to the values speci&acirc;
<br>
fied. Multiple groups with the same name are automatically
merged into a single group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values are key IDs or
fingerprints, but any key description is accepted. Note that
a value with spaces in it will be treated as two different
values. Note also there <br>
is only one level of expansion --- you cannot make an group
that points to another group. When used from the command
line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to <br>
this option to prevent the shell from treating it as
multiple arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ungroup name <br>
Remove a given entry from the --group list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-groups <br>
Remove all entries from the --group list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local-user name <br>
-u Use name as the key to sign with. Note that this option
overrides --default-key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--try-all-secrets <br>
Don&rsquo;t look at the key ID as stored in the message but
try all secret keys in turn to find the right decryption
key. This option forces the behaviour as used by anonymous
<br>
recipients (created by using --throw-keyids or
--hidden-recipient) and might come handy in case where an
encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input and Output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--armor <br>
-a Create ASCII armored output. The default is to create the
binary OpenPGP format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-armor <br>
Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output file <br>
-o file <br>
Write output to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-output n <br>
This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be
generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports
various levels of compression, it is possible that <br>
the plaintext of a given message may be significantly larger
than the original OpenPGP message. While GnuPG works
properly with such messages, there is often a desire to <br>
set a maximum file size that will be generated before
processing is forced to stop by the OS limits. Defaults to
0, which means &quot;no limit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--import-options parameters <br>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options
for importing keys. Options can be prepended with a
&lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give the opposite meaning. The options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import-local-sigs <br>
Allow importing key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;.
This is not generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme
is being used. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep-ownertrust <br>
Normally possible still existing ownertrust values of a key
are cleared if a key is imported. This is in general
desirable so that a formerly deleted key does not <br>
automatically gain an ownertrust values merely due to
import. On the other hand it is sometimes necessary to
re-import a trusted set of keys again but keeping <br>
already assigned ownertrust values. This can be achieved by
using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repair-pks-subkey-bug <br>
During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the
PKS keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with
multiple subkeys. Note that this cannot com&acirc; <br>
pletely repair the damaged key as some crucial data is
removed by the keyserver, but it does at least give you back
one subkey. Defaults to no for regular --import <br>
and to yes for keyserver --recv-keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">merge-only <br>
During import, allow key updates to existing keys, but do
not allow any new keys to be imported. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import-clean <br>
After import, compact (remove all signatures except the
self-signature) any user IDs from the new key that are not
usable. Then, remove any signatures from the new <br>
key that are not usable. This includes signatures that were
issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This
option is the same as running the --edit-key <br>
command &quot;clean&quot; after import. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import-minimal <br>
Import the smallest key possible. This removes all
signatures except the most recent self-signature on each
user ID. This option is the same as running the --edit- <br>
key command &quot;minimize&quot; after import. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-options parameters <br>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options
for exporting keys. Options can be prepended with a
&lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give the opposite meaning. The options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-local-sigs <br>
Allow exporting key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;.
This is not generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme
is being used. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-attributes <br>
Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting. This
is useful to export keys if they are going to be used by an
OpenPGP program that does not accept <br>
attribute user IDs. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-sensitive-revkeys <br>
Include designated revoker information that was marked as
&quot;sensitive&quot;. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-reset-subkey-passwd <br>
When using the --export-secret-subkeys command, this option
resets the passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty.
This is useful when the exported subkey is to <br>
be used on an unattended machine where a passphrase
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make sense. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-clean <br>
Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key
being exported if the user IDs are not usable. Also, do not
export any signatures that are not usable. This <br>
includes signatures that were issued by keys that are not
present on the keyring. This option is the same as running
the --edit-key command &quot;clean&quot; before export <br>
except that the local copy of the key is not modified.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export-minimal <br>
Export the smallest key possible. This removes all
signatures except the most recent self-signature on each
user ID. This option is the same as running the --edit- <br>
key command &quot;minimize&quot; before export except that
the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-colons <br>
Print key listings delimited by colons. Note that the output
will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any --display-charset
setting. This format is useful when GnuPG is <br>
called from scripts and other programs as it is easily
machine parsed. The details of this format are documented in
the file &acirc;doc/DETAILS&acirc;, which is included in the
GnuPG <br>
source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fixed-list-mode <br>
Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in --with-colon
listing mode and print all timestamps as seconds since
1970-01-01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-fingerprint <br>
Same as the command --fingerprint but changes only the
format of the output and may be used together with another
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenPGP protocol specific
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --textmode <br>
--no-textmode <br>
Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP
canonical text form with standard &quot;CRLF&quot; line
endings. This also sets the necessary flags to inform the
recipient <br>
that the encrypted or signed data is text and may need its
line endings converted back to whatever the local system
uses. This option is useful when communicating between <br>
two platforms that have different line ending conventions
(UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc). --no-textmode
disables this option, and is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -t (but not --textmode) is
used together with armoring and signing, this enables
clearsigned messages. This kludge is needed for command-line
compatibility with com&acirc; <br>
mand-line versions of PGP; normally you would use --sign or
--clearsign to select the type of the signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-v3-sigs <br>
--no-force-v3-sigs <br>
OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4
signatures but PGP versions 5 through 7 only recognize v4
signatures on key material. This option forces v3
signa&acirc; <br>
tures for signatures on data. Note that this option implies
--no-ask-sig-expire, and unsets --sig-policy-url,
--sig-notation, and --sig-keyserver-url, as these features
<br>
cannot be used with v3 signatures. --no-force-v3-sigs
disables this option. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-v4-certs <br>
--no-force-v4-certs <br>
Always use v4 key signatures even on v3 keys. This option
also changes the default hash algorithm for v3 RSA keys from
MD5 to SHA-1. --no-force-v4-certs disables this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-mdc <br>
Force the use of encryption with a modification detection
code. This is always used with the newer ciphers (those with
a blocksize greater than 64 bits), or if all of the <br>
recipient keys indicate MDC support in their feature
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-mdc <br>
Disable the use of the modification detection code. Note
that by using this option, the encrypted message becomes
vulnerable to a message modification attack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--personal-cipher-preferences
string <br>
Set the list of personal cipher preferences to string. Use
gpg --version to get a list of available algorithms, and use
none to set no preference at all. This allows the <br>
user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an
algorithm that is usable by all recipients. The most highly
<br>
ranked cipher in this list is also used for the --symmetric
encryption command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--personal-digest-preferences
string <br>
Set the list of personal digest preferences to string. Use
gpg --version to get a list of available algorithms, and use
none to set no preference at all. This allows the <br>
user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an
algorithm that is usable by all recipients. The most highly
<br>
ranked digest algorithm in this list is also used when
signing without encryption (e.g. --clearsign or --sign).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--personal-compress-preferences
string <br>
Set the list of personal compression preferences to string.
Use gpg --version to get a list of available algorithms, and
use none to set no preference at all. This <br>
allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by
the recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an
algorithm that is usable by all recipients. The most <br>
highly ranked compression algorithm in this list is also
used when there are no recipient keys to consider (e.g.
--symmetric).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--s2k-cipher-algo name <br>
Use name as the cipher algorithm used to protect secret
keys. The default cipher is AES128. This cipher is also used
for conventional encryption if --personal-cipher- <br>
preferences and --cipher-algo is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--s2k-digest-algo name <br>
Use name as the digest algorithm used to mangle the
passphrases. The default algorithm is SHA-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--s2k-mode n <br>
Selects how passphrases are mangled. If n is 0 a plain
passphrase (which is not recommended) will be used, a 1 adds
a salt to the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates <br>
the whole process a number of times (see --s2k-count).
Unless --rfc1991 is used, this mode is also used for
conventional encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--s2k-count n <br>
Specify how many times the passphrase mangling is repeated.
This value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.
The default is inquired from gpg-agent. Note that <br>
not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if
an illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the
nearest legal value. This option is only meaningful if <br>
--s2k-mode is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compliance options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options control what GnuPG
is compliant to. Only one of these options may be active at
a time. Note that the default setting of this is nearly
always the correct one. See <br>
the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section
below before using one of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnupg <br>
Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP
behavior (see --openpgp), but with some additional
workarounds for common compatibility problems in different
ver&acirc; <br>
sions of PGP. This is the default option, so it is not
generally needed, but it may be useful to override a
different compliance option in the gpg.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--openpgp <br>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict
OpenPGP behavior. Use this option to reset all previous
options like --s2k-*, --cipher-algo, --digest-algo and
--com&acirc; <br>
press-algo to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP workarounds
are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rfc4880 <br>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict
RFC-4880 behavior. Note that this is currently the same
thing as --openpgp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rfc2440 <br>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict
RFC-2440 behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rfc1991 <br>
Try to be more RFC-1991 (PGP 2.x) compliant. This option is
deprecated will be removed in GnuPG 2.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp2 Set up all options to be
as PGP 2.x compliant as possible, and warn if an action is
taken (e.g. encrypting to a non-RSA key) that will create a
message that PGP 2.x will <br>
not be able to handle. Note that &lsquo;PGP 2.x&rsquo; here
means &lsquo;MIT PGP 2.6.2&rsquo;. There are other versions
of PGP 2.x available, but the MIT release is a good common
baseline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies --rfc1991
--disable-mdc --no-force-v4-certs <br>
--escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs
--allow-weak-digest-algos <br>
--cipher-algo IDEA --digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo ZIP. It
also disables --textmode when encrypting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is deprecated will
be removed in GnuPG 2.1. The reason for dropping PGP-2
support is that the PGP 2 format is not anymore considered
safe (for example due to <br>
the use of the broken MD5 algorithm). Note that the
decryption of PGP-2 created messages will continue to
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp6 Set up all options to be
as PGP 6 compliant as possible. This restricts you to the
ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is installed), 3DES, and
CAST5, the hashes MD5, SHA1 <br>
and RIPEMD160, and the compression algorithms none and ZIP.
This also disables --throw-keyids, and making signatures
with signing subkeys as PGP 6 does not understand sig&acirc;
<br>
natures made by signing subkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies
--disable-mdc --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp7 Set up all options to be
as PGP 7 compliant as possible. This is identical to --pgp6
except that MDCs are not disabled, and the list of allowable
ciphers is expanded to <br>
add AES128, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp8 Set up all options to be
as PGP 8 compliant as possible. PGP 8 is a lot closer to the
OpenPGP standard than previous versions of PGP, so all this
does is disable --throw- <br>
keyids and set --escape-from-lines. All algorithms are
allowed except for the SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512
digests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Doing things one usually
doesn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--dry-run <br>
Don&rsquo;t make any changes (this is not completely
implemented).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-only <br>
Changes the behaviour of some commands. This is like
--dry-run but different in some cases. The semantic of this
command may be extended in the future. Currently it only
<br>
skips the actual decryption pass and therefore enables a
fast listing of the encryption keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
--interactive <br>
Prompt before overwriting any files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-level level <br>
Select the debug level for investigating problems. level may
be a numeric value or by a keyword:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none No debugging at all. A
value of less than 1 may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basic Some basic debug messages.
A value between 1 and 2 may be used instead of the
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advanced <br>
More verbose debug messages. A value between 3 and 5 may be
used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expert Even more detailed
messages. A value between 6 and 8 may be used instead of the
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guru All of the debug messages
you can get. A value greater than 8 may be used instead of
the keyword. The creation of hash tracing files is only
enabled if the keyword <br>
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How these messages are mapped to
the actual debugging flags is not specified and may change
with newer releases of this program. They are however
carefully selected to best aid <br>
in debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug flags <br>
Set debugging flags. All flags are or-ed and flags may be
given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-all <br>
Set all useful debugging flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-ccid-driver <br>
Enable debug output from the included CCID driver for
smartcards. Note that this option is only available on some
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--faked-system-time epoch <br>
This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system
time back or forth to epoch which is the number of seconds
elapsed since the year 1970. Alternatively epoch may <br>
be given as a full ISO time string (e.g.
&quot;20070924T154812&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-progress-filter <br>
Enable certain PROGRESS status outputs. This option allows
frontends to display a progress indicator while gpg is
processing larger files. There is a slight performance <br>
overhead using it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status-fd n <br>
Write special status strings to the file descriptor n. See
the file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--status-file file <br>
Same as --status-fd, except the status data is written to
file file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logger-fd n <br>
Write log output to file descriptor n and not to STDERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file file <br>
--logger-file file <br>
Same as --logger-fd, except the logger data is written to
file file. Note that --log-file is only implemented for
GnuPG-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--attribute-fd n <br>
Write attribute subpackets to the file descriptor n. This is
most useful for use with --status-fd, since the status
messages are needed to separate out the various sub&acirc;
<br>
packets from the stream delivered to the file
descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--attribute-file file <br>
Same as --attribute-fd, except the attribute data is written
to file file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comment string <br>
--no-comments <br>
Use string as a comment string in clear text signatures and
ASCII armored messages or keys (see --armor). The default
behavior is not to use a comment string. --comment <br>
may be repeated multiple times to get multiple comment
strings. --no-comments removes all comments. It is a good
idea to keep the length of a single comment below 60 <br>
characters to avoid problems with mail programs wrapping
such lines. Note that comment lines, like all other header
lines, are not protected by the signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emit-version <br>
--no-emit-version <br>
Force inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored
output. If given once only the name of the program and the
major number is emitted, given twice the minor is also <br>
emitted, given triple the micro is added, and given quad an
operating system identification is also emitted.
--no-emit-version (default) disables the version line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sig-notation name=value <br>
--cert-notation name=value <br>
-N, --set-notation name=value <br>
Put the name value pair into the signature as notation data.
name must consist only of printable characters or spaces,
and must contain a &rsquo;@&rsquo; character in the form
key&acirc; <br>
name@domain.example.com (substituting the appropriate
keyname and domain name, of course). This is to help prevent
pollution of the IETF reserved notation namespace. The <br>
--expert flag overrides the &rsquo;@&rsquo; check. value may
be any printable string; it will be encoded in UTF8, so you
should check that your --display-charset is set correctly.
If <br>
you prefix name with an exclamation mark (!), the notation
data will be flagged as critical (rfc4880:5.2.3.16).
--sig-notation sets a notation for data signatures. --cert-
<br>
notation sets a notation for key signatures
(certifications). --set-notation sets both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are special codes that may
be used in notation names. &quot;%k&quot; will be expanded
into the key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%K&quot; into
the long key ID of the key being <br>
signed, &quot;%f&quot; into the fingerprint of the key being
signed, &quot;%s&quot; into the key ID of the key making the
signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long key ID of the key
making the signature, <br>
&quot;%g&quot; into the fingerprint of the key making the
signature (which might be a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the
fingerprint of the primary key of the key making the
signature, &quot;%c&quot; <br>
into the signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and
&quot;%%&quot; results in a single &quot;%&quot;. %k, %K,
and %f are only meaningful when making a key signature
(certification), and <br>
%c is only meaningful when using the OpenPGP smartcard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sig-policy-url string <br>
--cert-policy-url string <br>
--set-policy-url string <br>
Use string as a Policy URL for signatures
(rfc4880:5.2.3.20). If you prefix it with an exclamation
mark (!), the policy URL packet will be flagged as critical.
--sig-pol&acirc; <br>
icy-url sets a policy url for data signatures.
--cert-policy-url sets a policy url for key signatures
(certifications). --set-policy-url sets both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same %-expandos used for
notation data are available here as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sig-keyserver-url string <br>
Use string as a preferred keyserver URL for data signatures.
If you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the keyserver
URL packet will be flagged as critical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same %-expandos used for
notation data are available here as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-filename string <br>
Use string as the filename which is stored inside messages.
This overrides the default, which is to use the actual
filename of the file being encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--for-your-eyes-only <br>
--no-for-your-eyes-only <br>
Set the &lsquo;for your eyes only&rsquo; flag in the
message. This causes GnuPG to refuse to save the file unless
the --output option is given, and PGP to use a &quot;secure
viewer&quot; with a <br>
claimed Tempest-resistant font to display the message. This
option overrides --set-filename. --no-for-your-eyes-only
disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-embedded-filename <br>
--no-use-embedded-filename <br>
Try to create a file with a name as embedded in the data.
This can be a dangerous option as it enables overwriting
files. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cipher-algo name <br>
Use name as cipher algorithm. Running the program with the
command --version yields a list of supported algorithms. If
this is not used the cipher algorithm is selected <br>
from the preferences stored with the key. In general, you do
not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the
OpenPGP standard. --personal-cipher-preferences <br>
is the safe way to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--digest-algo name <br>
Use name as the message digest algorithm. Running the
program with the command --version yields a list of
supported algorithms. In general, you do not want to use
this <br>
option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
--personal-digest-preferences is the safe way to accomplish
the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compress-algo name <br>
Use compression algorithm name. &quot;zlib&quot; is RFC-1950
ZLIB compression. &quot;zip&quot; is RFC-1951 ZIP
compression which is used by PGP. &quot;bzip2&quot; is a
more modern compression scheme <br>
that can compress some things better than zip or zlib, but
at the cost of more memory used during compression and
decompression. &quot;uncompressed&quot; or &quot;none&quot;
disables compres&acirc; <br>
sion. If this option is not used, the default behavior is to
examine the recipient key preferences to see which
algorithms the recipient supports. If all else fails, ZIP
<br>
is used for maximum compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZLIB may give better compression
results than ZIP, as the compression window size is not
limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better compression
results than that, but will <br>
use a significantly larger amount of memory while
compressing and decompressing. This may be significant in
low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all
versions) <br>
only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other
than ZIP or &quot;none&quot; will make the message
unreadable with PGP. In general, you do not want to use this
option as it <br>
allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
--personal-compress-preferences is the safe way to
accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cert-digest-algo name <br>
Use name as the message digest algorithm used when signing a
key. Running the program with the command --version yields a
list of supported algorithms. Be aware that if <br>
you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports but other
OpenPGP implementations do not, then some users will not be
able to use the key signatures you make, or quite
possi&acirc; <br>
bly your entire key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-cipher-algo name <br>
Never allow the use of name as cipher algorithm. The given
name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm
will still get disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-pubkey-algo name <br>
Never allow the use of name as public key algorithm. The
given name will not be checked so that a later loaded
algorithm will still get disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--throw-keyids <br>
--no-throw-keyids <br>
Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages.
This helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a
limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. ([Using
<br>
a little social engineering anyone who is able to decrypt
the message can check whether one of the other recipients is
the one he suspects.]) On the receiving side, it <br>
may slow down the decryption process because all available
secret keys must be tried. --no-throw-keyids disables this
option. This option is essentially the same as using <br>
--hidden-recipient for all recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--not-dash-escaped <br>
This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so
that they can be used for patch files. You should not send
such an armored file via email because all spaces <br>
and line endings are hashed too. You can not use this option
for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a line,
patch files don&rsquo;t have this. A special armor header
<br>
line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--escape-from-lines <br>
--no-escape-from-lines <br>
Because some mailers change lines starting with &quot;From
&quot; to &quot;&gt;From &quot; it is good to handle such
lines in a special way when creating cleartext signatures to
prevent the mail <br>
system from breaking the signature. Note that all other PGP
versions do it this way too. Enabled by default.
--no-escape-from-lines disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passphrase-repeat n <br>
Specify how many times gpg will request a new passphrase be
repeated. This is useful for helping memorize a passphrase.
Defaults to 1 repetition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passphrase-fd n <br>
Read the passphrase from file descriptor n. Only the first
line will be read from file descriptor n. If you use 0 for
n, the passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can <br>
only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passphrase-file file <br>
Read the passphrase from file file. Only the first line will
be read from file file. This can only be used if only one
passphrase is supplied. Obviously, a passphrase <br>
stored in a file is of questionable security if other users
can read this file. Don&rsquo;t use this option if you can
avoid it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passphrase string <br>
Use string as the passphrase. This can only be used if only
one passphrase is supplied. Obviously, this is of very
questionable security on a multi-user system. Don&rsquo;t
use <br>
this option if you can avoid it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--command-fd n <br>
This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC
mode. If this option is enabled, user input on questions is
not expected from the TTY but from the given file <br>
descriptor. It should be used together with --status-fd. See
the file doc/DETAILS in the source distribution for details
on how to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--command-file file <br>
Same as --command-fd, except the commands are read out of
file file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-non-selfsigned-uid <br>
--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid <br>
Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not
self-signed. This is not recommended, as a non self-signed
user ID is trivial to forge. --no-allow-non-self&acirc; <br>
signed-uid disables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-freeform-uid <br>
Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while
generating a new one. This option should only be used in
very special environments as it does not ensure the de-facto
<br>
standard format of user IDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-time-conflict <br>
GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with
keys and signatures have plausible values. However,
sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to
<br>
clock problems. This option makes these checks just a
warning. See also --ignore-valid-from for timestamp issues
on subkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-valid-from <br>
GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in
the future. This option allows the use of such keys and thus
exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not <br>
use this option unless there is some clock problem. See also
--ignore-time-conflict for timestamp issues with
signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-crc-error <br>
The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC
checksum against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC
gets mangled somewhere on the transmission channel but the
<br>
actual content (which is protected by the OpenPGP protocol
anyway) is still okay. This option allows GnuPG to ignore
CRC errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-mdc-error <br>
This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into
a warning. This can be useful if a message is partially
corrupt, but it is necessary to get as much data as <br>
possible out of the corrupt message. However, be aware that
a MDC protection failure may also mean that the message was
tampered with intentionally by an attacker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-weak-digest-algos <br>
Signatures made with known-weak digest algorithms are
normally rejected with an &lsquo;&lsquo;invalid digest
algorithm&rsquo;&rsquo; message. This option allows the
verification of signatures <br>
made with such weak algorithms. MD5 is the only digest
algorithm considered weak by default. See also --weak-digest
to reject other digest algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--weak-digest name <br>
Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak. Signatures
made over weak digests algorithms are normally rejected.
This option can be supplied multiple times if multiple <br>
algorithms should be considered weak. See also
--allow-weak-digest-algos to disable rejection of weak
digests. MD5 is always considered weak, and does not need to
be <br>
listed explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-default-keyring <br>
Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings.
Note that GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if
you use this option and do not provide alternate <br>
keyrings via --keyring or --secret-keyring, then GnuPG will
still use the default public or secret keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-verify <br>
Skip the signature verification step. This may be used to
make the decryption faster if the signature verification is
not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-key-data <br>
Print key listings delimited by colons (like --with-colons)
and print the public key data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fast-list-mode <br>
Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this
is achieved by leaving some parts empty. Some applications
don&rsquo;t need the user ID and the trust information <br>
given in the listings. By using this options they can get a
faster listing. The exact behaviour of this option may
change in future versions. If you are missing some <br>
information, don&rsquo;t use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-literal <br>
This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what
it might be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-filesize <br>
This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what
it might be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-session-key <br>
Display the session key used for one message. See
--override-session-key for the counterpart of this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We think that Key Escrow is a
Bad Thing; however the user should have the freedom to
decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the content of
one specific message with&acirc; <br>
out compromising all messages ever encrypted for one secret
key. DON&rsquo;T USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO
SO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override-session-key string
<br>
Don&rsquo;t use the public key but the session key string.
The format of this string is the same as the one printed by
--show-session-key. This option is normally not used but
<br>
comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the content
of an encrypted message; using this option you can do this
without handing out the secret key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-sig-expire <br>
--no-ask-sig-expire <br>
When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time.
If this option is not specified, the expiration time set via
--default-sig-expire is used. --no-ask-sig-expire <br>
disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-sig-expire <br>
The default expiration time to use for signature expiration.
Valid values are &quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number
followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for
<br>
months), or y (for years) (for example &quot;2m&quot; for
two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five years), or an
absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to
&quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-cert-expire <br>
--no-ask-cert-expire <br>
When making a key signature, prompt for an expiration time.
If this option is not specified, the expiration time set via
--default-cert-expire is used. --no-ask-cert- <br>
expire disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-cert-expire <br>
The default expiration time to use for key signature
expiration. Valid values are &quot;0&quot; for no
expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days), w
(for weeks), m <br>
(for months), or y (for years) (for example &quot;2m&quot;
for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for five years), or an
absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to
&quot;0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-secret-key-import <br>
This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-multiple-messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-allow-multiple-messages
<br>
Allow processing of multiple OpenPGP messages contained in a
single file or stream. Some programs that call GPG are not
prepared to deal with multiple messages being pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed together, so this option defaults to no. Note that
versions of GPG prior to 1.4.7 always allowed multiple
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Do not use this option
unless you need it as a temporary workaround!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-special-filenames <br>
This options enables a mode in which filenames of the form
&acirc;-&amp;n&acirc;, where n is a non-negative decimal
number, refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file
with that <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-expensive-trust-checks <br>
Experimental use only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-permissions <br>
Don&rsquo;t change the permissions of a secret keyring back
to user read/write only. Use this option only if you really
know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-preference-list string
<br>
Set the list of default preferences to string. This
preference list is used for new keys and becomes the default
for &quot;setpref&quot; in the edit menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-keyserver-url name
<br>
Set the default keyserver URL to name. This keyserver will
be used as the keyserver URL when writing a new
self-signature on a key, which includes key generation and
<br>
changing preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-config <br>
Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG.
This option is intended for external programs that call
GnuPG to perform tasks, and is thus not generally use&acirc;
<br>
ful. See the file &acirc;doc/DETAILS&acirc; in the source
distribution for the details of which configuration items
may be listed. --list-config is only usable with
--with-colons set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gpgconf-list <br>
This command is similar to --list-config but in general only
internally used by the gpgconf tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gpgconf-test <br>
This is more or less dummy action. However it parses the
configuration file and returns with failure if the
configuration file would prevent gpg from startup. Thus it
<br>
may be used to run a syntax check on the configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--load-extension name <br>
Load an extension module. If name does not contain a slash
it is searched for in the directory configured when GnuPG
was built (generally &quot;/usr/local/lib/gnupg&quot;).
Exten&acirc; <br>
sions are not generally useful anymore, and the use of this
option is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-photos <br>
--no-show-photos <br>
Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs, --list-public-keys,
--list-secret-keys, and verifying a signature to also
display the photo ID attached to the key, if any. See also
<br>
--photo-viewer. These options are deprecated. Use
--list-options [no-]show-photos and/or --verify-options
[no-]show-photos instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-keyring <br>
Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show
which keyring a given key resides on. This option is
deprecated: use --list-options [no-]show-keyring
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ctapi-driver file <br>
Use file to access the smartcard reader. The current default
is &lsquo;libtowitoko.so&rsquo;. Note that the use of this
interface is deprecated; it may be removed in future
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--always-trust <br>
Identical to --trust-model always. This option is
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-notation <br>
--no-show-notation <br>
Show signature notations in the --list-sigs or --check-sigs
listings as well as when verifying a signature with a
notation in it. These options are deprecated. Use --list-
<br>
options [no-]show-notation and/or --verify-options
[no-]show-notation instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-policy-url <br>
--no-show-policy-url <br>
Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs or --check-sigs listings
as well as when verifying a signature with a policy URL in
it. These options are deprecated. Use --list- <br>
options [no-]show-policy-url and/or --verify-options
[no-]show-policy-url instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
gpg -se -r Bob file <br>
sign and encrypt for user Bob</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --clearsign file <br>
make a clear text signature</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg -sb file <br>
make a detached signature</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg -u 0x12345678 -sb file <br>
make a detached signature with the key 0x12345678</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --list-keys user_ID <br>
show keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --fingerprint user_ID <br>
show fingerprint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg --verify pgpfile <br>
gpg --verify sigfile <br>
Verify the signature of the file but do not output the data.
The second form is used for detached signatures, where
sigfile is the detached signature (either ASCII armored <br>
or binary) and are the signed data; if this is not given,
the name of the file holding the signed data is constructed
by cutting off the extension (&quot;.asc&quot; or
&quot;.sig&quot;) of <br>
sigfile or by asking the user for the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID <br>
There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some
of them are only valid for gpg others are only good for
gpgsm. Here is the entire list of ways to specify a key:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By key Id. <br>
This format is deduced from the length of the string and its
content or 0x prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are
the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint. The <br>
use of key Ids is just a shortcut, for all automated
processing the fingerprint should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using gpg an exclamation
mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified
primary or secondary key and not to try and calculate which
primary or secondary key to <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last four lines of the
example give the key ID in their long form as internally
used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the long key ID
using the option --with- <br>
colons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">234567C4 <br>
0F34E556E <br>
01347A56A <br>
0xAB123456</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">234AABBCC34567C4 <br>
0F323456784E56EAB <br>
01AB3FED1347A5612 <br>
0x234AABBCC34567C4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By fingerprint. <br>
This format is deduced from the length of the string and its
content or the 0x prefix. Note, that only the 20 byte
version fingerprint is available with gpgsm (i.e. the <br>
SHA-1 hash of the certificate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using gpg an exclamation
mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified
primary or secondary key and not to try and calculate which
primary or secondary key to <br>
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The best way to specify a key Id
is by using the fingerprint. This avoids any ambiguities in
case that there are duplicated key IDs.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1234343434343434C434343434343434
<br>
123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434 <br>
0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434 <br>
0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpgsm also accepts colons
between each pair of hexadecimal digits because this is the
de-facto standard on how to present X.509 fingerprints. gpg
also allows the use of the <br>
space separated SHA-1 fingerprint as printed by the key
listing commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By exact match on OpenPGP user
ID. <br>
This is denoted by a leading equal sign. It does not make
sense for X.509 certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=Heinrich Heine
&lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By exact match on an email
address. <br>
This is indicated by enclosing the email address in the
usual way with left and right angles.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By word match. <br>
All words must match exactly (not case sensitive) but can
appear in any order in the user ID or a subjects name. Words
are any sequences of letters, digits, the under&acirc; <br>
score and all characters with bit 7 set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+Heinrich Heine duesseldorf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By exact match on the
subject&rsquo;s DN. <br>
This is indicated by a leading slash, directly followed by
the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the subject. Note that you
can&rsquo;t use the string printed by &quot;gpgsm
--list-keys&quot; <br>
because that one as been reordered and modified for better
readability; use --with-colons to print the raw (but
standard escaped) RFC-2253 string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/CN=Heinrich
Heine,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By exact match on the
issuer&rsquo;s DN. <br>
This is indicated by a leading hash mark, directly followed
by a slash and then directly followed by the rfc2253 encoded
DN of the issuer. This should return the Root <br>
cert of the issuer. See note above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#/CN=Root
Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By exact match on serial number

issuer. See <br>
note above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#4F03/CN=Root

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By keygrip <br>
This is indicated by an ampersand followed by the 40 hex
digits of a keygrip. gpgsm prints the keygrip when using the
command --dump-cert. It does not yet work for <br>
OpenPGP keys.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;D75F22C3F86E355877348498CDC92BD21010A480</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By substring match. <br>
This is the default mode but applications may want to
explicitly indicate this by putting the asterisk in front.
Match is not case sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Heine <br>
*Heine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that we have reused
the hash mark identifier which was used in old GnuPG
versions to indicate the so called local-id. It is not
anymore used and there should be no <br>
conflict when used with X.509 stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs
has the drawback that it is not possible to map them back to
the original encoding, however we don&rsquo;t have to do
this because our key database <br>
stores this encoding as meta data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
There are a few configuration files to control certain
aspects of gpg&rsquo;s operation. Unless noted, they are
expected in the current home directory (see: [option
--homedir]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg.conf <br>
This is the standard configuration file read by gpg on
startup. It may contain any valid long option; the leading
two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be <br>
abbreviated. This default name may be changed on the command
line (see: [gpg-option --options]). You should backup this
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on larger
installations, it is useful to put predefined files into the
directory &acirc;/etc/skel/.gnupg/&acirc; so that newly
created users start up with a working configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For internal purposes gpg
creates and maintains a few other files; They all live in in
the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]). Only
the gpg may modify these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg <br>
The public keyring. You should backup this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock <br>
The lock file for the public keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx <br>
~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock <br>
A public keyring and its lock file used by GnuPG versions
&gt;= 2. It is ignored by GnuPG 1.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/secring.gpg <br>
The secret keyring. You should backup this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg <br>
The trust database. There is no need to backup this file; it
is better to backup the ownertrust values (see: [option
--export-ownertrust]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock <br>
The lock file for the trust database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/random_seed <br>
A file used to preserve the state of the internal random
pool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock <br>
The lock file for the secret keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/ <br>
This is the directory where gpg stores pre-generated
revocation certificates. The file name corresponds to the
OpenPGP fingerprint of the respective key. It is suggested
<br>
to backup those certificates and if the primary private key
is not stored on the disk to move them to an external
storage device. Anyone who can access theses files is <br>
able to revoke the corresponding key. You may want to print
them out. You should backup all files in this directory and
take care to keep this backup closed away.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr[/local]/share/gnupg/options.skel
<br>
The skeleton options file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr[/local]/lib/gnupg/ <br>
Default location for extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operation is further controlled
by a few environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Used to locate the default
home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUPGHOME <br>
If set directory used instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPG_AGENT_INFO <br>
Used to locate the gpg-agent. This is only honored when
--use-agent is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value consists of 3 colon
delimited fields: The first is the path to the Unix Domain
Socket, the second the PID of the gpg-agent and the protocol
version which should <br>
be set to 1. When starting the gpg-agent as described in its
documentation, this variable is set to the correct value.
The option --gpg-agent-info can be used to override <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PINENTRY_USER_DATA <br>
This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry. It is useful
to convey extra information to a custom pinentry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
LINES Used to size some displays to the full size of the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANGUAGE <br>
Apart from its use by GNU, it is used in the W32 version to
override the language selection done through the Registry.
If used and set to a valid and available language <br>
name (langid), the file with the translation is loaded
from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpgdir/gnupg.nls/langid.mo. Here
gpgdir is the directory out of which the gpg binary has been
loaded. If it can&rsquo;t be loaded the Registry is tried
and as last resort the <br>
native Windows locale system is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On older systems this program should be installed as
setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages.
Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from
writing memory <br>
pages (which may contain passphrases or other sensitive
material) to disk. If you get no warning message about
insecure memory your operating system supports locking
without <br>
being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as
locked memory is allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that some systems
(especially laptops) have the ability to
&lsquo;&lsquo;suspend to disk&rsquo;&rsquo; (also known as
&lsquo;&lsquo;safe sleep&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;hibernate&rsquo;&rsquo;). This writes all
memory to disk before <br>
going into a low power or even powered off mode. Unless
measures are taken in the operating system to protect the
saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be
<br>
recoverable from it later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you report a bug you
should first search the mailing list archives for similar
problems and second check whether such a bug has already
been reported to our bug tracker at <br>
