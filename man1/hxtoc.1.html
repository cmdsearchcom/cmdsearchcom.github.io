<p>HXTOC(1) HTML-XML-utils HXTOC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hxtoc - insert a table of contents in an HTML file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hxtoc [ -x ] [ -l low ] [ -h high ] [ -t ] [ -d ] [ -c class
] [ -f ] [ file-or-URL ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The hxtoc command reads an HTML file, inserts missing ID
attributes in all H1 to H6 elements between the levels -l
and -h (unless the option -d is in effect, see below) and
also <br>
inserts A elements with NAME attributes, so old browsers
will recognize the H1 to H6 headers as target anchors as
well (unless the option -t is in effect). The output is
written <br>
to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a comment of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;!--toc--&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or a pair of comments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;!--begin-toc--&gt; <br>
... <br>
&lt;!--end-toc--&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the comment, or the pair
with everything in between, will be replaced by a table of
contents, consisting of a list (UL) of links to all headers
in the document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text of headers is copied to
this table of contents, including any inline markup, except
that ID attributes, DFN tags and SPAN tags with a CLASS of
&quot;index&quot; are omitted (but <br>
the elements&rsquo; content is copied).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The copied text can optionally
be &quot;flattened&quot; first, see option -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a header has a CLASS
attribute with as value (or one of its values) the keyword
&quot;no-toc&quot;, then that header will not appear in the
table of contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Use XML conventions: empty
elements are written with a slash at the end: &lt;IMG
/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l low Sets the lowest numbered
header to appear in the table of content. Default is 1
(i.e., H1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h high Sets the highest
numbered header to appear in the table of content. Default
is 6 (i.e., H6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Normally, hxtoc adds both ID
attributes and empty A elements with a NAME attribute and
CLASS=&quot;bctarget&quot;, so that older browsers that do
no understand ID will still find <br>
the target. With this option, the A elements will not be
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c class The generated UL
elements in the table of contents will have a CLASS
attribute with the value class. The default is
&quot;toc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Tries to use sectioning
elements as targets in the table of contents instead of H1
to H6. A sectioning elements is a DIV, SECTION, ARTICLE,
ASIDE or NAV element whose <br>
first child is a heading element (H1 to H6) or an HGROUP.
The sectioning element will be given an ID if it
doesn&rsquo;t have one yet. With this option, the level of
any H1 <br>
to H6 that is the first child of a sectioning element (or of
an HGROUP that is itself the first child of a sectioning
element) is not determined by its name, but by the <br>
nesting depth of the sectioning elements. (Any H1 to H6 that
are not the first child of a sectioning element still have
their level implied by their name.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Flatten the text of the table
of contents. Without -f, the contents of header elements are
copied to the table of contents almost unchanged, i.e.,
including any child <br>
elements and their attributes (except for ID attributes, DFN
elements and certain SPAN elements, as explained above).
With -f, the contents are flattened instead: All <br>
child elements are removed and only their contents are
copied to the table of contents. Additionally elements with
an ALT attribute, such as IMG, are replaced by the <br>
contents of the ALT attribute. Exception: BDO tags are
copied unchanged and elements with a DIR attribute are
replaced by a SPAN with that DIR attribute. (BDO and DIR
<br>
may occur in languages written right-to-left.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand is supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file-or-URL <br>
The name or URL of an HTML file. If absent, standard input
is read instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following exit values are returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; 0 An error occurred in the
parsing of the HTML file. hxtoc will try to correct the
error and produce output anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The error recovery for incorrect HTML is primitive.</p>
