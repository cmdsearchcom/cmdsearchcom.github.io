<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
winedump - A Wine DLL tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
winedump [-h | sym sym | spec dll | dump file ]
[mode_options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
winedump is a Wine tool which aims to help: <br>
A: Reimplementing a Win32 DLL for use within Wine, or <br>
B: Compiling a Win32 application with Winelib that uses x86
DLLs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For both tasks in order to be
able to link to the Win functions some <br>
glue code is needed. This &rsquo;glue&rsquo; comes in the
form of a .spec file. <br>
The .spec file, along with some dummy code, is used to
create a <br>
Wine .so corresponding to the Windows DLL. The winebuild
program <br>
can then resolve calls made to DLL functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating a .spec file is a
labour intensive task during which it is <br>
easy to make a mistake. The idea of winedump is to automate
this task <br>
and create the majority of the support code needed for your
DLL. In <br>
addition you can have winedump create code to help you
re-implement a <br>
DLL, by providing tracing of calls to the DLL, and (in some
cases) <br>
automatically determining the parameters, calling
conventions, and <br>
return values of the DLL functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another use for this tool is to
display (dump) information about a 32bit <br>
DLL or PE format image file. When used in this way winedump
functions <br>
similarly to tools such as pedump provided by many Win32
compiler <br>
vendors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally winedump can be also
used to demangle C++ symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
winedump can be used in several different modes. The first
argument to the program determines the mode winedump will
run in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help mode. Basic usage help
is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump To dump the contents of a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spec For generating .spec files
and stub DLLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sym Symbol mode. Used to
demangle C++ symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Mode options depend on the mode given as the first
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help mode: <br>
No options are used. <br>
The program prints the help info and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Dumps the contents of file.
Various file formats are supported <br>
(PE, NE, LE, Minidumps, .lnk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Turns on symbol
demangling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Dumps file header
information. <br>
This option dumps only the standard PE header structures,
<br>
along with the COFF sections available in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j dir_name <br>
Dumps only the content of directory dir_name, for files <br>
which header points to directories. <br>
For PE files, currently the import, export, debug, resource,
<br>
tls and clr directories are implemented. <br>
For NE files, currently the export and resource directories
are <br>
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Dumps everything. <br>
This command prints all available information (including all
<br>
available directories - see -j option) about the file. You
may <br>
wish to pipe the output through more/less or into a file,
since <br>
a lot of output will be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Dumps contents of debug
section if any (for now, only stabs <br>
information is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spec mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dll Use dll for input file and
generate implementation code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dir Look for prototypes in
dir (implies -c). In the case of <br>
Windows DLLs, this could be either the standard include <br>
directory from your compiler, or a SDK include directory.
<br>
If you have a text document with prototypes (such as <br>
documentation) that can be used also, however you may need
<br>
to delete some non-code lines to ensure that prototypes are
<br>
parsed correctly. <br>
The dir argument can also be a file specification (e.g. <br>
include/*). If it contains wildcards you must quote it to
<br>
prevent the shell from expanding it. <br>
If you have no prototypes, specify /dev/null as dir. <br>
winedump may still be able to generate some working stub
<br>
code for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Generate skeleton code
(requires -I). <br>
This option tells winedump to create function stubs for each
<br>
function in the DLL. As winedump reads each exported symbol
<br>
from the source DLL, it first tries to demangle the name. If
<br>
the name is a C++ symbol, the arguments, class and return
<br>
value are all encoded into the symbol name. Winedump <br>
converts this information into a C function prototype. If
<br>
this fails, the file(s) specified in the -I argument are
<br>
scanned for a function prototype. If one is found it is used
<br>
for the next step of the process, code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t TRACE arguments (implies -c).
<br>
This option produces the same code as -c, except that <br>
arguments are printed out when the function is called. <br>
Structs that are passed by value are printed as
&quot;struct&quot;, <br>
and functions that take variable argument lists print
&quot;...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f dll Forward calls to dll
(implies -t). <br>
This is the most complicated level of code generation. The
<br>
same code is generated as -t, however support is added for
<br>
forwarding calls to another DLL. The DLL to forward to is
<br>
given as dll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Generate documentation. <br>
By default, winedump generates a standard comment at the
<br>
header of each function it generates. Passing this option
<br>
makes winedump output a full header template for standard
<br>
Wine documentation, listing the parameters and return value
<br>
of the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o name <br>
Set the output dll name (default: dll). <br>
By default, if winedump is run on DLL foo, it creates <br>
files foo.spec, foo_main.c etc, and prefixes any <br>
functions generated with FOO_. If -o bar is given, <br>
these will become bar.spec, bar_main.c and BAR_ <br>
respectively. <br>
This option is mostly useful when generating a forwarding
DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Assume __cdecl calls
(default: __stdcall). <br>
If winebuild cannot determine the calling convention, <br>
__stdcall is used by default, unless this option has <br>
been given. <br>
Unless -q is given, a warning will be printed for every <br>
function that winedump determines the calling convention
<br>
for and which does not match the assumed calling
convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s num Start prototype search
after symbol num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e num End prototype search
after symbol num. <br>
By passing the -s or -e options you can have winedump try to
<br>
generate code for only some functions in your DLL. This may
<br>
be used to generate a single function, for example, if you
<br>
wanted to add functionality to an existing DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S symfile <br>
Search only prototype names found in symfile. <br>
If you want to only generate code for a subset of exported
<br>
functions from your source DLL, you can use this option to
<br>
provide a text file containing the names of the symbols to
<br>
extract, one per line. Only the symbols present in this file
<br>
will be used in your output DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Don&rsquo;t show progress
(quiet). <br>
No output is printed unless a fatal error is
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Show lots of detail while
working (verbose). <br>
There are 3 levels of output while winedump is running. The
<br>
default level, when neither -q or -v are given, prints the
<br>
number of exported functions found in the dll, followed by
<br>
the name of each function as it is processed, and a status
<br>
indication of whether it was processed OK. With -v given, a
<br>
lot of information is dumped while winedump works: this is
<br>
intended to help debug any problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sym mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sym Demangles C++ symbol sym and
then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
function_grep.pl <br>
Perl script used to retrieve a function prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files output in spec mode for
foo.dll: <br>
foo.spec <br>
This is the .spec file. <br>
foo_dll.h <br>
foo_main.c <br>
These are the source code files containing the minimum set
<br>
of code to build a stub DLL. The C file contains one <br>
function, FOO_Init, which does nothing (but must be <br>
present). <br>
Makefile.in <br>
This is a template for configure to produce a makefile. It
<br>
is designed for a DLL that will be inserted into the Wine
<br>
source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
C++ name demangling is not fully in sync with the
implementation in msvcrt. It might be useful to submit your
C++ name to the testsuite for msvcrt.</p>
