<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
r.viewshed is a module that computes the viewshed of a point
on a raster terrain. That is, given an elevation raster, and
the location of an observer, it generates a raster
out&acirc; <br>
put map showing which cells are visible from the given
location. The algorithm underlying r.viewshed minimizes both
the CPU operations and the transfer of data between main
mem&acirc; <br>
ory and disk; as a result r.viewshed runs fast on very large
rasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
To run r.viewshed, the user must specify an input elevation
map name, an output raster map name, and the location of the
viewpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the time being the viewpoint
(coordinates parameter) is assumed to be located inside the
terrain. The viewpoint location is given in map
coordinates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output raster map may have
one of three possible formats, based on which flags are
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, if no flag is set,
the output is in angle-mode, and each point in the output
map is marked as NULL if the point is not visible or the
respective point in the eleva&acirc; <br>
tion map is NULL. Otherwise, a value in [0, 180]
representing the vertical angle with regard to the
viewpoint, in degrees, if the point is visible. A value of 0
is directly <br>
below the specified viewing position, 90 is due horizontal.
The angle to the cell containing the viewing position is
undefined and set to 180.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -b flag is set, the
output is in boolean-mode, and each point in the output map
is marked as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 0 if the point
is no-data/null or not visible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 1 if the point
is visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -e flag is set, the
output is in elevation-mode, and each point in the output
map is marked as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; no-data (null),
if the respective point in the elevation map is no-data
(null)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; -1, if the point
is not visible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the difference
in elevation between the point and the viewpoint, if the
point is visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to identify the area
of the map which is within the search radius but not
visible, a combination of r.buffer and r.mapcalc can be used
to create a negative of the <br>
viewshed map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the elevations are
not adjusted for the curvature of the earth. The user can
turn this on with flag -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the observer is
assumed to have height 1.75 map units above the terrain. The
user can change this using option observer_elevation. The
value entered is in the same <br>
units as the elevation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the target is assumed
to have height of 0 map units above the terrain. The user
can change this using option target_elevation to determine
if objects of a given <br>
height would be visible. The value entered is in the same
units as the elevation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default there is no
restriction on the maximum distance to which the observer
can see. The user can set a maximum distance of visibility
using option max_distance. The value <br>
entered is in the same units as the cell size of the
raster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main memory usage: By default
r.viewshed assumes it has 500MB of main memory, and sets up
its internal data structures so that it does not require
more than this amount of RAM. <br>
The user can set the amount of memory used by the program by
setting the memory_usage to the number of MB of memory they
would like to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory mode <br>
The algorithm can run in two modes: in internal memory,
which means that it keeps all necessary data structures in
memory during the computation. And in external memory, which
<br>
means that the data structures are external, i.e. on disk.
r.viewshed decides which mode to run in using the amount of
main memory specified by the user. The internal mode is <br>
(much) faster than the external mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ideally, the user should specify
on the command line the amount of physical memory that is
free for the program to use. Underestimating the memory may
result in r.viewshed run&acirc; <br>
ning in external mode instead of internal, which is slower.
Overestimating the amount of free memory may result in
r.viewshed running in internal mode and using virtual
memory, <br>
which is slower than the external mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The algorithm <br>
r.viewshed uses the following model for determining
visibility: The height of a cell is assumed to be variable,
and the actual height of a point falling into a cell, but
not <br>
identical the cell center, is interpolated. Thus the terrain
is viewed as a smooth surface. Two points are visible to
each other if their line-of-sight does not intersect the
<br>
terrain. The height for an arbitrary point x in the terrain
is interpolated from the 4 surrounding neighbours. This
means that this model does a bilinear interpolation of <br>
heights. This model is suitable for both low and high
resolution rasters as well as terrain with flat and steep
slopes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The core of the algorithm is
determining, for each cell, the line-of-sight and its
intersections with the cells in the terrain. For a (square)
grid of n cells, there can be O(n <br>
1/2) cells that intersect the LOS. If we test every single
such cell for every point in the grid, this adds up to
O(n3/2) tests. We can do all these tests faster if we re-use
<br>
information from one point to the next (two grid points that
are close to each other will be intersected by a lot of the
same points) and organize the computation differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More precisely, the algorithm
uses a technique called line sweeping: It considers a
half-line centered at the viewpoint, and rotates it radially
around the viewpoint, 360 <br>
degrees. During the sweep it keeps track of all the cells
that intersect the sweep line at that time; These are called
the active cells. A cell has 3 associated events: when it
<br>
is first met by the sweep line and inserted into the active
structure; when it is last met by the sweep line and deleted
from the active structure; and when the sweep line passes
<br>
over its centerpoint, at which time its visibility is
determined. To determine the visibility of a cell all cells
that intersect the line-of-sight must be active, so they are
in <br>
the active structure. The algorithm looks at all the active
cells that are between the point and the viewpoint, and
finds the maximum gradient among these. If the cell&acirc;s
gradi&acirc; <br>
ent is higher, it is marked as visible, whereas if it is
lower, it is marked as invisible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a (square) raster of n point
in total, the standard viewshed algorithm uses O(n sqrt(n))=
O(n3/2) time, while the sweep-line algorithm uses O(n lg n)
time. This algorithm is <br>
efficient in terms of CPU operations and can be also made
efficient in terms of I/O-operations. For all details see
the REFERENCES below.</p>
