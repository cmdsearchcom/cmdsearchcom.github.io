dbmixer - Mixer application for the DBMix sound system

<b>dbmixer</b> is an advanced mixer application to control various audio
  channels. It is part of the DBMix sound system and requires a running
  <b>dbfsd</b>. The user interface is devided into four parts: the <i>channel
  boxes</i>, one for each channel, on the top left, the <i>crossfader box</i>
  below, the <i>sample editor box</i> right of the channel boxes, and the
  <i>controls box</i> to the far right. Each of them is described in detail
  below.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHANNEL_BOX_COMPONENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CHANNEL_BOX_COMPONENTS">CHANNEL
  BOX COMPONENTS</a></h1>
The list box on top assigns each channel to a particular input device.
  <i>Pause</i> and <i>Mute</i> buttons below are pretty self-descriptive.
  <i>Cue</i> redirects the channel to the cueing device and is only enabled if
  <b>dbfsd</b> has been started with the <i>-c</i> option. The buttons labelled
  <i>Once</i> and <i>Loop</i> act in conjunction with the sample editor (see
  below). They play or loop respectively a short, pre-recorded sample on the
  current channel. To adjust the channel's <i>volume</i>, move the vertical
  slider up and down. (The number on top of the slider is a bit misleading--100
  means absolute silence while it shows 0 when the volume is at its maximum.) A
  horizontal slider controls the <i>pitch</i> of the sound output. The row of
  buttons below resets the speed to 100 per cent (middle button), or alters the
  speed by five per cent in either direction (left and right buttons). The
  bottom row, finally, comprises of the <i>Pitch Sync</i> buttons. While being
  pressed, they temporarily slow down ( <i>-S</i>), pause ( <i>.]S[.</i>), or
  speed up ( <i>S+</i>) the sound. The purpose of these three buttons is to
  assist in beat matching: First use the pitch control to adjust two songs to
  the same speed, the use the sync buttons to match the beats.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CROSSFADING_BOX_COMPONENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CROSSFADING_BOX_COMPONENTS">CROSSFADING
  BOX COMPONENTS</a></h1>
The crossfader comprises of three parts, the fader slider itself, and the two
  channel selectors, one on each side of the fader. To crossfade, first select
  the channels to fade between in the channel selectors. Then move the fader
  slider to the desired position, or push one of the autofade buttons to the
  right. <i>&lt;</i> fades to the left, <i>/\</i> centres the fader, and
  <i>&gt;</i> fades to the right. A slider labelled <i>Autofade Spd.</i>
  controls the autofade speed. It is actually located in the controls box, but
  belongs to the crossfader, really. The value of this slider is the fade time
  from end to end in seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To either side of the crossfader channel selectors there are buttons that say
  <i>Punch</i>. Doing so sets the volume for the selected crossfader channel to
  maximum. When the button is released, the channel volume returns to its
  previous value. This is usefull for quickly overlaying soundbytes from one
  stream over another.

  EDITOR BOX COMPONENTS</a></h1>
The list box on top connects the sample recorder to one of the channels. The
  <i>Load</i> and <i>Save</i> buttons (re-)store samples on disk. To record a
  sample from the selected channel, press the <i>Record</i> button. Press again
  to stop recording. Max recording time is ten seconds. The <i>start</i> and
  <i>end sliders</i> are used to fine tune the start and end times of the
  sample; values on top of the sliders the time offsets in seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One can copy a sample to another channel using the <i>Copy Sample To</i> button
  and its associated list box. First select the channel from the list, then
  click the button.

  BOX COMPONENTS</a></h1>
The green light on top turns red whenever samples are clipped in the output.
  This is most likely to occur during a crossfade. Next is the <i>Mic</i>
  <i>Talkover</i> button. It cuts all regular output channels to one third of
  their volume to allow microphone input to be heard. See <b>dbin</b> (1) to
  learn how to enable microphone input. <i>Cue Split</i> places cue output in
  the right cup of the headphones, and the master output in the left.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>Balance</i> slider controls the volume ratio of left vs. right in the
  master output, while the <i>Main</i> and <i>Cue</i> sliders allow to adjust
  the soundcard volume for the master and cue devices, respectively. <i>Autofade
  Spd.</i> actually belongs to the crossfader and is described above.

  BUGS</a></h1>
<b>dbmixer</b> refuses to start if the maximum number of clients are already
  running. In this case, close one of your clients, start <b>dbmixer</b>, and
  then restart your last client.
