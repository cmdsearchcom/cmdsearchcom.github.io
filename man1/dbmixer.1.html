<p>DBMIXER(1) General Commands Manual DBMIXER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dbmixer - Mixer application for the DBMix sound system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dbmixer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dbmixer is an advanced mixer application to control various
audio channels. It is part of the DBMix sound system and
requires a running dbfsd. The user interface is devided <br>
into four parts: the channel boxes, one for each channel, on
the top left, the crossfader box below, the sample editor
box right of the channel boxes, and the controls box to the
<br>
far right. Each of them is described in detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANNEL BOX COMPONENTS <br>
The list box on top assigns each channel to a particular
input device. Pause and Mute buttons below are pretty
self-descriptive. Cue redirects the channel to the cueing
device <br>
and is only enabled if dbfsd has been started with the -c
option. The buttons labelled Once and Loop act in
conjunction with the sample editor (see below). They play or
loop <br>
respectively a short, pre-recorded sample on the current
channel. To adjust the channel&rsquo;s volume, move the
vertical slider up and down. (The number on top of the
slider is a <br>
bit misleading--100 means absolute silence while it shows 0
when the volume is at its maximum.) A horizontal slider
controls the pitch of the sound output. The row of buttons
<br>
below resets the speed to 100 per cent (middle button), or
alters the speed by five per cent in either direction (left
and right buttons). The bottom row, finally, comprises of
<br>
the Pitch Sync buttons. While being pressed, they
temporarily slow down (-S), pause (.]S[.), or speed up (S+)
the sound. The purpose of these three buttons is to assist
in beat <br>
matching: First use the pitch control to adjust two songs to
the same speed, the use the sync buttons to match the
beats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CROSSFADING BOX COMPONENTS <br>
The crossfader comprises of three parts, the fader slider
itself, and the two channel selectors, one on each side of
the fader. To crossfade, first select the channels to fade
<br>
between in the channel selectors. Then move the fader slider
to the desired position, or push one of the autofade buttons
to the right. &lt; fades to the left, /&nbsp; centres the
<br>
fader, and &gt; fades to the right. A slider labelled
Autofade Spd. controls the autofade speed. It is actually
located in the controls box, but belongs to the crossfader,
really. <br>
The value of this slider is the fade time from end to end in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To either side of the crossfader
channel selectors there are buttons that say Punch. Doing so
sets the volume for the selected crossfader channel to
maximum. When the button is <br>
released, the channel volume returns to its previous value.
This is usefull for quickly overlaying soundbytes from one
stream over another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAMPLE EDITOR BOX COMPONENTS
<br>
The list box on top connects the sample recorder to one of
the channels. The Load and Save buttons (re-)store samples
on disk. To record a sample from the selected channel, <br>
press the Record button. Press again to stop recording. Max
recording time is ten seconds. The start and end sliders are
used to fine tune the start and end times of the sam&acirc;
<br>
ple; values on top of the sliders the time offsets in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can copy a sample to another
channel using the Copy Sample To button and its associated
list box. First select the channel from the list, then click
the button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROLS BOX COMPONENTS <br>
The green light on top turns red whenever samples are
clipped in the output. This is most likely to occur during a
crossfade. Next is the Mic Talkover button. It cuts all
reg&acirc; <br>
ular output channels to one third of their volume to allow
microphone input to be heard. See dbin (1) to learn how to
enable microphone input. Cue Split places cue output in <br>
the right cup of the headphones, and the master output in
the left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Balance slider controls the
volume ratio of left vs. right in the master output, while
the Main and Cue sliders allow to adjust the soundcard
volume for the master and cue <br>
devices, respectively. Autofade Spd. actually belongs to the
crossfader and is described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS <br>
dbmixer refuses to start if the maximum number of clients
are already running. In this case, close one of your
clients, start dbmixer, and then restart your last
client.</p>
