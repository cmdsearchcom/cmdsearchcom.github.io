<p>CAPSH(1) User Commands CAPSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
capsh - capability shell wrapper</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
capsh [OPTION]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Linux capability support and use can be explored and
constrained with this tool. This tool provides a handy
wrapper for certain types of capability testing and
environment cre&acirc; <br>
ation. It also provides some debugging features useful for
summarizing capability state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The tool takes a number of optional arguments, acting on
them in the order they are provided. They are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print Display prevailing
capability and related state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- [args] Execute /bin/bash with
trailing arguments. Note, you can use -c &rsquo;command to
execute&rsquo; for specific commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">== Execute capsh again with
remaining arguments. Useful for testing exec() behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--caps=cap-set Set the
prevailing process capabilities to those specified by
cap-set. Where cap-set is a text-representation of
capability state as per cap_from_text(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--drop=cap-list Remove the
listed capabilities from the prevailing bounding set. The
capabilites are a comma separated list of capabilities as
recognized by the <br>
cap_from_name(3) function. Use of this feature requires that
the capsh program is operating with CAP_SETPCAP in its
effective set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inh=cap-list Set the
inheritable set of capabilities for the current process to
equal those provided in the comma separated list. For this
action to succeed, the pre&acirc; <br>
vailing process should already have each of these
capabilities in the union of the current inheritable and
permitted capability sets, or the capsh program <br>
is operating with CAP_SETPCAP in its effective set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user=username Assume the
identity of the named user. That is, look up the
user&rsquo;s uid and gid with getpwuid(3) and their group
memberships with getgrouplist(3) and set <br>
them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uid=id Force all uid values to
equal id using the setuid(2) system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gid=&lt;id&gt; Force all gid
values to equal id using the setgid(2) system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--groups=&lt;id-list&gt; Set the
supplementary groups to the numerical list provided. The
groups are set with the setgroups(2) system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep=&lt;0|1&gt; In a non-pure
capability mode, the kernel provides liberal privilege to
the super-user. However, it is normally the case that when
the super-user changes <br>
uid to some lesser user, then capabilities are dropped. For
these situations, the kernel can permit the process to
retain its capabilities after a setuid(2) <br>
system call. This feature is known as keep-caps support. The
way to activate it using this script is with this argument.
Setting the value to 1 will cause <br>
keep-caps to be active. Setting it to 0 will cause keep-caps
to deactivate for the current process. In all cases,
keep-caps is deactivated when an exec() is <br>
performed. See --secbits for ways to disable this
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--secbits=N XXX - need to
document this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--chroot=path Execute the
chroot(2) system call with the new root-directory (/) equal
to path. This operation requires CAP_SYS_CHROOT to be in
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forkfor=sec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--killit=sig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--decode=N This is a convenience
feature. If you look at /proc/1/status there are some
capability related fields of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CapInh: 0000000000000000 <br>
CapPrm: ffffffffffffffff <br>
CapEff: fffffffffffffeff <br>
CapBnd: ffffffffffffffff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option provides a quick way
to decode a capability vector represented in this form. For
example, the missing capability from this effective set is
<br>
0x0100. By running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capsh --decode=0x0100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">we observe that the missing
capability is: cap_setpcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--supports=xxx As the kernel
evolves, more capabilities are added. This option can be
used to verify the existence of a capability on the system.
For example, --sup&acirc; <br>
ports=cap_syslog will cause capsh to promptly exit with a
status of 1 when run on kernel 2.6.27. However, when run on
kernel 2.6.38 it will silently suc&acirc; <br>
ceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Following successful execution the tool exits with status 0.
Following an error, the tool immediately exits with status
1.</p>
