<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dx is the command that starts the Data Explorer Startup
Window, and optionally starts the Data Explorer User
Interface, Data Explorer Executive, Data Explorer Data
Prompter, Data <br>
Explorer Module Builder or the Data Explorer Tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Data Explorer Startup Window
is an X windows/Motif based application which allows easy
access to the other subsystemes of the Data Explorer
visualization system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Data Explorer User Interface
is an X windows/Motif based application that provides a
visual programming environment and an interface to the
executive. The executive provides <br>
the computational tools and mechanisms to create data
visualizations. The</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data Explorer Data Prompter is
an X windows/Motif based application that helps users import
data in a variety of formats, and provides general purpose
visual programs to visual <br>
imported data, leading to a shortened &quot;time to first
picture&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Data Explorer Module Builder
is an X windows/Motif based application that helps users
build their own modules to be included in a custom version
of Data Explorer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Data Explorer Tutorial is an
application that helps users learn to use Data Explorer by
leading them through a sequence of tasks. Users can easily
skip around in the tuto&acirc; <br>
rial in order to concentrate on tasks of most use to their
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete description
of the Data Explorer User Interface and Executive see the
IBM Visualization Data Explorer User&rsquo;s Guide. For a
more complete description of the <br>
Data Explorer Data Prompter see the IBM Visualization Data
Explorer QuickStart Guide. For a more thorough description
of the Data Explorer Module Builder see the IBM
Visualiza&acirc; <br>
tion Data Explorer Programmer&rsquo;s Reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
With no options the dx command starts the Startup Window, an
X windows/Motif program from which the other parts of the
Data Explorer system can be started. The various command
<br>
line options and environment variables listed below can be
specified to change the default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options set by including them in
the DXARGS environment variable are placed at the start of
the command line, followed by any options set by environment
variables, followed by <br>
explicit command line arguments. When conflicting options
are given, the last option has precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8bitcmap &lt; private | shared
| 0-1 | -1 &gt; <br>
Overrides the DX8BITCMAP environment variable (see
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cache &lt; on | off &gt; <br>
Turn on or off the executive caching system. When the Data
Explorer caching mechanism is enabled the Data Explorer
executive automatically caches the intermediate results <br>
generated during its visualization computations. Unlike
standard caching mechanisms, these results are accessed by
means of their functional derivation. This allows for <br>
automatic graph optimization and helps to avoid the
recomputation of previously utilized intermediates,
especially when the Data Explorer sequencer is being used.
In cer&acirc; <br>
tain rare instances, a machine with a small amount of memory
may want to disable this caching to conserve memory and
reduce paging. Default = on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-colors &lt; colors file &gt;
<br>
Override DXCOLORS environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-connect &lt; host:port &gt;
<br>
Start a distributed executive only (no user interface).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data &lt; path list &gt; <br>
Override DXDATA environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-directory &lt; dir &gt; <br>
Cause the executive to be run in the given directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display &lt; display name &gt;
<br>
Set the name of the X display to be used by the user
interface and the executive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dxroot &lt; dir &gt; <br>
Overrides the default dx root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-echo &lt; dir &gt; <br>
Echo the command lines without executing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-edit Cause the user interface
to be started with the Visual Program Editor (VPE) window as
the top level window of the user interface (the top level
window is denoted by an <br>
anchor in the upper left hand corner). Also see -image,
-startup, and -menubar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encode &lt; filename &gt; <br>
Encode the given file into a binary format with a key (which
must be specified with the -key option). For example <br>
dx -encode -key 1234567890abcdef foo.net The resulting file
can only be encoded by the DX user interface when the same
key is used. For example <br>
dx -image -key 1234567890abcdef foo-e.net</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exec &lt; executive executable
&gt; <br>
Use the given file as a replacement for the executive. This
option allows a user to build and use his/her own custom
executive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-execonly <br>
Start the executive in remote mode in which it will then
await a connection from the user interface. The user
interface is not started with this option. Also see <br>
-script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-execute <br>
Execute once after the user interface has made a connection
with the executive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-execute_on_change <br>
Cause Data Explorer to go into execute-on-change mode at
start up. Execute-on-change mode causes the Visual Program
to be executed any time any of the values (i.e. module <br>
inupts, interactor values...) in the program change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-file &lt; filename &gt; <br>
Start the Data Prompter, Module Builder, or Data Explorer
User Interface with the header file filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-full When used with -prompter,
starts the full Data Prompter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print a brief listing of
options and usage for dx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-highlight &lt; on | off &gt;
<br>

highlighting is turned on, the user interface will highlight
each module as it is executed. Default = on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-host &lt; host name &gt; <br>
Override DXHOST environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hwrender &lt; gl | opengl &gt;
<br>
Override the default hardware rendering choice on platforms
where both are supported. Default is opengl. Sets the
DXHWMOD environment variable to either DXhwdd.o or
DXhwd&acirc; <br>
dOGL.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-image Cause the user interface
to be started with the image window as the top level window
of the user interface. Also, control panels that are
configured to open automatically <br>
are opened. Also see -edit, -startup and -menubar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include &lt; path list &gt;
<br>
Override DXINCLUDE environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-key &lt; 64bit hex &gt; <br>
16 character hexidecimal (64bit) number that is used to
encode and decode .net files. See -encode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-license &lt; type &gt; <br>
Force a specific license for either the user interface or
executive. The following are valid values for type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">runtime: forces a run-time
license (UI or executive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timed: forces a timed (limited
function) license (UI only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">develop: forces a developer
license (UI or executive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-local Override the DXHOST
environment variable (if set) and cause the executive to be
run on the local host. In the absence of the DXHOST
environment variable, this is the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log &lt; on | off &gt; <br>
Turn on or off executive logging. If logging is on then the
executive logs output to the file dx.log in the directory
where the executive is executing. Default = off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-macros &lt; path list &gt; <br>
Override the DXMACROS environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-menubar <br>
Start Data Explorer with a menubar as the anchor window.
Also, control panels that are configured to open
automatically are opened. See also -image, -edit, and
-startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdf &lt; mdf file &gt; <br>
Override the DXMDF environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memory &lt; # of MB &gt; <br>
Set the maximum amount of memory, in megabytes rounded up to
a two megabyte boundary, that the executive is able to
allocate. Default = the amount of physical memory <br>
minus 8 MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-metric <br>
Have the ui use metric units when possible, for example for
setting the image size for printing postscript images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-modules &lt; pathlist &gt; <br>
Set the list of directories to be searched for outboard
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-morehelp <br>
Displays this information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodeid <br>
print out the node id of the machine that the command is run
on. The node id is used when generating a license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-optimize &lt; memory |
precision &gt; <br>
Select whether to minimize memory usage or produce more
color-accurate images. When memory is optimized, image
objects are generated with 24 bits/pixel instead of 96, and
<br>
ReadImage will produce delayed color images if supported by
the format. The default is precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-outboarddebug <br>
Enable user to start outboard modules manually for debugging
when they are called in a visual program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-processors <br>
For Data Explorer SMP, sets the number of processors to
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-program &lt; programname &gt;
<br>
Start the user interface with the visual program
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prompter <br>
Start the data prompter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-readahead &lt; on | off &gt;
<br>
Specify whether or not the executive reads ahead in its
input stream before executing the commands it receives from
the stream. If this is turned off, then the executive <br>
will execute each command line as it is received. This is
useful for certain debugging purposes, such as memory leak
detection. Default = on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-script [ &lt; script file &gt;
] <br>
Run just the executive in script mode. If a file name is
provided then the executive reads and executes commands from
the given script and then terminates. If a file is <br>
not provided then when the executive starts up it enters
interactive mode where it waits for script commands. Also
see -execonly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-startup <br>
Start Data Explorer with the startup window as the initial
window. This is the default. See also -image, -edit, and
-menubar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-suppress <br>
Do not open any control panels at start-up. This is used in
-image mode and -menubar mode only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timed Start DX using a timed
license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-timing &lt; on | off &gt; <br>
Turn on or off the executive timing mechanism. If enabled,
then when the executive exits it will list on standard
output or the logging file timing statistics for each <br>
module that was used during the course of execution. Default
= off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trace &lt; on | off &gt; <br>
Turn on or off the executive trace mechanism. When tracing
is enabled the executive displays informative messages about
the execution sequence on either standard output <br>
or the log file if logging is enabled. Default = off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trialkey <br>
Determines the information necessary for generating a
trialkey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tutor Start the Data Explorer
tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uionly <br>
Cause the user interface to be started without making a
connection to an executive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Echo commands in the dx script as they are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version numbers of various executables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables provide an alternate way
to set certain of the command line options, or alter the
default behavior of Data Explorer in some way. Options set
<br>
with environment variables are overridden if the same option
is also specified on the command line. Options set with
DXARGS are overridden by both environment variables and <br>
explicit command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DX8BITCMAP <br>
When Data Explorer displays images in 8-bit windows, it
makes every effort to create an accurate representation of
the image using the default colormap shared among
appli&acirc; <br>
cations using 8-bit windows. If the colors required by Data
Explorer are not present in the colormap and there are not
enough free color cells available in the shared <br>
color map for their allocation, Data Explorer will find
approximations among the colors that are available. However,
in certain circumstances, the difference between the <br>
desired color and the approximation is found to be too great
to be acceptable. In such circumstances, DX will allocate a
private colormap for more accurate results. In <br>
this case, depending on your X server, you may need to move
the mouse to select the Image or Display window in order for
the correct colors to appear. The -8bitcmap flag <br>
sets the level at which the change to using a private
colormap is made. The value of this parameter should be a
number between 0 and 1, or &quot;private&quot; or
&quot;shared&quot;, and it <br>
repressents the Euclidean distance in RGB color space,
normalized to 1, for the maximum allowed discrepancy. If you
set this parameter to 1, then a private colormap will <br>
never be used. If you set it to -1, then a private colormap
will always be used. The default is 0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXARGS This contains the default
set of arguments used by the dx script. The arguments are
prepended to those given to dx on the command line. This
variable allows for the dx <br>
command to be easily customized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXAXESMAXWIDTH <br>
Sets the number of digits in axes tick labels at which a
switch to scientific notation is made. The default is 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXCOLORS <br>
This contains the name of an alternate file that contains
mappings of color names to red, green, blue triplets in a
format like that of the default color file found in <br>
/usr/lpp/dx/lib/colors.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXDATA This contains a colon
separated list of directories in which the executive will
search for data files. Also see the -data option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXDELAYEDCOLORS <br>
If set to anything other than 0, enables ReadImage to create
delayed color images if the image is a tiff format image
saved in a byte-with-colormap format or a gif image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXEXEC Specifies an executive to
be run at start-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXFLING <br>
If DXFLING is set to 1, then for hardware-rendered images,
in rotation mode and execute-on-change mode, if you drag the
mouse across the image, and release the mouse but&acirc;
<br>
ton outside the image, the object in the image will begin to
rotate, and will continue to rotate until you click inside
the image. The direction and speed of the mouse <br>
motion before release will affect the rotation direction and
rotation speed of the object in the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXGAMMA <br>
Sets the gamma correction for software-rendered images
displayed to the screen using the Display and Image tools.
The default value is 2, except for 8-bit windows on the <br>
sgi architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXGAMMA_8BIT, <br>
DXGAMMA_12BIT, DXGAMMA_24BIT sets the gamma correction
factor for software-rendered images for the windows with the
indicated window depth. Overrides the value set by <br>
DXGAMMA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXHOST This contains the name of
the host machine that will run the executive. If this is not
set then a default of &quot;localhost&quot; is used, unless
the local host is a PVS console <br>
in which case the default is to run the executive on the
PVS. Also see the -host, -local and -server options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXHWGAMMA <br>
Sets the gamma correction for hardware-rendered images
displayed to the screen using the Display and Image tools.
The default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXHWMOD <br>
Specifies the name of the hardware rendering library to use
when more than one is supported. Should be either DXhwdd.o
or DXhwddOGL.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXINCLUDE <br>
This contains a colon separated list of directories in which
the executive will search for &quot;included&quot; scripts.
Also see the -include option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXMACROS <br>
This contains a colon separated list of directories in which
the user interface searches for macros that will be
automatically loaded. When running in script mode one <br>
must &quot;include&quot; all the macros by hand prior to
referencing them. Also see the -macros option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXMDF This contains the name of
a module description file (mdf) that contains user defined
modules for a customized version of the executive. Also see
the -mdf option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXMEMORY <br>
sets the amount of memory (in megabytes) that can be used by
the executive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXMODULES <br>
This contains a colon separated list of directories in which
the executive searches for outboard modules. Also see the
-modules option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DX_NESTED_LOOPS <br>
For faces, loops, and edges data, if set, allows loops other
than the enclosing loop for a face to be listed first.
However, there is a consequent decrease in performance <br>
if this environment variable is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXNO_BACKING_STORE <br>
If set to anything, disables framebuffer readbacks. Setting
this environment variable may improve performance of
interaction with hardware rendered images, especially for
<br>
machines for which readback is slow. The default behavior is
that framebuffer readbacks are enabled. If you set this
environment variable, not that some interactions using <br>
the Image tool will result in a black image while
interaction is taking place. However, if you are not using
the Image tool, it is strongly recommended that you set this
<br>
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXPIXELTYPE <br>
sets the image type to either 24-bit color images or
floating-point-based 96-bit images (the default). This
affects the behavior of Render and ReadImage. This variable
<br>
can be set to either DXByte (24 bits) or DXFloat (96 bits).
Setting this variable to DXByte will result in images taking
up less memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXPROCESSORS <br>
Sets the number of processors to be used for Data Explorer
SMP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXRSH Specifies the remote shell
command to use when connecting to other systems (such as
those when using distributed execution). The default is the
the path to rsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXRSH_NOENV <br>
Prevents the remote &quot;invoke dxexec&quot; script from
being written with a full carbon copy of the local
environment (only DISPLAY is set).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXROOT Specifies the top-level
directory for all the files and directories needed by Data
Explorer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXSHMEM <br>
If set to anything other than -1, forces shared memory to be
used (if allowed by the architecture). If set to -1, (if
allowed by the architecture) will cause the data <br>
segment to simply be extended. Please see Appendix C of the
Data Explorer User Guide for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DX_SOCKET_BUFSIZE <br>
Allows the user to specify the size of the send and receive
buffers for the socket connection between the UI and the
exec. This value is clamped to the max allowed by the <br>
system. This can fix a problem where the executive and UI
hang involving a deadlock situation in the socket
communication. The value assigned to it is passed as the
param&acirc; <br>
eter to setsockopt for SOL_SNDBUF and SOL_RCVBUF. A typcial
increased value may be 262144.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DX_USER_INTERACTOR_FILE <br>
Specifies a file containing user interactors for use by the
SuperviseState and SuperviseWindow modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DX_WEB_BROWSER <br>
Under UNIX specifies the web browser to launch for viewing
the HTML documentation. Under Windows and MacOS X setting
this environment variable will launch the systems <br>
default web browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The next few examples assume that none of the DX environment
variables have been set.</p>
