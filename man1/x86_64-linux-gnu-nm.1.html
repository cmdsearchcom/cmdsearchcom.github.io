<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GNU nm lists the symbols from object files objfile.... If no
object files are listed as arguments, nm assumes the file
a.out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each symbol, nm shows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The symbol
value, in the radix selected by options (see below), or
hexadecimal by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The symbol type.
At least the following types are used; others are, as well,
depending on the object file format. If lowercase, the
symbol is usually local; if uppercase, <br>
the symbol is global (external). There are however a few
lowercase symbols that are shown for special global symbols
(&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;A&quot; The symbol&rsquo;s
value is absolute, and will not be changed by further
linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;B&quot; <br>
&quot;b&quot; The symbol is in the uninitialized data
section (known as BSS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;C&quot; The symbol is
common. Common symbols are uninitialized data. When linking,
multiple common symbols may appear with the same name. If
the symbol is defined anywhere, <br>
the common symbols are treated as undefined references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;D&quot; <br>
&quot;d&quot; The symbol is in the initialized data
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;G&quot; <br>
&quot;g&quot; The symbol is in an initialized data section
for small objects. Some object file formats permit more
efficient access to small data objects, such as a global int
<br>
variable as opposed to a large global array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;i&quot; For PE format
files this indicates that the symbol is in a section
specific to the implementation of DLLs. For ELF format files
this indicates that the symbol is an <br>
indirect function. This is a GNU extension to the standard
set of ELF symbol types. It indicates a symbol which if
referenced by a relocation does not evaluate to its <br>
address, but instead must be invoked at runtime. The runtime
execution will then return the value to be used in the
relocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;I&quot; The symbol is an
indirect reference to another symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;N&quot; The symbol is a
debugging symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;p&quot; The symbols is in
a stack unwind section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;R&quot; <br>
&quot;r&quot; The symbol is in a read only data section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;S&quot; <br>
&quot;s&quot; The symbol is in an uninitialized data section
for small objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;T&quot; <br>
&quot;t&quot; The symbol is in the text (code) section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;U&quot; The symbol is
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;u&quot; The symbol is a
unique global symbol. This is a GNU extension to the
standard set of ELF symbol bindings. For such a symbol the
dynamic linker will make sure that in <br>
the entire process there is just one symbol with this name
and type in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;V&quot; <br>
&quot;v&quot; The symbol is a weak object. When a weak
defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the
normal defined symbol is used with no error. When a weak
undefined <br>
symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of
the weak symbol becomes zero with no error. On some systems,
uppercase indicates that a default value has <br>
been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;W&quot; <br>
&quot;w&quot; The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been
specifically tagged as a weak object symbol. When a weak
defined symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the
normal <br>
defined symbol is used with no error. When a weak undefined
symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of
the symbol is determined in a system-specific <br>
manner without error. On some systems, uppercase indicates
that a default value has been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;-&quot; The symbol is a
stabs symbol in an a.out object file. In this case, the next
values printed are the stabs other field, the stabs desc
field, and the stab type. Stabs <br>
symbols are used to hold debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;?&quot; The symbol type is
unknown, or object file format specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The symbol
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The long and short forms of options, shown here as
alternatives, are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
-o <br>
--print-file-name <br>
Precede each symbol by the name of the input file (or
archive member) in which it was found, rather than
identifying the input file once only, before all of its
symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
--debug-syms <br>
Display all symbols, even debugger-only symbols; normally
these are not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B The same as --format=bsd (for
compatibility with the MIPS nm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C <br>
--demangle[=style] <br>
Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level
names. Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by
the system, this makes C++ function names readable. <br>
Different compilers have different mangling styles. The
optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an
appropriate demangling style for your compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-demangle <br>
Do not demangle low-level symbol names. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
--dynamic <br>
Display the dynamic symbols rather than the normal symbols.
This is only meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain
types of shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f format <br>
--format=format <br>
Use the output format format, which can be &quot;bsd&quot;,
&quot;sysv&quot;, or &quot;posix&quot;. The default is
&quot;bsd&quot;. Only the first character of format is
significant; it can be either upper or <br>
lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g <br>
--extern-only <br>
Display only external symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Show a summary of the options to nm and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
--line-numbers <br>
For each symbol, use debugging information to try to find a
filename and line number. For a defined symbol, look for the
line number of the address of the symbol. For an <br>
undefined symbol, look for the line number of a relocation
entry which refers to the symbol. If line number information
can be found, print it after the other symbol <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
-v <br>
--numeric-sort <br>
Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, rather than
alphabetically by their names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
--no-sort <br>
Do not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print them
in the order encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
--portability <br>
Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of the
default format. Equivalent to -f posix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
--reverse-sort <br>
Reverse the order of the sort (whether numeric or
alphabetic); let the last come first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S <br>
--print-size <br>
Print both value and size of defined symbols for the
&quot;bsd&quot; output style. This option has no effect for
object formats that do not record symbol sizes, unless
--size-sort is <br>
also used in which case a calculated size is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--print-armap <br>
When listing symbols from archive members, include the
index: a mapping (stored in the archive by ar or ranlib) of
which modules contain definitions for which names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t radix <br>
--radix=radix <br>
Use radix as the radix for printing the symbol values. It
must be d for decimal, o for octal, or x for
hexadecimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
--undefined-only <br>
Display only undefined symbols (those external to each
object file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Show the version number of nm and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X This option is ignored for
compatibility with the AIX version of nm. It takes one
parameter which must be the string 32_64. The default mode
of AIX nm corresponds to -X 32, <br>
which is not supported by GNU nm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--defined-only <br>
Display only defined symbols for each object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--plugin name <br>
Load the plugin called name to add support for extra target
types. This option is only available if the toolchain has
been built with plugin support enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--size-sort <br>
Sort symbols by size. For ELF objects symbol sizes are read
from the ELF, for other object types the symbol sizes are
computed as the difference between the value of the <br>
symbol and the value of the symbol with the next higher
value. If the &quot;bsd&quot; output format is used the size
of the symbol is printed, rather than the value, and -S must
be <br>
used in order both size and value to be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--special-syms <br>
Display symbols which have a target-specific special
meaning. These symbols are usually used by the target for
some special processing and are not normally helpful when
<br>
included in the normal symbol lists. For example for ARM
targets this option would skip the mapping symbols used to
mark transitions between ARM code, THUMB code and data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--synthetic <br>
Include synthetic symbols in the output. These are special
symbols created by the linker for various purposes. They are
not shown by default since they are not part of the <br>
binary&rsquo;s original source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-symbol-versions <br>
Enables the display of symbol version information if any
exists. The version string is displayed as a suffix to the
symbol name, preceeded by an @ character. For example <br>
foo@VER_1. If the version is the default version to be used
when resolving unversioned references to the symbol then it
is displayed as a suffix preceeded by two @ <br>
characters. For example foo@@VER_2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target=bfdname <br>
Specify an object code format other than your system&rsquo;s
default format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>
