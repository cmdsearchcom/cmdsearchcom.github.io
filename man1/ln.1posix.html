<p>LN(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
LN(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ln &acirc; link files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ln [&acirc;fs] [&acirc;L|&acirc;P] source_file
target_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln [&acirc;fs]
[&acirc;L|&acirc;P] source_file... target_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
In the first synopsis form, the ln utility shall create a
new directory entry (link) at the destination path specified
by the target_file operand. If the &acirc;s option is
specified, <br>
a symbolic link shall be created for the file specified by
the source_file operand. This first synopsis form shall be
assumed when the final operand does not name an existing
<br>
directory; if more than two operands are specified and the
final is not an existing directory, an error shall
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second synopsis form, the
ln utility shall create a new directory entry (link), or if
the &acirc;s option is specified a symbolic link, for each
file specified by a source_file <br>
operand, at a destination path in the existing directory
named by target_dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the last operand specifies an
existing file of a type not specified by the System
Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, the behavior is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The corresponding destination
path for each source_file shall be the concatenation of the
target directory pathname, a &lt;slash&gt; character if the
target directory pathname did not <br>
end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the last pathname component of
the source_file. The second synopsis form shall be assumed
when the final operand names an existing directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each source_file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the destination path
exists and was created by a previous step, it is unspecified
whether ln shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with the <br>
current source_file, and go on to any remaining
source_files; or will continue processing the current
source_file. If the destination path exists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If the &acirc;f option is not
specified, ln shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error, do nothing more with the current source_file, and go
on to any remaining <br>
source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If destination names the same
directory entry as the current source_file ln shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more with
the current <br>
source_file, and go on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. Actions shall be performed
equivalent to the unlink() function defined in the System
Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, called using
destination as the path argument. If <br>
this fails for any reason, ln shall write a diagnostic
message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
source_file, and go on to any remaining source_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the &acirc;s option is
specified, actions shall be performed equivalent to the
symlink() function with source_file as the path1 argument
and the destination path as the path2 <br>
argument. The ln utility shall do nothing more with
source_file and shall go on to any remaining files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If source_file is a symbolic
link:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. If the &acirc;P option is in
effect, actions shall be performed equivalent to the
linkat() function with source_file as the path1 argument,
the destination path as the path2 <br>
argument, AT_FDCWD as the fd1 and fd2 arguments, and zero as
the flag argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. If the &acirc;L option is in
effect, actions shall be performed equivalent to the
linkat() function with source_file as the path1 argument,
the destination path as the path2 <br>
argument, AT_FDCWD as the fd1 and fd2 arguments, and
AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW as the flag argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ln utility shall do nothing
more with source_file and shall go on to any remaining
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Actions shall be performed
equivalent to the link() function defined in the System
Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 using source_file as
the path1 argument, and the destina&acirc; <br>
tion path as the path2 argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ln utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f Force existing
destination pathnames to be removed to allow the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L For each source_file
operand that names a file of type symbolic link, create a
(hard) link to the file referenced by the symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;P For each source_file
operand that names a file of type symbolic link, create a
(hard) link to the symbolic link itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Create symbolic links
instead of hard links. If the &acirc;s option is specified,
the &acirc;L and &acirc;P options shall be silently
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
mutually-exclusive options &acirc;L and &acirc;P shall not
be considered an error. The last option specified shall
determine the behavior of the utility <br>
(unless the &acirc;s option causes it to be ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;s option is not
specified and neither a &acirc;L nor a &acirc;P option is
specified, it is implementation-defined which of the
&acirc;L and &acirc;P options will be used as the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source_file <br>
A pathname of a file to be linked. If the &acirc;s option is
specified, no restrictions on the type of file or on its
existence shall be made. If the &acirc;s option is not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied, whether a directory can be linked is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_file <br>
The pathname of the new directory entry to be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target_dir <br>
A pathname of an existing directory in which the new
directory entries are created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ln:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All the specified files were
linked successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section does not require ln
&acirc;f a b to remove b if a subsequent link operation
would fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historic versions of ln
(including the one specified by the SVID) unlink the
destination file, if it exists, by default. If the mode does
not permit writing, these versions <br>
prompt for confirmation before attempting the unlink. In
these versions the &acirc;f option causes ln not to attempt
to prompt for confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows ln to succeed in
creating links when the target file already exists, even if
the file itself is not writable (although the directory must
be). Early proposals speci&acirc; <br>
fied this functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not allow the ln utility to unlink
existing destination paths by default for the following
reasons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The ln utility has
historically been used to provide locking for shell
applications, a usage that is incompatible with ln unlinking
the destination path by default. There was <br>
no corresponding technical advantage to adding this
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This functionality gave ln the
ability to destroy the link structure of files, which
changes the historical behavior of ln.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* This functionality is easily
replicated with a combination of rm and ln.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It is not historical practice
in many systems; BSD and BSD-derived systems do not support
this behavior. Unfortunately, whichever behavior is selected
can cause scripts writ&acirc; <br>
ten expecting the other behavior to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It is preferable that ln
perform in the same manner as the link() function, which
does not permit the target to exist already.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 retains the &acirc;f option to provide
support for shell scripts depending on the SVID semantics.
It seems likely that shell scripts would not be written to
<br>
handle prompting by ln and would therefore have specified
the &acirc;f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;f option is an
undocumented feature of many historical versions of the ln
utility, allowing linking to directories. These versions
require modification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Early proposals of this volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 also required a &acirc;i option, which
behaved like the &acirc;i options in cp and mv, prompting
for confirmation before unlinking existing <br>
files. This was not historical practice for the ln utility
and has been omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;L and &acirc;P
options allow for implementing both common behaviors of the
ln utility. Earlier versions of this standard did not
specify these options and required the behavior <br>
now described for the &acirc;L option. Many systems by
default or as an alternative provided a non-conforming ln
utility with the behavior now described for the &acirc;P
option. Since appli&acirc; <br>
cations could not rely on ln following links in practice,
the &acirc;L and &acirc;P options were added to specify the
desired behavior for the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;L and &acirc;P
options are ignored when &acirc;s is specified in order to
allow an alias to be created to alter the default behavior
when creating hard links (for example, alias ln=&rsquo;ln
<br>
&acirc;L&rsquo;). They serve no purpose when &acirc;s is
specified, since source_file is then just a string to be
used as the contents of the created symbolic link and need
not exist as a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specification ensures that
ln a a with or without the &acirc;f option will not unlink
the file a. Earlier versions of this standard were unclear
in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
