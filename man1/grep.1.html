<p>GREP(1) General Commands Manual GREP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...] <br>
grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
grep searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no
files are named, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as
file name) for lines containing a match to the given <br>
PATTERN. By default, grep prints the matching lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, two variant
programs egrep and fgrep are available. egrep is the same as
grep -E. fgrep is the same as grep -F. Direct invocation as
either egrep or fgrep is <br>
deprecated, but is provided to allow historical applications
that rely on them to run unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Generic Program Information <br>
--help Print a usage message briefly summarizing these
command-line options and the bug-reporting address, then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the version number of grep to the standard output
stream. This version number should be included in all bug
reports (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matcher Selection <br>
-E, --extended-regexp <br>
Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression (ERE,
see below). (-E is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fixed-strings,
--fixed-regexp <br>
Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by
newlines, any of which is to be matched. (-F is specified by
POSIX, --fixed-regexp is an obsoleted alias, <br>
please do not use it in new scripts.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --basic-regexp <br>
Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular expression (BRE, see
below). This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --perl-regexp <br>
Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression. This is
highly experimental and grep -P may warn of unimplemented
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matching Control <br>
-e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN <br>
Use PATTERN as the pattern. This can be used to specify
multiple search patterns, or to protect a pattern beginning
with a hyphen (-). (-e is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f FILE, --file=FILE <br>
Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line. The empty file
contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing. (-f
is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-case <br>
Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input
files. (-i is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --invert-match <br>
Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.
(-v is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --word-regexp <br>
Select only those lines containing matches that form whole
words. The test is that the matching substring must either
be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a <br>
non-word constituent character. Similarly, it must be either
at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent
character. Word-constituent characters are <br>
letters, digits, and the underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --line-regexp <br>
Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.
(-x is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Obsolete synonym for -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Output Control <br>
-c, --count <br>
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
lines for each input file. With the -v, --invert-match
option (see below), count non-matching lines. (-c is <br>
specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
<br>
Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines,
context lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and
separators (for fields and groups of context lines) <br>
with escape sequences to display them in color on the
terminal. The colors are defined by the environment variable
GREP_COLORS. The deprecated environment variable <br>
GREP_COLOR is still supported, but its setting does not have
priority. WHEN is never, always, or auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --files-without-match <br>
Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input
file from which no output would normally have been printed.
The scanning will stop on the first match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --files-with-matches <br>
Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input
file from which output would normally have been printed. The
scanning will stop on the first match. (-l is <br>
specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m NUM, --max-count=NUM <br>
Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines. If the input
is standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching
lines are output, grep ensures that the standard input <br>
is positioned to just after the last matching line before
exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context
lines. This enables a calling process to resume a <br>
search. When grep stops after NUM matching lines, it outputs
any trailing context lines. When the -c or --count option is
also used, grep does not output a count greater <br>
than NUM. When the -v or --invert-match option is also used,
grep stops after outputting NUM non-matching lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --only-matching <br>
Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line,
with each such part on a separate output line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet, --silent <br>
Quiet; do not write anything to standard output. Exit
immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if
an error was detected. Also see the -s or --no-messages <br>
option. (-q is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --no-messages <br>
Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable
files. Portability note: unlike GNU grep, 7th Edition Unix
grep did not conform to POSIX, because it lacked -q and <br>
its -s option behaved like GNU grep&rsquo;s -q option.
USG-style grep also lacked -q but its -s option behaved like
GNU grep. Portable shell scripts should avoid both -q and
<br>
-s and should redirect standard and error output to
/dev/null instead. (-s is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Line Prefix Control <br>
-b, --byte-offset <br>
Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before
each line of output. If -o (--only-matching) is specified,
print the offset of the matching part itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --with-filename <br>
Print the file name for each match. This is the default when
there is more than one file to search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --no-filename <br>
Suppress the prefixing of file names on output. This is the
default when there is only one file (or only standard input)
to search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--label=LABEL <br>
Display input actually coming from standard input as input
coming from file LABEL. This is especially useful when
implementing tools like zgrep, e.g., gzip -cd foo.gz | <br>
grep --label=foo -H something. See also the -H option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --line-number <br>
Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number
within its input file. (-n is specified by POSIX.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --initial-tab <br>
Make sure that the first character of actual line content
lies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks
normal. This is useful with options that prefix their <br>
output to the actual content: -H,-n, and -b. In order to
improve the probability that lines from a single file will
all start at the same column, this also causes the <br>
line number and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a
minimum size field width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unix-byte-offsets <br>
Report Unix-style byte offsets. This switch causes grep to
report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text
file, i.e., with CR characters stripped off. This <br>
will produce results identical to running grep on a Unix
machine. This option has no effect unless -b option is also
used; it has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS <br>
and MS-Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z, --null <br>
Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the
character that normally follows a file name. For example,
grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file name <br>
instead of the usual newline. This option makes the output
unambiguous, even in the presence of file names containing
unusual characters like newlines. This option can <br>
be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z,
and xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those
that contain newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Context Line Control <br>
-A NUM, --after-context=NUM <br>
Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
Places a line containing a group separator (described under
--group-separator) between contiguous groups of <br>
matches. With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no
effect and a warning is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B NUM, --before-context=NUM
<br>
Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
Places a line containing a group separator (described under
--group-separator) between contiguous groups of <br>
matches. With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no
effect and a warning is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM <br>
Print NUM lines of output context. Places a line containing
a group separator (described under --group-separator)
between contiguous groups of matches. With the -o or <br>
--only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group-separator=SEP <br>
Use SEP as a group separator. By default SEP is double
hyphen (--).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-group-separator <br>
Use empty string as a group separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File and Directory Selection
<br>
-a, --text <br>
Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent
to the --binary-files=text option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary-files=TYPE <br>
If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file
contains binary data, assume that the file is of type TYPE.
By default, TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs <br>
either a one-line message saying that a binary file matches,
or no message if there is no match. If TYPE is
without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does not
match; <br>
this is equivalent to the -I option. If TYPE is text, grep
processes a binary file as if it were text; this is
equivalent to the -a option. Warning: grep <br>
--binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which can
have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if
the terminal driver interprets some of it as <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D ACTION, --devices=ACTION <br>
If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to
process it. By default, ACTION is read, which means that
devices are read just as if they were ordinary files. <br>
If ACTION is skip, devices are silently skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
<br>
If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.
By default, ACTION is read, i.e., read directories just as
if they were ordinary files. If ACTION is skip, <br>
silently skip directories. If ACTION is recurse, read all
files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic
links only if they are on the command line. This is <br>
equivalent to the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude=GLOB <br>
Skip files whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard
matching). A file-name glob can use *, ?, and [...] as
wildcards, and &nbsp;to quote a wildcard or backslash <br>
character literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-from=FILE <br>
Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name
globs read from FILE (using wildcard matching as described
under --exclude).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-dir=DIR <br>
Exclude directories matching the pattern DIR from recursive
searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Process a binary file as if
it did not contain matching data; this is equivalent to the
--binary-files=without-match option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include=GLOB <br>
Search only files whose base name matches GLOB (using
wildcard matching as described under --exclude).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --recursive <br>
Read all files under each directory, recursively, following
symbolic links only if they are on the command line. This is
equivalent to the -d recurse option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --dereference-recursive <br>
Read all files under each directory, recursively. Follow all
symbolic links, unlike -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Options <br>
--line-buffered <br>
Use line buffering on output. This can cause a performance
penalty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --binary <br>
Treat the file(s) as binary. By default, under MS-DOS and
MS-Windows, grep guesses the file type by looking at the
contents of the first 32KB read from the file. If grep <br>
decides the file is a text file, it strips the CR characters
from the original file contents (to make regular expressions
with ^ and $ work correctly). Specifying -U <br>
overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and
passed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a
text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line, <br>
this will cause some regular expressions to fail. This
option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and
MS-Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --null-data <br>
Treat the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero
byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a newline. Like
the -Z or --null option, this option can be used <br>
with commands like sort -z to process arbitrary file
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of
strings. Regular expressions are constructed analogously to
arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to <br>
combine smaller expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep understands three different
versions of regular expression syntax: &acirc;basic,&acirc;
&acirc;extended&acirc; and &acirc;perl.&acirc; In GNU grep,
there is no difference in available functionality between
<br>
basic and extended syntaxes. In other implementations, basic
regular expressions are less powerful. The following
description applies to extended regular expressions; <br>
differences for basic regular expressions are summarized
afterwards. Perl regular expressions give additional
functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and <br>
pcrepattern(3), but may not be available on every
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fundamental building blocks
are the regular expressions that match a single character.
Most characters, including all letters and digits, are
regular expressions that match <br>
themselves. Any meta-character with special meaning may be
quoted by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The period . matches any single
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character Classes and Bracket
Expressions <br>
A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [
and ]. It matches any single character in that list; if the
first character of the list is the caret ^ then it matches
<br>
any character not in the list. For example, the regular
expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within a bracket expression, a
range expression consists of two characters separated by a
hyphen. It matches any single character that sorts between
the two characters, <br>
inclusive, using the locale&rsquo;s collating sequence and
character set. For example, in the default C locale, [a-d]
is equivalent to [abcd]. Many locales sort characters in
<br>
dictionary order, and in these locales [a-d] is typically
not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to
[aBbCcDd], for example. To obtain the traditional
interpretation of <br>
bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the
LC_ALL environment variable to the value C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, certain named classes
of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as
follows. Their names are self explanatory, and they are
[:alnum:], [:alpha:], <br>
[:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:], [:print:],
[:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:]. For
example, [[:alnum:]] means the character class of numbers
and letters <br>
in the current locale. In the C locale and ASCII character
set encoding, this is the same as [0-9A-Za-z]. (Note that
the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic
<br>
names, and must be included in addition to the brackets
delimiting the bracket expression.) Most meta-characters
lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions. To
<br>
include a literal ] place it first in the list. Similarly,
to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first. Finally,
to include a literal - place it last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anchoring <br>
The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that
respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end
of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Backslash Character and
Special Expressions <br>
The symbols &lt; and &gt; respectively match the empty
string m a t at the beginning and end of a word. The symbol
cthe empty string h e s at the edge of a word, and 0matches
the <br>
empty string provided it&rsquo;s not at the edge of a word.
The symbol 48a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and W is a synonym
for [^_[:alnum:]].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repetition <br>
A regular expression may be followed by one of several
repetition operators: <br>
? The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
<br>
* The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
<br>
+ The preceding item will be matched one or more times. <br>
{n} The preceding item is matched exactly n times. <br>
{n,} The preceding item is matched n or more times. <br>
{,m} The preceding item is matched at most m times. This is
a GNU extension. <br>
{n,m} The preceding item is matched at least n times, but
not more than m times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concatenation <br>
Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting
regular expression matches any string formed by
concatenating two substrings that respectively match the
concatenated <br>
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternation <br>
Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator
|; the resulting regular expression matches any string
matching either alternate expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Precedence <br>
Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in
turn takes precedence over alternation. A whole expression
may be enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence
<br>
rules and form a subexpression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back References and
Subexpressions <br>
The back-reference 0 where n is a single digit, matches the
substring previously matched by the nth parenthesized
subexpression of the regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic vs Extended Regular
Expressions <br>
In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |,
(, and ) lose their special meaning; instead use the
backslashed versions <br>
Traditional egrep did not support the { meta-character, and
some egrep implementations support instead, so portable
scripts should avoid { in grep -E patterns and should use
<br>
[{] to match a literal {.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU grep -E attempts to support
traditional usage by assuming that { is not special if it
would be the start of an invalid interval specification. For
example, the command <br>
grep -E &rsquo;{1&rsquo; searches for the two-character
string {1 instead of reporting a syntax error in the regular
expression. POSIX allows this behavior as an extension, but
portable <br>
scripts should avoid it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The behavior of grep is affected by the following
environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The locale for category LC_foo
is specified by examining the three environment variables
LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG, in that order. The first of these
variables that is set specifies <br>
the locale. For example, if LC_ALL is not set, but
LC_MESSAGES is set to pt_BR, then the Brazilian Portuguese
locale is used for the LC_MESSAGES category. The C locale is
used <br>
if none of these environment variables are set, if the
locale catalog is not installed, or if grep was not compiled
with national language support (NLS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GREP_OPTIONS <br>
This variable specifies default options to be placed in
front of any explicit options. For example, if GREP_OPTIONS
is &rsquo;--binary-files=without-match
--directories=skip&rsquo;, <br>
grep behaves as if the two options
--binary-files=without-match and --directories=skip had been
specified before any explicit options. Option specifications
are separated <br>
by whitespace. A backslash escapes the next character, so it
can be used to specify an option containing whitespace or a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GREP_COLOR <br>
This variable specifies the color used to highlight matched
(non-empty) text. It is deprecated in favor of GREP_COLORS,
but still supported. The mt, ms, and mc <br>
capabilities of GREP_COLORS have priority over it. It can
only specify the color used to highlight the matching
non-empty text in any matching line (a selected line when
<br>
the -v command-line option is omitted, or a context line
when -v is specified). The default is 01;31, which means a
bold red foreground text on the terminal&rsquo;s default
<br>
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GREP_COLORS <br>
Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight
various parts of the output. Its value is a colon-separated
list of capabilities that defaults to <br>
ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the
rv and ne boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).
Supported capabilities are as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sl= SGR substring for whole
selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the -v
command-line option is omitted, or non-matching lines when
-v is specified). If however <br>
the boolean rv capability and the -v command-line option are
both specified, it applies to context matching lines
instead. The default is empty (i.e., the <br>
terminal&rsquo;s default color pair).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cx= SGR substring for whole
context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the -v
command-line option is omitted, or matching lines when -v is
specified). If however the <br>
boolean rv capability and the -v command-line option are
both specified, it applies to selected non-matching lines
instead. The default is empty (i.e., the <br>
terminal&rsquo;s default color pair).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rv Boolean value that reverses
(swaps) the meanings of the sl= and cx= capabilities when
the -v command-line option is specified. The default is
false (i.e., the <br>
capability is omitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mt=01;31 <br>
SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching
line (i.e., a selected line when the -v command-line option
is omitted, or a context line when -v is <br>
specified). Setting this is equivalent to setting both ms=
and mc= at once to the same value. The default is a bold red
text foreground over the current line <br>
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ms=01;31 <br>
SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a selected
line. (This is only used when the -v command-line option is
omitted.) The effect of the sl= (or cx= if rv) <br>
capability remains active when this kicks in. The default is
a bold red text foreground over the current line
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mc=01;31 <br>
SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a context line.
(This is only used when the -v command-line option is
specified.) The effect of the cx= (or sl= if <br>
rv) capability remains active when this kicks in. The
default is a bold red text foreground over the current line
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fn=35 SGR substring for file
names prefixing any content line. The default is a magenta
text foreground over the terminal&rsquo;s default
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ln=32 SGR substring for line
numbers prefixing any content line. The default is a green
text foreground over the terminal&rsquo;s default
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bn=32 SGR substring for byte
offsets prefixing any content line. The default is a green
text foreground over the terminal&rsquo;s default
background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">se=36 SGR substring for
separators that are inserted between selected line fields
(:), between context line fields, (-), and between groups of
adjacent lines when nonzero <br>
context is specified (--). The default is a cyan text
foreground over the terminal&rsquo;s default background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ne Boolean value that prevents
clearing to the end of line using Erase in Line (EL) to
Right (33[K) each time a colorized item ends. This is needed
on terminals on <br>
which EL is not supported. It is otherwise useful on
terminals for which the back_color_erase (bce) boolean
terminfo capability does not apply, when the chosen <br>
highlight colors do not affect the background, or when EL is
too slow or causes too much flicker. The default is false
(i.e., the capability is omitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that boolean capabilities
have no =... part. They are omitted (i.e., false) by default
and become true when specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the Select Graphic Rendition
(SGR) section in the documentation of the text terminal that
is used for permitted values and their meaning as character
attributes. <br>
These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons. grep
takes care of assembling the result into a complete SGR <br>
sequence (33[...m). Common values to concatenate include 1
for bold, 4 for underline, 5 for blink, 7 for inverse, 39
for default foreground color, 30 to 37 for <br>
foreground colors, 90 to 97 for 16-color mode foreground
colors, 38;5;0 to 38;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes
foreground colors, 49 for default background color, 40 <br>
to 47 for background colors, 100 to 107 for 16-color mode
background colors, and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color and
256-color modes background colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG <br>
These variables specify the locale for the LC_COLLATE
category, which determines the collating sequence used to
interpret range expressions like [a-z].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG <br>
These variables specify the locale for the LC_CTYPE
category, which determines the type of characters, e.g.,
which characters are whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG <br>
These variables specify the locale for the LC_MESSAGES
category, which determines the language that grep uses for
messages. The default C locale uses American English <br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIXLY_CORRECT <br>
If set, grep behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, grep
behaves more like other GNU programs. POSIX requires that
options that follow file names must be treated as file <br>
names; by default, such options are permuted to the front of
the operand list and are treated as options. Also, POSIX
requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as <br>
&acirc;illegal&acirc;, but since they are not really against
the law the default is to diagnose them as
&acirc;invalid&acirc;. POSIXLY_CORRECT also disables
_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_, <br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_
<br>
(Here N is grep&rsquo;s numeric process ID.) If the ith
character of this environment variable&rsquo;s value is 1,
do not consider the ith operand of grep to be an option,
even if it <br>
appears to be one. A shell can put this variable in the
environment for each command it runs, specifying which
operands are the results of file name wildcard expansion
<br>
and therefore should not be treated as options. This
behavior is available only with the GNU C library, and only
when POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Normally, the exit status is 0 if selected lines are found
and 1 otherwise. But the exit status is 2 if an error
occurred, unless the -q or --quiet or --silent option is
used <br>
and a selected line is found. Note, however, that POSIX only
mandates, for programs such as grep, cmp, and diff, that the
exit status in case of error be greater than 1; it is <br>
therefore advisable, for the sake of portability, to use
logic that tests for this general condition instead of
strict equality with 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Bugs <br>
Large repetition counts in the {n,m} construct may cause
grep to use lots of memory. In addition, certain other
obscure regular expressions require exponential time and
space, <br>
and may cause grep to run out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Back-references are very slow,
and may require exponential time.</p>
