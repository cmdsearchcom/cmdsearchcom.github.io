<p>CHEM(1) General Commands Manual CHEM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chem - groff preprocessor for producing chemical structure
diagrams</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chem [option...] [--] [filespec...] <br>
chem -h | --help <br>
chem -v | --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION USAGE <br>
There are no other options than -h, --help, -v, and
--version; these options provoke the printing of a version
or usage information, respectively, and all filespec
arguments are <br>
ignored. A filespec argument is either a file name of an
existing file or a minus character -, meaning standard
input. If no argument is specified then standard input is
taken <br>
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
chem produces chemical structure diagrams. Today&rsquo;s
version is best suited for organic chemistry (bonds, rings).
The chem program is a groff preprocessor like eqn, pic, tbl,
<br>
etc. It generates pic output such that all chem parts are
translated into diagrams of the pic language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program chem originates from
the Perl source file chem.pl. It tells pic to include a copy
of the macro file chem.pic. Moreover the groff source file
pic.tmac is loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a style reminiscent of eqn
and pic, the chem diagrams are written in a special
language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A set of chem lines looks like
this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.cstart <br>
chem data <br>
.cend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines containing the keywords
.cstart and .cend start and end the input for chem,
respectively. In pic context, i.e., after the call of .PS,
chem input can optionally be started <br>
by the line begin chem and ended by the line with the single
word end instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anything outside these
initialization lines is copied through without modification;
all data between the initialization lines is converted into
pic commands to draw the diagram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.cstart <br>
CH3 <br>
bond <br>
CH3 <br>
.cend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints two CH3 groups with a
bond between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To actually view this, you must
run chem followed by groffer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chem [file...] | groffer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to create just groff
output, you must run chem followed by groff with the option
-p for the activation of pic:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chem [file...] | groff -p
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE LANGUAGE <br>
The chem input language is rather small. It provides rings
of several styles and a way to glue them together as
desired, bonds of several styles, moieties (e.g., C, NH3,
...), <br>
and strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting Variables <br>
There are some variables that can be set by commands. Such
commands have two possible forms, either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets the given variable to
the argument value. If more arguments are given only the
last argument is taken, all other arguments are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are only a few variables
to be set by these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">textht arg <br>
Set the height of the text to arg; default is 0.16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwid arg <br>
Set the character width to arg; default is 0.12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db arg Set the bond length to
arg; default is 0.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size arg <br>
Scale the diagram to make it look plausible at point size
arg; default is 10 point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bonds <br>
This</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond [direction] [length n]
[from Name|picstuff]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">draws a single bond in direction
from nearest corner of Name. bond can also be double bond,
front bond, back bond, etc. (We will get back to Name
soon.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">direction is the angle in
degrees (0 up, positive clockwise) or a direction word like
up, down, sw (= southwest), etc. If no direction is
specified, the bond goes in the current <br>
direction (usually that of the last bond).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the bond begins at the
last object placed; this can be changed by naming a from
place. For instance, to make a simple alkyl chain:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CH3 <br>
bond (this one goes right from the CH3) <br>
C (at the right end of the bond) <br>
double bond up (from the C) <br>
O (at the end of the double bond) <br>
bond right from C <br>
CH3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A length in inches may be
specified to override the default length. Other pic commands
can be tacked on to the end of a bond command, to created
dotted or dashed bonds or to <br>
specify a to place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rings <br>
There are lots of rings, but only 5 and 6-sided rings get
much support. ring by itself is a 6-sided ring; benzene is
the benzene ring with a circle inside. aromatic puts a
cir&acirc; <br>
cle into any kind of ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ring [pointing
(up|right|left|down)] [aromatic] [put Mol at n] [double i,j
k,l ...] [picstuff]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vertices of a ring are
numbered 1, 2, ... from the vertex that points in the
natural compass direction. So for a hexagonal ring with the
point at the top, the top vertex <br>
is 1, while if the ring has a point at the east side, that
is vertex 1. This is expressed as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R1: ring pointing up <br>
R2: ring pointing right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ring vertices are named .V1,
..., .Vn, with .V1 in the pointing direction. So the corners
of R1 are R1.V1 (the top), R1.V2, R1.V3, R1.V4 (the bottom),
etc., whereas for R2, <br>
R2.V1 is the rightmost vertex and R2.V4 the leftmost. These
vertex names are used for connecting bonds or other rings.
For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R1: benzene pointing right <br>
R2: benzene pointing right with .V6 at R1.V2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates two benzene rings
connected along a side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interior double bonds are
specified as double n1,n2 n3,n4 ...; each number pair adds
an interior bond. So the alternate form of a benzene ring
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ring double 1,2 3,4 5,6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Heterocycles (rings with
something other than carbon at a vertex) are written as put
X at V, as in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R: ring put N at 1 put O at
2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this heterocycle, R.N and R.O
become synonyms for R.V1 and R.V2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two 5-sided rings.
ring5 is pentagonal with a side that matches the 6-sided
ring; it has four natural directions. A flatring is a
5-sided ring created by chopping one <br>
corner of a 6-sided ring so that it exactly matches the
6-sided rings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of a ring has to
fit on a single line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moieties and Strings <br>
A moiety is a string of characters beginning with a capital
letter, such as N(C2H5)2. Numbers are converted to
subscripts (unless they appear to be fractional values, as
in <br>
N2.5H). The name of a moiety is determined from the moiety
after special characters have been stripped out: e.g.,
N(C2H5)2) has the name NC2H52.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moieties can be specified in two
kinds. Normally a moiety is placed right after the last
thing mentioned, separated by a semicolon surrounded by
spaces, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B1: bond ; OH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the moiety is OH; it is set
after a bond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the second kind a moiety can
be positioned as the first word in a pic-like command,
e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CH3 at C + (0.5,0.5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the moiety is CH3. It is
placed at a position relative to C, a moiety used earlier in
the chemical structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So moiety names can be specified
as chem positions everywhere in the chem code. Beneath their
printing moieties are names for places.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The moiety BP is special. It is
not printed but just serves as a mark to be referred to in
later chem commands. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond ; BP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sets a mark at the end of the
bond. This can be used then for specifying a place. The name
BP is derived from branch point (i.e., line crossing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A string within double quotes
&quot; is interpreted as a part of a chem command. It
represents a string that should be printed (without the
quotes). Text within quotes &quot;...&quot; is <br>
treated more or less like a moiety except that no changes
are made to the quoted part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Names <br>
In the alkyl chain above, notice that the carbon atom C was
used both to draw something and as the name for a place. A
moiety always defines a name for a place; you can use <br>
your own names for places instead, and indeed, for rings you
will have to. A name is just</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name: ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name is often the name of a
moiety like CH3, but it need not to be. Any name that begins
with a capital letter and which contains only letters and
numbers is valid:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First: bond <br>
bond 30 from First</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous <br>
The specific construction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond ... ; moiety</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bond <br>
moiety</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, each item has to be
on a separate line (and only one line). Note that there must
be whitespace after the semicolon which separates the
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A period character . or a single
quote &rsquo; in the first column of a line signals a troff
command, which is copied through as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line whose first non-blank
character is a hash character (#) is treated as a comment
and thus ignored. However, hash characters within a word are
kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line whose first word is pic
is copied through as-is after the word pic has been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scales the diagram to make it
look plausible at point size n (default is 10 point).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anything else is assumed to be
pic code, which is copied through with a label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since chem is a pic
preprocessor, it is possible to include pic statements in
the middle of a diagram to draw things not provided for by
chem itself. Such pic statements should <br>
be included in chem code by adding pic as the first word of
this line for clarity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following pic commands are
accepted as chem commands, so no pic command word is
needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define Start the definition of
pic macro within chem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Start a block composite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">] End a block composite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ Start a macro definition
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} End a macro definition
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macro names from define
statements are stored and their call is accepted as a chem
command as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WISH LIST <br>
This TODO list was collected by Brian Kernighan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error checking is minimal;
errors are usually detected and reported in an oblique
fashion by pic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no library or file
inclusion mechanism, and there is no shorthand for
repetitive structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The extension mechanism is to
create pic macros, but these are tricky to get right and
don&rsquo;t have all the properties of built-in objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no in-line chemistry
yet (e.g., analogous to the $...$ construct of eqn).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no way to control entry
point for bonds on groups. Normally a bond connects to the
carbon atom if entering from the top or bottom and otherwise
to the nearest corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bonds from substituted atoms on
heterocycles do not join at the proper place without adding
a bit of pic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no decent primitive for
brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text (quoted strings)
doesn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A squiggle bond is needed.</p>
