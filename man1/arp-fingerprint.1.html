arp-fingerprint - Fingerprint a system using ARP
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>arp-fingerprint</b> [<i>options</i>] <i>target</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The target should be specified as a single IP address or hostname. You cannot
  specify multiple targets, IP networks or ranges.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use an IP address for the target, you can use the <b>-o</b> option to
  pass the <b>--numeric</b> option to <b>arp-scan</b>, which will prevent it
  from attempting DNS lookups. This can speed up the fingerprinting process,
  especially on systems with a slow or faulty DNS configuration.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>arp-fingerprint</b> fingerprints the specified target host using the ARP
  protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It sends various different types of ARP request to the target, and records which
  types it responds to. From this, it constructs a fingerprint string consisting
  of &quot;1&quot; where the target responded and &quot;0&quot; where it did
  not. An example of a fingerprint string is <i>01000100000</i>. This
  fingerprint string is then used to lookup the likely target operating system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the fingerprint strings are shared by several operating systems, so
  there is not always a one-to-one mapping between fingerprint strings and
  operating systems. Also the fact that a system's fingerprint matches a certain
  operating system (or list of operating systems) does not necessarily mean that
  the system being fingerprinted is that operating system, although it is quite
  likely. This is because the list of operating systems is not exhaustive; it is
  just what I have discovered to date, and there are bound to be operating
  systems that are not listed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ARP fingerprint of a system is generally a function of that system's kernel
  (although it is possible for the ARP function to be implemented in user space,
  it almost never is).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes, an operating system can give different fingerprints depending on the
  configuration. An example is Linux, which will respond to a non-local source
  IP address if that IP is routed through the interface being tested. This is
  both good and bad: on one hand it makes the fingerprinting task more complex;
  but on the other, it can allow some aspects of the system configuration to be
  determined.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes the fact that two different operating systems share a common ARP
  fingerprint string points to a re-use of networking code. One example of this
  is Windows NT and FreeBSD.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>arp-fingerprint</b> uses <b>arp-scan</b> to send the ARP requests and receive
  the replies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are other methods that can be used to fingerprint a system using
  <b>arp-scan</b> which can be used in addition to <b>arp-fingerprint</b>. These
  additional methods are not included in <b>arp-fingerprint</b> either because
  they are likely to cause disruption to the target system, or because they
  require knowledge of the target's configuration that may not always be
  available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>arp-fingerprint</b> is still being developed, and the results should not be
  relied on. As most of the ARP requests that it sends are non-standard, it is
  possible that it may disrupt some systems, so caution is advised.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find a system that <b>arp-fingerprint</b> reports as <i>UNKNOWN</i>, and
  you know what operating system it is running, could you please send details of
  the operating system and fingerprint to <i>arp-scan@nta-monitor.com</i> so I
  can include it in future versions. Please include the exact version of the
  operating system if you know it, as fingerprints sometimes change between
  versions.

<b>arp-fingerprint</b> is implemented in Perl, so you need to have the Perl
