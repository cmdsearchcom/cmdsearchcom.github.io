<p>ARP-FINGERPRINT(1) General Commands Manual
ARP-FINGERPRINT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
arp-fingerprint - Fingerprint a system using ARP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
arp-fingerprint [options] target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target should be specified
as a single IP address or hostname. You cannot specify
multiple targets, IP networks or ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use an IP address for the
target, you can use the -o option to pass the --numeric
option to arp-scan, which will prevent it from attempting
DNS lookups. This can speed up <br>
the fingerprinting process, especially on systems with a
slow or faulty DNS configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
arp-fingerprint fingerprints the specified target host using
the ARP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It sends various different types
of ARP request to the target, and records which types it
responds to. From this, it constructs a fingerprint string
consisting of &quot;1&quot; where the <br>
target responded and &quot;0&quot; where it did not. An
example of a fingerprint string is 01000100000. This
fingerprint string is then used to lookup the likely target
operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the fingerprint strings
are shared by several operating systems, so there is not
always a one-to-one mapping between fingerprint strings and
operating systems. Also the <br>
fact that a system&rsquo;s fingerprint matches a certain
operating system (or list of operating systems) does not
necessarily mean that the system being fingerprinted is that
operating <br>
system, although it is quite likely. This is because the
list of operating systems is not exhaustive; it is just what
I have discovered to date, and there are bound to be
operat&acirc; <br>
ing systems that are not listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ARP fingerprint of a system
is generally a function of that system&rsquo;s kernel
(although it is possible for the ARP function to be
implemented in user space, it almost never <br>
is).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, an operating system
can give different fingerprints depending on the
configuration. An example is Linux, which will respond to a
non-local source IP address if that <br>
IP is routed through the interface being tested. This is
both good and bad: on one hand it makes the fingerprinting
task more complex; but on the other, it can allow some <br>
aspects of the system configuration to be determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes the fact that two
different operating systems share a common ARP fingerprint
string points to a re-use of networking code. One example of
this is Windows NT and Free&acirc; <br>
BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arp-fingerprint uses arp-scan to
send the ARP requests and receive the replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are other methods that can
be used to fingerprint a system using arp-scan which can be
used in addition to arp-fingerprint. These additional
methods are not included in <br>
arp-fingerprint either because they are likely to cause
disruption to the target system, or because they require
knowledge of the target&rsquo;s configuration that may not
always be <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arp-fingerprint is still being
developed, and the results should not be relied on. As most
of the ARP requests that it sends are non-standard, it is
possible that it may disrupt <br>
some systems, so caution is advised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find a system that
arp-fingerprint reports as UNKNOWN, and you know what
operating system it is running, could you please send
details of the operating system and finger&acirc; <br>
print to arp-scan@nta-monitor.com so I can include it in
future versions. Please include the exact version of the
operating system if you know it, as fingerprints sometimes
<br>
change between versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display a brief usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display verbose progress
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;option-string&gt; <br>
Pass specified options to arp-scan. You need to enclose the
options string in quotes if it contains spaces. e.g. -o
&quot;-I eth1&quot;. The commonly used options are
--interface <br>
(-I) and --numeric (-N).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
$ arp-fingerprint 192.168.0.1 <br>
192.168.0.1 01000100000 Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ arp-fingerprint -o &quot;-N -I
eth1&quot; 192.168.0.202 <br>
192.168.0.202 11110100000 FreeBSD 5.3, Win98, WinME, NT4,
2000, XP, 2003</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
arp-fingerprint is implemented in Perl, so you need to have
the Perl interpreter installed on your system to use it.</p>
