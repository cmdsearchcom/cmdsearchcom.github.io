LRZIP is a file compression program designed to do particularly well on very
  large files containing long distance redundancy. lrztar is a wrapper for LRZIP
  to simplify compression and decompression of directories.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option enables integrity checking of the file written
      to disk on decompression. All decompression is tested internally in lrzip
      with either crc32 or md5 hash checking depending on the version of the
      archive already. However the file written to disk may be corrupted for
      other reasons to do with other userspace problems such as faulty library
      versions, drivers, hardware failure and so on. Enabling this option will
      make lrzip perform an md5 hash check on the file that's written to disk.
      When the archive has the md5 value stored in it, it is compared to this.
      Otherwise it is compared to the value calculated during decompression.
      This offers an extra guarantee that the file written is the same as the
      original archived.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Decompress. If this option is not used then lrzip looks at
      the name used to launch the program. If it contains the string
      &quot;lrunzip&quot; then the -d option is automatically set. If it
      contains the string &quot;lrzcat&quot; then the -d -o - options are
      automatically set.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Encrypt. This option enables high grade password encryption
      using a combination of multiply sha512 hashed password, random salt and
      aes128 CBC encryption. Passwords up to 500 characters long are supported,
      and the encryption mechanism used virtually guarantees that the same file
      created with the same password will never be the same. Furthermore, the
      password hashing is increased according to the date the file is encrypted,
      increasing the number of CPU cycles required for each password attempt in
      accordance with Moore's law, thus making the difficulty of attempting
      brute force attacks proportional to the power of modern computers.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-H</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This shows the md5 hash value calculated on compressing or
      decompressing an lrzip archive. By default all compression has the md5
      value calculated and stored in all archives since version 0.560. On
      decompression, when an md5 value has been found, it will be calculated and
      used for integrity checking. If the md5 value is not stored in the
      archive, it will not be calculated unless explicitly specified with this
      option, or check integrity (see below) has been requested.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">This shows information about a compressed file. It shows
      the compressed size, the decompressed size, the compression ratio, what
      compression was used and what hash checking will be used for internal
      integrity checking. Note that the compression mode is detected from the
      first block only and it will show no compression used if the first block
      was incompressible, even if later blocks were compressible. If verbose
      options -v or -vv are added, a breakdown of all the internal blocks and
      progressively more information pertaining to them will also be shown.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If this option is specified then lrzip will not show the
      percentage progress while compressing. Note that compression happens in
      bursts with lzma compression which is the default compression. This means
      that it will progress very rapidly for short periods and then stop for
      long periods.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">LZO Compression. If this option is set then lrzip will use
      the ultra fast lzo compression algorithm for the 2nd stage. This mode of
      compression gives bzip2 like compression at the speed it would normally
      take to simply copy the file, giving excellent compression/time
    value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">No 2nd stage compression. If this option is set then lrzip
      will only perform the long distance redundancy 1st stage compression.
      While this does not compress any faster than LZO compression, it produces
      a smaller file that then responds better to further compression (by eg
      another application), also reducing the compression time
    substantially.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-z</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">ZPAQ compression. Uses ZPAQ compression which is from the
      PAQ family of compressors known for having some of the highest compression
      ratios possible but at the cost of being extremely slow on both compress
      and decompress (4x slower than lzma which is the default).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-L 1..9</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the compression level from 1 to 9. The default is to
      use level 7, which gives good all round compression. The compression level
      is also strongly related to how much memory lrzip uses. See the -w option
      for details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-N value</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The default nice value is 19. This option can be used to
      set the priority scheduling for the lrzip backup or decompression. Valid
      nice values are from -20 to 19. Note this does NOT speed up or slow down
      compression.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p value</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the number of processor count to determine the number
      of threads to run. Normally lrzip will scale according to the number of
      CPUs it detects. Using this will override the value in case you wish to
      use less CPUs to either decrease the load on your machine, or to improve
      compression. Setting it to 1 will maximise compression but will not
      attempt to use more than one CPU.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-T</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disables the LZO compressibility threshold testing when a
      slower compression back-end is used. LZO testing is normally performed for
      the slower back-end compression of LZMA and ZPAQ. The reasoning is that if
      it is completely incompressible by LZO then it will also be incompressible
      by them. Thus if a block fails to be compressed by the very fast LZO,
      lrzip will not attempt to compress that block with the slower compressor,
      thereby saving time. If this option is enabled, it will bypass the LZO
      testing and attempt to compress each block regardless.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-U </b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Unlimited window size. If this option is set, and the file
      being compressed does not fit into the available ram, lrzip will use a
      moving second buffer as a &quot;sliding mmap&quot; which emulates having
      infinite ram. This will provide the most possible compression in the first
      rzip stage which can improve the compression of ultra large files when
      they're bigger than the available ram. However it runs progressively
      slower the larger the difference between ram and the file size, so is best
      reserved for when the smallest possible size is desired on a very large
      file, and the time taken is not important.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the maximum allowable compression window size to n in
      hundreds of megabytes. This is the amount of memory lrzip will search
      during its first stage of pre-compression and is the main thing that will
      determine how much benefit lrzip will provide over ordinary compression
      with the 2nd stage algorithm. If not set (recommended), the value chosen
      will be determined by an internal heuristic in lrzip which uses the most
      memory that is reasonable, without any hard upper limit. It is limited to
      2GB on 32bit machines. lrzip will always reduce the window size to the
      biggest it can be without running out of memory.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMPRESSION_ALGORITHM"><a class="selflink" href="#COMPRESSION_ALGORITHM">COMPRESSION
  ALGORITHM</a></h1>
LRZIP operates in two stages. The first stage finds and encodes large chunks of
  duplicated data over potentially very long distances in the input file. The
  second stage is to use a compression algorithm to compress the output of the
  first stage. The compression algorithm can be chosen to be optimised for
  extreme size (zpaq), size (lzma - default), speed (lzo), legacy (bzip2 or
  gzip) or can be omitted entirely doing only the first stage. A one stage only
  compressed file can almost always improve both the compression size and speed
  done by a subsequent compression program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The key difference between lrzip and other well known compression algorithms is
  its ability to take advantage of very long distance redundancy. The well known
  deflate algorithm used in gzip uses a maximum history buffer of 32k. The block
  sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to 900k of history. The history
  buffer in lrzip can be any size long, not even limited by available ram.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is quite common these days to need to compress files that contain long
  distance redundancies. For example, when compressing a set of home directories
  several users might have copies of the same file, or of quite similar files.
  It is also common to have a single file that contains large duplicated chunks
  over long distances, such as pdf files containing repeated copies of the same
  image. Most compression programs won't be able to take advantage of this
  redundancy, and thus might achieve a much lower compression ratio than lrzip
  can achieve.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
LRZIP recognises a configuration file that contains default settings. This
  configuration is searched for in the current directory, /etc/lrzip, and
  $HOME/.lrzip. The configuration filename must be <b>lrzip.conf</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
By default, lrzip will search for and use a configuration file, lrzip.conf. If
  the user wishes to bypass the file, a startup ENV variable may be set.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>LRZIP =</b> <i>NOCONFIG </i> <b>[lrzip|lrunzip]</b> [OPTIONS] &lt;file&gt;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
which will force lrzip to ignore the configuration file.

  - Notes on rzip by Andrew Tridgell</a></h1>
The ideas behind rzip were first implemented in 1998 while I was working on
  rsync. That version was too slow to be practical, and was replaced by this
  version in 2003. LRZIP was created by the desire to have better compression
  and/or speed by Con Kolivas on blending the lzma and lzo compression
  algorithms with the rzip first stage, and extending the compression windows to
  scale with increasing ram sizes.
