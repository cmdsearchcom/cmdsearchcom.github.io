<p style="margin-top: 1em">LRZIP=NOCONFIG environment
variable setting can be used to bypass lrzip.conf. <br>
TMP environment variable will be used for storage of
temporary files when needed. <br>
TMPDIR may also be stored in lrzip.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no filenames or &quot;-&quot;
is specified, stdin/out will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS General options <br>
-c This option enables integrity checking of the file
written to disk on decompression. All decompression is
tested internally in lrzip with either crc32 or md5 hash
checking <br>
depending on the version of the archive already. However the
file written to disk may be corrupted for other reasons to
do with other userspace problems such as faulty <br>
library versions, drivers, hardware failure and so on.
Enabling this option will make lrzip perform an md5 hash
check on the file that&rsquo;s written to disk. When the
archive <br>
has the md5 value stored in it, it is compared to this.
Otherwise it is compared to the value calculated during
decompression. This offers an extra guarantee that the file
<br>
written is the same as the original archived.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Decompress. If this option is
not used then lrzip looks at the name used to launch the
program. If it contains the string &quot;lrunzip&quot; then
the -d option is automatically <br>
set. If it contains the string &quot;lrzcat&quot; then the
-d -o - options are automatically set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Encrypt. This option enables
high grade password encryption using a combination of
multiply sha512 hashed password, random salt and aes128 CBC
encryption. Passwords up to <br>
500 characters long are supported, and the encryption
mechanism used virtually guarantees that the same file
created with the same password will never be the same.
Fur&acirc; <br>
thermore, the password hashing is increased according to the
date the file is encrypted, increasing the number of CPU
cycles required for each password attempt in accor&acirc;
<br>
dance with Moore&rsquo;s law, thus making the difficulty of
attempting brute force attacks proportional to the power of
modern computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h|-? Print an options summary
page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H This shows the md5 hash value
calculated on compressing or decompressing an lrzip archive.
By default all compression has the md5 value calculated and
stored in all ar&acirc; <br>
chives since version 0.560. On decompression, when an md5
value has been found, it will be calculated and used for
integrity checking. If the md5 value is not stored in <br>
the archive, it will not be calculated unless explicitly
specified with this option, or check integrity (see below)
has been requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i This shows information about
a compressed file. It shows the compressed size, the
decompressed size, the compression ratio, what compression
was used and what hash check&acirc; <br>
ing will be used for internal integrity checking. Note that
the compression mode is detected from the first block only
and it will show no compression used if the first <br>
block was incompressible, even if later blocks were
compressible. If verbose options -v or -vv are added, a
breakdown of all the internal blocks and progressively more
<br>
information pertaining to them will also be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q If this option is specified
then lrzip will not show the percentage progress while
compressing. Note that compression happens in bursts with
lzma compression which is the <br>
default compression. This means that it will progress very
rapidly for short periods and then stop for long
periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r If this option is specified,
lrzip will recursively enter the directories specified,
compressing or decompressing every file individually in the
same directory. Note for <br>
better compression it is recommended to instead combine
files in a tar file rather than compress them separately,
either manually or with the lrztar helper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t This tests the compressed
file integrity. It does this by decompressing it to a
temporary file and then deleting it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[v] Increases verbosity. -vv
will print more messages than -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the lrzip version
number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options affecting output <br>
-D If this option is specified then lrzip will delete the
source file after successful compression or decompression.
When this option is not specified then the source files <br>
are not deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f If this option is not
specified (Default) then lrzip will not overwrite any
existing files. If you set this option then rzip will
silently overwrite any files as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k This option will keep broken
or damaged files instead of deleting them. When compression
or decompression is interrupted either by user or error, or
a file decompressed <br>
fails an integrity check, it is normally deleted by
LRZIP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Set the output file name. If
this option is not set then the output file name is chosen
based on the input name and the suffix. The -o option cannot
be used if more than <br>
one file name is specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Set the output directory for
the default filename. This option cannot be combined with
-o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Set the compression suffix.
The default is &rsquo;.lrz&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options affecting compression
<br>
-b Bzip2 compression. Uses bzip2 compression for the 2nd
stage, much like the original rzip does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Gzip compression. Uses gzip
compression for the 2nd stage. Uses libz compress and
uncompress functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l LZO Compression. If this
option is set then lrzip will use the ultra fast lzo
compression algorithm for the 2nd stage. This mode of
compression gives bzip2 like compres&acirc; <br>
sion at the speed it would normally take to simply copy the
file, giving excellent compression/time value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No 2nd stage compression. If
this option is set then lrzip will only perform the long
distance redundancy 1st stage compression. While this does
not compress any faster <br>
than LZO compression, it produces a smaller file that then
responds better to further compression (by eg another
application), also reducing the compression time
substan&acirc; <br>
tially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z ZPAQ compression. Uses ZPAQ
compression which is from the PAQ family of compressors
known for having some of the highest compression ratios
possible but at the cost of <br>
being extremely slow on both compress and decompress (4x
slower than lzma which is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Low level options <br>
-L 1..9 <br>
Set the compression level from 1 to 9. The default is to use
level 7, which gives good all round compression. The
compression level is also strongly related to how much <br>
memory lrzip uses. See the -w option for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N value <br>
The default nice value is 19. This option can be used to set
the priority scheduling for the lrzip backup or
decompression. Valid nice values are from -20 to 19. Note
this <br>
does NOT speed up or slow down compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p value <br>
Set the number of processor count to determine the number of
threads to run. Normally lrzip will scale according to the
number of CPUs it detects. Using this will over&acirc; <br>
ride the value in case you wish to use less CPUs to either
decrease the load on your machine, or to improve
compression. Setting it to 1 will maximise compression but
will <br>
not attempt to use more than one CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Disables the LZO
compressibility threshold testing when a slower compression
back-end is used. LZO testing is normally performed for the
slower back-end compression of <br>
LZMA and ZPAQ. The reasoning is that if it is completely
incompressible by LZO then it will also be incompressible by
them. Thus if a block fails to be compressed by the <br>
very fast LZO, lrzip will not attempt to compress that block
with the slower compressor, thereby saving time. If this
option is enabled, it will bypass the LZO testing and <br>
attempt to compress each block regardless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Unlimited window size. If
this option is set, and the file being compressed does not
fit into the available ram, lrzip will use a moving second
buffer as a &quot;sliding mmap&quot; <br>
which emulates having infinite ram. This will provide the
most possible compression in the first rzip stage which can
improve the compression of ultra large files when <br>
they&rsquo;re bigger than the available ram. However it runs
progressively slower the larger the difference between ram
and the file size, so is best reserved for when the <br>
smallest possible size is desired on a very large file, and
the time taken is not important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w n Set the maximum allowable
compression window size to n in hundreds of megabytes. This
is the amount of memory lrzip will search during its first
stage of pre-compression <br>
and is the main thing that will determine how much benefit
lrzip will provide over ordinary compression with the 2nd
stage algorithm. If not set (recommended), the value <br>
chosen will be determined by an internal heuristic in lrzip
which uses the most memory that is reasonable, without any
hard upper limit. It is limited to 2GB on 32bit <br>
machines. lrzip will always reduce the window size to the
biggest it can be without running out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
&quot;make install&quot; or just install lrzip somewhere in
your search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPRESSION ALGORITHM <br>
LRZIP operates in two stages. The first stage finds and
encodes large chunks of duplicated data over potentially
very long distances in the input file. The second stage is
to use <br>
a compression algorithm to compress the output of the first
stage. The compression algorithm can be chosen to be
optimised for extreme size (zpaq), size (lzma - default),
speed <br>
(lzo), legacy (bzip2 or gzip) or can be omitted entirely
doing only the first stage. A one stage only compressed file
can almost always improve both the compression size and <br>
speed done by a subsequent compression program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The key difference between lrzip
and other well known compression algorithms is its ability
to take advantage of very long distance redundancy. The well
known deflate algorithm <br>
used in gzip uses a maximum history buffer of 32k. The block
sorting algorithm used in bzip2 is limited to 900k of
history. The history buffer in lrzip can be any size long,
not <br>
even limited by available ram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is quite common these days to
need to compress files that contain long distance
redundancies. For example, when compressing a set of home
directories several users might have <br>
copies of the same file, or of quite similar files. It is
also common to have a single file that contains large
duplicated chunks over long distances, such as pdf files
contain&acirc; <br>
ing repeated copies of the same image. Most compression
programs won&rsquo;t be able to take advantage of this
redundancy, and thus might achieve a much lower compression
ratio than <br>
lrzip can achieve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
LRZIP recognises a configuration file that contains default
settings. This configuration is searched for in the current
directory, /etc/lrzip, and $HOME/.lrzip. The
configura&acirc; <br>
tion filename must be lrzip.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
By default, lrzip will search for and use a configuration
file, lrzip.conf. If the user wishes to bypass the file, a
startup ENV variable may be set. <br>
LRZIP = NOCONFIG [lrzip|lrunzip] [OPTIONS] &lt;file&gt; <br>
which will force lrzip to ignore the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY - Notes on rzip by
Andrew Tridgell <br>
The ideas behind rzip were first implemented in 1998 while I
was working on rsync. That version was too slow to be
practical, and was replaced by this version in 2003. LRZIP
was <br>
created by the desire to have better compression and/or
speed by Con Kolivas on blending the lzma and lzo
compression algorithms with the rzip first stage, and
extending the com&acirc; <br>
pression windows to scale with increasing ram sizes.</p>
