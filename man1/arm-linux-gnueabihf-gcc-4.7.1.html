<p>GCC(1) GNU GCC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard] <br>
[-g] [-pg] [-Olevel] <br>
[-Wwarn...] [-pedantic] <br>
[-Idir...] [-Ldir...] <br>
[-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] <br>
[-foption...] [-mmachine-option...] <br>
[-o outfile] [@file] infile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the most useful options are
listed here; see below for the remainder. g++ accepts mostly
the same options as gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing,
compilation, assembly and linking. The &quot;overall
options&quot; allow you to stop this process at an
intermediate stage. For <br>
example, the -c option says not to run the linker. Then the
output consists of object files output by the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options are passed on to
one stage of processing. Some options control the
preprocessor and others the compiler itself. Yet other
options control the assembler and <br>
linker; most of these are not documented here, since you
rarely need to use any of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the command-line options
that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an
option is only useful with another language (usually C++),
the explanation says so <br>
explicitly. If the description for a particular option does
not mention a source language, you can use that option with
all supported languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gcc program accepts options
and file names as operands. Many options have multi-letter
names; therefore multiple single-letter options may not be
grouped: -dv is very <br>
different from -d -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can mix options and other
arguments. For the most part, the order you use
doesn&rsquo;t matter. Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if <br>
you specify -L more than once, the directories are searched
in the order specified. Also, the placement of the -l option
is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many options have long names
starting with -f or with -W---for example,
-fmove-loop-invariants, -Wformat and so on. Most of these
have both positive and negative forms; the <br>
negative form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo. This manual
documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is not
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling the Kind of
Output <br>
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing,
compilation proper, assembly and linking, always in that
order. GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several
<br>
files either into several assembler input files, or into one
assembler input file; then each assembler input file
produces an object file, and linking combines all the object
<br>
files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For any given input file, the
file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is
done:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.c <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.mm <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.mii <br>
Objective-C++ source code that should not be
preprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.h <br>
C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x none <br>
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent
files are handled according to their file name suffixes (as
they are if -x has not been used at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pass-exit-codes <br>
Normally the gcc program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code. If
you specify -pass-exit-codes, the gcc program will <br>
instead return with numerically highest error produced by
any phase that returned an error indication. The C, C++, and
Fortran frontends return 4, if an internal compiler <br>
error is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only want some of the
stages of compilation, you can use -x (or filename suffixes)
to tell gcc where to start, and one of the options -c, -S,
or -E to say where gcc is to <br>
stop. Note that some combinations (for example, -x
cpp-output -E) instruct gcc to do nothing at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Compile or assemble the
source files, but do not link. The linking stage simply is
not done. The ultimate output is in the form of an object
file for each source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the object file name
for a source file is made by replacing the suffix .c, .i,
.s, etc., with .o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized input files, not
requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Stop after the stage of
compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is in the
form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the assembler file
name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix .c,
.i, etc., with .s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input files that don&rsquo;t
require compilation are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Stop after the preprocessing
stage; do not run the compiler proper. The output is in the
form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input files that don&rsquo;t
require preprocessing are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Place output in file file. This applies regardless to
whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an
executable file, an object file, an assembler file or <br>
preprocessed C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -o is not specified, the
default is to put an executable file in a.out, the object
file for source.suffix in source.o, its assembler file in
source.s, a precompiled header <br>
file in source.suffix.gch, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print (on standard error
output) the commands executed to run the stages of
compilation. Also print the version number of the compiler
driver program and of the preprocessor <br>
and the compiler proper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-### <br>
Like -v except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters
or &quot;./-_&quot;. This is useful for shell scripts to
capture <br>
the driver-generated command lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pipe <br>
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
between the various stages of compilation. This fails to
work on some systems where the assembler is unable to read
<br>
from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has no trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print (on the standard output) a description of the
command-line options understood by gcc. If the -v option is
also specified then --help will also be passed on to the
<br>
various processes invoked by gcc, so that they can display
the command-line options they accept. If the -Wextra option
has also been specified (prior to the --help option), <br>
then command-line options that have no documentation
associated with them will also be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-help <br>
Print (on the standard output) a description of
target-specific command-line options for each tool. For some
targets extra target-specific information may also be
printed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...]
<br>
Print (on the standard output) a description of the
command-line options understood by the compiler that fit
into all specified classes and qualifiers. These are the
<br>
supported classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimizers <br>
This will display all of the optimization options supported
by the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warnings <br>
This will display all of the options controlling warning
messages produced by the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target <br>
This will display target-specific options. Unlike the
--target-help option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler will not be displayed. This is <br>
because those tools do not currently support the extended
--help= syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">params <br>
This will display the values recognized by the --param
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">language <br>
This will display the options supported for language, where
language is the name of one of the languages supported in
this version of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common <br>
This will display the options that are common to all
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the supported
qualifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undocumented <br>
Display only those options that are undocumented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">joined <br>
Display options taking an argument that appears after an
equal sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
--help=target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separate <br>
Display options taking an argument that appears as a
separate word following the original option, such as: -o
output-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus for example to display all
the undocumented target-specific switches supported by the
compiler the following can be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help=target,undocumented</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sense of a qualifier can be
inverted by prefixing it with the ^ character, so for
example to display all binary warning options (i.e., ones
that are either on or off and <br>
that do not take an argument) that have a description,
use:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument to --help= should
not consist solely of inverted qualifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining several classes is
possible, although this usually restricts the output by so
much that there is nothing to display. One case where it
does work however is when <br>
one of the classes is target. So for example to display all
the target-specific optimization options the following can
be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help=target,optimizers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --help= option can be
repeated on the command line. Each successive use will
display its requested class of options, skipping those that
have already been displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -Q option appears on the
command line before the --help= option, then the descriptive
text displayed by --help= is changed. Instead of describing
the displayed <br>
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is
enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that
the compiler knows this at the point where the --help= <br>
option is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a truncated example from
the ARM port of gcc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target
-c <br>
The following options are target specific: <br>
-mabi= 2 <br>
-mabort-on-noreturn [disabled] <br>
-mapcs [disabled]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is sensitive to the
effects of previous command-line options, so for example it
is possible to find out which optimizations are enabled at
-O2 by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q -O2 --help=optimizers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you can discover
which binary optimizations are enabled by -O3 by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers
&gt; /tmp/O3-opts <br>
gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts <br>
diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-canonical-prefixes <br>
Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to /../
or /./, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wrapper <br>
Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program. The name of
the wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma
separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c t.c -wrapper
gdb,--args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will invoke all subprograms
of gcc under gdb --args, thus the invocation of cc1 will be
gdb --args cc1 ....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fplugin=name.so <br>
Load the plugin code in file name.so, assumed to be a shared
object to be dlopen&rsquo;d by the compiler. The base name
of the shared object file is used to identify the plugin
<br>
for the purposes of argument parsing (See
-fplugin-arg-name-key=value below). Each plugin should
define the callback functions specified in the Plugins
API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fplugin-arg-name-key=value <br>
Define an argument called key with a value of value for the
plugin called name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-ada-spec[-slim] <br>
For C and C++ source and include files, generate
corresponding Ada specs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-go-spec=file <br>
For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in file. This generates Go &quot;const&quot;,
&quot;type&quot;, &quot;var&quot;, and &quot;func&quot;
declarations which may be a useful way <br>
to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiling C++ Programs <br>
C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes .C,
.cc, .cpp, .CPP, .c++, .cp, or .cxx; C++ header files often
use .hh, .hpp, .H, or (for shared template code) .tcc; and
<br>
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix .ii. GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs
even if you call the compiler the same way as for compiling
C <br>
programs (usually with the name gcc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the use of gcc does not
add the C++ library. g++ is a program that calls GCC and
treats .c, .h and .i files as C++ source files instead of C
source files unless -x is <br>
used, and automatically specifies linking against the C++
library. This program is also useful when precompiling a C
header file with a .h extension for use in C++ compilations.
<br>
On many systems, g++ is also installed with the name
c++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you compile C++ programs,
you may specify many of the same command-line options that
you use for compiling programs in any language; or
command-line options meaningful for C <br>
and related languages; or options that are meaningful only
for C++ programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling C Dialect
<br>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages
derived from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++)
that the compiler accepts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ansi <br>
In C mode, this is equivalent to -std=c90. In C++ mode, it
is equivalent to -std=c++98.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This turns off certain features
of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C
code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as
the &quot;asm&quot; and <br>
&quot;typeof&quot; keywords, and predefined macros such as
&quot;unix&quot; and &quot;vax&quot; that identify the type
of system you are using. It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO <br>
trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables
recognition of C++ style // comments as well as the
&quot;inline&quot; keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternate keywords
&quot;__asm__&quot;, &quot;__extension__&quot;,
&quot;__inline__&quot; and &quot;__typeof__&quot; continue
to work despite -ansi. You would not want to use them in an
ISO C program, of <br>
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that
might be included in compilations done with -ansi. Alternate
predefined macros such as &quot;__unix__&quot; and
&quot;__vax__&quot; are <br>
also available, with or without -ansi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ansi option does not cause
non-ISO programs to be rejected gratuitously. For that,
-pedantic is required in addition to -ansi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macro
&quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot; is predefined when the -ansi
option is used. Some header files may notice this macro and
refrain from declaring certain functions or defining <br>
certain macros that the ISO standard doesn&rsquo;t call for;
this is to avoid interfering with any programs that might
use these names for other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions that would normally be
built in but do not have semantics defined by ISO C (such as
&quot;alloca&quot; and &quot;ffs&quot;) are not built-in
functions when -ansi is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-std= <br>
Determine the language standard. This option is currently
only supported when compiling C or C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler can accept several
base standards, such as c90 or c++98, and GNU dialects of
those standards, such as gnu90 or gnu++98. By specifying a
base standard, the <br>
compiler will accept all programs following that standard
and those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.
For example, -std=c90 turns off certain features of GCC <br>
that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the
&quot;asm&quot; and &quot;typeof&quot; keywords, but not
other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90,
such as omitting the middle <br>
term of a &quot;?:&quot; expression. On the other hand, by
specifying a GNU dialect of a standard, all features the
compiler support are enabled, even when those features
change the <br>
meaning of the base standard and some strict-conforming
programs may be rejected. The particular standard is used by
-pedantic to identify which features are GNU extensions <br>
given that version of the standard. For example -std=gnu90
-pedantic would warn about C++ style // comments, while
-std=gnu99 -pedantic would not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A value for this option must be
provided; possible values are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c90 <br>
c89 <br>
iso9899:1990 <br>
Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that
conflict with ISO C90 are disabled). Same as -ansi for C
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso9899:199409 <br>
ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c99 <br>
c9x <br>
iso9899:1999 <br>
iso9899:199x <br>
ISO C99. Note that this standard is not yet fully supported;
see &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/c99status.html&gt; for
more information. The names c9x and iso9899:199x are <br>
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c11 <br>
c1x <br>
iso9899:2011 <br>
ISO C11, the 2011 revision of the ISO C standard. Support is
incomplete and experimental. The name c1x is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnu90 <br>
gnu89 <br>
GNU dialect of ISO C90 (including some C99 features). This
is the default for C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnu99 <br>
gnu9x <br>
GNU dialect of ISO C99. When ISO C99 is fully implemented in
GCC, this will become the default. The name gnu9x is
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnu11 <br>
gnu1x <br>
GNU dialect of ISO C11. Support is incomplete and
experimental. The name gnu1x is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c++98 <br>
The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Same as -ansi for
C++ code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnu++98 <br>
GNU dialect of -std=c++98. This is the default for C++
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c++11 <br>
The 2011 ISO C++ standard plus amendments. Support for C++11
is still experimental, and may change in incompatible ways
in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnu++11 <br>
GNU dialect of -std=c++11. Support for C++11 is still
experimental, and may change in incompatible ways in future
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnu89-inline <br>
The option -fgnu89-inline tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for &quot;inline&quot; functions when in C99
mode. <br>
This option is accepted and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up
to but not including 4.3. In GCC versions 4.3 and later it
changes the behavior of GCC in C99 mode. Using <br>
this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
&quot;gnu_inline&quot; function attribute to all inline
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -fno-gnu89-inline
explicitly tells GCC to use the C99 semantics for
&quot;inline&quot; when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior). This option was <br>
first supported in GCC 4.3. This option is not supported in
-std=c90 or -std=gnu90 mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preprocessor macros
&quot;__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__&quot; and
&quot;__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__&quot; may be used to check which
semantics are in effect for &quot;inline&quot;
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aux-info filename <br>
Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all
functions declared and/or defined in a translation unit,
including those in header files. This option is <br>
silently ignored in any language other than C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides declarations, the file
indicates, in comments, the origin of each declaration
(source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped <br>
(I, N for new or O for old, respectively, in the first
character after the line number and the colon), and whether
it came from a declaration or a definition (C or F, <br>
respectively, in the following character). In the case of
function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of arguments
followed by their declarations is also provided, inside <br>
comments, after the declaration.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions
<br>
Accept variadic functions without named parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although it is possible to
define such a function, this is not very useful as it is not
possible to read the arguments. This is only supported for C
as this construct is <br>
allowed by C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-asm <br>
Do not recognize &quot;asm&quot;, &quot;inline&quot; or
&quot;typeof&quot; as a keyword, so that code can use these
words as identifiers. You can use the keywords
&quot;__asm__&quot;, &quot;__inline__&quot; and
&quot;__typeof__&quot; <br>
instead. -ansi implies -fno-asm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C++, this switch only affects
the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword, since &quot;asm&quot; and
&quot;inline&quot; are standard keywords. You may want to
use the -fno-gnu-keywords flag instead, which has the <br>
same effect. In C99 mode (-std=c99 or -std=gnu99), this
switch only affects the &quot;asm&quot; and
&quot;typeof&quot; keywords, since &quot;inline&quot; is a
standard keyword in ISO C99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-builtin <br>
-fno-builtin-function <br>
Don&rsquo;t recognize built-in functions that do not begin
with __builtin_ as prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC normally generates special
code to handle certain built-in functions more efficiently;
for instance, calls to &quot;alloca&quot; may become single
instructions which adjust the <br>
stack directly, and calls to &quot;memcpy&quot; may become
inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as
<br>
such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can
you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a
different library. In addition, when a function is <br>
recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information
about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if
<br>
the resulting code still contains calls to that function.
For example, warnings are given with -Wformat for bad calls
to &quot;printf&quot;, when &quot;printf&quot; is built in,
and &quot;strlen&quot; is <br>
known not to modify global memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -fno-builtin-function
option only the built-in function function is disabled.
function must not begin with __builtin_. If a function is
named that is not built-in <br>
in this version of GCC, this option is ignored. There is no
corresponding -fbuiltin-function option; if you wish to
enable built-in functions selectively when using <br>
-fno-builtin or -ffreestanding, you may define macros such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define abs(n) __builtin_abs
((n)) <br>
#define strcpy(d, s) __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fhosted <br>
Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.
This implies -fbuiltin. A hosted environment is one in which
the entire standard library is available, and in <br>
which &quot;main&quot; has a return type of &quot;int&quot;.
Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. This is
equivalent to -fno-freestanding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffreestanding <br>
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding
environment. This implies -fno-builtin. A freestanding
environment is one in which the standard library may not
exist, <br>
and program startup may not necessarily be at
&quot;main&quot;. The most obvious example is an OS kernel.
This is equivalent to -fno-hosted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopenmp <br>
Enable handling of OpenMP directives &quot;#pragma omp&quot;
in C/C++ and &quot;!$omp&quot; in Fortran. When -fopenmp is
specified, the compiler generates parallel code according to
the OpenMP <br>
Application Program Interface v3.0
&lt;http://www.openmp.org/&gt;. This option implies
-pthread, and thus is only supported on targets that have
support for -pthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnu-tm <br>
When the option -fgnu-tm is specified, the compiler will
generate code for the Linux variant of Intel&rsquo;s current
Transactional Memory ABI specification document (Revision
1.1, <br>
May 6 2009). This is an experimental feature whose interface
may change in future versions of GCC, as the official
specification changes. Please note that not all <br>
architectures are supported for this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on
GCC&rsquo;s support for transactional memory,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the transactional
memory feature is not supported with non-call exceptions
(-fnon-call-exceptions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fms-extensions <br>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C++ code, this allows member
names in structures to be similar to previous types
declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef int UOW; <br>
struct ABC { <br>
UOW UOW; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some cases of unnamed fields in
structures and unions are only accepted with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fplan9-extensions <br>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enables -fms-extensions,
permits passing pointers to structures with anonymous fields
to functions that expect pointers to elements of the type of
the field, and permits <br>
referring to anonymous fields declared using a typedef. This
is only supported for C, not C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trigraphs <br>
Support ISO C trigraphs. The -ansi option (and -std options
for strict ISO C conformance) implies -trigraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-integrated-cpp <br>
Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and
compiling. This option allows a user supplied
&quot;cc1&quot;, &quot;cc1plus&quot;, or &quot;cc1obj&quot;
via the -B option. The user supplied <br>
compilation step can then add in an additional preprocessing
step after normal preprocessing but before compiling. The
default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The semantics of this option
will change if &quot;cc1&quot;, &quot;cc1plus&quot;, and
&quot;cc1obj&quot; are merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-traditional <br>
-traditional-cpp <br>
Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a
pre-standard C compiler. They are now only supported with
the -E switch. The preprocessor continues to support a <br>
pre-standard mode. See the GNU CPP manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcond-mismatch <br>
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the
second and third arguments. The value of such an expression
is void. This option is not supported for C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flax-vector-conversions <br>
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing
numbers of elements and/or incompatible element types. This
option should not be used for new code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funsigned-char <br>
Let the type &quot;char&quot; be unsigned, like
&quot;unsigned char&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each kind of machine has a
default for what &quot;char&quot; should be. It is either
like &quot;unsigned char&quot; by default or like
&quot;signed char&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ideally, a portable program
should always use &quot;signed char&quot; or &quot;unsigned
char&quot; when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use <br>
plain &quot;char&quot; and expect it to be signed, or expect
it to be unsigned, depending on the machines they were
written for. This option, and its inverse, let you make such
a <br>
program work with the opposite default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type &quot;char&quot; is
always a distinct type from each of &quot;signed char&quot;
or &quot;unsigned char&quot;, even though its behavior is
always just like one of those two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsigned-char <br>
Let the type &quot;char&quot; be signed, like &quot;signed
char&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is equivalent to
-fno-unsigned-char, which is the negative form of
-funsigned-char. Likewise, the option -fno-signed-char is
equivalent to -funsigned-char.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsigned-bitfields <br>
-funsigned-bitfields <br>
-fno-signed-bitfields <br>
-fno-unsigned-bitfields <br>
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or
unsigned, when the declaration does not use either
&quot;signed&quot; or &quot;unsigned&quot;. By default, such
a bit-field is signed, <br>
because this is consistent: the basic integer types such as
&quot;int&quot; are signed types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling C++ Dialect
<br>
This section describes the command-line options that are
only meaningful for C++ programs; but you can also use most
of the GNU compiler options regardless of what language your
<br>
program is in. For example, you might compile a file
&quot;firstClass.C&quot; like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g++ -g -frepo -O -c
firstClass.C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, only -frepo is
an option meant only for C++ programs; you can use the other
options with any language supported by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of options that
are only for compiling C++ programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fabi-version=n <br>
Use version n of the C++ ABI. Version 2 is the version of
the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4. Version 1 is the
version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ <br>
3.2. Version 0 will always be the version that conforms most
closely to the C++ ABI specification. Therefore, the ABI
obtained using version 0 will change as ABI bugs are <br>
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is version 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 3 corrects an error in
mangling a constant address as a template argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 4, which first appeared
in G++ 4.5, implements a standard mangling for vector
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 5, which first appeared
in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of attribute
const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function <br>
parameter in the declaration of another parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 6, which first appeared
in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion behavior of C++11 scoped
enums and the mangling of template argument packs,
const/static_cast, prefix ++ <br>
and --, and a class scope function used as a template
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also -Wabi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-access-control <br>
Turn off all access checking. This switch is mainly useful
for working around bugs in the access control code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcheck-new <br>
Check that the pointer returned by &quot;operator new&quot;
is non-null before attempting to modify the storage
allocated. This check is normally unnecessary because the
C++ standard <br>
specifies that &quot;operator new&quot; will only return 0
if it is declared throw(), in which case the compiler will
always check the return value even without this option. In
all <br>
other cases, when &quot;operator new&quot; has a non-empty
exception specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by
throwing &quot;std::bad_alloc&quot;. See also new
(nothrow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconserve-space <br>
Put uninitialized or run-time-initialized global variables
into the common segment, as C does. This saves space in the
executable at the cost of not diagnosing duplicate <br>
definitions. If you compile with this flag and your program
mysteriously crashes after &quot;main()&quot; has completed,
you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
<br>
two definitions were merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is no longer useful
on most targets, now that support has been added for putting
variables into BSS without making them common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconstexpr-depth=n <br>
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr
functions to n. A limit is needed to detect endless
recursion during constant expression evaluation. The minimum
<br>
specified by the standard is 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdeduce-init-list <br>
Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
std::initializer_list from a brace-enclosed initializer
list, i.e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">template &lt;class T&gt; auto
forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t)) <br>
{ <br>
return realfn (t); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void f() <br>
{ <br>
forward({1,2}); // call
forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This deduction was implemented
as a possible extension to the originally proposed semantics
for the C++11 standard, but was not part of the final
standard, so it is disabled <br>
by default. This option is deprecated, and may be removed in
a future version of G++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffriend-injection <br>
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so
that they are visible outside the scope of the class in
which they are declared. Friend functions were documented to
<br>
work this way in the old Annotated C++ Reference Manual, and
versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked that way. However,
in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared in <br>
an enclosing scope can only be found using argument
dependent lookup. This option causes friends to be injected
as they were in earlier releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is for
compatibility, and may be removed in a future release of
G++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-elide-constructors <br>
The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a
temporary that is only used to initialize another object of
the same type. Specifying this option disables that <br>
optimization, and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in
all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-enforce-eh-specs <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate code to check for violation of
exception specifications at run time. This option violates
the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code size
in <br>
production builds, much like defining NDEBUG. This does not
give user code permission to throw exceptions in violation
of the exception specifications; the compiler will <br>
still optimize based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception will result in undefined behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffor-scope <br>
-fno-for-scope <br>
If -ffor-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared
in a for-init-statement is limited to the for loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard. If -fno-for-scope <br>
is specified, the scope of variables declared in a
for-init-statement extends to the end of the enclosing
scope, as was the case in old versions of G++, and other
<br>
(traditional) implementations of C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default if neither flag is
given to follow the standard, but to allow and give a
warning for old-style code that would otherwise be invalid,
or have different behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-gnu-keywords <br>
Do not recognize &quot;typeof&quot; as a keyword, so that
code can use this word as an identifier. You can use the
keyword &quot;__typeof__&quot; instead. -ansi implies
-fno-gnu-keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-implicit-templates <br>
Never emit code for non-inline templates that are
instantiated implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for
explicit instantiations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-implicit-inline-templates
<br>
Don&rsquo;t emit code for implicit instantiations of inline
templates, either. The default is to handle inlines
differently so that compiles with and without optimization
will <br>
need the same set of explicit instantiations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-implement-inlines <br>
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline
functions controlled by #pragma implementation. This will
cause linker errors if these functions are not inlined <br>
everywhere they are called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fms-extensions <br>
Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such
as implicit int and getting a pointer to member function via
non-standard syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-nonansi-builtins <br>
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not
mandated by ANSI/ISO C. These include &quot;ffs&quot;,
&quot;alloca&quot;, &quot;_exit&quot;, &quot;index&quot;,
&quot;bzero&quot;, &quot;conjf&quot;, and other related <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnothrow-opt <br>
Treat a &quot;throw()&quot; exception specification as
though it were a &quot;noexcept&quot; specification to
reduce or eliminate the text size overhead relative to a
function with no exception <br>
specification. If the function has local variables of types
with non-trivial destructors, the exception specification
will actually make the function smaller because the EH <br>
cleanups for those variables can be optimized away. The
semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of a
function with such an exception specification will result in
a <br>
call to &quot;terminate&quot; rather than
&quot;unexpected&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-operator-names <br>
Do not treat the operator name keywords &quot;and&quot;,
&quot;bitand&quot;, &quot;bitor&quot;, &quot;compl&quot;,
&quot;not&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and &quot;xor&quot; as
synonyms as keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-optional-diags <br>
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does
not need to issue. Currently, the only such diagnostic
issued by G++ is the one for a name having multiple <br>
meanings within a class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpermissive <br>
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from
errors to warnings. Thus, using -fpermissive will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-pretty-templates <br>
When an error message refers to a specialization of a
function template, the compiler will normally print the
signature of the template followed by the template arguments
and <br>
any typedefs or typenames in the signature (e.g. &quot;void
f(T) [with T = int]&quot; rather than &quot;void
f(int)&quot;) so that it&rsquo;s clear which template is
involved. When an error message <br>
refers to a specialization of a class template, the compiler
will omit any template arguments that match the default
template arguments for that template. If either of these
<br>
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message
rather than easier, using -fno-pretty-templates will disable
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frepo <br>
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time. This
option also implies -fno-implicit-templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-rtti <br>
Disable generation of information about every class with
virtual functions for use by the C++ run-time type
identification features (dynamic_cast and typeid). If you
don&rsquo;t <br>
use those parts of the language, you can save some space by
using this flag. Note that exception handling uses the same
information, but it will generate it as needed. The <br>
dynamic_cast operator can still be used for casts that do
not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to
&quot;void *&quot; or to unambiguous base classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstats <br>
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the
compilation. This information is generally only useful to
the G++ development team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-enums <br>
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a
value of enumerated type can only be one of the values of
the enumeration (as defined in the C++ standard; <br>
basically, a value that can be represented in the minimum
number of bits needed to represent all the enumerators).
This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a <br>
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftemplate-depth=n <br>
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to
n. A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to
detect endless recursions during template class <br>
instantiation. ANSI/ISO C++ conforming programs must not
rely on a maximum depth greater than 17 (changed to 1024 in
C++11). The default value is 900, as the compiler can <br>
run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some
situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-threadsafe-statics <br>
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in
the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.
You can use this option to reduce code size slightly <br>
in code that doesn&rsquo;t need to be thread-safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-cxa-atexit <br>
Register destructors for objects with static storage
duration with the &quot;__cxa_atexit&quot; function rather
than the &quot;atexit&quot; function. This option is
required for fully <br>
standards-compliant handling of static destructors, but will
only work if your C library supports
&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr
<br>
Don&rsquo;t use the &quot;__cxa_get_exception_ptr&quot;
runtime routine. This will cause
&quot;std::uncaught_exception&quot; to be incorrect, but is
necessary if the runtime routine is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvisibility-inlines-hidden <br>
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to
compare pointers to inline functions or methods where the
addresses of the two functions were taken in different
shared <br>
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of this is that GCC
may, effectively, mark inline methods with
&quot;__attribute__ ((visibility
(&quot;hidden&quot;)))&quot; so that they do not appear in
the export table of a DSO <br>
and do not require a PLT indirection when used within the
DSO. Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect on load
and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the <br>
size of the dynamic export table when the library makes
heavy use of templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of this switch is
not quite the same as marking the methods as hidden
directly, because it does not affect static variables local
to the function or cause the <br>
compiler to deduce that the function is defined in only one
shared object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may mark a method as having
a visibility explicitly to negate the effect of the switch
for that method. For example, if you do want to compare
pointers to a particular <br>
inline method, you might mark it as having default
visibility. Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility will have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicitly instantiated inline
methods are unaffected by this option as their linkage might
otherwise cross a shared library boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvisibility-ms-compat <br>
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make
GCC&rsquo;s C++ linkage model compatible with that of
Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag makes these changes to
GCC&rsquo;s linkage model:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It sets the default
visibility to &quot;hidden&quot;, like
-fvisibility=hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Types, but not their members,
are not hidden by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The One Definition Rule is
relaxed for types without explicit visibility specifications
that are defined in more than one different shared object:
those declarations are <br>
permitted if they would have been permitted when this option
was not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In new code it is better to use
-fvisibility=hidden and export those classes that are
intended to be externally visible. Unfortunately it is
possible for code to rely, <br>
perhaps accidentally, on the Visual Studio behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Among the consequences of these
changes are that static data members of the same type with
the same name but defined in different shared objects will
be different, so <br>
changing one will not change the other; and that pointers to
function members defined in different shared objects may not
compare equal. When this flag is given, it is a <br>
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name
differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-weak <br>
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by
the linker. By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they
are available. This option exists only for testing, and <br>
should not be used by end-users; it will result in inferior
code and has no benefits. This option may be removed in a
future release of G++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc++ <br>
Do not search for header files in the standard directories
specific to C++, but do still search the other standard
directories. (This option is used when building the C++ <br>
library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, these optimization,
warning, and code generation options have meanings only for
C++ programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-default-inline <br>
Do not assume inline for functions defined inside a class
scope. <br>
Note that these functions will have linkage like inline
functions; they just won&rsquo;t be inlined by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible
with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI. Although an effort has been
made to warn about all such cases, there are <br>
probably some cases that are not warned about, even though
G++ is generating incompatible code. There may also be cases
where warnings are emitted even though the code that <br>
is generated will be compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should rewrite your code to
avoid these warnings if you are concerned about the fact
that code generated by G++ may not be binary compatible with
code generated by other <br>
compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The known incompatibilities in
-fabi-version=2 (the default) include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A template with
a non-type template parameter of reference type is mangled
incorrectly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern int N; <br>
template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {}; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is fixed in
-fabi-version=3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SIMD vector
types declared using &quot;__attribute ((vector_size))&quot;
are mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for
overloading of functions taking vectors of <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mangling is changed in
-fabi-version=4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The known incompatibilities in
-fabi-version=1 include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Incorrect
handling of tail-padding for bit-fields. G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A { virtual void f(); int
f1 : 1; }; <br>
struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, G++ will place
&quot;B::f2&quot; into the same byte as&quot;A::f1&quot;;
other compilers will not. You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding &quot;A&quot; so that its size is a <br>
multiple of the byte size on your platform; that will cause
G++ and other compilers to layout &quot;B&quot;
identically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Incorrect
handling of tail-padding for virtual bases. G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A { virtual void f();
char c1; }; <br>
struct B { B(); char c2; }; <br>
struct C : public A, public virtual B {};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, G++ will not place
&quot;B&quot; into the tail-padding for &quot;A&quot;; other
compilers will. You can avoid this problem by explicitly
padding &quot;A&quot; so that its size is a <br>
multiple of its alignment (ignoring virtual base classes);
that will cause G++ and other compilers to layout
&quot;C&quot; identically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Incorrect
handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than
that of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear
in a union. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">union U { int i : 4096; };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assuming that an &quot;int&quot;
does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the union too small
by the number of bits in an &quot;int&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Empty classes
can be placed at incorrect offsets. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A {};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct B { <br>
A a; <br>
virtual void f (); <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct C : public B, public A
{};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G++ will place the &quot;A&quot;
base class of &quot;C&quot; at a nonzero offset; it should
be placed at offset zero. G++ mistakenly believes that the
&quot;A&quot; data member of &quot;B&quot; is already at
<br>
offset zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Names of

Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the
constructors or destructors in that class are private, and
it has neither friends nor public static member
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor (C++
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when delete is used to destroy an instance of a class
that has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is
unsafe to delete an instance of a derived class <br>
through a pointer to a base class if the base class does not
have a virtual destructor. This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnarrowing (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs
within { }, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int i = { 2.2 }; // error:
narrowing from double to int</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is included in -Wall

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnoexcept (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because
of a call to a function that does not have a non-throwing

-Weffc++ is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following -W... options are
not affected by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++
only) <br>
Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
Scott Meyers&rsquo; Effective C++, Second Edition book:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 11: Define
a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically allocated memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 12: Prefer
initialization to assignment in constructors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 14: Make
destructors virtual in base classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 15: Have
&quot;operator=&quot; return a reference to *this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 23:
Don&rsquo;t try to return a reference when you must return
an object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn about violations of
the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers&rsquo; More
Effective C++ book:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 6:
Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment
and decrement operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Item 7: Never
overload &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;||&quot;, or
&quot;,&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selecting this option, be
aware that the standard library headers do not obey all of
these guidelines; use grep -v to filter out those
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn also about the use of an uncasted &quot;NULL&quot; as
sentinel. When compiling only with GCC this is a valid
sentinel, as &quot;NULL&quot; is defined to
&quot;__null&quot;. Although it is a null <br>
pointer constant not a null pointer, it is guaranteed to be
of the same size as a pointer. But this use is not portable
across different compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-non-template-friend (C++
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are
declared within a template. Since the advent of explicit
template specification support in G++, if the name of the
<br>
friend is an unqualified-id (i.e., friend foo(int)), the C++
language specification demands that the friend declare or
define an ordinary, nontemplate function. (Section <br>
14.5.3). Before G++ implemented explicit specification,
unqualified-ids could be interpreted as a particular
specialization of a templatized function. Because this non-
<br>
conforming behavior is no longer the default behavior for
G++, -Wnon-template-friend allows the compiler to check
existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by <br>
default. This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
-Wno-non-template-friend, which keeps the conformant
compiler code but disables the helpful warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-style-cast (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is
used within a C++ program. The new-style casts
(dynamic_cast, static_cast, reinterpret_cast, and
const_cast) are <br>
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to
search for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions
from a base class. For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A { <br>
virtual void f(); <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct B: public A { <br>
void f(int); <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the &quot;A&quot; class version
of &quot;f&quot; is hidden in &quot;B&quot;, and code
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B* b; <br>
b-&gt;f();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will fail to compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to
member function to a plain pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsign-promo (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from
unsigned or enumerated type to a signed type, over a
conversion to an unsigned type of the same size. Previous
<br>
versions of G++ would try to preserve unsignedness, but the
standard mandates the current behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A { <br>
operator int (); <br>
A&amp; operator = (int); <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">main () <br>
{ <br>
A a,b; <br>
a = b; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, G++ will
synthesize a default A&amp; operator = (const A&amp;);,
while cfront will use the user-defined operator =.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ Dialects <br>
(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and
Objective-C++ languages themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section describes the
command-line options that are only meaningful for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs, but you can also use
most of the language-independent GNU <br>
compiler options. For example, you might compile a file
&quot;some_class.m&quot; like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c
some_class.m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, -fgnu-runtime
is an option meant only for Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since Objective-C is
an extension of the C language, Objective-C compilations may
also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
-Wtraditional). Similarly, <br>
Objective-C++ compilations may use C++-specific options
(e.g., -Wabi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of options that
are only for compiling Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconstant-string-class=class-name
<br>
Use class-name as the name of the class to instantiate for
each literal string specified with the syntax
&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;. The default class name is
&quot;NXConstantString&quot; if the GNU <br>
runtime is being used, and &quot;NSConstantString&quot; if
the NeXT runtime is being used (see below). The
-fconstant-cfstrings option, if also present, will override
the <br>
-fconstant-string-class setting and cause
&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot; literals to be laid out as
constant CoreFoundation strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnu-runtime <br>
Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU
Objective-C runtime. This is the default for most types of
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnext-runtime <br>
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime. This is
the default for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac
OS X. The macro &quot;__NEXT_RUNTIME__&quot; is predefined
if <br>
(and only if) this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-nil-receivers <br>
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches
(&quot;[receiver message:arg]&quot;) in this translation
unit ensure that the receiver is not &quot;nil&quot;. This
allows for more efficient <br>
entry points in the runtime to be used. This option is only
available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime and ABI
version 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-abi-version=n <br>
Use version n of the Objective-C ABI for the selected
runtime. This option is currently supported only for the
NeXT runtime. In that case, Version 0 is the traditional
<br>
(32-bit) ABI without support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions. Version 1 is the traditional
(32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C <br>
2.0 additions. Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI. If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit
target machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target
machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors <br>
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance
variables is a C++ object with a non-trivial default
constructor. If so, synthesize a special &quot;- (id) <br>
.cxx_construct&quot; instance method which will run
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance
variables, in order, and then return &quot;self&quot;.
Similarly, check if any <br>
instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
destructor, and if so, synthesize a special &quot;- (void)
.cxx_destruct&quot; method which will run all such default
destructors, <br>
in reverse order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;- (id)
.cxx_construct&quot; and &quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;
methods thusly generated will only operate on instance
variables declared in the current Objective-C class, and not
<br>
those inherited from superclasses. It is the responsibility
of the Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods in an
object&rsquo;s inheritance hierarchy. The &quot;- (id) <br>
.cxx_construct&quot; methods will be invoked by the runtime
immediately after a new object instance is allocated; the
&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot; methods will be invoked
immediately <br>
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of this writing, only the
NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has support for
invoking the &quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot; and &quot;-
(void) .cxx_destruct&quot; methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-direct-dispatch <br>
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher. On Darwin this
is accomplished via the comm page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-exceptions <br>
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling
in Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.
This option is required to use the Objective-C <br>
keywords @try, @throw, @catch, @finally and @synchronized.
This option is available with both the GNU runtime and the
NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with the <br>
NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-gc <br>
Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and
Objective-C++ programs. This option is only available with
the NeXT runtime; the GNU runtime has a different garbage
<br>
collection implementation that does not require special
compiler flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-nilcheck <br>
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a
nil receiver in method invocations before doing the actual
method call. This is the default and can be disabled <br>
using -fno-objc-nilcheck. Class methods and super calls are
never checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag
is set to. Currently this flag does nothing when the <br>
GNU runtime, or an older version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-std=objc1 <br>
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the
language recognized by GCC 4.0. This only affects the
Objective-C additions to the C/C++ language; it does not
affect <br>
conformance to C/C++ standards, which is controlled by the
separate C/C++ dialect option flags. When this option is
used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler, any
<br>
Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is
rejected. This is useful if you need to make sure that your
Objective-C code can be compiled with older versions of <br>
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freplace-objc-classes <br>
Emit a special marker instructing ld(1) not to statically
link in the resulting object file, and allow dyld(1) to load
it in at run time instead. This is used in conjunction <br>
with the Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, where the object
file in question may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded
in the course of program execution, without the need to <br>
restart the program itself. Currently, Fix-and-Continue
functionality is only available in conjunction with the NeXT
runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fzero-link <br>
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily
replaces calls to &quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;
(when the name of the class is known at compile time) with
static class <br>
references that get initialized at load time, which improves
run-time performance. Specifying the -fzero-link flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <br>
&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot; to be retained.
This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during
program <br>
execution. The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to
&quot;objc_get_class(&quot;...&quot;)&quot; regardless of
command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gen-decls <br>
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the
source file to a file named sourcename.decl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted
by the garbage collector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is
issued for every method in the protocol that is not
implemented by the class. The default behavior is to issue a
<br>
warning for every method not explicitly implemented in the
class, even if a method implementation is inherited from the
superclass. If you use the -Wno-protocol option, then <br>
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be
implemented, and no warning is issued for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wselector (Objective-C and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same
selector are found during compilation. The check is
performed on the list of methods in the final stage of <br>
compilation. Additionally, a check is performed for each
selector appearing in a &quot;@selector(...)&quot;
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has
been found <br>
during compilation. Because these checks scan the method
table only at the end of compilation, these warnings are not
produced if the final stage of compilation is not <br>
reached, for example because an error is found during
compilation, or because the -fsyntax-only option is being
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-selector-match
(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or
return types are found for a given selector when attempting
to send a message using this selector to a receiver of <br>
type &quot;id&quot; or &quot;Class&quot;. When this flag is
off (which is the default behavior), the compiler will omit
such warnings if any differences found are confined to types
that share <br>
the same size and alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundeclared-selector
(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if a &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression referring to
an undeclared selector is found. A selector is considered
undeclared if no method with that name has been declared
before <br>
the &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression, either explicitly
in an @interface or @protocol declaration, or implicitly in
an @implementation section. This option always performs its
<br>
checks as soon as a &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression is
found, while -Wselector only performs its checks in the
final stage of compilation. This also enforces the coding
style <br>
convention that methods and selectors must be declared
before being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-objc-runtime-info <br>
Generate C header describing the largest structure that is
passed by value, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to Control Diagnostic
Messages Formatting <br>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted
irrespective of the output device&rsquo;s aspect (e.g. its
width, ...). The options described below can be used to
control the <br>
diagnostic messages formatting algorithm, e.g. how many
characters per line, how often source location information
should be reported. Right now, only the C++ front end can
<br>
honor these options. However it is expected, in the near
future, that the remaining front ends would be able to
digest them correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmessage-length=n <br>
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of
about n characters. The default is 72 characters for g++ and
0 for the rest of the front ends supported by GCC. If <br>
n is zero, then no line-wrapping will be done; each error
message will appear on a single line.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-show-location=once
<br>
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the
diagnostic messages reporter to emit once source location
information; that is, in case the message is too long to fit
<br>
on a single physical line and has to be wrapped, the source
location won&rsquo;t be emitted (as prefix) again, over and
over, in subsequent continuation lines. This is the default
<br>
behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line
<br>
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the
diagnostic messages reporter to emit the same source
location information (as prefix) for physical lines that
result <br>
from the process of breaking a message which is too long to
fit on a single line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-diagnostics-show-option
<br>
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating
the command-line option that directly controls the
diagnostic (if such an option is known to the diagnostic
<br>
machinery). Specifying the -fno-diagnostics-show-option flag
suppresses that behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to Request or Suppress
Warnings <br>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions
that are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or
suggest there may have been an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following
language-independent options do not enable specific warnings
but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsyntax-only <br>
Check the code for syntax errors, but don&rsquo;t do
anything beyond that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-errors=n <br>
Limits the maximum number of error messages to n, at which
point GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue
processing the source code. If n is 0 (the default), there
<br>
is no limit on the number of error messages produced. If
-Wfatal-errors is also specified, then -Wfatal-errors takes
precedence over this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Inhibit all warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror <br>
Make all warnings into errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror= <br>
Make the specified warning into an error. The specifier for
a warning is appended, for example -Werror=switch turns the
warnings controlled by -Wswitch into errors. This <br>
switch takes a negative form, to be used to negate -Werror
for specific warnings, for example -Wno-error=switch makes
-Wswitch warnings not be errors, even when -Werror is in
<br>
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The warning message for each
controllable warning includes the option that controls the
warning. That option can then be used with -Werror= and
-Wno-error= as described <br>
above. (Printing of the option in the warning message can be
disabled using the -fno-diagnostics-show-option flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying -Werror=foo
automatically implies -Wfoo. However, -Wno-error=foo does
not imply anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wfatal-errors <br>
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the
first error occurred rather than trying to keep going and
printing further error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can request many specific
warnings with options beginning -W, for example -Wimplicit
to request warnings on implicit declarations. Each of these
specific warning options <br>
also has a negative form beginning -Wno- to turn off
warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only
one of the two forms, whichever is not the default. For <br>
further, language-specific options also refer to C++ Dialect
Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an unrecognized warning
option is requested (e.g., -Wunknown-warning), GCC will emit
a diagnostic stating that the option is not recognized.
However, if the -Wno- form is <br>
used, the behavior is slightly different: No diagnostic will
be produced for -Wno-unknown-warning unless other
diagnostics are being produced. This allows the use of new
-Wno- <br>
options with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the
compiler will warn that an unrecognized option was used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic <br>
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some
other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. <br>
For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard
specified by any -std option used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs
should compile properly with or without this option (though
a rare few will require -ansi or a -std option specifying
the required version of <br>
ISO C). However, without this option, certain GNU extensions
and traditional C and C++ features are supported as well.
With this option, they are rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic does not cause warning
messages for use of the alternate keywords whose names begin
and end with __. Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the
expression that <br>
follows &quot;__extension__&quot;. However, only system
header files should use these escape routes; application
programs should avoid them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some users try to use -pedantic
to check programs for strict ISO C conformance. They soon
find that it does not do quite what they want: it finds some
non-ISO practices, but <br>
not all---only those for which ISO C requires a diagnostic,
and some others for which diagnostics have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A feature to report any failure
to conform to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but
would require considerable additional work and would be
quite different from <br>
-pedantic. We don&rsquo;t have plans to support such a
feature in the near future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the standard specified
with -std represents a GNU extended dialect of C, such as
gnu90 or gnu99, there is a corresponding base standard, the
version of ISO C on which <br>
the GNU extended dialect is based. Warnings from -pedantic
are given where they are required by the base standard. (It
would not make sense for such warnings to be given <br>
only for features not in the specified GNU C dialect, since
by definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the
compiler supports with the given option, and there <br>
would be nothing to warn about.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic-errors <br>
Like -pedantic, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall <br>
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some
users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or
modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction <br>
with macros. This also enables some language-specific
warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C
and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall turns on the following
warning flags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waddress -Warray-bounds (only
with -O2) -Wc++11-compat -Wchar-subscripts -Wenum-compare
(in C/Objc; this is on by default in C++) -Wimplicit-int (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
-Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only)
-Wcomment -Wformat -Wmain (only for C/ObjC and unless

<br>
-Wuninitialized -Wunknown-pragmas -Wunused-function
-Wunused-label -Wunused-value -Wunused-variable
-Wvolatile-register-var</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some warning flags are
not implied by -Wall. Some of them warn about constructions
that users generally do not consider questionable, but which
occasionally you <br>
might wish to check for; others warn about constructions
that are necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and there
is no simple way to modify the code to suppress the <br>
warning. Some of them are enabled by -Wextra but many of
them must be enabled individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wextra <br>
This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled
by -Wall. (This option used to be called -W. The older name
is still supported, but the newer name is more <br>
descriptive.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wclobbered -Wempty-body
-Wignored-qualifiers -Wmissing-field-initializers
-Wmissing-parameter-type (C only) -Wold-style-declaration (C
only) -Woverride-init -Wsign-compare <br>
-Wtype-limits -Wuninitialized -Wunused-parameter (only with
-Wunused or -Wall) -Wunused-but-set-parameter (only with
-Wunused or -Wall)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -Wextra also prints
warning messages for the following cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A pointer is
compared against integer zero with &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; (C++ only) A
base class is not initialized in a derived class&rsquo; copy
constructor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wchar-subscripts <br>
Warn if an array subscript has type &quot;char&quot;. This
is a common cause of error, as programmers often forget that
this type is signed on some machines. This warning is
enabled <br>
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcomment <br>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in a /*
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a //
comment. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-coverage-mismatch <br>
Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
-fprofile-use option. If a source file was changed between
-fprofile-gen and -fprofile-use, the files with the profile
<br>
feedback can fail to match the source file and GCC cannot
use the profile feedback information. By default, this
warning is enabled and is treated as an error. <br>
-Wno-coverage-mismatch can be used to disable the warning or
-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch can be used to disable the
error. Disabling the error for this warning can result <br>
in poorly optimized code and is useful only in the case of
very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing
code-base. Completely disabling the warning is not <br>
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-cpp <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress warning messages
emitted by &quot;#warning&quot; directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdouble-promotion (C, C++,
Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Give a warning when a value of type &quot;float&quot; is
implicitly promoted to &quot;double&quot;. CPUs with a
32-bit &quot;single-precision&quot; floating-point unit
implement &quot;float&quot; in hardware, but <br>
emulate &quot;double&quot; in software. On such a machine,
doing computations using &quot;double&quot; values is much
more expensive because of the overhead required for software
emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is easy to accidentally do
computations with &quot;double&quot; because floating-point
literals are implicitly of type &quot;double&quot;. For
example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">float area(float radius) <br>
{ <br>
return 3.14159 * radius * radius; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the compiler will perform the
entire computation with &quot;double&quot; because the
floating-point literal is a &quot;double&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat <br>
Check calls to &quot;printf&quot; and &quot;scanf&quot;,
etc., to make sure that the arguments supplied have types
appropriate to the format string specified, and that the
conversions specified <br>
in the format string make sense. This includes standard
functions, and others specified by format attributes, in the
&quot;printf&quot;, &quot;scanf&quot;, &quot;strftime&quot;
and &quot;strfmon&quot; (an X/Open <br>
extension, not in the C standard) families (or other
target-specific families). Which functions are checked
without format attributes having been specified depends on
the <br>
standard version selected, and such checks of functions
without the attribute specified are disabled by
-ffreestanding or -fno-builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The formats are checked against
the format features supported by GNU libc version 2.2. These
include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well as features
from the Single Unix <br>
Specification and some BSD and GNU extensions. Other library
implementations may not support all these features; GCC does
not support warning about features that go beyond a <br>
particular library&rsquo;s limitations. However, if
-pedantic is used with -Wformat, warnings will be given
about format features not in the selected standard version
(but not for <br>
&quot;strfmon&quot; formats, since those are not in any
version of the C standard).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since -Wformat also checks for
null format arguments for several functions, -Wformat also
implies -Wnonnull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat is included in -Wall.
For more control over some aspects of format checking, the
options -Wformat-y2k, -Wno-format-extra-args,
-Wno-format-zero-length, <br>
-Wformat-nonliteral, -Wformat-security, and -Wformat=2 are
available, but are not included in -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: In Ubuntu 8.10 and later
versions this option is enabled by default for C, C++, ObjC,
ObjC++. To disable, use -Wformat=0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-y2k <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn about
&quot;strftime&quot; formats that may yield only a two-digit
year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-format-contains-nul <br>
If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about format strings
that contain NUL bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-format-extra-args <br>
If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about excess arguments
to a &quot;printf&quot; or &quot;scanf&quot; format
function. The C standard specifies that such arguments are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the unused arguments lie
between used arguments that are specified with $ operand
number specifications, normally warnings are still given,
since the implementation <br>
could not know what type to pass to &quot;va_arg&quot; to
skip the unused arguments. However, in the case of
&quot;scanf&quot; formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused <br>
arguments are all pointers, since the Single Unix
Specification says that such unused arguments are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-format-zero-length <br>
If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about zero-length
formats. The C standard specifies that zero-length formats
are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-nonliteral <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn if the format string is
not a string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the
format function takes its format arguments as a <br>
&quot;va_list&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-security <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems. At
present, this warns about calls to &quot;printf&quot; and
&quot;scanf&quot; <br>
functions where the format string is not a string literal
and there are no format arguments, as in &quot;printf
(foo);&quot;. This may be a security hole if the format
string came <br>
from untrusted input and contains %n. (This is currently a
subset of what -Wformat-nonliteral warns about, but in
future warnings may be added to -Wformat-security that are
<br>
not included in -Wformat-nonliteral.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: In Ubuntu 8.10 and later
versions this option is enabled by default for C, C++, ObjC,
ObjC++. To disable, use -Wno-format-security, or disable all
format warnings with <br>
-Wformat=0. To make format security warnings fatal, specify
-Werror=format-security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat=2 <br>
Enable -Wformat plus format checks not included in -Wformat.
Currently equivalent to -Wformat -Wformat-nonliteral
-Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnonnull <br>
Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the &quot;nonnull&quot;
function attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnonnull is included in -Wall
and -Wformat. It can be disabled with the -Wno-nonnull
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winit-self (C, C++, Objective-C
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with
themselves. Note this option can only be used with the
-Wuninitialized option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, GCC will warn about
&quot;i&quot; being uninitialized in the following snippet
only when -Winit-self has been specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() <br>
{ <br>
int i = i; <br>
return i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-int (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn when a declaration does not specify a type. This
warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-function-declaration
(C and Objective-C only) <br>
Give a warning whenever a function is used before being
declared. In C99 mode (-std=c99 or -std=gnu99), this warning
is enabled by default and it is made into an error by <br>
-pedantic-errors. This warning is also enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit (C and Objective-C
only) <br>
Same as -Wimplicit-int and -Wimplicit-function-declaration.
This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++
only) <br>
Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as &quot;const&quot;. For ISO C such a type qualifier
has no effect, since the value returned by a function is not
an <br>
lvalue. For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar
types or &quot;void&quot;. ISO C prohibits qualified
&quot;void&quot; return types on function definitions, so
such return types always <br>
receive a warning even without this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmain <br>
Warn if the type of main is suspicious. main should be a
function with external linkage, returning int, taking either
zero arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate <br>
types. This warning is enabled by default in C++ and is
enabled by either -Wall or -pedantic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-braces <br>
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully
bracketed. In the following example, the initializer for a
is not fully bracketed, but that for b is fully
bracketed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
<br>
int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, C++,
Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wparentheses <br>
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as
when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose <br>
precedence people often get confused about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn if a comparison like
x&lt;=y&lt;=z appears; this is equivalent to (x&lt;=y ? 1 :
0) &lt;= z, which is a different interpretation from that of
ordinary mathematical notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn about constructions
where there may be confusion to which &quot;if&quot;
statement an &quot;else&quot; branch belongs. Here is an
example of such a case:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
if (a) <br>
if (b) <br>
foo (); <br>
else <br>
bar (); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C/C++, every &quot;else&quot;
branch belongs to the innermost possible &quot;if&quot;
statement, which in this example is &quot;if (b)&quot;. This
is often not what the programmer expected, as <br>
illustrated in the above example by indentation the
programmer chose. When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag is
specified. <br>
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the
innermost &quot;if&quot; statement so there is no way the
&quot;else&quot; could belong to the enclosing
&quot;if&quot;. The resulting code would <br>
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
if (a) <br>
{ <br>
if (b) <br>
foo (); <br>
else <br>
bar (); <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn for dangerous uses of
the ?: with omitted middle operand GNU extension. When the
condition in the ?: operator is a boolean expression the
omitted value will be <br>
always 1. Often the user expects it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsequence-point <br>
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of
violations of sequence point rules in the C and C++
standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C and C++ standards defines
the order in which expressions in a C/C++ program are
evaluated in terms of sequence points, which represent a
partial ordering between the <br>
execution of parts of the program: those executed before the
sequence point, and those executed after it. These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is <br>
not part of a larger expression), after the evaluation of
the first operand of a &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;,
&quot;||&quot;, &quot;? :&quot; or &quot;,&quot; (comma)
operator, before a function is called (but after the <br>
evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the
called function), and in certain other places. Other than as
expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of <br>
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not
specified. All these rules describe only a partial order
rather than a total order, since, for example, if two
functions <br>
are called within one expression with no sequence point
between them, the order in which the functions are called is
not specified. However, the standards committee have <br>
ruled that function calls do not overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not specified when between
sequence points modifications to the values of objects take
effect. Programs whose behavior depends on this have
undefined behavior; the C <br>
and C++ standards specify that &quot;Between the previous
and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
expression. <br>
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine
the value to be stored.&quot;. If a program breaks these
rules, the results on any particular implementation are <br>
entirely unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of code with undefined
behavior are &quot;a = a++;&quot;, &quot;a[n] = b[n++]&quot;
and &quot;a[i++] = i;&quot;. Some more complicated cases are
not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an <br>
occasional false positive result, but in general it has been
found fairly effective at detecting this sort of problem in
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard is worded
confusingly, therefore there is some debate over the precise
meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases. Links
to discussions of the problem, <br>
including proposed formal definitions, may be found on the
GCC readings page, at
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by -Wall
for C and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wreturn-type <br>
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that
defaults to &quot;int&quot;. Also warn about any
&quot;return&quot; statement with no return-value in a
function whose return-type is <br>
not &quot;void&quot; (falling off the end of the function
body is considered returning without a value), and about a
&quot;return&quot; statement with an expression in a
function whose return- <br>
type is &quot;void&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For C++, a function without
return type always produces a diagnostic message, even when
-Wno-return-type is specified. The only exceptions are main
and functions defined in <br>
system headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement has an index of
enumerated type and lacks a &quot;case&quot; for one or more
of the named codes of that enumeration. (The presence of a
&quot;default&quot; <br>
label prevents this warning.) &quot;case&quot; labels
outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when
this option is used (even if there is a &quot;default&quot;
label). This warning <br>
is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-default <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement does not have a
&quot;default&quot; case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-enum <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement has an index of
enumerated type and lacks a &quot;case&quot; for one or more
of the named codes of that enumeration. &quot;case&quot;
labels outside the <br>
enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is
used. The only difference between -Wswitch and this option
is that this option gives a warning about an omitted <br>
enumeration code even if there is a &quot;default&quot;
label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsync-nand (C and C++ only)
<br>
Warn when &quot;__sync_fetch_and_nand&quot; and
&quot;__sync_nand_and_fetch&quot; built-in functions are
used. These functions changed semantics in GCC 4.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtrigraphs <br>
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the
meaning of the program (trigraphs within comments are not
warned about). This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-but-set-parameter <br>
Warn whenever a function parameter is assigned to, but
otherwise unused (aside from its declaration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
unused attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wunused together with -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-but-set-variable <br>
Warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise
unused (aside from its declaration). This warning is enabled
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
unused attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wunused, which is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-function <br>
Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined
or a non-inline static function is unused. This warning is
enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-label <br>
Warn whenever a label is declared but not used. This warning
is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
unused attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-local-typedefs (C,
Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a typedef locally defined in a function is not
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-parameter <br>
Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
unused attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-unused-result <br>
Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
&quot;warn_unused_result&quot; does not use its return
value. The default is -Wunused-result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-variable <br>
Warn whenever a local variable or non-constant static
variable is unused aside from its declaration. This warning
is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
unused attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-value <br>
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is
explicitly not used. To suppress this warning cast the
unused expression to void. This includes an
expression-statement or <br>
the left-hand side of a comma expression that contains no
side effects. For example, an expression such as x[i,j] will
cause a warning, while x[(void)i,j] will not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused <br>
All the above -Wunused options combined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to get a warning about
an unused function parameter, you must either specify
-Wextra -Wunused (note that -Wall implies -Wunused), or
separately specify <br>
-Wunused-parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wuninitialized <br>
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being
initialized or if a variable may be clobbered by a
&quot;setjmp&quot; call. In C++, warn if a non-static
reference or non- <br>
static const member appears in a class without
constructors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to warn about code
that uses the uninitialized value of the variable in its own
initializer, use the -Winit-self option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These warnings occur for
individual uninitialized or clobbered elements of structure,
union or array variables as well as for variables that are
uninitialized or clobbered as <br>
a whole. They do not occur for variables or elements
declared &quot;volatile&quot;. Because these warnings depend
on optimization, the exact variables or elements for which
there are <br>
warnings will depend on the precise optimization options and
version of GCC used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there may be no
warning about a variable that is used only to compute a
value that itself is never used, because such computations
may be deleted by data flow <br>
analysis before the warnings are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmaybe-uninitialized <br>
For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the
function entry to a use of the variable that is initialized,
but there exist some other paths the variable is not <br>
initialized, the compiler will emit a warning if it can not
prove the uninitialized paths do not happen at run time.
These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
<br>
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error. Here is one example of
how this can happen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
int x; <br>
switch (y) <br>
{ <br>
case 1: x = 1; <br>
break; <br>
case 2: x = 4; <br>
break; <br>
case 3: x = 5; <br>
} <br>
foo (x); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of &quot;y&quot; is
always 1, 2 or 3, then &quot;x&quot; is always initialized,
but GCC doesn&rsquo;t know this. To suppress the warning,
the user needs to provide a default case with <br>
assert(0) or similar code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also warns when a
non-volatile automatic variable might be changed by a call
to &quot;longjmp&quot;. These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler sees only the calls
to &quot;setjmp&quot;. It cannot know where
&quot;longjmp&quot; will be called; in fact, a signal
handler could call it at any point in the code. As a result,
<br>
you may get a warning even when there is in fact no problem
because &quot;longjmp&quot; cannot in fact be called at the
place that would cause a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some spurious warnings can be
avoided if you declare all the functions you use that never
return as &quot;noreturn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by -Wall
or -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunknown-pragmas <br>
Warn when a &quot;#pragma&quot; directive is encountered
that is not understood by GCC. If this command-line option
is used, warnings will even be issued for unknown pragmas in
system <br>
header files. This is not the case if the warnings were only
enabled by the -Wall command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pragmas <br>
Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect
parameters, invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.
See also -Wunknown-pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-aliasing <br>
This option is only active when -fstrict-aliasing is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing
rules that the compiler is using for optimization. The <br>
warning does not catch all cases, but does attempt to catch
the more common pitfalls. It is included in -Wall. It is
equivalent to -Wstrict-aliasing=3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-aliasing=n <br>
This option is only active when -fstrict-aliasing is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing
rules that the compiler is using for optimization. <br>
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false
positives). Higher levels also correspond to more effort,
similar to the way -O works. -Wstrict-aliasing is <br>
equivalent to -Wstrict-aliasing=n, with n=3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 1: Most aggressive, quick,
least accurate. Possibly useful when higher levels do not
warn but -fstrict-aliasing still breaks the code, as it has
very few false <br>
negatives. However, it has many false positives. Warns for
all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced. Runs in the front end <br>
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not
too precise. May still have many false positives (not as
many as level 1 though), and few false negatives (but
possibly more than level 1). <br>
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.
Warns about incomplete types. Runs in the front end
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 3 (default for
-Wstrict-aliasing): Should have very few false positives and
few false negatives. Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when
optimization is enabled. <br>
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the
front end: &quot;*(int*)&amp;some_float&quot;. If
optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where
it deals with <br>
multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to
information. Only warns when the converted pointer is
dereferenced. Does not warn about incomplete types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow <br>
-Wstrict-overflow=n <br>
This option is only active when -fstrict-overflow is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on
the assumption that signed overflow does not occur. <br>
Note that it does not warn about all cases where the code
might overflow: it only warns about cases where the compiler
implements some optimization. Thus this warning <br>
depends on the optimization level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optimization that assumes
that signed overflow does not occur is perfectly safe if the
values of the variables involved are such that overflow
never does, in fact, occur. <br>
Therefore this warning can easily give a false positive: a
warning about code that is not actually a problem. To help
focus on important issues, several warning levels are <br>
defined. No warnings are issued for the use of undefined
signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
will require, in particular when determining whether a <br>
loop will be executed at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=1 <br>
Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to
avoid. For example: &quot;x + 1 &gt; x&quot;; with
-fstrict-overflow, the compiler will simplify this to 1.
This level of <br>
-Wstrict-overflow is enabled by -Wall; higher levels are
not, and must be explicitly requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=2 <br>
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified
to a constant. For example: &quot;abs (x) &gt;= 0&quot;.
This can only be simplified when -fstrict-overflow is in
<br>
effect, because &quot;abs (INT_MIN)&quot; overflows to
&quot;INT_MIN&quot;, which is less than zero.
-Wstrict-overflow (with no level) is the same as
-Wstrict-overflow=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=3 <br>
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is
simplified. For example: &quot;x + 1 &gt; 1&quot; will be
simplified to &quot;x &gt; 0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=4 <br>
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the
above cases. For example: &quot;(x * 10) / 5&quot; will be
simplified to &quot;x * 2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=5 <br>
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the
magnitude of a constant involved in a comparison. For
example: &quot;x + 2 &gt; y&quot; will be simplified to
&quot;x + 1 &gt;= y&quot;. This <br>
is reported only at the highest warning level because this
simplification applies to many comparisons, so this warning
level will give a very large number of false <br>
positives.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-attribute=[pure|const|noreturn]
<br>
Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial.
The attributes currently supported are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-attribute=pure <br>
-Wsuggest-attribute=const <br>
-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn <br>
Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
&quot;pure&quot;, &quot;const&quot; or &quot;noreturn&quot;.
The compiler only warns for functions visible in other
compilation units or <br>
(in the case of &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;const&quot;) if
it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A
function returns normally if it doesn&rsquo;t contain an
infinite loop nor returns <br>
abnormally by throwing, calling &quot;abort()&quot; or
trapping. This analysis requires option -fipa-pure-const,
which is enabled by default at -O and higher. Higher
optimization <br>
levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Warray-bounds <br>
This option is only active when -ftree-vrp is active
(default for -O2 and above). It warns about subscripts to
arrays that are always out of bounds. This warning is
enabled <br>
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-div-by-zero <br>
Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.
Floating-point division by zero is not warned about, as it
can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and
NaNs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsystem-headers <br>
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header
files. Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed,
on the assumption that they usually do not indicate <br>
real problems and would only make the compiler output harder
to read. Using this command-line option tells GCC to emit
warnings from system headers as if they occurred in <br>
user code. However, note that using -Wall in conjunction
with this option will not warn about unknown pragmas in
system headers---for that, -Wunknown-pragmas must also be
<br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtrampolines <br>
Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A trampoline is a small piece of
data or code that is created at run <br>
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is
taken, and <br>
is used to call the nested function indirectly. For some
targets, it <br>
is made up of data only and thus requires no special
treatment. But, <br>
for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires
the stack <br>
to be made executable in order for the program to work
properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wfloat-equal <br>
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality
comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea behind this is that
sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider
floating-point values as approximations to infinitely
precise real numbers. If you <br>
are doing this, then you need to compute (by analyzing the
code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely maximum
error that the computation introduces, and allow for it <br>
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but
that&rsquo;s a different problem). In particular, instead of
testing for equality, you would check to see whether the
<br>
two values have ranges that overlap; and this is done with
the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C
only) <br>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
traditional and ISO C. Also warn about ISO C constructs that
have no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic <br>
constructs that should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Macro parameters
that appear within string literals in the macro body. In
traditional C macro replacement takes place within string
literals, but does not in ISO C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In traditional
C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. Traditional
preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the # appeared in column 1 on the <br>
line. Therefore -Wtraditional warns about directives that
traditional C understands but would ignore because the #
does not appear as the first character on the line. <br>
It also suggests you hide directives like #pragma not
understood by traditional C by indenting them. Some
traditional implementations would not recognize #elif, so it
<br>
suggests avoiding it altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A function-like
macro that appears without arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The unary plus
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The U integer
constant suffix, or the F or L floating-point constant
suffixes. (Traditional C does support the L suffix on
integer constants.) Note, these suffixes <br>
appear in macros defined in the system headers of most
modern systems, e.g. the _MIN/_MAX macros in
&quot;&lt;limits.h&gt;&quot;. Use of these macros in user
code might normally lead to <br>
spurious warnings, however GCC&rsquo;s integrated
preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A function
declared external in one block and then used after the end
of the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A
&quot;switch&quot; statement has an operand of type
&quot;long&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A
non-&quot;static&quot; function declaration follows a
&quot;static&quot; one. This construct is not accepted by
some traditional C compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The ISO type of
an integer constant has a different width or signedness from
its traditional type. This warning is only issued if the
base of the constant is ten. I.e. <br>
hexadecimal or octal values, which typically represent bit
patterns, are not warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Usage of ISO
string concatenation is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Initialization
of automatic aggregates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Identifier
conflicts with labels. Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Initialization
of unions. If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted. This is done under the assumption that the zero
initializer in user code appears <br>
conditioned on e.g. &quot;__STDC__&quot; to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to
zero in the traditional C case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Conversions by
prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa. The absence of these prototypes when compiling with
traditional C would cause serious <br>
problems. This is a subset of the possible conversion
warnings, for the full set use -Wtraditional-conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of ISO C
style function definitions. This warning intentionally is
not issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features will <br>
appear in your code when using libiberty&rsquo;s traditional
C compatibility macros, &quot;PARAMS&quot; and
&quot;VPARAMS&quot;. This warning is also bypassed for
nested functions because that <br>
feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtraditional-conversion (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is
different from what would happen to the same argument in the
absence of a prototype. This includes conversions of fixed
<br>
point to floating and vice versa, and conversions changing
the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument except
when the same as the default promotion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a
block. This construct, known from C++, was introduced with
ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC. It is not <br>
supported by ISO C90 and was not supported by GCC versions
before GCC 3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundef <br>
Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an #if
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-endif-labels <br>
Do not warn whenever an #else or an #endif are followed by
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshadow <br>
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows
another variable, parameter, type, or class member (in C++),
or whenever a built-in function is shadowed. Note that <br>
in C++, the compiler will not warn if a local variable
shadows a struct/class/enum, but will warn if it shadows an
explicit typedef.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlarger-than=len <br>
Warn whenever an object of larger than len bytes is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wframe-larger-than=len <br>
Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than len
bytes. The computation done to determine the stack frame
size is approximate and not conservative. The actual <br>
requirements may be somewhat greater than len even if you do
not get a warning. In addition, any space allocated via
&quot;alloca&quot;, variable-length arrays, or related
constructs <br>
is not included by the compiler when determining whether or
not to issue a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-free-nonheap-object <br>
Do not warn when attempting to free an object that was not
allocated on the heap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstack-usage=len <br>
Warn if the stack usage of a function might be larger than
len bytes. The computation done to determine the stack usage
is conservative. Any space allocated via &quot;alloca&quot;,
<br>
variable-length arrays, or related constructs is included by
the compiler when determining whether or not to issue a
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message is in keeping with
the output of -fstack-usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the stack
usage is fully static but exceeds the specified amount,
it&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: stack usage is 1120
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the stack
usage is (partly) dynamic but bounded, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: stack usage might be
1648 bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the stack
usage is (partly) dynamic and not bounded, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: stack usage might be
unbounded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations <br>
Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler
could not assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.
With -funsafe-loop-optimizations warn if the compiler <br>
made such assumptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW
targets only) <br>
Disables the warnings about non-ISO &quot;printf&quot; /
&quot;scanf&quot; format width specifiers &quot;I32&quot;,
&quot;I64&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; used on Windows targets
depending on the MS runtime, when you are using <br>
the options -Wformat and -pedantic without
gnu-extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpointer-arith <br>
Warn about anything that depends on the &quot;size of&quot;
a function type or of &quot;void&quot;. GNU C assigns these
types a size of 1, for convenience in calculations with
&quot;void *&quot; pointers <br>
and pointers to functions. In C++, warn also when an
arithmetic operation involves &quot;NULL&quot;. This warning
is also enabled by -pedantic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtype-limits <br>
Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to
the limited range of the data type, but do not warn for
constant expressions. For example, warn if an unsigned <br>
variable is compared against zero with &lt; or &gt;=. This
warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wbad-function-cast (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching
type. For example, warn if &quot;int malloc()&quot; is cast
to &quot;anything *&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc++-compat (C and Objective-C
only) <br>
Warn about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common
subset of ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit
conversion from &quot;void *&quot; to a pointer to
non-&quot;void&quot; type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc++11-compat (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
C++ 1998 and ISO C++ 2011, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998
that are keywords in ISO C++ 2011. This warning <br>
turns on -Wnarrowing and is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcast-qual <br>
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type
qualifier from the target type. For example, warn if a
&quot;const char *&quot; is cast to an ordinary &quot;char
*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn when making a cast
that introduces a type qualifier in an unsafe way. For
example, casting &quot;char **&quot; to &quot;const char
**&quot; is unsafe, as in this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* p is char ** value. */ <br>
const char **q = (const char **) p; <br>
/* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK. */
<br>
*q = &quot;string&quot;; <br>
/* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory. */ <br>
**p = &rsquo;b&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcast-align <br>
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required
alignment of the target is increased. For example, warn if a
&quot;char *&quot; is cast to an &quot;int *&quot; on
machines where integers <br>
can only be accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wwrite-strings <br>
When compiling C, give string constants the type &quot;const
char[length]&quot; so that copying the address of one into a
non-&quot;const&quot; &quot;char *&quot; pointer will get a
warning. These <br>
warnings will help you find at compile time code that can
try to write into a string constant, but only if you have
been very careful about using &quot;const&quot; in
declarations and <br>
prototypes. Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance. This is
why we did not make -Wall request these warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling C++, warn about
the deprecated conversion from string literals to &quot;char
*&quot;. This warning is enabled by default for C++
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wclobbered <br>
Warn for variables that might be changed by longjmp or
vfork. This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wconversion <br>
Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This
includes conversions between real and integer, like
&quot;abs (x)&quot; when &quot;x&quot; is
&quot;double&quot;; conversions between signed and <br>
unsigned, like &quot;unsigned ui = -1&quot;; and conversions
to smaller types, like &quot;sqrtf (M_PI)&quot;. Do not warn
for explicit casts like &quot;abs ((int) x)&quot; and
&quot;ui = (unsigned) -1&quot;, or if <br>
the value is not changed by the conversion like in &quot;abs
(2.0)&quot;. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers can be disabled by using <br>
-Wno-sign-conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For C++, also warn for confusing
overload resolution for user-defined conversions; and
conversions that will never use a type conversion operator:
conversions to &quot;void&quot;, the <br>
same type, a base class or a reference to them. Warnings
about conversions between signed and unsigned integers are
disabled by default in C++ unless -Wsign-conversion is <br>
explicitly enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-conversion-null (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Do not warn for conversions between &quot;NULL&quot; and
non-pointer types. -Wconversion-null is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant
(C++ and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a literal &rsquo;0&rsquo; is used as null pointer
constant. This can be useful to facilitate the conversion to
&quot;nullptr&quot; in C++11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wempty-body <br>
Warn if an empty body occurs in an if, else or do while
statement. This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wenum-compare <br>
Warn about a comparison between values of different
enumerated types. In C++ enumeral mismatches in conditional
expressions are also diagnosed and the warning is enabled by
<br>
default. In C this warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wjump-misses-init (C,
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a &quot;goto&quot; statement or a &quot;switch&quot;
statement jumps forward across the initialization of a
variable, or jumps backward to a label after the variable
has been <br>
initialized. This only warns about variables that are
initialized when they are declared. This warning is only
supported for C and Objective-C; in C++ this sort of branch
<br>
is an error in any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wjump-misses-init is included
in -Wc++-compat. It can be disabled with the
-Wno-jump-misses-init option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsign-compare <br>
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values
could produce an incorrect result when the signed value is
converted to unsigned. This warning is also enabled by <br>
-Wextra; to get the other warnings of -Wextra without this
warning, use -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsign-conversion <br>
Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an
integer value, like assigning a signed integer expression to
an unsigned integer variable. An explicit cast <br>
silences the warning. In C, this option is enabled also by
-Wconversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waddress <br>
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These
include using the address of a function in a conditional
expression, such as &quot;void func(void); if (func)&quot;,
and <br>
comparisons against the memory address of a string literal,
such as &quot;if (x == &quot;abc&quot;)&quot;. Such uses
typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a
function always <br>
evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a
function call; and comparisons against string literals <br>
result in unspecified behavior and are not portable in C, so
they usually indicate that the programmer intended to use
&quot;strcmp&quot;. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlogical-op <br>
Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in
expressions. This includes using logical operators in
contexts where a bit-wise operator is likely to be
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waggregate-return <br>
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are
defined or called. (In languages where you can return an
array, this also elicits a warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-attributes <br>
Do not warn if an unexpected &quot;__attribute__&quot; is
used, such as unrecognized attributes, function attributes
applied to variables, etc. This will not stop errors for
incorrect <br>
use of supported attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined
<br>
Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined. This
suppresses warnings for redefinition of
&quot;__TIMESTAMP__&quot;, &quot;__TIME__&quot;,
&quot;__DATE__&quot;, &quot;__FILE__&quot;, and
&quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-prototypes (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying
the argument types. (An old-style function definition is
permitted without a warning if preceded by a <br>
declaration that specifies the argument types.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-style-declaration (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in
a declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers
like &quot;static&quot; are not the first things in a <br>
declaration. This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-style-definition (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an old-style function definition is used. A warning
is given even if there is a previous prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in
K&amp;R-style functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void foo(bar) { }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-prototypes (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
prototype declaration. This warning is issued even if the
definition itself provides a prototype. The aim is to <br>
detect global functions that are not declared in header
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-declarations <br>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
declaration. Do so even if the definition itself provides a
prototype. Use this option to detect global functions <br>
that are not declared in header files. In C++, no warnings
are issued for function templates, or for inline functions,
or for functions in anonymous namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-field-initializers
<br>
Warn if a structure&rsquo;s initializer has some fields
missing. For example, the following code would cause such a
warning, because &quot;x.h&quot; is implicitly zero:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct s { int f, g, h; }; <br>
struct s x = { 3, 4 };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not warn about
designated initializers, so the following modification would
not trigger a warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct s { int f, g, h; }; <br>
struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is included in
-Wextra. To get other -Wextra warnings without this one, use
-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-format-attribute <br>
Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for
&quot;format&quot; attributes. Note these are only possible
candidates, not absolute ones. GCC will guess that function
<br>
pointers with &quot;format&quot; attributes that are used in
assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding &quot;format&quot;
attribute in the <br>
resulting type. I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the
return type of the containing function respectively <br>
should also have a &quot;format&quot; attribute to avoid the
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC will also warn about
function definitions that might be candidates for
&quot;format&quot; attributes. Again, these are only
possible candidates. GCC will guess that &quot;format&quot;
<br>
attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls
a function like &quot;vprintf&quot; or &quot;vscanf&quot;,
but this might not always be the case, and some functions
for which <br>
&quot;format&quot; attributes are appropriate may not be
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-multichar <br>
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant
(&rsquo;FOOF&rsquo;) is used. Usually they indicate a typo
in the user&rsquo;s code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be <br>
used in portable code.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnormalized=&lt;none|id|nfc|nfkc&gt;
<br>
In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they
are different sequences of characters. However, sometimes
when characters outside the basic ASCII character set <br>
are used, you can have two different character sequences
that look the same. To avoid confusion, the ISO 10646
standard sets out some normalization rules which when
applied <br>
ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence. GCC can warn you if you are using
identifiers that have not been normalized; this option <br>
controls that warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four levels of warning
supported by GCC. The default is -Wnormalized=nfc, which
warns about any identifier that is not in the ISO 10646
&quot;C&quot; normalized form, NFC. <br>
NFC is the recommended form for most uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, there are some
characters allowed in identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that,
when turned into NFC, are not allowed in identifiers. That
is, there&rsquo;s no way to <br>
use these symbols in portable ISO C or C++ and have all your
identifiers in NFC. -Wnormalized=id suppresses the warning
for these characters. It is hoped that future <br>
versions of the standards involved will correct this, which
is why this option is not the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can switch the warning off
for all characters by writing -Wnormalized=none. You would
only want to do this if you were using some other
normalization scheme (like &quot;D&quot;), <br>
because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some characters in ISO 10646
have distinct meanings but look identical in some fonts or
display methodologies, especially once formatting has been
applied. For instance <br>
&quot;207F&quot;, &quot;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL LETTER
N&quot;, will display just like a regular &quot;n&quot; that
has been placed in a superscript. ISO 10646 defines the NFKC
normalization scheme to <br>
convert all these into a standard form as well, and GCC will
warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use
-Wnormalized=nfkc. This warning is comparable to warning
about every <br>
identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but
may be useful as a local coding convention if the <br>
programming environment is unable to be fixed to display
these characters distinctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-deprecated <br>
Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-deprecated-declarations
<br>
Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types
marked as deprecated by using the &quot;deprecated&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-overflow <br>
Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverride-init (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an initialized field without side effects is
overridden when using designated initializers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is included in
-Wextra. To get other -Wextra warnings without this one, use
-Wextra -Wno-override-init.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpacked <br>
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the
packed attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the
structure. Such structures may be mis-aligned for <br>
little benefit. For instance, in this code, the variable
&quot;f.x&quot; in &quot;struct bar&quot; will be misaligned
even though &quot;struct bar&quot; does not itself have the
packed attribute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct foo { <br>
int x; <br>
char a, b, c, d; <br>
} __attribute__((packed)); <br>
struct bar { <br>
char z; <br>
struct foo f; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpacked-bitfield-compat <br>
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the
&quot;packed&quot; attribute on bit-fields of type
&quot;char&quot;. This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but the
change can lead to differences in the <br>
structure layout. GCC informs you when the offset of such a
field has changed in GCC 4.4. For example there is no longer
a 4-bit padding between field &quot;a&quot; and
&quot;b&quot; in this <br>
structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct foo <br>
{ <br>
char a:4; <br>
char b:8; <br>
} __attribute__ ((packed));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default. Use -Wno-packed-bitfield-compat to disable this
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpadded <br>
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align
an element of the structure or to align the whole structure.
Sometimes when this happens it is possible to <br>
rearrange the fields of the structure to reduce the padding
and so make the structure smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wredundant-decls <br>
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same
scope, even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and
changes nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnested-externs (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an &quot;extern&quot; declaration is encountered
within a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winline <br>
Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as
inline. Even with this option, the compiler will not warn
about failures to inline functions declared in system <br>
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler uses a variety of
heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function.
For example, the compiler takes into account the size of the
function being <br>
inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been
done in the current function. Therefore, seemingly
insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
<br>
warnings produced by -Winline to appear or disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Suppress warnings from applying the offsetof macro to a
non-POD type. According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard,
applying offsetof to a non-POD type is undefined. In
existing <br>
C++ implementations, however, offsetof typically gives
meaningful results even when applied to certain kinds of
non-POD types. (Such as a simple struct that fails to be a
POD <br>
type only by virtue of having a constructor.) This flag is
for users who are aware that they are writing nonportable
code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the <br>
warning about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restrictions on offsetof may
be relaxed in a future version of the C++ standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast <br>
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer
of a different size. In C++, casting to a pointer type of
smaller size is an error. Wint-to-pointer-cast is enabled
<br>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer
type of a different size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winvalid-pch <br>
Warn if a precompiled header is found in the search path but
can&rsquo;t be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlong-long <br>
Warn if long long type is used. This is enabled by either
-pedantic or -Wtraditional in ISO C90 and C++98 modes. To
inhibit the warning messages, use -Wno-long-long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvariadic-macros <br>
Warn if variadic macros are used in pedantic ISO C90 mode,
or the GNU alternate syntax when in pedantic ISO C99 mode.
This is default. To inhibit the warning messages, use <br>
-Wno-variadic-macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvector-operation-performance
<br>
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD
capabilities of the architecture. Mainly useful for the
performance tuning. Vector operation can be implemented <br>
&quot;piecewise&quot;, which means that the scalar operation
is performed on every vector element; &quot;in
parallel&quot;, which means that the vector operation is
implemented using scalars of <br>
wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and &quot;as a single scalar&quot;, which means that vector
fits into a scalar type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvla <br>
Warn if variable length array is used in the code. -Wno-vla
will prevent the -pedantic warning of the variable length
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvolatile-register-var <br>
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile. The
volatile modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that
may eliminate reads and/or writes to register variables.
<br>
This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdisabled-optimization <br>
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled. This
warning does not generally indicate that there is anything
wrong with your code; it merely indicates that GCC&rsquo;s
<br>
optimizers were unable to handle the code effectively.
Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs when the <br>
optimization itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpointer-sign (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with
different signedness. This option is only supported for C
and Objective-C. It is implied by -Wall and by -pedantic,
<br>
which can be disabled with -Wno-pointer-sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstack-protector <br>
This option is only active when -fstack-protector is active.
It warns about functions that will not be protected against
stack smashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-mudflap <br>
Suppress warnings about constructs that cannot be
instrumented by -fmudflap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverlength-strings <br>
Warn about string constants that are longer than the
&quot;minimum maximum&quot; length specified in the C
standard. Modern compilers generally allow string constants
that are much <br>
longer than the standard&rsquo;s minimum limit, but very
portable programs should avoid using longer strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The limit applies after string
constant concatenation, and does not count the trailing NUL.
In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in C99, it was raised
to 4095. C++98 does <br>
not specify a normative minimum maximum, so we do not
diagnose overlength strings in C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is implied by
-pedantic, and can be disabled with
-Wno-overlength-strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
GCC will issue a warning for any floating constant that does
not have a suffix. When used together with -Wsystem-headers
it will warn about such constants in system header <br>
files. This can be useful when preparing code to use with
the &quot;FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64&quot; pragma from the
decimal floating-point extension to C99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Debugging Your
Program or GCC <br>
GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Produce debugging information
in the operating system&rsquo;s native format (stabs, COFF,
XCOFF, or DWARF 2). GDB can work with this debugging
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most systems that use stabs
format, -g enables use of extra debugging information that
only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging
work better in GDB but will <br>
probably make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the
program. If you want to control for certain whether to
generate the extra information, use -gstabs+, -gstabs, <br>
-gxcoff+, -gxcoff, or -gvms (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC allows you to use -g with
-O. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may
not exist at all; flow <br>
of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute
constant results or their values were already at hand; some
<br>
statements may execute in different places because they were
moved out of loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nevertheless it proves possible
to debug optimized output. This makes it reasonable to use
the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are useful
when GCC is generated with the capability for more than one
debugging format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ggdb <br>
Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This means to
use the most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or
the native format if neither of those are <br>
supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstabs <br>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
supported), without GDB extensions. This is the format used
by DBX on most BSD systems. On MIPS, Alpha and System <br>
V Release 4 systems this option produces stabs debugging
output that is not understood by DBX or SDB. On System V
Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU
assembler.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols
<br>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
supported), for only symbols that are actually used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-class-debug-always <br>
Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in
only one object file, emit it in all object files using the
class. This option should be used only with <br>
debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC normally
emits debugging information for classes because using this
option will increase the size of debugging information by
<br>
as much as a factor of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-debug-types-section <br>
By default when using DWARF v4 or higher type DIEs will be
put into their own .debug_types section instead of making
them part of the .debug_info section. It is more <br>
efficient to put them in a separate comdat sections since
the linker will then be able to remove duplicates. But not
all DWARF consumers support .debug_types sections yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstabs+ <br>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is likely <br>
to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gcoff <br>
Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
supported). This is the format used by SDB on most System V
systems prior to System V Release 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gxcoff <br>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
supported). This is the format used by the DBX debugger on
IBM RS/6000 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gxcoff+ <br>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is likely <br>
to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program,
and may cause assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS)
to fail with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gdwarf-version <br>
Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
supported). This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6. The
value of version may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default <br>
version is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that with DWARF version 2
some ports require, and will always use, some
non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 4 may require GDB 7.0
and -fvar-tracking-assignments for maximum benefit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grecord-gcc-switches <br>
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke
the compiler that may affect code generation to be appended
to the DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging <br>
information. The options are concatenated with spaces
separating them from each other and from the compiler
version. See also -frecord-gcc-switches for another way of
<br>
storing compiler options into the object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gno-record-gcc-switches <br>
Disallow appending command-line options to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstrict-dwarf <br>
Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version
than selected with -gdwarf-version. On most targets using
non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard <br>
versions is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gno-strict-dwarf <br>
Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
selected with -gdwarf-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gvms <br>
Produce debugging information in VMS debug format (if that
is supported). This is the format used by DEBUG on VMS
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glevel <br>
-ggdblevel <br>
-gstabslevel <br>
-gcofflevel <br>
-gxcofflevel <br>
-gvmslevel <br>
Request debugging information and also use level to specify
how much information. The default level is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 0 produces no debug
information at all. Thus, -g0 negates -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 1 produces minimal
information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the
program that you don&rsquo;t plan to debug. This includes
descriptions of functions and external <br>
variables, but no information about local variables and no
line numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 3 includes extra
information, such as all the macro definitions present in
the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you
use -g3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gdwarf-2 does not accept a
concatenated debug level, because GCC used to support an
option -gdwarf that meant to generate debug information in
version 1 of the DWARF format <br>
(which is very different from version 2), and it would have
been too confusing. That debug format is long obsolete, but
the option cannot be changed now. Instead use an <br>
additional -glevel option to change the debug level for
DWARF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gtoggle <br>
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this
option would have generated it, or turn it on at level 2
otherwise. The position of this argument in the command line
<br>
does not matter, it takes effect after all other options are
processed, and it does so only once, no matter how many
times it is given. This is mainly intended to be used <br>
with -fcompare-debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-final-insns[=file] <br>
Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to file. If the
optional argument is omitted (or if file is &quot;.&quot;),
the name of the dump file will be determined by appending
<br>
&quot;.gkd&quot; to the compilation output file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-debug[=opts] <br>
If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a
second time, adding opts and -fcompare-debug-second to the
arguments passed to the second compilation. Dump the <br>
final internal representation in both compilations, and
print an error if they differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the equal sign is omitted,
the default -gtoggle is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG, if defined, non-empty and nonzero,
implicitly enables -fcompare-debug. If GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG is
defined to a string starting with <br>
a dash, then it is used for opts, otherwise the default
-gtoggle is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-debug=, with the equal
sign but without opts, is equivalent to -fno-compare-debug,
which disables the dumping of the final representation and
the second <br>
compilation, preventing even GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG from taking
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To verify full coverage during
-fcompare-debug testing, set GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG to say
-fcompare-debug-not-overridden, which GCC will reject as an
invalid option in any actual <br>
compilation (rather than preprocessing, assembly or
linking). To get just a warning, setting GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG
to -w%n-fcompare-debug not overridden will do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-debug-second <br>
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the
second compilation requested by -fcompare-debug, along with
options to silence warnings, and omitting other options <br>
that would cause side-effect compiler outputs to files or to
the standard output. Dump files and preserved temporary
files are renamed so as to contain the &quot;.gk&quot;
additional <br>
extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is passed to
the compiler driver, it causes the first compilation to be
skipped, which makes it useful for little other than
debugging the compiler proper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-feliminate-dwarf2-dups <br>
Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating
duplicated information about each symbol. This option only
makes sense when generating DWARF2 debugging information
with <br>
-gdwarf-2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly
<br>
Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the
base name of the compilation source file matches the base
name of file in which the struct was defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option substantially
reduces the size of debugging information, but at
significant potential loss in type information to the
debugger. See -femit-struct-debug-reduced <br>
for a less aggressive option. See
-femit-struct-debug-detailed for more detailed control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option works only with
DWARF 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-struct-debug-reduced <br>
Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the
base name of the compilation source file matches the base
name of file in which the type was defined, unless the <br>
struct is a template or defined in a system header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option significantly
reduces the size of debugging information, with some
potential loss in type information to the debugger. See
-femit-struct-debug-baseonly for a <br>
more aggressive option. See -femit-struct-debug-detailed for
more detailed control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option works only with
DWARF 2.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=spec-list]
<br>
Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler will
generate debug information. The intent is to reduce
duplicate struct debug information between different object
<br>
files within the same program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is a detailed
version of -femit-struct-debug-reduced and
-femit-struct-debug-baseonly, which will serve for most
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A specification has the
syntax[dir:|ind:][ord:|gen:](any|sys|base|none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional first word limits
the specification to structs that are used directly (dir:)
or used indirectly (ind:). A struct type is used directly
when it is the type of a <br>
variable, member. Indirect uses arise through pointers to
structs. That is, when use of an incomplete struct would be
legal, the use is indirect. An example is struct one <br>
direct; struct two * indirect;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional second word limits
the specification to ordinary structs (ord:) or generic
structs (gen:). Generic structs are a bit complicated to
explain. For C++, these are <br>
non-explicit specializations of template classes, or
non-template classes within the above. Other programming
languages have generics, but -femit-struct-debug-detailed
does <br>
not yet implement them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third word specifies the
source files for those structs for which the compiler will
emit debug information. The values none and any have the
normal meaning. The value <br>
base means that the base of name of the file in which the
type declaration appears must match the base of the name of
the main compilation file. In practice, this means that <br>
types declared in foo.c and foo.h will have debug
information, but types declared in other header will not.
The value sys means those types satisfying base or declared
in <br>
system or compiler headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to experiment to
determine the best settings for your application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option works only with
DWARF 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-merge-debug-strings <br>
Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the
debugging information that are identical in different object
files. Merging is not supported by all assemblers or <br>
linkers. Merging decreases the size of the debug information
in the output file at the cost of increasing link processing
time. Merging is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdebug-prefix-map=old=new <br>
When compiling files in directory old, record debugging
information describing them as in new instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm <br>
Emit DWARF 2 unwind info as compiler generated
&quot;.eh_frame&quot; section instead of using GAS
&quot;.cfi_*&quot; directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Generate extra code to write
profile information suitable for the analysis program prof.
You must use this option when compiling the source files you
want data about, and <br>
you must also use it when linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pg Generate extra code to write
profile information suitable for the analysis program gprof.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Makes the compiler print out
each function name as it is compiled, and print some
statistics about each pass when it finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftime-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time
consumed by each pass when it finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmem-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
memory allocation when it finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpre-ipa-mem-report <br>
-fpost-ipa-mem-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
memory allocation before or after interprocedural
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-usage <br>
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the
program, on a per-function basis. The filename for the dump
is made by appending .su to the auxname. auxname is <br>
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. An entry is made up of <br>
three fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The name of the
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A number of
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; One or more
qualifiers: &quot;static&quot;, &quot;dynamic&quot;,
&quot;bounded&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qualifier &quot;static&quot;
means that the function manipulates the stack statically: a
fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on
function entry and released on <br>
function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made in
the function. The second field is this fixed number of
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qualifier
&quot;dynamic&quot; means that the function manipulates the
stack dynamically: in addition to the static allocation
described above, stack adjustments are made in the <br>
body of the function, for example to push/pop arguments
around function calls. If the qualifier &quot;bounded&quot;
is also present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded
at <br>
compile time and the second field is an upper bound of the
total amount of stack used by the function. If it is not
present, the amount of these adjustments is not bounded <br>
at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-arcs <br>
Add code so that program flow arcs are instrumented. During
execution the program records how many times each branch and
call is executed and how many times it is taken or <br>
returns. When the compiled program exits it saves this data
to a file called auxname.gcda for each source file. The data
may be used for profile-directed optimizations <br>
(-fbranch-probabilities), or for test coverage analysis
(-ftest-coverage). Each object file&rsquo;s auxname is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
specified <br>
and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix is
removed (e.g. foo.gcda for input file dir/foo.c, or <br>
dir/foo.gcda for output file specified as -o dir/foo.o).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--coverage <br>
This option is used to compile and link code instrumented
for coverage analysis. The option is a synonym for
-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage (when compiling) and -lgcov
(when <br>
linking). See the documentation for those options for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Compile the
source files with -fprofile-arcs plus optimization and code
generation options. For test coverage analysis, use the
additional -ftest-coverage option. You <br>
do not need to profile every source file in a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Link your object
files with -lgcov or -fprofile-arcs (the latter implies the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fprofile-arcs, for each
function of your program GCC creates a program flow graph,
then finds a spanning tree for the graph. Only arcs that are

an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the

Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug
counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdbg-cnt=counter-value-list
<br>
Set the internal debug counter upper bound.
counter-value-list is a comma-separated list of name:value
pairs which sets the upper bound of each debug counter name
to value. <br>
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of UINT_MAX,
thus dbg_cnt() returns true always unless the upper bound is
set by this option. e.g. With <br>
-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0 dbg_cnt(dce) will return true
only for first 10 invocations</p>

the pass name should be appended with a sequential <br>
number starting from 1. range-list is a comma seperated list
of function ranges or assembler names. Each range is a
number pair seperated by a colon. The range is <br>
inclusive in both ends. If the range is trivial, the number
pair can be simplified as a single number. If the
function&rsquo;s cgraph node&rsquo;s uid is falling within
one of the <br>
specified ranges, the pass is disabled for that function.
The uid is shown in the function header of a dump file, and
the pass names can be dumped by using option <br>
-fdump-passes.</p>

-fdump-rtl-pass <br>
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times
specified by letters. This is used for debugging the
RTL-based passes of the compiler. The file names for most of
<br>
the dumps are made by appending a pass number and a word to
the dumpname, and the files are created in the directory of
the output file. Note that the pass number is <br>
computed statically as passes get registered into the pass
manager. Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic
order of execution of passes. In particular, a pass <br>
installed by a plugin could have a number over 200 even if
it executed quite early. dumpname is generated from the name
of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is <br>
not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the
source file. These switches may have different effects when
-E is used for preprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug dumps can be enabled with

-fdump-translation-unit-options (C++ only) <br>
Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire
translation unit to a file. The file name is made by
appending .tu to the source file name, and the file is <br>
created in the same directory as the output file. If the

Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate
file. The file name is generated by appending a suffix
ending in .statistics to the source file name, and the <br>
file is created in the same directory as the output file. If
the -option form is used, -stats will cause counters to be
summed over the whole compilation unit while -details <br>
will dump every event as the passes generate them. The
default with no option is to sum counters for each function
compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-tree-switch <br>
-fdump-tree-switch-options <br>
Control the dumping at various stages of processing the
intermediate language tree to a file. The file name is
generated by appending a switch specific suffix to the
source <br>
file name, and the file is created in the same directory as
the output file. If the -options form is used, options is a
list of - separated options which control the details <br>
of the dump. Not all options are applicable to all dumps;
those that are not meaningful will be ignored. The following
options are available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
Print the address of each node. Usually this is not
meaningful as it changes according to the environment and

<br>
with a debug environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asmname <br>
If &quot;DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME&quot; has been set for a given
decl, use that in the dump instead of &quot;DECL_NAME&quot;.
Its primary use is ease of use working backward from mangled
names <br>
in the assembly file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim <br>
Inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a function
merely because that scope has been reached. Only dump such
items when they are directly reachable by some <br>
other path. When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option
inhibits dumping the bodies of control structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=n <br>
This option controls the amount of debugging output the
vectorizer prints. This information is written to standard
error, unless -fdump-tree-all or -fdump-tree-vect is <br>
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, .vect. For n=0 no diagnostic information is
reported. If n=1 the vectorizer reports each loop that got
<br>
vectorized, and the total number of loops that got
vectorized. If n=2 the vectorizer also reports
non-vectorized loops that passed the first analysis phase
<br>
(vect_analyze_loop_form) - i.e. countable, inner-most,
single-bb, single-entry/exit loops. This is the same
verbosity level that -fdump-tree-vect-stats uses. Higher
<br>
verbosity levels mean either more information dumped for
each reported loop, or same amount of information reported
for more loops: if n=3, vectorizer cost model information
<br>
is reported. If n=4, alignment related information is added
to the reports. If n=5, data-references related information
(e.g. memory dependences, memory access-patterns) is <br>
added to the reports. If n=6, the vectorizer reports also
non-vectorized inner-most loops that did not pass the first
analysis phase (i.e., may not be countable, or may have <br>
complicated control-flow). If n=7, the vectorizer reports
also non-vectorized nested loops. If n=8, SLP related
information is added to the reports. For n=9, all the <br>
information the vectorizer generates during its analysis and
transformation is reported. This is the same verbosity level
that -fdump-tree-vect-details uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frandom-seed=string <br>
This option provides a seed that GCC uses when it would
otherwise use random numbers. It is used to generate certain
symbol names that have to be different in every compiled
<br>
file. It is also used to place unique stamps in coverage
data files and the object files that produce them. You can
use the -frandom-seed option to produce reproducibly <br>
identical object files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string should be different
for every file you compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-verbose=n <br>
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option
controls the amount of debugging output the scheduler
prints. This information is written to standard error,
unless <br>
-fdump-rtl-sched1 or -fdump-rtl-sched2 is specified, in
which case it is output to the usual dump listing file,
.sched1 or .sched2 respectively. However for n greater than
<br>
nine, the output is always printed to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For n greater than zero,
-fsched-verbose outputs the same information as
-fdump-rtl-sched1 and -fdump-rtl-sched2. For n greater than
one, it also output basic block <br>
probabilities, detailed ready list information and unit/insn
info. For n greater than two, it includes RTL at abort
point, control-flow and regions info. And for n over <br>
four, -fsched-verbose also includes dependence info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-save-temps <br>
-save-temps=cwd <br>
Store the usual &quot;temporary&quot; intermediate files
permanently; place them in the current directory and name
them based on the source file. Thus, compiling foo.c with -c
<br>
-save-temps would produce files foo.i and foo.s, as well as
foo.o. This creates a preprocessed foo.i output file even
though the compiler now normally uses an integrated <br>
preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in combination with
the -x command-line option, -save-temps is sensible enough
to avoid over writing an input source file with the same
extension as an intermediate <br>
file. The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by
renaming the source file before using -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you invoke GCC in parallel,
compiling several different source files that share a common
base name in different subdirectories or the same source
file compiled for <br>
multiple output destinations, it is likely that the
different parallel compilers will interfere with each other,
and overwrite the temporary files. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o
indir1/foo.c&amp; <br>
gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may result in foo.i and foo.o
being written to simultaneously by both compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-save-temps=obj <br>
Store the usual &quot;temporary&quot; intermediate files
permanently. If the -o option is used, the temporary files
are based on the object file. If the -o option is not used,
the <br>
-save-temps=obj switch behaves like -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
<br>
gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o <br>
gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would create foo.i, foo.s,
dir/xbar.i, dir/xbar.s, dir2/yfoobar.i, dir2/yfoobar.s, and
dir2/yfoobar.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time[=file] <br>
Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the
compilation sequence. For C source files, this is the
compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is
done).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the specification of an
output file, the output looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cc1 0.12 0.01 <br>
# as 0.00 0.01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first number on each line is
the &quot;user time&quot;, that is time spent executing the
program itself. The second number is &quot;system
time&quot;, time spent executing operating system <br>
routines on behalf of the program. Both numbers are in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the specification of an
output file, the output is appended to the named file, and
it looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt;
<br>
0.00 0.01 as &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;user time&quot; and
the &quot;system time&quot; are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed,
so that one can later tell what file was being <br>
compiled, and with which options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvar-tracking <br>
Run variable tracking pass. It computes where variables are
stored at each position in code. Better debugging
information is then generated (if the debugging information
<br>
format supports this information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is enabled by default when
compiling with optimization (-Os, -O, -O2, ...), debugging
information (-g) and the debug info format supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvar-tracking-assignments <br>
Annotate assignments to user variables early in the
compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over
throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an
attempt to <br>
improve debug information while optimizing. Use of -gdwarf-4
is recommended along with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be enabled even if
var-tracking is disabled, in which case annotations will be
created and maintained, but discarded at the end.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
<br>
Toggle -fvar-tracking-assignments, in the same way that
-gtoggle toggles -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-file-name=library <br>
Print the full absolute name of the library file library
that would be used when linking---and don&rsquo;t do
anything else. With this option, GCC does not compile or
link <br>
anything; it just prints the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multi-directory <br>
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib
selected by any other switches present in the command line.
This directory is supposed to exist in GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multi-lib <br>
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler
switches that enable them. The directory name is separated
from the switches by ;, and each switch starts with an <br>
@ instead of the -, without spaces between multiple
switches. This is supposed to ease shell-processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multi-os-directory <br>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib,
relative to some lib subdirectory. If OS libraries are
present in the lib subdirectory and no multilibs are used,
<br>
this is usually just ., if OS libraries are present in
libsuffix sibling directories this prints e.g. ../lib64,
../lib or ../lib32, or if OS libraries are present in <br>
lib/subdir subdirectories it prints e.g. amd64, sparcv9 or
ev6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multiarch <br>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch,
relative to some lib subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-prog-name=program <br>
Like -print-file-name, but searches for a program such as
cpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-libgcc-file-name <br>
Same as -print-file-name=libgcc.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when you use
-nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs but you do want to link with
libgcc.a. You can do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;...
&lsquo;gcc -print-libgcc-file-name&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-search-dirs <br>
Print the name of the configured installation directory and
a list of program and library directories gcc will
search---and don&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when gcc prints
the error message installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No
such file or directory. To resolve this you either need to
put cpp0 and the other <br>
compiler components where gcc expects to find them, or you
can set the environment variable GCC_EXEC_PREFIX to the
directory where you installed them. Don&rsquo;t forget the
<br>
trailing /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-sysroot <br>
Print the target sysroot directory that will be used during
compilation. This is the target sysroot specified either at
configure time or using the --sysroot option, <br>
possibly with an extra suffix that depends on compilation
options. If no target sysroot is specified, the option
prints nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-sysroot-headers-suffix
<br>
Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching
for headers, or give an error if the compiler is not
configured with such a suffix---and don&rsquo;t do anything
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpmachine <br>
Print the compiler&rsquo;s target machine (for example,
i686-pc-linux-gnu)---and don&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpversion <br>
Print the compiler version (for example, 3.0)---and
don&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpspecs <br>
Print the compiler&rsquo;s built-in specs---and don&rsquo;t
do anything else. (This is used when GCC itself is being
built.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-feliminate-unused-debug-types
<br>
Normally, when producing DWARF2 output, GCC will emit
debugging information for all types declared in a
compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are
actually used <br>
in that compilation unit. Sometimes this is useful, such as
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that
is not actually used in your program (but is <br>
declared). More often, however, this results in a
significant amount of wasted space. With this option, GCC
will avoid producing debug symbol output for types that are
<br>
nowhere used in the source file being compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options That Control
Optimization <br>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without any optimization option,
the compiler&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the cost of
compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results. Statements are independent: if you <br>
stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you
can then assign a new value to any variable or change the
program counter to any other statement in the function and
<br>
get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turning on optimization flags
makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or
code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly
the ability to debug the <br>
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler performs
optimization based on the knowledge it has of the program.
Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file
mode allows the compiler to use <br>
information gained from all of the files when compiling each
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all optimizations are
controlled directly by a flag. Only optimizations that have
a flag are listed in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most optimizations are only
enabled if an -O level is set on the command line. Otherwise
they are disabled, even if individual optimization flags are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the target and how
GCC was configured, a slightly different set of
optimizations may be enabled at each -O level than those
listed here. You can invoke GCC with -Q <br>
--help=optimizers to find out the exact set of optimizations
that are enabled at each level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O <br>
-O1 Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more
time, and a lot more memory for a large function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -O, the compiler tries to
reduce code size and execution time, without performing any
optimizations that take a great deal of compilation
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O turns on the following
optimization flags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fauto-inc-dec -fcompare-elim
-fcprop-registers -fdce -fdefer-pop -fdelayed-branch -fdse
-fguess-branch-probability -fif-conversion2 -fif-conversion
-fipa-pure-const <br>
-fipa-profile -fipa-reference -fmerge-constants
-fsplit-wide-types -ftree-bit-ccp -ftree-builtin-call-dce
-ftree-ccp -ftree-ch -ftree-copyrename -ftree-dce <br>
-ftree-dominator-opts -ftree-dse -ftree-forwprop -ftree-fre
-ftree-phiprop -ftree-sra -ftree-pta -ftree-ter
-funit-at-a-time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O also turns on
-fomit-frame-pointer on machines where doing so does not
interfere with debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O2 Optimize even more. GCC
performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not
involve a space-speed tradeoff. As compared to -O, this
option increases both compilation <br>
time and the performance of the generated code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O2 turns on all optimization
flags specified by -O. It also turns on the following
optimization flags: -fthread-jumps -falign-functions
-falign-jumps -falign-loops <br>
-falign-labels -fcaller-saves -fcrossjumping
-fcse-follow-jumps -fcse-skip-blocks
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks -fdevirtualize
-fexpensive-optimizations -fgcse -fgcse-lm <br>
-finline-small-functions -findirect-inlining -fipa-sra
-foptimize-sibling-calls -fpartial-inlining -fpeephole2
-fregmove -freorder-blocks -freorder-functions <br>
-frerun-cse-after-loop -fsched-interblock -fsched-spec
-fschedule-insns -fschedule-insns2 -fstrict-aliasing
-fstrict-overflow -ftree-switch-conversion -ftree-tail-merge
<br>
-ftree-pre -ftree-vrp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note the warning under
-fgcse about invoking -O2 on programs that use computed
gotos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: In Ubuntu 8.10 and later
versions, -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 is set by default, and is
activated when -O is set to 2 or higher. This enables
additional compile-time and run- <br>
time checks for several libc functions. To disable, specify
either -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE or -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O3 Optimize yet more. -O3 turns
on all optimizations specified by -O2 and also turns on the
-finline-functions, -funswitch-loops,
-fpredictive-commoning, -fgcse-after-reload, <br>
-ftree-vectorize, -ftree-partial-pre and -fipa-cp-clone
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O0 Reduce compilation time and
make debugging produce the expected results. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Os Optimize for size. -Os
enables all -O2 optimizations that do not typically increase
code size. It also performs further optimizations designed
to reduce code size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Os disables the following
optimization flags: -falign-functions -falign-jumps
-falign-loops -falign-labels -freorder-blocks
-freorder-blocks-and-partition <br>
-fprefetch-loop-arrays -ftree-vect-loop-version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ofast <br>
Disregard strict standards compliance. -Ofast enables all
-O3 optimizations. It also enables optimizations that are
not valid for all standard compliant programs. It turns <br>
on -ffast-math and the Fortran-specific -fno-protect-parens
and -fstack-arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use multiple -O options,
with or without level numbers, the last such option is the
one that is effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options of the form -fflag
specify machine-independent flags. Most flags have both
positive and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo
would be -fno-foo. In the table <br>
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one you
typically will use. You can figure out the other form by
either removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options control
specific optimizations. They are either activated by -O
options or are related to ones that are. You can use the
following flags in the rare cases <br>
when &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of optimizations to be
performed is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-default-inline <br>
Do not make member functions inline by default merely
because they are defined inside the class scope (C++ only).
Otherwise, when you specify -O, member functions defined
<br>
inside class scope are compiled inline by default; i.e., you
don&rsquo;t need to add inline in front of the member
function name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-defer-pop <br>
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as
that function returns. For machines that must pop arguments
after a function call, the compiler normally lets <br>
arguments accumulate on the stack for several function calls
and pops them all at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fforward-propagate <br>
Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL. The pass tries to
combine two instructions and checks if the result can be
simplified. If loop unrolling is active, two passes <br>
are performed and the second is scheduled after loop
unrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default at optimization levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffp-contract=style <br>
-ffp-contract=off disables floating-point expression
contraction. -ffp-contract=fast enables floating-point
expression contraction such as forming of fused multiply-add
<br>
operations if the target has native support for them.
-ffp-contract=on enables floating-point expression
contraction if allowed by the language standard. This is
currently <br>
not implemented and treated equal to -ffp-contract=off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ffp-contract=fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fomit-frame-pointer <br>
Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for
functions that don&rsquo;t need one. This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers; it
also makes an extra <br>
register available in many functions. It also makes
debugging impossible on some machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some machines, such as the
VAX, this flag has no effect, because the standard calling
sequence automatically handles the frame pointer and nothing
is saved by pretending <br>
it doesn&rsquo;t exist. The machine-description macro
&quot;FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED&quot; controls whether a target
machine supports this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with GCC version 4.6,
the default setting (when not optimizing for size) for
32-bit Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets has been
changed to -fomit-frame-pointer. <br>
The default can be reverted to -fno-omit-frame-pointer by
configuring GCC with the --enable-frame-pointer configure
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foptimize-sibling-calls <br>
Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-inline <br>
Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked
with the &quot;always_inline&quot; attribute. This is the
default when not optimizing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single functions can be exempted
from inlining by marking them with the &quot;noinline&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-small-functions <br>
Integrate functions into their callers when their body is
smaller than expected function call code (so overall size of
program gets smaller). The compiler heuristically <br>
decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way. This inlining applies to all
functions, even those not declared inline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-findirect-inlining <br>
Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known
at compile time thanks to previous inlining. This option has
any effect only when inlining itself is turned on by <br>
the -finline-functions or -finline-small-functions
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-functions <br>
Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not
declared inline. The compiler heuristically decides which
functions are worth integrating in this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all calls to a given function
are integrated, and the function is declared
&quot;static&quot;, then the function is normally not output
as assembler code in its own right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-functions-called-once
<br>
Consider all &quot;static&quot; functions called once for
inlining into their caller even if they are not marked
&quot;inline&quot;. If a call to a given function is
integrated, then the <br>
function is not output as assembler code in its own
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O1, -O2, -O3
and -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fearly-inlining <br>
Inline functions marked by &quot;always_inline&quot; and
functions whose body seems smaller than the function call
overhead early before doing -fprofile-generate
instrumentation and <br>
real inlining pass. Doing so makes profiling significantly
cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs having large
chains of nested wrapper functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-sra <br>
Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates,
removal of unused parameters and replacement of parameters
passed by reference by parameters passed by value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3 and
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-limit=n <br>
By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be
inlined. This flag allows coarse control of this limit. n is
the size of functions that can be inlined in number of <br>
pseudo instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inlining is actually controlled
by a number of parameters, which may be specified
individually by using --param name=value. The
-finline-limit=n option sets some of these <br>
parameters as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-single <br>
is set to n/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-auto <br>
is set to n/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See below for a documentation of
the individual parameters controlling inlining and for the
defaults of these parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: there may be no value to
-finline-limit that results in default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: pseudo instruction
represents, in this particular context, an abstract
measurement of function&rsquo;s size. In no way does it
represent a count of assembly instructions and <br>
as such its exact meaning might change from one release to
an another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-keep-inline-dllexport <br>
This is a more fine-grained version of
-fkeep-inline-functions, which applies only to functions
that are declared using the &quot;dllexport&quot; attribute
or declspec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fkeep-inline-functions <br>
In C, emit &quot;static&quot; functions that are declared
&quot;inline&quot; into the object file, even if the
function has been inlined into all of its callers. This
switch does not affect <br>
functions using the &quot;extern inline&quot; extension in
GNU C90. In C++, emit any and all inline functions into the
object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fkeep-static-consts <br>
Emit variables declared &quot;static const&quot; when
optimization isn&rsquo;t turned on, even if the variables
aren&rsquo;t referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC enables this option by
default. If you want to force the compiler to check if the
variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use <br>
the -fno-keep-static-consts option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmerge-constants <br>
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and
floating-point constants) across compilation units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is the default for
optimized compilation if the assembler and linker support
it. Use -fno-merge-constants to inhibit this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmerge-all-constants <br>
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies
-fmerge-constants. In addition to -fmerge-constants this
considers e.g. even constant initialized arrays or
initialized constant variables with integral <br>
or floating-point types. Languages like C or C++ require
each variable, including multiple instances of the same
variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations, so
<br>
using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmodulo-sched <br>
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first
scheduling pass. This pass looks at innermost loops and
reorders their instructions by overlapping different <br>
iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves
<br>
Perform more aggressive SMS based modulo scheduling with
register moves allowed. By setting this flag certain
anti-dependences edges will be deleted which will trigger
the <br>
generation of reg-moves based on the life-range analysis.
This option is effective only with -fmodulo-sched
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-branch-count-reg <br>
Do not use &quot;decrement and branch&quot; instructions on
a count register, but instead generate a sequence of
instructions that decrement a register, compare it against
zero, then <br>
branch based upon the result. This option is only meaningful
on architectures that support such instructions, which
include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fbranch-count-reg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-function-cse <br>
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each
instruction that calls a constant function contain the
function&rsquo;s address explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option results in less
efficient code, but some strange hacks that alter the
assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ffunction-cse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss
<br>
If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts
variables that are initialized to zero into BSS. This can
save space in the resulting code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option turns off this
behavior because some programs explicitly rely on variables
going to the data section. E.g., so that the resulting
executable can find the <br>
beginning of that section and/or make assumptions based on
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fzero-initialized-in-bss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmudflap -fmudflapth
-fmudflapir <br>
For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all
risky pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard
library string/heap functions, and some other <br>
associated constructs with range/validity tests. Modules so
instrumented should be immune to buffer overflows, invalid
heap use, and some other classes of C/C++ programming <br>
errors. The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (libmudflap), which will be linked into a program if
-fmudflap is given at link time. Run-time behavior of <br>
the instrumented program is controlled by the
MUDFLAP_OPTIONS environment variable. See &quot;env
MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out&quot; for its options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -fmudflapth instead of
-fmudflap to compile and to link if your program is
multi-threaded. Use -fmudflapir, in addition to -fmudflap or
-fmudflapth, if instrumentation <br>
should ignore pointer reads. This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still
provides some protection against outright memory corrupting
<br>
writes, but allows erroneously read data to propagate within
a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fthread-jumps <br>
Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump
branches to a location where another comparison subsumed by
the first is found. If so, the first branch is redirected
<br>
to either the destination of the second branch or a point
immediately following it, depending on whether the condition
is known to be true or false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-wide-types <br>
When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as
&quot;long long&quot; on a 32-bit system, split the
registers apart and allocate them independently. This
normally <br>
generates better code for those types, but may make
debugging more difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcse-follow-jumps <br>
In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump
instructions when the target of the jump is not reached by
any other path. For example, when CSE encounters an <br>
&quot;if&quot; statement with an &quot;else&quot; clause,
CSE will follow the jump when the condition tested is
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcse-skip-blocks <br>
This is similar to -fcse-follow-jumps, but causes CSE to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks. When CSE
encounters a simple &quot;if&quot; statement with no else
clause, <br>
-fcse-skip-blocks causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the &quot;if&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frerun-cse-after-loop <br>
Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop
optimizations has been performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse <br>
Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. This
pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When compiling a program
using computed gotos, a GCC extension, you may get better
run-time performance if you disable the global common
subexpression elimination pass <br>
by adding -fno-gcse to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-lm <br>
When -fgcse-lm is enabled, global common subexpression
elimination will attempt to move loads that are only killed
by stores into themselves. This allows a loop containing a
<br>
load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside the
loop, and a copy/store within the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default when gcse is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-sm <br>
When -fgcse-sm is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination. This pass will
attempt to move stores out of loops. When used in <br>
conjunction with -fgcse-lm, loops containing a load/store
sequence can be changed to a load before the loop and a
store after the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enabled at any optimization
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-las <br>
When -fgcse-las is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after
stores to the same memory location (both partial and <br>
full redundancies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enabled at any optimization
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-after-reload <br>
When -fgcse-after-reload is enabled, a redundant load
elimination pass is performed after reload. The purpose of
this pass is to cleanup redundant spilling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funsafe-loop-optimizations <br>
If given, the loop optimizer will assume that loop indices
do not overflow, and that the loops with nontrivial exit
condition are not infinite. This enables a wider range of
<br>
loop optimizations even if the loop optimizer itself cannot
prove that these assumptions are valid. Using
-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations, the compiler will warn you if
it finds <br>
this kind of loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcrossjumping <br>
Perform cross-jumping transformation. This transformation
unifies equivalent code and save code size. The resulting
code may or may not perform better than without cross- <br>
jumping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fauto-inc-dec <br>
Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory
accesses. This pass is always skipped on architectures that
do not have instructions to support this. Enabled by <br>
default at -O and higher on architectures that support
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdce <br>
Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdse <br>
Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fif-conversion <br>
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
equivalents. This include use of conditional moves, min,
max, set flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable
<br>
by standard arithmetics. The use of conditional execution on
chips where it is available is controlled by
&quot;if-conversion2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fif-conversion2 <br>
Use conditional execution (where available) to transform
conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdelete-null-pointer-checks
<br>
Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null
pointers, and that no code or data element resides there.
This enables simple constant folding optimizations at all
<br>
optimization levels. In addition, other optimization passes
in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow analyses
that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these <br>
assume that if a pointer is checked after it has already
been dereferenced, it cannot be null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note however that in some
environments this assumption is not true. Use
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some targets, especially
embedded ones, disable this option at all levels. Otherwise
it is enabled at all levels: -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3, -Os. Passes
that use the information <br>
are enabled independently at different optimization
levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdevirtualize <br>
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct
calls. This is done both within a procedure and
interprocedurally as part of indirect inlining <br>
(&quot;-findirect-inlining&quot;) and interprocedural
constant propagation (-fipa-cp). Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexpensive-optimizations <br>
Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
expensive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-free <br>
Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions. This is
especially helpful for the x86-64 architecture which
implicitly zero-extends in 64-bit registers after writing to
<br>
their lower 32-bit half.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled for x86 at levels -O2,
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foptimize-register-move <br>
-fregmove <br>
Attempt to reassign register numbers in move instructions
and as operands of other simple instructions in order to
maximize the amount of register tying. This is especially
<br>
helpful on machines with two-operand instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note -fregmove and
-foptimize-register-move are the same optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-algorithm=algorithm <br>
Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated
register allocator. The algorithm argument can be priority,
which specifies Chow&rsquo;s priority coloring, or CB, which
<br>
specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring. Chaitin-Briggs coloring
is not implemented for all architectures, but for those
targets that do support it, it is the default because it
<br>
generates better code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-region=region <br>
Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.
The region argument should be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Use all loops as register
allocation regions. This can give the best results for
machines with a small and/or irregular register set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed <br>
Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure
as the regions. This value usually gives the best results in
most cases and for most architectures, and is <br>
enabled by default when compiling with optimization for
speed (-O, -O2, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one Use all functions as a
single region. This typically results in the smallest code
size, and is enabled by default for -Os or -O0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-loop-pressure <br>
Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions
to move loop invariants. This option usually results in
generation of faster and smaller code on machines with <br>
large register files (&gt;= 32 registers), but it can slow
the compiler down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled at level
-O3 for some targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-ira-share-save-slots <br>
Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used
hard registers living through a call. Each hard register
gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function stack
<br>
frames are larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-ira-share-spill-slots <br>
Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for
pseudo-registers. Each pseudo-register that does not get a
hard register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result
function <br>
stack frames are larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-verbose=n <br>
Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated
register allocator. The default value is 5. If the value n
is greater or equal to 10, the dump output is sent to <br>
stderr using the same format as n minus 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdelayed-branch <br>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
instructions to exploit instruction slots available after
delayed branch instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fschedule-insns <br>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required
data being unavailable. This helps machines that have slow
<br>
floating point or memory load instructions by allowing other
instructions to be issued until the result of the load or
floating-point instruction is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fschedule-insns2 <br>
Similar to -fschedule-insns, but requests an additional pass
of instruction scheduling after register allocation has been
done. This is especially useful on machines with a <br>
relatively small number of registers and where memory load
instructions take more than one cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-sched-interblock <br>
Don&rsquo;t schedule instructions across basic blocks. This
is normally enabled by default when scheduling before
register allocation, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or
<br>
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-sched-spec <br>
Don&rsquo;t allow speculative motion of non-load
instructions. This is normally enabled by default when
scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or at <br>
-O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-pressure <br>
Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before
the register allocation. This only makes sense when
scheduling before register allocation is enabled, i.e. with
<br>
-fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher. Usage of this option
can improve the generated code and decrease its size by
preventing register pressure increase above the number of
<br>
available hard registers and as a consequence register
spills in the register allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-spec-load <br>
Allow speculative motion of some load instructions. This
only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation,
i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-spec-load-dangerous <br>
Allow speculative motion of more load instructions. This
only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation,
i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-stalled-insns <br>
-fsched-stalled-insns=n <br>
Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from
the queue of stalled insns into the ready list, during the
second scheduling pass. -fno-sched-stalled-insns <br>
means that no insns will be moved prematurely,
-fsched-stalled-insns=0 means there is no limit on how many
queued insns can be moved prematurely. -fsched-stalled-insns
<br>
without a value is equivalent to
-fsched-stalled-insns=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-stalled-insns-dep <br>
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=n <br>
Define how many insn groups (cycles) will be examined for a
dependency on a stalled insn that is candidate for premature
removal from the queue of stalled insns. This has an <br>
effect only during the second scheduling pass, and only if
-fsched-stalled-insns is used. -fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep
is equivalent to -fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0. <br>
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep without a value is equivalent to
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched2-use-superblocks <br>
When scheduling after register allocation, do use superblock
scheduling algorithm. Superblock scheduling allows motion
across basic block boundaries resulting on faster <br>
schedules. This option is experimental, as not all machine
descriptions used by GCC model the CPU closely enough to
avoid unreliable results from the algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only makes sense when
scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-group-heuristic <br>
Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler. This heuristic
favors the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, <br>
i.e. with -fschedule-insns or -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-critical-path-heuristic
<br>
Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler. This
heuristic favors instructions on the critical path. This is
enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. <br>
with -fschedule-insns or -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic <br>
Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the
scheduler. This heuristic favors speculative instructions
with greater dependency weakness. This is enabled by default
<br>
when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-rank-heuristic <br>
Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler. This heuristic
favors the instruction belonging to a basic block with
greater size or frequency. This is enabled by default when
<br>
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-last-insn-heuristic <br>
Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler. This
heuristic favors the instruction that is less dependent on
the last instruction scheduled. This is enabled by <br>
default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-dep-count-heuristic <br>
Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler. This
heuristic favors the instruction that has more instructions
depending on it. This is enabled by default when <br>
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops
<br>
The modulo scheduling comes before the traditional
scheduling, if a loop was modulo scheduled we may want to
prevent the later scheduling passes from changing its
schedule, <br>
we use this option to control that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fselective-scheduling <br>
Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
Selective scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fselective-scheduling2 <br>
Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
Selective scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsel-sched-pipelining <br>
Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during
selective scheduling. This option has no effect until one of
-fselective-scheduling or -fselective-scheduling2 is turned
<br>
on.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops
<br>
When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also
pipeline outer loops. This option has no effect until
-fsel-sched-pipelining is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshrink-wrap <br>
Emit function prologues only before parts of the function
that need it, rather than at the top of the function. This
flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcaller-saves <br>
Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be
clobbered by function calls, by emitting extra instructions
to save and restore the registers around such calls. Such
<br>
allocation is done only when it seems to result in better
code than would otherwise be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is always enabled by
default on certain machines, usually those which have no
call-preserved registers to use instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcombine-stack-adjustments <br>
Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory
references and then tries to find ways to combine them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default at -O1 and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconserve-stack <br>
Attempt to minimize stack usage. The compiler will attempt
to use less stack space, even if that makes the program
slower. This option implies setting the large-stack-frame
<br>
parameter to 100 and the large-stack-frame-growth parameter
to 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-reassoc <br>
Perform reassociation on trees. This flag is enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-pre <br>
Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at -O2 and -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-partial-pre <br>
Make partial redundancy elimination (PRE) more aggressive.
This flag is enabled by default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-forwprop <br>
Perform forward propagation on trees. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-fre <br>
Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees. The
difference between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers
expressions that are computed on all paths leading to the
<br>
redundant computation. This analysis is faster than PRE,
though it exposes fewer redundancies. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-phiprop <br>
Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on
trees. This pass is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-copy-prop <br>
Perform copy propagation on trees. This pass eliminates
unnecessary copy operations. This flag is enabled by default
at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-pure-const <br>
Discover which functions are pure or constant. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-reference <br>
Discover which static variables do not escape cannot escape
the compilation unit. Enabled by default at -O and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-pta <br>
Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural
modification and reference analysis. This option can cause
excessive memory and compile-time usage on large <br>
compilation units. It is not enabled by default at any
optimization level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-profile <br>
Perform interprocedural profile propagation. The functions
called only from cold functions are marked as cold. Also
functions executed once (such as &quot;cold&quot;,
&quot;noreturn&quot;, <br>
static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are
then optimized for size. Enabled by default at -O and <br>
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-cp <br>
Perform interprocedural constant propagation. This
optimization analyzes the program to determine when values
passed to functions are constants and then optimizes <br>
accordingly. This optimization can substantially increase
performance if the application has constants passed to
functions. This flag is enabled by default at -O2, -Os and
<br>
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-cp-clone <br>
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant
propagation stronger. When enabled, interprocedural constant
propagation will perform function cloning when <br>
externally visible function can be called with constant
arguments. Because this optimization can create multiple
copies of functions, it may significantly increase code size
<br>
(see --param ipcp-unit-growth=value). This flag is enabled
by default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-matrix-reorg <br>
Perform matrix flattening and transposing. Matrix flattening
tries to replace an m-dimensional matrix with its equivalent
n-dimensional matrix, where n &lt; m. This reduces <br>
the level of indirection needed for accessing the elements
of the matrix. The second optimization is matrix
transposing, which attempts to change the order of the
matrix&rsquo;s <br>
dimensions in order to improve cache locality. Both
optimizations need the -fwhole-program flag. Transposing is
enabled only if profiling information is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-sink <br>
Perform forward store motion on trees. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-bit-ccp <br>
Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees
and propagate pointer alignment information. This pass only
operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by <br>
default at -O and higher. It requires that -ftree-ccp is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-ccp <br>
Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on
trees. This pass only operates on local scalar variables and
is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-switch-conversion <br>
Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array. This flag is enabled by
default at -O2 and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-tail-merge <br>
Look for identical code sequences. When found, replace one
with a jump to the other. This optimization is known as tail
merging or cross jumping. This flag is enabled by <br>
default at -O2 and higher. The compilation time in this pass
can be limited using max-tail-merge-comparisons parameter
and max-tail-merge-iterations parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-dce <br>
Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-builtin-call-dce <br>
Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to
builtin functions that may set &quot;errno&quot; but are
otherwise side-effect free. This flag is enabled by default
at <br>
-O2 and higher if -Os is not also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-dominator-opts <br>
Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and
expression simplification) based on a dominator tree <br>
traversal. This also performs jump threading (to reduce
jumps to jumps). This flag is enabled by default at -O and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-dse <br>
Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees. A dead store
is a store into a memory location that is later overwritten
by another store without any intervening loads. In <br>
this case the earlier store can be deleted. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-ch <br>
Perform loop header copying on trees. This is beneficial
since it increases effectiveness of code motion
optimizations. It also saves one jump. This flag is enabled
by <br>
default at -O and higher. It is not enabled for -Os, since
it usually increases code size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-optimize <br>
Perform loop optimizations on trees. This flag is enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-linear <br>
Perform loop interchange transformations on tree. Same as
-floop-interchange. To use this code transformation, GCC has
to be configured with --with-ppl and --with-cloog to <br>
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-interchange <br>
Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.
Interchanging two nested loops switches the inner and outer
loops. For example, given a loop like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO J = 1, M <br>
DO I = 1, N <br>
A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C <br>

ENDDO <br>
ENDDO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which can be beneficial when
&quot;N&quot; is larger than the caches, because in Fortran,
the elements of an array are stored in memory contiguously

cache miss. This optimization applies to all the languages
supported by GCC and is not limited to Fortran. To use <br>
this code transformation, GCC has to be configured with
--with-ppl and --with-cloog to enable the Graphite loop
transformation infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-strip-mine <br>
Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops. Strip
mining splits a loop into two nested loops. The outer loop
has strides equal to the strip size and the inner loop <br>
has strides of the original loop within a strip. The strip
length can be changed using the loop-block-tile-size
parameter. For example, given a loop like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO I = 1, N <br>
A(I) = A(I) + C <br>
ENDDO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop strip mining will transform

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-block <br>
Perform loop blocking transformations on loops. Blocking
strip mines each loop in the loop nest such that the memory
accesses of the element loops fit inside caches. The <br>
strip length can be changed using the loop-block-tile-size
parameter. For example, given a loop like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO I = 1, N <br>
DO J = 1, M <br>
A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgraphite-identity <br>
Enable the identity transformation for graphite. For every
SCoP we generate the polyhedral representation and transform
it back to gimple. Using -fgraphite-identity we can <br>
check the costs or benefits of the GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE
-&gt; GIMPLE transformation. Some minimal optimizations are
also performed by the code generator CLooG, like index <br>
splitting and dead code elimination in loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-flatten <br>
Removes the loop nesting structure: transforms the loop nest
into a single loop. This transformation can be useful as an
enablement transform for vectorization and <br>
parallelization. This feature is experimental. To use this
code transformation, GCC has to be configured with
--with-ppl and --with-cloog to enable the Graphite loop <br>
transformation infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-parallelize-all <br>
Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops
that can be parallelized. Parallelize all the loops that can
be analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences <br>
without checking that it is profitable to parallelize the
loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcheck-data-deps <br>
Compare the results of several data dependence analyzers.
This option is used for debugging the data dependence
analyzers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-if-convert <br>
Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost
loops to branch-less equivalents. The intent is to remove
control-flow from the innermost loops in order to improve
<br>
the ability of the vectorization pass to handle these loops.
This is enabled by default if vectorization is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores
<br>
Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing
memory writes. This transformation can be unsafe for
multi-threaded programs as it transforms conditional memory
<br>
writes into unconditional memory writes. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) <br>
if (cond) <br>
A[i] = expr;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would be transformed to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) <br>
A[i] = cond ? expr : A[i];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">potentially producing data
races.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-distribution <br>
Perform loop distribution. This flag can improve cache
performance on big loop bodies and allow further loop
optimizations, like parallelization or vectorization, to
take <br>
place. For example, the loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO I = 1, N <br>
A(I) = B(I) + C <br>
D(I) = E(I) * F <br>

A(I) = B(I) + C <br>
ENDDO <br>
DO I = 1, N <br>
D(I) = E(I) * F <br>
ENDDO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns
<br>
Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code
generated with calls to a library. This flag is enabled by
default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This pass distributes the
initialization loops and generates a call to memset zero.
For example, the loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO I = 1, N <br>
A(I) = 0 <br>
B(I) = A(I) + I <br>
ENDDO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is transformed to</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DO I = 1, N <br>
A(I) = 0 <br>
ENDDO <br>
DO I = 1, N <br>
B(I) = A(I) + I <br>
ENDDO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the initialization loop is
transformed into a call to memset zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-im <br>
Perform loop invariant motion on trees. This pass moves only
invariants that would be hard to handle at RTL level
(function calls, operations that expand to nontrivial <br>
sequences of insns). With -funswitch-loops it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop,
so that we can use just trivial invariantness analysis in
<br>
loop unswitching. The pass also includes store motion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-ivcanon <br>
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops
for which determining number of iterations requires
complicated analysis. Later optimizations then may determine
<br>
the number easily. Useful especially in connection with
unrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fivopts <br>
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength
reduction, induction variable merging and induction variable
elimination) on trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-parallelize-loops=n <br>
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run
in n threads. This is only possible for loops whose
iterations are independent and can be arbitrarily reordered.
<br>
The optimization is only profitable on multiprocessor
machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive, rather than
constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth. This option implies
<br>
-pthread, and thus is only supported on targets that have
support for -pthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-pta <br>
Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-sra <br>
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates. This pass replaces
structure references with scalars to prevent committing
structures to memory too early. This flag is enabled by <br>
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-copyrename <br>
Perform copy renaming on trees. This pass attempts to rename
compiler temporaries to other variables at copy locations,
usually resulting in variable names which more <br>
closely resemble the original variables. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars
<br>
Tell the copyrename pass (see -ftree-copyrename) to attempt
to combine small user-defined variables too, but only if
they were inlined from other functions. It is a more <br>
limited form of -ftree-coalesce-vars. This may harm debug
information of such inlined variables, but it will keep
variables of the inlined-into function apart from each <br>
other, such that they are more likely to contain the
expected values in a debugging session. This was the default
in GCC versions older than 4.7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-coalesce-vars <br>
Tell the copyrename pass (see -ftree-copyrename) to attempt
to combine small user-defined variables too, instead of just
compiler temporaries. This may severely limit the <br>
ability to debug an optimized program compiled with
-fno-var-tracking-assignments. In the negated form, this
flag prevents SSA coalescing of user variables, including
<br>
inlined ones. This option is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-ter <br>
Perform temporary expression replacement during the
SSA-&gt;normal phase. Single use/single def temporaries are
replaced at their use location with their defining
expression. <br>
This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL
generation. This is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-vectorize <br>
Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by
default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-slp-vectorize <br>
Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is
enabled by default at -O3 and when -ftree-vectorize is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-vect-loop-version <br>
Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on
trees. When a loop appears to be vectorizable except that
data alignment or data dependence cannot be determined at
<br>
compile time, then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with run-time checks for
alignment or dependence to control which version is <br>
executed. This option is enabled by default except at level
-Os where it is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvect-cost-model <br>
Enable cost model for vectorization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-vrp <br>
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees. This is similar to
the constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges
of values are propagated. This allows the <br>
optimizers to remove unnecessary range checks like array
bound checks and null pointer checks. This is enabled by
default at -O2 and higher. Null pointer check elimination
<br>
is only done if -fdelete-null-pointer-checks is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftracer <br>
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size. This
transformation simplifies the control flow of the function
allowing other optimizations to do better job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funroll-loops <br>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
compile time or upon entry to the loop. -funroll-loops
implies -frerun-cse-after-loop. This option makes code <br>
larger, and may or may not make it run faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funroll-all-loops <br>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is
uncertain when the loop is entered. This usually makes
programs run more slowly. -funroll-all-loops implies the
same <br>
options as -funroll-loops,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller <br>
Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later
iterations of the unrolled loop using the value in the first
iteration. This breaks long dependency chains, thus <br>
improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combination of -fweb and CSE is
often sufficient to obtain the same effect. However in cases
the loop body is more complicated than a single basic block,
this is not <br>
reliable. It also does not work at all on some of the
architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is enabled by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller
<br>
With this option, the compiler will create multiple copies
of some local variables when unrolling a loop which can
result in superior code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpartial-inlining <br>
Inline parts of functions. This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the -finline-functions
or -finline-small-functions options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpredictive-commoning <br>
Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing
computations (especially memory loads and stores) performed
in previous iterations of loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled at level
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprefetch-loop-arrays <br>
If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to
prefetch memory to improve the performance of loops that
access large arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may generate better
or worse code; results are highly dependent on the structure
of loops within the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled at level -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-peephole <br>
-fno-peephole2 <br>
Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations. The
difference between -fno-peephole and -fno-peephole2 is in
how they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use
<br>
one, some use the other, a few use both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpeephole is enabled by
default. -fpeephole2 enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-guess-branch-probability
<br>
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC will use heuristics to guess
branch probabilities if they are not provided by profiling
feedback (-fprofile-arcs). These heuristics are based on the
control flow graph. <br>
If some branch probabilities are specified by
__builtin_expect, then the heuristics will be used to guess
branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking <br>
the __builtin_expect info into account. The interactions
between the heuristics and __builtin_expect can be complex,
and in some cases, it may be useful to disable the <br>
heuristics so that the effects of __builtin_expect are
easier to understand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fguess-branch-probability at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-blocks <br>
Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to
reduce number of taken branches and improve code
locality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-blocks-and-partition
<br>
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled
function, in order to reduce number of taken branches,
partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections
of <br>
the assembly and .o files, to improve paging and cache
locality performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is
automatically turned off in the presence of exception
handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a
user-defined section attribute and on any <br>
architecture that does not support named sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-functions <br>
Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve
code locality. This is implemented by using special
subsections &quot;.text.hot&quot; for most frequently
executed functions <br>
and &quot;.text.unlikely&quot; for unlikely executed
functions. Reordering is done by the linker so object file
format must support named sections and linker must place
them in a <br>
reasonable way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also profile feedback must be
available in to make this option effective. See
-fprofile-arcs for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-aliasing <br>
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules
applicable to the language being compiled. For C (and C++),
this activates optimizations based on the type of <br>
expressions. In particular, an object of one type is assumed
never to reside at the same address as an object of a
different type, unless the types are almost the same. For
<br>
example, an &quot;unsigned int&quot; can alias an
&quot;int&quot;, but not a &quot;void*&quot; or a
&quot;double&quot;. A character type may alias any other
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pay special attention to code
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">union a_union { <br>
int i; <br>
double d; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() { <br>
union a_union t; <br>
t.d = 3.0; <br>
return t.i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The practice of reading from a
different union member than the one most recently written to
(called &quot;type-punning&quot;) is common. Even with
-fstrict-aliasing, type-punning is <br>
allowed, provided the memory is accessed through the union
type. So, the code above will work as expected. However,
this code might not:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() { <br>
union a_union t; <br>
int* ip; <br>
t.d = 3.0; <br>
ip = &amp;t.i; <br>
return *ip; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, access by taking the
address, casting the resulting pointer and dereferencing the
result has undefined behavior, even if the cast uses a union
type, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() { <br>
double d = 3.0; <br>
return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fstrict-aliasing option is
enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-overflow <br>
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules,
depending on the language being compiled. For C (and C++)
this means that overflow when doing arithmetic with <br>
signed numbers is undefined, which means that the compiler
may assume that it will not happen. This permits various
optimizations. For example, the compiler will assume <br>
that an expression like &quot;i + 10 &gt; i&quot; will
always be true for signed &quot;i&quot;. This assumption is
only valid if signed overflow is undefined, as the
expression is false if &quot;i + <br>
10&quot; overflows when using twos complement arithmetic.
When this option is in effect any attempt to determine
whether an operation on signed numbers will overflow must be
<br>
written carefully to not actually involve overflow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also allows the
compiler to assume strict pointer semantics: given a pointer
to an object, if adding an offset to that pointer does not
produce a pointer to the <br>
same object, the addition is undefined. This permits the
compiler to conclude that &quot;p + u &gt; p&quot; is always
true for a pointer &quot;p&quot; and unsigned integer
&quot;u&quot;. This assumption is <br>
only valid because pointer wraparound is undefined, as the
expression is false if &quot;p + u&quot; overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the -fwrapv option.
Using -fwrapv means that integer signed overflow is fully
defined: it wraps. When -fwrapv is used, there is no
difference between <br>
-fstrict-overflow and -fno-strict-overflow for integers.
With -fwrapv certain types of overflow are permitted. For
example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing <br>
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be
used with -fwrapv, but not otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fstrict-overflow option is
enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-functions <br>
-falign-functions=n <br>
Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two
greater than n, skipping up to n bytes. For instance,
-falign-functions=32 aligns functions to the next 32-byte
<br>
boundary, but -falign-functions=24 would align to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23
bytes or less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-functions and
-falign-functions=1 are equivalent and mean that functions
will not be aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some assemblers only support
this flag when n is a power of two; in that case, it is
rounded up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is not specified or is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-labels <br>
-falign-labels=n <br>
Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary,
skipping up to n bytes like -falign-functions. This option
can easily make code slower, because it must insert dummy
<br>
operations for when the branch target is reached in the
usual flow of the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-labels and
-falign-labels=1 are equivalent and mean that labels will
not be aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-loops <br>
-falign-loops=n <br>
Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to n
bytes like -falign-functions. The hope is that the loop will
be executed many times, which will make up for any <br>
execution of the dummy operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-loops and

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-jumps <br>
-falign-jumps=n <br>
Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch
targets where the targets can only be reached by jumping,

This option is left for compatibility reasons.
-funit-at-a-time has no effect, while -fno-unit-at-a-time

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-toplevel-reorder <br>
Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and

that they appear in the input file. When this option is
used, <br>
unreferenced static variables will not be removed. This
option is intended to support existing code that relies on a

which is otherwise enabled at -O0 on some targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fweb <br>
Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation
purposes and assign each web individual pseudo register.
This allows the register allocation pass to operate on <br>
pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other
optimization passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial
dead code remover. It can, however, make debugging <br>
impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
&quot;home register&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default with
-funroll-loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwhole-program <br>
Assume that the current compilation unit represents the
whole program being compiled. All public functions and
variables with the exception of &quot;main&quot; and those
merged by <br>
attribute &quot;externally_visible&quot; become static
functions and in effect are optimized more aggressively by
interprocedural optimizers. If gold is used as the linker
plugin, <br>
&quot;externally_visible&quot; attributes are automatically
added to functions (not variable yet due to a current gold
issue) that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to
<br>
resolution file produced by gold. For other linkers that
cannot generate resolution file, explicit
&quot;externally_visible&quot; attributes are still
necessary. While this option is <br>
equivalent to proper use of the &quot;static&quot; keyword
for programs consisting of a single file, in combination
with option -flto this flag can be used to compile many
smaller <br>
scale programs since the functions and variables become
local for the whole combined compilation unit, not for the
single source file itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies -fwhole-file
for Fortran programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto[=n] <br>
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer. When
invoked with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of
GCC&rsquo;s internal representations) and writes it to
special ELF <br>
sections in the object file. When the object files are
linked together, all the function bodies are read from these
ELF sections and instantiated as if they had been part of
<br>
the same translation unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the link-time optimizer,
-flto needs to be specified at compile time and during the
final link. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c <br>
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c <br>
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first two invocations to GCC
save a bytecode representation of GIMPLE into special ELF
sections inside foo.o and bar.o. The final invocation reads
the GIMPLE bytecode <br>
from foo.o and bar.o, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual. Since both
foo.o and bar.o are merged into a single image, this <br>
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in
GCC to work across the two files as if they were a single
one. This means, for example, that the inliner is able <br>
to inline functions in bar.o into functions in foo.o and
vice-versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another (simpler) way to enable
link-time optimization is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c
bar.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above generates bytecode for
foo.c and bar.c, merges them together into a single GIMPLE
representation and optimizes them as usual to produce
myprog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only important thing to keep
in mind is that to enable link-time optimizations the -flto
flag needs to be passed to both the compile and the link
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make whole program
optimization effective, it is necessary to make certain
whole program assumptions. The compiler needs to know what
functions and variables can be <br>
accessed by libraries and runtime outside of the link-time
optimized unit. When supported by the linker, the linker
plugin (see -fuse-linker-plugin) passes information to <br>
the compiler about used and externally visible symbols. When
the linker plugin is not available, -fwhole-program should
be used to allow the compiler to make these <br>
assumptions, which leads to more aggressive optimization
decisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that when a file is
compiled with -flto, the generated object file is larger
than a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE
bytecodes and the usual final code. <br>
This means that object files with LTO information can be
linked as normal object files; if -flto is not passed to the
linker, no interprocedural optimizations are applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the optimization
flags used to compile individual files are not necessarily
related to those used at link time. For instance,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -O0 -flto foo.c <br>
gcc -c -O0 -flto bar.c <br>
gcc -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This produces individual object
files with unoptimized assembler code, but the resulting
binary myprog is optimized at -O3. If, instead, the final
binary is generated <br>
without -flto, then myprog is not optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When producing the final binary
with -flto, GCC only applies link-time optimizations to
those files that contain bytecode. Therefore, you can mix
and match object files and <br>
libraries with GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code. GCC
automatically selects which files to optimize in LTO mode
and which files to link without further processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some code generation
flags preserved by GCC when generating bytecodes, as they
need to be used during the final link stage. Currently, the
following options are <br>
saved into the GIMPLE bytecode files: -fPIC, -fcommon and
all the -m target flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At link time, these options are
read in and reapplied. Note that the current implementation
makes no attempt to recognize conflicting values for these
options. If different <br>
files have conflicting option values (e.g., one file is
compiled with -fPIC and another isn&rsquo;t), the compiler
simply uses the last value read from the bytecode files. It
is <br>
recommended, then, that you compile all the files
participating in the same link with the same options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LTO encounters objects with C
linkage declared with incompatible types in separate
translation units to be linked together (undefined behavior
according to ISO C99 6.2.7), <br>
a non-fatal diagnostic may be issued. The behavior is still
undefined at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another feature of LTO is that
it is possible to apply interprocedural optimizations on
files written in different languages. This requires support
in the language front <br>
end. Currently, the C, C++ and Fortran front ends are
capable of emitting GIMPLE bytecodes, so something like this
should work:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -flto foo.c <br>
g++ -c -flto bar.cc <br>
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90 <br>
g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that the final link is
done with g++ to get the C++ runtime libraries and
-lgfortran is added to get the Fortran runtime libraries. In
general, when mixing languages <br>
in LTO mode, you should use the same link command options as
when mixing languages in a regular (non-LTO) compilation;
all you need to add is -flto to all the compile and <br>
link commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If object files containing
GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
libfoo.a, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO
link if you are using a linker with <br>
plugin support. To enable this feature, use the flag
-fuse-linker-plugin at link time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto
-fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the linker plugin enabled,
the linker extracts the needed GIMPLE files from libfoo.a
and passes them on to the running GCC to make them part of
the aggregated GIMPLE <br>
image to be optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not using a linker
with plugin support and/or do not enable the linker plugin,
then the objects inside libfoo.a are extracted and linked as
usual, but they do not <br>
participate in the LTO optimization process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link-time optimizations do not
require the presence of the whole program to operate. If the
program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <br>
-flto and -fwhole-program to allow the interprocedural
optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may lead
to improved optimization opportunities. Use of <br>
-fwhole-program is not needed when linker plugin is active
(see -fuse-linker-plugin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current implementation of
LTO makes no attempt to generate bytecode that is portable
between different types of hosts. The bytecode files are
versioned and there is a <br>
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one
version of GCC will not work with an older/newer version of
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link-time optimization does not
work well with generation of debugging information.
Combining -flto with -g is currently experimental and
expected to produce wrong results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify the optional n,
the optimization and code generation done at link time is
executed in parallel using n parallel jobs by utilizing an
installed make program. <br>
The environment variable MAKE may be used to override the
program used. The default value for n is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also specify
-flto=jobserver to use GNU make&rsquo;s job server mode to
determine the number of parallel jobs. This is useful when
the Makefile calling GCC is already <br>
executing in parallel. You must prepend a + to the command
recipe in the parent Makefile for this to work. This option
likely only works if MAKE is GNU make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is disabled by
default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-partition=alg <br>
Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time
optimizer. The value is either &quot;1to1&quot; to specify a
partitioning mirroring the original source files or
&quot;balanced&quot; to <br>
specify partitioning into equally sized chunks (whenever
possible). Specifying &quot;none&quot; as an algorithm
disables partitioning and streaming completely. The default
value is <br>
&quot;balanced&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-compression-level=n <br>
This option specifies the level of compression used for
intermediate language written to LTO object files, and is
only meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode (-flto). Valid
<br>
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).
Values outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9. If
the option is not given, a default balanced compression <br>
setting is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-report <br>
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the
link-time optimizer. The contents of this report vary from
version to version. It is meant to be useful to GCC <br>
developers when processing object files in LTO mode (via
-flto).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-linker-plugin <br>
Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time
optimization. This option relies on plugin support in the
linker, which is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or
newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option enables the
extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out of
library archives. This improves the quality of optimization
by exposing more code to the link- <br>
time optimizer. This information specifies what symbols can
be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking). Resulting code quality improvements on <br>
binaries (and shared libraries that use hidden visibility)
are similar to &quot;-fwhole-program&quot;. See -flto for a
description of the effect of this flag and how to use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default when LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was
configured for use with a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld
2.21 or newer or gold).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffat-lto-objects <br>
Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the
intermediate language and the object code. This makes them
usable for both LTO linking and normal linking. This option
<br>
is effective only when compiling with -flto and is ignored
at link time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-fat-lto-objects improves
compilation time over plain LTO, but requires the complete
toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for <br>
basic functionality. Additionally, nm, ar and ranlib need to
support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build
environment (capable of building static libraries etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -ffat-lto-objects
but this default is intended to change in future releases
when linker plugin enabled environments become more
common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-elim <br>
After register allocation and post-register allocation
instruction splitting, identify arithmetic instructions that
compute processor flags similar to a comparison operation
<br>
based on that arithmetic. If possible, eliminate the
explicit comparison operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This pass only applies to
certain targets that cannot explicitly represent the
comparison operation before register allocation is
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-ld=gold <br>
Use the gold linker instead of the default linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-ld=bfd <br>
Use the ld.bfd linker instead of the default linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcprop-registers <br>
After register allocation and post-register allocation
instruction splitting, we perform a copy-propagation pass to
try to reduce scheduling dependencies and occasionally <br>
eliminate the copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-correction <br>
Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for
multi-threaded programs may be inconsistent due to missed
counter updates. When this option is specified, GCC will use
<br>
heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, GCC will emit an error message when an inconsistent
profile is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-dir=path <br>
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to
path. This option affects only the profile data generated by
-fprofile-generate, -ftest-coverage, -fprofile-arcs <br>
and used by -fprofile-use and -fbranch-probabilities and its
related options. Both absolute and relative paths can be
used. By default, GCC will use the current directory <br>
as path, thus the profile data file will appear in the same
directory as the object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-generate <br>
-fprofile-generate=path <br>
Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to
produce profile useful for later recompilation with profile
feedback based optimization. You must use <br>
-fprofile-generate both when compiling and when linking your
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
enabled: &quot;-fprofile-arcs&quot;,
&quot;-fprofile-values&quot;, &quot;-fvpt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If path is specified, GCC will
look at the path to find the profile feedback data files.
See -fprofile-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-use <br>
-fprofile-use=path <br>
Enable profile feedback directed optimizations, and
optimizations generally profitable only with profile
feedback available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
enabled: &quot;-fbranch-probabilities&quot;,
&quot;-fvpt&quot;, &quot;-funroll-loops&quot;,
&quot;-fpeel-loops&quot;, &quot;-ftracer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, GCC emits an error
message if the feedback profiles do not match the source
code. This error can be turned into a warning by using
-Wcoverage-mismatch. Note <br>
this may result in poorly optimized code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If path is specified, GCC will
look at the path to find the profile feedback data files.
See -fprofile-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options control
compiler behavior regarding floating-point arithmetic. These
options trade off between speed and correctness. All must be
specifically enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffloat-store <br>
Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and
inhibit other options that might change whether a
floating-point value is taken from a register or memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option prevents undesirable
excess precision on machines such as the 68000 where the
floating registers (of the 68881) keep more precision than a
&quot;double&quot; is supposed to <br>
have. Similarly for the x86 architecture. For most programs,
the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely
on the precise definition of IEEE floating point. <br>
Use -ffloat-store for such programs, after modifying them to
store all pertinent intermediate computations into
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexcess-precision=style <br>
This option allows further control over excess precision on
machines where floating-point registers have more precision
than the IEEE &quot;float&quot; and &quot;double&quot; types
and the <br>
processor does not support operations rounding to those
types. By default, -fexcess-precision=fast is in effect;
this means that operations are carried out in the precision
<br>
of the registers and that it is unpredictable when rounding
to the types specified in the source code takes place. When
compiling C, if -fexcess-precision=standard is <br>
specified then excess precision will follow the rules
specified in ISO C99; in particular, both casts and
assignments cause values to be rounded to their semantic
types <br>
(whereas -ffloat-store only affects assignments). This
option is enabled by default for C if a strict conformance
option such as -std=c99 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexcess-precision=standard is
not implemented for languages other than C, and has no
effect if -funsafe-math-optimizations or -ffast-math is
specified. On the x86, it also <br>
has no effect if -mfpmath=sse or -mfpmath=sse+387 is
specified; in the former case, IEEE semantics apply without
excess precision, and in the latter, rounding is <br>
unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffast-math <br>
Sets -fno-math-errno, -funsafe-math-optimizations,
-ffinite-math-only, -fno-rounding-math, -fno-signaling-nans
and -fcx-limited-range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the
preprocessor macro &quot;__FAST_MATH__&quot; to be
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not turned on by
any -O option besides -Ofast since it can result in
incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
implementation of IEEE or ISO <br>
rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however,
yield faster code for programs that do not require the
guarantees of these specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-math-errno <br>
Do not set ERRNO after calling math functions that are
executed with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt. A program
that relies on IEEE exceptions for math error handling may
<br>
want to use this flag for speed while maintaining IEEE
arithmetic compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -fmath-errno.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Darwin systems, the math
library never sets &quot;errno&quot;. There is therefore no

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funsafe-math-optimizations <br>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a)
assume that arguments and results are valid and (b) may
violate IEEE or ANSI standards. When used at link-time, it
<br>
may include libraries or startup files that change the
default FPU control word or other similar optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fassociative-math <br>
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point
operations. This violates the ISO C and C++ language
standard by possibly changing computation result. NOTE: <br>
re-ordering may change the sign of zero as well as ignore
NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and thus
cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior <br>
like &quot;(x + 2**52) - 2**52&quot;. May also reorder
floating-point comparisons and thus may not be used when
ordered comparisons are required. This option requires that
both <br>
-fno-signed-zeros and -fno-trapping-math be in effect.
Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense with
-frounding-math. For Fortran the option is automatically
enabled when both <br>
-fno-signed-zeros and -fno-trapping-math are in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-associative-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freciprocal-math <br>
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of
dividing by the value if this enables optimizations. For
example &quot;x / y&quot; can be replaced with &quot;x *
(1/y)&quot;, which is <br>
useful if &quot;(1/y)&quot; is subject to common
subexpression elimination. Note that this loses precision
and increases the number of flops operating on the
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-reciprocal-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffinite-math-only <br>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-finite-math-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-signed-zeros <br>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that
ignore the signedness of zero. IEEE arithmetic specifies the
behavior of distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then <br>
prohibits simplification of expressions such as x+0.0 or
0.0*x (even with -ffinite-math-only). This option implies
that the sign of a zero result isn&rsquo;t significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fsigned-zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-trapping-math <br>
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot
generate user-visible traps. These traps include division by
zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and <br>
invalid operation. This option requires that
-fno-signaling-nans be in effect. Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on &quot;non-stop&quot; IEEE
arithmetic, for <br>
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should never be

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ftrapping-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frounding-math <br>
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume
default floating-point rounding behavior. This is
round-to-zero for all floating point to integer conversions,
and <br>
round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic truncations. This
option should be specified for programs that change the FP
rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed <br>
with a non-default rounding mode. This option disables
constant folding of floating-point expressions at compile
time (which may be affected by rounding mode) and arithmetic
<br>
transformations that are unsafe in the presence of
sign-dependent rounding modes.</p>

will be used to specify the default state for
&quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsignaling-nans <br>
Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate
user-visible traps during floating-point operations. Setting
this option disables optimizations that may change <br>

Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead
of implicitly converting them to double-precision
constants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcx-limited-range <br>
When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step
is not needed when performing complex division. Also, there
is no checking whether the result of a complex <br>
multiplication or division is &quot;NaN + I*NaN&quot;, with
an attempt to rescue the situation in that case. The default

Nevertheless, the option applies to all languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcx-fortran-rules <br>
Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.
Range reduction is done as part of complex division, but
there is no checking whether the result of a complex <br>
multiplication or division is &quot;NaN + I*NaN&quot;, with

After running a program compiled with -fprofile-arcs, you
can compile it a second time using -fbranch-probabilities,

each branch was taken. When the program compiled with
-fprofile-arcs exits it saves arc execution counts to a file

information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same
source code and the same optimization options for both <br>
compilations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fbranch-probabilities, GCC
puts a REG_BR_PROB note on each JUMP_INSN and CALL_INSN.
These can be used to improve optimization. Currently, they
are only used in one <br>
place: in reorg.c, instead of guessing which path a branch
is most likely to take, the REG_BR_PROB values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-values <br>
If combined with -fprofile-arcs, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is
gathered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fbranch-probabilities, it
reads back the data gathered from profiling values of
expressions for usage in optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-generate
and -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvpt <br>
If combined with -fprofile-arcs, it instructs the compiler
to add a code to gather information about values of
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fbranch-probabilities, it
reads back the data gathered and actually performs the
optimizations based on them. Currently the optimizations
include specialization of <br>
division operation using the knowledge about the value of
the denominator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frename-registers <br>
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by
making use of registers left over after register allocation.
This optimization will most benefit processors with <br>
lots of registers. Depending on the debug information format
adopted by the target, however, it can make debugging
impossible, since variables will no longer stay in a
&quot;home <br>
register&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default with
-funroll-loops and -fpeel-loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftracer <br>
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size. This
transformation simplifies the control flow of the function
allowing other optimizations to do better job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funroll-loops <br>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
compile time or upon entry to the loop. -funroll-loops
implies -frerun-cse-after-loop, -fweb and <br>
-frename-registers. It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number
of iterations). This option makes code larger, and may <br>
or may not make it run faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funroll-all-loops <br>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is
uncertain when the loop is entered. This usually makes
programs run more slowly. -funroll-all-loops implies the
same <br>
options as -funroll-loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpeel-loops <br>
Peels loops for which there is enough information that they
do not roll much (from profile feedback). It also turns on
complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops <br>
with small constant number of iterations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmove-loop-invariants <br>
Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop
optimizer. Enabled at level -O1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funswitch-loops <br>
Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the
loop, with duplicates of the loop on both branches (modified
according to result of the condition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffunction-sections <br>
-fdata-sections <br>
Place each function or data item into its own section in the
output file if the target supports arbitrary sections. The
name of the function or the name of the data item <br>
determines the section&rsquo;s name in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use these options on systems
where the linker can perform optimizations to improve
locality of reference in the instruction space. Most systems
using the ELF object format <br>
and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with
such optimizations. AIX may have these optimizations in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only use these options when
there are significant benefits from doing so. When you
specify these options, the assembler and linker will create
larger object and executable <br>
files and will also be slower. You will not be able to use
&quot;gprof&quot; on all systems if you specify this option
and you may have problems with debugging if you specify both
<br>
this option and -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbranch-target-load-optimize
<br>
Perform branch target register load optimization before
prologue / epilogue threading. The use of target registers
can typically be exposed only during reload, thus hoisting
<br>
loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs a
separate optimization pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbranch-target-load-optimize2
<br>
Perform branch target register load optimization after
prologue / epilogue threading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbtr-bb-exclusive <br>
When performing branch target register load optimization,
don&rsquo;t reuse branch target registers in within any
basic block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-protector <br>
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to
functions with vulnerable objects. This includes <br>
functions that call alloca, and functions with buffers
larger than 8 bytes. The guards are initialized when a
function is entered and then checked when the function
exits. <br>
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the
program exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: In Ubuntu 6.10 and later
versions this option is enabled by default for C, C++, ObjC,
ObjC++, if none of -fno-stack-protector, -nostdlib, nor
-ffreestanding are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-protector-all <br>
Like -fstack-protector except that all functions are
protected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsection-anchors <br>
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by
using shared &quot;anchor&quot; symbols to address nearby
objects. This transformation can help to reduce the number
of <br>
GOT entries and GOT accesses on some targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the implementation
of the following function &quot;foo&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static int a, b, c; <br>
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would usually calculate the
addresses of all three variables, but if you compile it with
-fsection-anchors, it will access the variables from a
common anchor point instead. <br>
The effect is similar to the following pseudocode (which
isn&rsquo;t valid C):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int foo (void) <br>
{ <br>
register int *xr = &amp;x; <br>
return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c
- &amp;x]; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all targets support this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--param name=value <br>
In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the
amount of optimization that is done. For example, GCC will
not inline functions that contain more than a certain <br>
number of instructions. You can control some of these
constants on the command line using the --param option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of specific
parameters, and the meaning of the values, are tied to the
internals of the compiler, and are subject to change without
notice in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In each case, the value is an
integer. The allowable choices for name are given in the
following table:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">predictable-branch-outcome <br>
When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower
than this threshold (in percent), then it is considered well
predictable. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-crossjump-edges <br>
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for
crossjumping. The algorithm used by -fcrossjumping is O(N^2)
in the number of edges incoming to each block. <br>
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making
the compilation time increase with probably small
improvement in executable size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-crossjump-insns <br>
The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at
the end of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed
on them. This value is ignored in the case where <br>
all instructions in the block being crossjumped from are
matched. The default value is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-grow-copy-bb-insns <br>
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic
blocks instead of jumping. The expansion is relative to a
jump instruction. The default value is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-goto-duplication-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block
that jumps to a computed goto. To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a
number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos <br>
early in the compilation process, and unfactors them as late
as possible. Only computed jumps at the end of a basic
blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns <br>
are unfactored. The default value is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-delay-slot-insn-search <br>
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking
for an instruction to fill a delay slot. If more than this
arbitrary number of instructions is searched, the <br>
time savings from filling the delay slot will be minimal so
stop searching. Increasing values mean more aggressive
optimization, making the compilation time increase <br>
with probably small improvement in execution time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-delay-slot-live-search <br>
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of
instructions to consider when searching for a block with
valid live register information. Increasing this <br>
arbitrarily chosen value means more aggressive optimization,
increasing the compilation time. This parameter should be
removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to <br>
maintain the control-flow graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-gcse-memory <br>
The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be
allocated in order to perform the global common
subexpression elimination optimization. If more memory than
<br>
specified is required, the optimization will not be
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-gcse-insertion-ratio <br>
If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger
than this value for any expression, then RTL PRE will insert
or remove the expression and thus leave <br>
partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.
The default value is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-pending-list-length <br>
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will
allow before flushing the current state and starting over.
Large functions with few branches or calls can <br>
create excessively large lists which needlessly consume
memory and resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-modulo-backtrack-attempts
<br>
The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler
should make when modulo scheduling a loop. Larger values can
exponentially increase compilation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-single <br>
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted
in GCC&rsquo;s internal representation) in a single <br>
function that the tree inliner will consider for inlining.
This only affects functions declared inline and methods
implemented in a class declaration (C++). The default <br>
value is 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-auto <br>
When you use -finline-functions (included in -O3), a lot of
functions that would otherwise not be considered for
inlining by the compiler will be investigated. To those <br>
functions, a different (more restrictive) limit compared to
functions declared inline can be applied. The default value
is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-function-insns <br>
The limit specifying really large functions. For functions
larger than this limit after inlining, inlining is
constrained by --param large-function-growth. This <br>
parameter is useful primarily to avoid extreme compilation
time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the back end.
The default value is 2700.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-function-growth <br>
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by
inlining in percents. The default value is 100 which limits
large function growth to 2.0 times the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-unit-insns <br>
The limit specifying large translation unit. Growth caused
by inlining of units larger than this limit is limited by
--param inline-unit-growth. For small units this <br>
might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time. If B is
small relative to A, the growth of unit is 300 <br>
and yet such inlining is very sane. For very large units
consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall
unit growth limit is needed to avoid exponential <br>
explosion of code size. Thus for smaller units, the size is
increased to --param large-unit-insns before applying
--param inline-unit-growth. The default is 10000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline-unit-growth <br>
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
caused by inlining. The default value is 30 which limits
unit growth to 1.3 times the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-unit-growth <br>
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
caused by interprocedural constant propagation. The default
value is 10 which limits unit growth to 1.1 times <br>
the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-stack-frame <br>
The limit specifying large stack frames. While inlining the
algorithm is trying to not grow past this limit too much.
Default value is 256 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-stack-frame-growth <br>
Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by
inlining in percents. The default value is 1000 which limits
large stack frame growth to 11 times the original <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-recursive <br>
max-inline-insns-recursive-auto <br>
Specifies maximum number of instructions out-of-line copy of
self recursive inline function can grow into by performing
recursive inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For functions declared inline
--param max-inline-insns-recursive is taken into account.
For function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens
only when <br>
-finline-functions (included in -O3) is enabled and --param
max-inline-insns-recursive-auto is used. The default value
is 450.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-recursive-depth <br>
max-inline-recursive-depth-auto <br>
Specifies maximum recursion depth used by the recursive
inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For functions declared inline
--param max-inline-recursive-depth is taken into account.
For function not declared inline, recursive inlining happens
only when <br>
-finline-functions (included in -O3) is enabled and --param
max-inline-recursive-depth-auto is used. The default value
is 8.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-inline-recursive-probability
<br>
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having
deep recursion in average and can hurt for function having
little recursion depth by increasing the prologue <br>
size or complexity of function body to other optimizers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When profile feedback is
available (see -fprofile-generate) the actual recursion
depth can be guessed from probability that function will
recurse via given call <br>
expression. This parameter limits inlining only to call
expression whose probability exceeds given threshold (in
percents). The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">early-inlining-insns <br>
Specify growth that early inliner can make. In effect it
increases amount of inlining for code having large
abstraction penalty. The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-early-inliner-iterations
<br>
max-early-inliner-iterations <br>
Limit of iterations of early inliner. This basically bounds
number of nested indirect calls early inliner can resolve.
Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comdat-sharing-probability <br>
comdat-sharing-probability <br>
Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with
comdat visibility will be shared across multiple compilation
units. The default value is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-vect-loop-bound <br>
The minimum number of iterations under which a loop will not
get vectorized when -ftree-vectorize is used. The number of
iterations after vectorization needs to be <br>
greater than the value specified by this option to allow
vectorization. The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcse-cost-distance-ratio <br>
Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an
expression can be moved by GCSE optimizations. This is
currently supported only in the code hoisting pass. The <br>
bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting will be
with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have
cost less than gcse-unrestricted-cost. Specifying 0 <br>
will disable hoisting of simple expressions. The default
value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcse-unrestricted-cost <br>
Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical
machine instruction, at which GCSE optimizations will not
constrain the distance an expression can travel. This is
<br>
currently supported only in the code hoisting pass. The
lesser the cost, the more aggressive code hoisting will be.
Specifying 0 will allow all expressions to travel <br>
unrestricted distances. The default value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-hoist-depth <br>
The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to
hoist. This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting
algorithm. The value of 0 will avoid limiting <br>
the search, but may slow down compilation of huge functions.
The default value is 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-tail-merge-comparisons <br>
The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with. This
is used to avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.
The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-tail-merge-iterations <br>
The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the
function. This is used to limit compilation time in tree
tail merging. The default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unrolled-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have
if that loop is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it
determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-average-unrolled-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities
of their execution that a loop should have if that loop is
unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines <br>
how many times the loop code is unrolled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unroll-times <br>
The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-peeled-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have
if that loop is peeled, and if the loop is peeled, it
determines how many times the loop code is peeled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-peel-times <br>
The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-completely-peeled-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-completely-peel-times <br>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable
for complete peeling.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-completely-peel-loop-nest-depth
<br>
The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete
peeling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unswitch-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unswitch-level <br>
The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single
loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lim-expensive <br>
The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop
invariant motion.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">iv-consider-all-candidates-bound
<br>
Bound on number of candidates for induction variables below
that all candidates are considered for each use in induction
variable optimizations. Only the most relevant <br>
candidates are considered if there are more candidates, to
avoid quadratic time complexity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iv-max-considered-uses <br>
The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that
contain more induction variable uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound
<br>
If number of candidates in the set is smaller than this
value, we always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set
during its optimization when a new iv is added to the <br>
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scev-max-expr-size <br>
Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions
analyzer. Large expressions slow the analyzer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scev-max-expr-complexity <br>
Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar
evolutions analyzer. Complex expressions slow the
analyzer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-max-vars <br>
The maximum number of variables in an Omega constraint
system. The default value is 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-max-geqs <br>
The maximum number of inequalities in an Omega constraint
system. The default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-max-eqs <br>
The maximum number of equalities in an Omega constraint
system. The default value is 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-max-wild-cards <br>
The maximum number of wildcard variables that the Omega
solver will be able to insert. The default value is 18.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-hash-table-size <br>
The size of the hash table in the Omega solver. The default
value is 550.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-max-keys <br>
The maximal number of keys used by the Omega solver. The
default value is 500.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">omega-eliminate-redundant-constraints
<br>
When set to 1, use expensive methods to eliminate all
redundant constraints. The default value is 0.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks
<br>
The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed
when doing loop versioning for alignment in the vectorizer.
See option ftree-vect-loop-version for more <br>
information.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">vect-max-version-for-alias-checks
<br>
The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed
when doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer. See
option ftree-vect-loop-version for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-iterations-to-track <br>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute force
algorithm for analysis of # of iterations of the loop tries
to evaluate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hot-bb-count-fraction <br>
Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic
block in program given basic block needs to have to be
considered hot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hot-bb-frequency-fraction <br>
Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions
of basic block in function given basic block needs to have
to be considered hot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-predicted-iterations <br>
The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.
This is useful in cases where function contain single loop
with known bound and other loop with unknown. We <br>
predict the known number of iterations correctly, while the
unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10. This
means that the loop without bounds would appear <br>
artificially cold relative to the other one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align-threshold <br>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of
basic block in function given basic block will get
aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align-loop-iterations <br>
A loop expected to iterate at lest the selected number of
iterations will get aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-dynamic-coverage <br>
tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback <br>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the
given percentage of executed instructions is covered. This
limits unnecessary code size expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback is used only when profile
feedback is available. The real profiles (as opposed to
statically estimated ones) are much less balanced <br>
allowing the threshold to be larger value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-max-code-growth <br>
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given
percentage. This is rather hokey argument, as most of the
duplicates will be eliminated later in cross jumping, <br>
so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired
code growth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-min-branch-ratio <br>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best
edge is less than this threshold (in percent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-min-branch-ratio <br>
tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback <br>
Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability
lower than this threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly to
tracer-dynamic-coverage two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation
without. The value for compilation with <br>
profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cse-path-length <br>
Maximum number of basic blocks on path that cse considers.
The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cse-insns <br>
The maximum instructions CSE process before flushing. The
default is 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ggc-min-expand <br>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory
allocation. This parameter specifies the minimum percentage
by which the garbage collector&rsquo;s heap should be
allowed <br>
to expand between collections. Tuning this may improve
compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 30% + 70% *
(RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB. If
&quot;getrlimit&quot; is available, the notion of
&quot;RAM&quot; is the smallest of actual RAM and <br>
&quot;RLIMIT_DATA&quot; or &quot;RLIMIT_AS&quot;. If GCC is
not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the
lower bound of 30% is used. Setting this parameter and
ggc-min-heapsize <br>
to zero causes a full collection to occur at every
opportunity. This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ggc-min-heapsize <br>
Minimum size of the garbage collector&rsquo;s heap before it
begins bothering to collect garbage. The first collection
occurs after the heap expands by ggc-min-expand% beyond <br>
ggc-min-heapsize. Again, tuning this may improve compilation
speed, and has no effect on code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is the smaller of
RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that tries to ensure that
RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but with a lower
bound of 4096 (four <br>
megabytes) and an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes). If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform,
the lower bound is used. Setting this parameter <br>
very large effectively disables garbage collection. Setting
this parameter and ggc-min-expand to zero causes a full
collection to occur at every opportunity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-reload-search-insns <br>
The maximum number of instruction reload should look
backward for equivalent register. Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
<br>
increase with probably slightly better performance. The
default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cselib-memory-locations <br>
The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take
into account. Increasing values mean more aggressive
optimization, making the compilation time increase with <br>
probably slightly better performance. The default value is
500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reorder-blocks-duplicate <br>
reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback <br>
Used by basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use
unconditional branch or duplicate the code on its
destination. Code is duplicated when its estimated size is
<br>
smaller than this value multiplied by the estimated size of
unconditional jump in the hot spots of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
reorder-block-duplicate-feedback is used only when profile
feedback is available and may be set to higher values than
reorder-block-duplicate since information about <br>
the hot spots is more accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-sched-ready-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the
scheduler should consider at any given time during the first
scheduling pass. Increasing values mean more <br>
thorough searches, making the compilation time increase with
probably little benefit. The default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-sched-region-blocks <br>
The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered
for interblock scheduling. The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-pipeline-region-blocks <br>
The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered
for pipelining in the selective scheduler. The default value
is 15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-sched-region-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
interblock scheduling. The default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-pipeline-region-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered for
pipelining in the selective scheduler. The default value is
200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-spec-prob <br>
The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a source
block for interblock speculative scheduling. The default
value is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-sched-extend-regions-iters
<br>
The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend
regions. 0 - disable region extension, N - do at most N
iterations. The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-sched-insn-conflict-delay
<br>
The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered for
speculative motion. The default value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched-spec-prob-cutoff <br>
The minimal probability of speculation success (in
percents), so that speculative insn will be scheduled. The
default value is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched-mem-true-dep-cost <br>
Minimal distance (in CPU cycles) between store and load
targeting same memory locations. The default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selsched-max-lookahead <br>
The maximum size of the lookahead window of selective
scheduling. It is a depth of search for available
instructions. The default value is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selsched-max-sched-times <br>
The maximum number of times that an instruction will be
scheduled during selective scheduling. This is the limit on
the number of iterations through which the <br>
instruction may be pipelined. The default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selsched-max-insns-to-rename
<br>
The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list
that are considered for renaming in the selective scheduler.
The default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sms-min-sc <br>
The minimum value of stage count that swing modulo scheduler
will generate. The default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-last-value-rtl <br>
The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be
recorded in an expression in combiner for a pseudo register
as last known value of that register. The default is <br>
10000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">integer-share-limit <br>
Small integer constants can use a shared data structure,
reducing the compiler&rsquo;s memory usage and increasing
its speed. This sets the maximum value of a shared integer
<br>
constant. The default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-virtual-mappings <br>
Specifies the minimum number of virtual mappings in the
incremental SSA updater that should be registered to trigger
the virtual mappings heuristic defined by virtual- <br>
mappings-ratio. The default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">virtual-mappings-ratio <br>
If the number of virtual mappings is virtual-mappings-ratio
bigger than the number of virtual symbols to be updated,
then the incremental SSA updater switches to a full <br>
update for those symbols. The default ratio is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssp-buffer-size <br>
The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that will receive
stack smashing protection when -fstack-protection is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This default before Ubuntu 10.10
was &quot;8&quot;. Currently it is &quot;4&quot;, to
increase the number of functions protected by the stack
protector.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts
<br>
Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs
to be duplicated when threading jumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-fields-for-field-sensitive
<br>
Maximum number of fields in a structure we will treat in a
field sensitive manner during pointer analysis. The default
is zero for -O0, and -O1 and 100 for -Os, -O2, and <br>
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefetch-latency <br>
Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed
before prefetch finishes. The distance we prefetch ahead is
proportional to this constant. Increasing this <br>
number may also lead to less streams being prefetched (see
simultaneous-prefetches).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">simultaneous-prefetches <br>
Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l1-cache-line-size <br>
The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l1-cache-size <br>
The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l2-cache-size <br>
The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio <br>
The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio
<br>
The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a
loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-canonical-types <br>
Whether the compiler should use the &quot;canonical&quot;
type system. By default, this should always be 1, which uses
a more efficient internal mechanism for comparing types in
<br>
C++ and Objective-C++. However, if bugs in the canonical
type system are causing compilation failures, set this value
to 0 to disable canonical types.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio
<br>
Switch initialization conversion will refuse to create
arrays that are bigger than
switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio times the number of
branches in the switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-partial-antic-length <br>
Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the
tree partial redundancy elimination optimization
(-ftree-pre) when optimizing at -O3 and above. For some <br>
sorts of source code the enhanced partial redundancy
elimination optimization can run away, consuming all of the
memory available on the host machine. This parameter <br>
sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior. Setting a value of 0
for this parameter will allow an unlimited set <br>
length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccvn-max-scc-size <br>
Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during
SCCVN processing. If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for
the whole function will not be done and <br>
optimizations depending on it will be disabled. The default
maximum SCC size is 10000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ira-max-loops-num <br>
IRA uses regional register allocation by default. If a
function contains more loops than the number given by this
parameter, only at most the given number of the most <br>
frequently-executed loops form regions for regional register
allocation. The default value of the parameter is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ira-max-conflict-table-size <br>
Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the
conflict table, the table can still require excessive
amounts of memory for huge functions. If the conflict <br>
table for a function could be more than the size in MB given
by this parameter, the register allocator instead uses a
faster, simpler, and lower-quality algorithm that <br>
does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.
The default value of the parameter is 2000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ira-loop-reserved-regs <br>
IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure
in loops for decisions to move loop invariants (see -O3).
The number of available registers reserved for some <br>
other purposes is given by this parameter. The default value
of the parameter is 2, which is the minimal number of
registers needed by typical instructions. This value <br>
is the best found from numerous experiments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop
<br>
Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in
compilation time and in amount of needed compile-time
memory, with very large loops. Loops with more basic blocks
<br>
than this parameter won&rsquo;t have loop invariant motion
optimization performed on them. The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for -O1 and 10000 for -O2 and above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps
<br>
Building data dapendencies is expensive for very large
loops. This parameter limits the number of data references
in loops that are considered for data dependence <br>
analysis. These large loops will not be handled then by the
optimizations using loop data dependencies. The default
value is 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-vartrack-size <br>
Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during
variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function. If this
limit is exceeded with variable tracking at <br>
assignments enabled, analysis for that function is retried
without it, after removing all debug insns from the
function. If the limit is exceeded even without debug <br>
insns, var tracking analysis is completely disabled for the
function. Setting the parameter to zero makes it
unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-vartrack-expr-depth <br>
Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to
map variable names or debug temporaries to value
expressions. This trades compilation time for more complete
<br>
debug information. If this is set too low, value expressions
that are available and could be represented in debug
information may end up not being used; setting this <br>
higher may enable the compiler to find more complex debug
expressions, but compile time and memory use may grow. The
default is 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-nondebug-insn-uid <br>
Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns. The
range below the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug
insns created by -fvar-tracking-assignments, but <br>
debug insns may get (non-overlapping) uids above it if the
reserved range is exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor <br>
IPA-SRA will replace a pointer to an aggregate with one or
more new parameters only when their cumulative size is less
or equal to ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor times the <br>
size of the original pointer parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tm-max-aggregate-size <br>
When making copies of thread-local variables in a
transaction, this parameter specifies the size in bytes
after which variables will be saved with the logging
functions <br>
as opposed to save/restore code sequence pairs. This option
only applies when using -fgnu-tm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">graphite-max-nb-scop-params <br>
To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop
transforms, the number of parameters in a Static Control
Part (SCoP) is bounded. The default value is 10 parameters.
A <br>
variable whose value is unknown at compilation time and
defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">graphite-max-bbs-per-function
<br>
To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the
size of the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded. The
default value is 100 basic blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-block-tile-size <br>
Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
-floop-block or -floop-strip-mine, strip mine each loop in
the loop nest by a given number of iterations. The <br>
strip length can be changed using the loop-block-tile-size
parameter. The default value is 51 iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-cp-value-list-size <br>
IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types
passed to a function&rsquo;s parameter in order to propagate
them and perform devirtualization. ipa-cp-value-list-size
<br>
is the maximum number of values and types it stores per one
formal parameter of a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lto-partitions <br>
Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR
compilation. The number of partitions should exceed the
number of CPUs used for compilation. The default <br>
value is 32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lto-minpartition <br>
Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated
instructions). This prevents expenses of splitting very
small programs into too many partitions.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help
<br>
The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions
when C++ name lookup fails for an identifier. The default is
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sink-frequency-threshold <br>
The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of
the target block relative to a statement&rsquo;s original
block to allow statement sinking of a statement. Larger <br>
numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking. The
default value is 75. A small positive adjustment is applied
for statements with memory operands as those are <br>
even more profitable so sink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-stores-to-sink <br>
The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be
sunk. Set to 0 if either vectorization (-ftree-vectorize) or
if-conversion (-ftree-loop-if-convert) is <br>
disabled. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-load-data-races <br>
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on loads. Set
to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0. This option is enabled by
default unless implicitly set by the -fmemory-model= <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-store-data-races <br>
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores. Set
to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0. This option is enabled by
default unless implicitly set by the <br>
-fmemory-model= option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-packed-load-data-races
<br>
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data
loads. Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0. This option is
enabled by default unless implicitly set by the <br>
-fmemory-model= option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-packed-store-data-races
<br>
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data
stores. Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0. This option is
enabled by default unless implicitly set by the <br>
-fmemory-model= option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case-values-threshold <br>
The smallest number of different values for which it is best
to use a jump-table instead of a tree of conditional
branches. If the value is 0, use the default for the <br>
machine. The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tree-reassoc-width <br>
Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel
in reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target
dependent heuristics used by default if has non zero <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling the
Preprocessor <br>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on
each C source file before actual compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the -E option,
nothing is done except preprocessing. Some of these options
make sense only together with -E because they cause the
preprocessor output to be <br>
unsuitable for actual compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wp,option <br>
You can use -Wp,option to bypass the compiler driver and
pass option directly through to the preprocessor. If option
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at <br>
the commas. However, many options are modified, translated
or interpreted by the compiler driver before being passed to
the preprocessor, and -Wp forcibly bypasses this <br>
phase. The preprocessor&rsquo;s direct interface is
undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you
should avoid using -Wp and let the driver handle the options
<br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xpreprocessor option <br>
Pass option as an option to the preprocessor. You can use
this to supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC
does not know how to recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to pass an option
that takes an argument, you must use -Xpreprocessor twice,
once for the option and once for the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name <br>
Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name=definition <br>
The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a #define
directive. In particular, the definition will be <br>
truncated by embedded newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are invoking the
preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need
to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a <br>
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to define a
function-like macro on the command line, write its argument
list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if
any). Parentheses are <br>
meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the
option. With sh and csh,
-D&rsquo;name(args...)=definition&rsquo; works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D and -U options are processed
in the order they are given on the command line. All
-imacros file and -include file options are processed after
all -D and -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U name <br>
Cancel any previous definition of name, either built in or
provided with a -D option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-undef <br>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
The standard predefined macros remain defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dir <br>
Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be
searched for header files. Directories named by -I are
searched before the standard system include directories. If
<br>
the directory dir is a standard system include directory,
the option is ignored to ensure that the default search
order for system directories and the special treatment of
<br>
system headers are not defeated . If dir begins with
&quot;=&quot;, then the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Write output to file. This is the same as specifying file as
the second non-option argument to cpp. gcc has a different
interpretation of a second non-option argument, so <br>
you must use -o to specify the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall <br>
Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for
normal code. At present this is -Wcomment, -Wtrigraphs,
-Wmultichar and a warning about integer promotion causing a
<br>
change of sign in &quot;#if&quot; expressions. Note that
many of the preprocessor&rsquo;s warnings are on by default
and have no options to control them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcomment <br>
-Wcomments <br>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in a /*
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a //
comment. (Both forms have the same effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtrigraphs <br>
Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the
program. However, a trigraph that would form an escaped
newline (??/ at the end of a line) can, by changing where
<br>
the comment begins or ends. Therefore, only trigraphs that
would form escaped newlines produce warnings inside a
comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is implied by -Wall.
If -Wall is not given, this option is still enabled unless
trigraphs are enabled. To get trigraph conversion without
warnings, but get the <br>
other -Wall warnings, use -trigraphs -Wall
-Wno-trigraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtraditional <br>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
traditional and ISO C. Also warn about ISO C constructs that
have no traditional C equivalent, and problematic <br>
constructs which should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundef <br>
Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is
encountered in an #if directive, outside of defined. Such
identifiers are replaced with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-macros <br>
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.
A macro is used if it is expanded or tested for existence at
least once. The preprocessor will also warn if the <br>
macro has not been used at the time it is redefined or
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in macros, macros defined
on the command line, and macros defined in include files are
not warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If a macro is actually
used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then CPP
will report it as unused. To avoid the warning in such a
case, you might improve the <br>
scope of the macro&rsquo;s definition by, for example,
moving it into the first skipped block. Alternatively, you
could provide a dummy use with something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if defined
the_macro_causing_the_warning <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wendif-labels <br>
Warn whenever an #else or an #endif are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if FOO <br>
... <br>
#else FOO <br>
... <br>
#endif FOO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second and third
&quot;FOO&quot; should be in comments, but often are not in
older programs. This warning is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror <br>
Make all warnings into hard errors. Source code which
triggers warnings will be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsystem-headers <br>
Issue warnings for code in system headers. These are
normally unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code,
therefore suppressed. If you are responsible for the system
<br>
library, you may want to see them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Suppress all warnings,
including those which GNU CPP issues by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic <br>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C
standard. Some of them are left out by default, since they
trigger frequently on harmless code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic-errors <br>
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory
diagnostics into errors. This includes mandatory diagnostics
that GCC issues without -pedantic but treats as <br>
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Instead of outputting the
result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make
describing the dependencies of the main source file. The
preprocessor outputs one make <br>
rule containing the object file name for that source file, a
colon, and the names of all the included files, including
those coming from -include or -imacros command line <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless specified explicitly
(with -MT or -MQ), the object file name consists of the name
of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file
suffix and with any <br>
leading directory parts removed. If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using
&minus;newline. The rule has no commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not suppress
the preprocessor&rsquo;s debug output, such as -dM. To avoid
mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you
should explicitly specify the <br>
dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment
variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT. Debug output will still
be sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing -M to the driver implies
-E, and suppresses warnings with an implicit -w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MM Like -M but do not mention
header files that are found in system header directories,
nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly,
from such a header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implies that the choice of
angle brackets or double quotes in an #include directive
does not in itself determine whether that header will appear
in -MM dependency <br>
output. This is a slight change in semantics from GCC
versions 3.0 and earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MF file <br>
When used with -M or -MM, specifies a file to write the
dependencies to. If no -MF switch is given the preprocessor
sends the rules to the same place it would have sent <br>
preprocessed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with the driver
options -MD or -MMD, -MF overrides the default dependency
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MG In conjunction with an
option such as -M requesting dependency generation, -MG
assumes missing header files are generated files and adds
them to the dependency list without <br>
raising an error. The dependency filename is taken directly
from the &quot;#include&quot; directive without prepending
any path. -MG also suppresses preprocessed output, as a
missing <br>
header file renders this useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is used in
automatic updating of makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MP This option instructs CPP to
add a phony target for each dependency other than the main
file, causing each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules
work around errors make <br>
gives if you remove header files without updating the
Makefile to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is typical output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.o: test.c test.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.h:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MT target <br>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
generation. By default CPP takes the name of the main input
file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix
<br>
such as .c, and appends the platform&rsquo;s usual object
suffix. The result is the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An -MT option will set the
target to be exactly the string you specify. If you want
multiple targets, you can specify them as a single argument
to -MT, or use multiple -MT <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -MT
&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo; might give</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MQ target <br>
Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters which are special
to Make. -MQ &rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo; gives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default target is
automatically quoted, as if it were given with -MQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MD -MD is equivalent to -M -MF
file, except that -E is not implied. The driver determines
file based on whether an -o option is given. If it is, the
driver uses its argument <br>
but with a suffix of .d, otherwise it takes the name of the
input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a .d suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -MD is used in conjunction
with -E, any -o switch is understood to specify the
dependency output file, but if used without -E, each -o is
understood to specify a target <br>
object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since -E is not implied, -MD can
be used to generate a dependency output file as a
side-effect of the compilation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MMD <br>
Like -MD except mention only user header files, not system
header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpch-deps <br>
When using precompiled headers, this flag will cause the
dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header&rsquo;s dependencies. If not specified
only the <br>
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that
were used to create it because those files are not consulted
when a precompiled header is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpch-preprocess <br>
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with
-E. It inserts a special &quot;#pragma&quot;, &quot;#pragma
GCC pch_preprocess &quot;filename&quot;&quot; in the output
to mark the place <br>
where the precompiled header was found, and its filename.
When -fpreprocessed is in use, GCC recognizes this
&quot;#pragma&quot; and loads the PCH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is off by default,
because the resulting preprocessed output is only really
suitable as input to GCC. It is switched on by
-save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should not write this
&quot;#pragma&quot; in your own code, but it is safe to edit
the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location. The filename may be absolute <br>
or it may be relative to GCC&rsquo;s current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x c <br>
-x c++ <br>
-x objective-c <br>
-x assembler-with-cpp <br>
Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or
assembly. This has nothing to do with standards conformance
or extensions; it merely selects which base syntax to <br>
expect. If you give none of these options, cpp will deduce
the language from the extension of the source file: .c, .cc,
.m, or .S. Some other common extensions for C++ and <br>
assembly are also recognized. If cpp does not recognize the
extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Previous versions of cpp
accepted a -lang option which selected both the language and
the standards conformance level. This option has been
removed, because it <br>
conflicts with the -l option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-std=standard <br>
-ansi <br>
Specify the standard to which the code should conform.
Currently CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be
added in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standard may be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;c90&quot; <br>
&quot;c89&quot; <br>
&quot;iso9899:1990&quot; <br>
The ISO C standard from 1990. c90 is the customary shorthand
for this version of the standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ansi option is equivalent
to -std=c90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;iso9899:199409&quot; <br>
The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;iso9899:1999&quot; <br>
&quot;c99&quot; <br>
&quot;iso9899:199x&quot; <br>
&quot;c9x&quot; <br>
The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.
Before publication, this was known as C9X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;iso9899:2011&quot; <br>
&quot;c11&quot; <br>
&quot;c1x&quot; <br>
The revised ISO C standard, published in December 2011.
Before publication, this was known as C1X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu90&quot; <br>
&quot;gnu89&quot; <br>
The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu99&quot; <br>
&quot;gnu9x&quot; <br>
The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu11&quot; <br>
&quot;gnu1x&quot; <br>
The 2011 C standard plus GNU extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;c++98&quot; <br>
The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;gnu++98&quot; <br>
The same as -std=c++98 plus GNU extensions. This is the
default for C++ code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I- Split the include path. Any
directories specified with -I options before -I- are
searched only for headers requested with &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not searched for <br>
&quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;. If additional directories
are specified with -I options after the -I-, those
directories are searched for all #include directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, -I- inhibits the
use of the directory of the current file directory as the
first search directory for &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot;. This option has been deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc <br>
Do not search the standard system directories for header
files. Only the directories you have specified with -I
options (and the directory of the current file, if <br>
appropriate) are searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc++ <br>
Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
directories, but do still search the other standard
directories. (This option is used when building the C++ <br>
library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include file <br>
Process file as if &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;
appeared as the first line of the primary source file.
However, the first directory searched for file is the
preprocessor&rsquo;s working <br>
directory instead of the directory containing the main
source file. If not found there, it is searched for in the
remainder of the &quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot; search
chain as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple -include options are
given, the files are included in the order they appear on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imacros file <br>
Exactly like -include, except that any output produced by
scanning file is thrown away. Macros it defines remain
defined. This allows you to acquire all the macros from a
<br>
header without also processing its declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files specified by -imacros
are processed before all files specified by -include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idirafter dir <br>
Search dir for header files, but do it after all directories
specified with -I and the standard system directories have
been exhausted. dir is treated as a system include <br>
directory. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
--sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iprefix prefix <br>
Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix
options. If the prefix represents a directory, you should
include the final /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iwithprefix dir <br>
-iwithprefixbefore dir <br>
Append dir to the prefix specified previously with -iprefix,
and add the resulting directory to the include search path.
-iwithprefixbefore puts it in the same place -I <br>
would; -iwithprefix puts it where -idirafter would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isysroot dir <br>
This option is like the --sysroot option, but applies only
to header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies
to both header files and libraries). See the <br>
--sysroot option for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imultilib dir <br>
Use dir as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isystem dir <br>
Search dir for header files, after all directories specified
by -I but before the standard system directories. Mark it as
a system directory, so that it gets the same <br>
special treatment as is applied to the standard system
directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then the
&quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
--sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iquote dir <br>
Search dir only for header files requested with
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they are not searched
for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;, before all
directories specified by -I and before the standard <br>
system directories. If dir begins with &quot;=&quot;, then
the &quot;=&quot; will be replaced by the sysroot prefix;
see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdirectives-only <br>
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option&rsquo;s behavior
depends on the -E and -fpreprocessed options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -E, preprocessing is
limited to the handling of directives such as
&quot;#define&quot;, &quot;#ifdef&quot;, and
&quot;#error&quot;. Other preprocessor operations, such as
macro expansion and <br>
trigraph conversion are not performed. In addition, the -dD
option is implicitly enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fpreprocessed,
predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is
disabled. Macros such as &quot;__LINE__&quot;, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally. <br>
This enables compilation of files previously preprocessed
with &quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With both -E and -fpreprocessed,
the rules for -fpreprocessed take precedence. This enables
full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with
&quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdollars-in-identifiers <br>
Accept $ in identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fextended-identifiers <br>
Accept universal character names in identifiers. This option
is experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be
enabled by default for C99 and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpreprocessed <br>
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already
been preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro
expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing,
<br>
and processing of most directives. The preprocessor still
recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file
preprocessed with -C to the compiler without problems. <br>
In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpreprocessed is implicit if
the input file has one of the extensions .i, .ii or .mi.
These are the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed
files created by -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftabstop=width <br>
Set the distance between tab stops. This helps the
preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or
errors, even if tabs appear on the line. If the value is
less <br>
than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored. The
default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdebug-cpp <br>
This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used with
-E, dumps debugging information about location maps. Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the <br>
map its location belongs to. The dump of the map holding the
location of a token would be:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">{&quot;P&quot;:F&lt;/file/path&gt;;&quot;F&quot;:F&lt;/includer/path&gt;;&quot;L&quot;:&lt;line_num&gt;;&quot;C&quot;:&lt;col_num&gt;;&quot;S&quot;:&lt;system_header_p&gt;;&quot;M&quot;:&lt;map_address&gt;;&quot;E&quot;:&lt;macro_expansion_p&gt;,&quot;loc&quot;:&lt;location&gt;}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used without -E, this
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]
<br>
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This
allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current
macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a
<br>
macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor
and the compiler consume more memory. The level parameter
can be used to choose the level of precision of token <br>
location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
necessary. Value 0 of level de-activates this option just as
if no -ftrack-macro-expansion was present on the <br>
command line. Value 1 tracks tokens locations in a degraded
mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument <br>
of a function-like macro have the same location. Value 2
tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most
memory hungry. When this option is given no argument, the
<br>
default parameter value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexec-charset=charset <br>
Set the execution character set, used for string and
character constants. The default is UTF-8. charset can be
any encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
&quot;iconv&quot; library <br>
routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwide-exec-charset=charset <br>
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string
and character constants. The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16,
whichever corresponds to the width of &quot;wchar_t&quot;.
As <br>
with -fexec-charset, charset can be any encoding supported
by the system&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; library routine;
however, you will have problems with encodings that do not
fit exactly in <br>
&quot;wchar_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finput-charset=charset <br>
Set the input character set, used for translation from the
character set of the input file to the source character set
used by GCC. If the locale does not specify, or GCC <br>
cannot get this information from the locale, the default is
UTF-8. This can be overridden by either the locale or this
command line option. Currently the command line <br>
option takes precedence if there&rsquo;s a conflict. charset
can be any encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fworking-directory <br>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output
that will let the compiler know the current working
directory at the time of preprocessing. When this option is
<br>
enabled, the preprocessor will emit, after the initial
linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working
directory followed by two slashes. GCC will use this <br>
directory, when it&rsquo;s present in the preprocessed
input, as the directory emitted as the current working
directory in some debugging information formats. This option
is <br>
implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but
this can be inhibited with the negated form
-fno-working-directory. If the -P flag is present in the
command <br>
line, this option has no effect, since no &quot;#line&quot;
directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-show-column <br>
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics. This may be
necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that
does not understand the column numbers, such as dejagnu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A predicate=answer <br>
Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer. This form is preferred to the older form -A
predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does
<br>
not use shell special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A -predicate=answer <br>
Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dCHARS <br>
CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following
characters, and must not be preceded by a space. Other
characters are interpreted by the compiler proper, or
reserved for <br>
future versions of GCC, and so are silently ignored. If you
specify characters whose behavior conflicts, the result is
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Instead of the normal output,
generate a list of #define directives for all the macros
defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including
predefined macros. <br>
This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in
your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file
foo.h, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will show all the predefined
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use -dM without the -E
option, -dM is interpreted as a synonym for
-fdump-rtl-mach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D Like M except in two respects:
it does not include the predefined macros, and it outputs
both the #define directives and the result of preprocessing.
Both kinds of <br>
output go to the standard output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Like D, but emit only the
macro names, not their expansions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Output #include directives in
addition to the result of preprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Like D except that only macros
that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in
preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed
until the use or test of <br>
the macro; and #undef directives are also output for macros
tested but undefined at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Inhibit generation of
linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might
be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent <br>
to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not discard comments. All
comments are passed through to the output file, except for
comments in processed directives, which are deleted along
with the directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be prepared for side
effects when using -C; it causes the preprocessor to treat
comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments
appearing at the <br>
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of
turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the
first token on the line is no longer a #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CC Do not discard comments,
including during macro expansion. This is like -C, except
that comments contained within macros are also passed
through to the output file where the <br>
macro is expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the side-effects
of the -C option, the -CC option causes all C++-style
comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments.
This is to prevent later <br>
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -CC option is generally used
to support lint comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-traditional-cpp <br>
Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C
preprocessors, as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trigraphs <br>
Process trigraph sequences. These are three-character
sequences, all starting with ??, that are defined by ISO C
to stand for single characters. For example, ??/ stands for
<br>
so &rsquo;??/n&rsquo; is a character constant for a newline.
By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them. See the -std and
-ansi options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nine trigraphs and their
replacements are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trigraph: ??( ??) ??&lt; ??&gt;
??= ??/ ??&rsquo; ??! ??- <br>
Replacement: [ ] { } # &nbsp; ^ | ~</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remap <br>
Enable special code to work around file systems which only
permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
--target-help <br>
Print text describing all the command line options instead
of preprocessing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Print out GNU
CPP&rsquo;s version number at the beginning of execution,
and report the final form of the include path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print the name of each header
file used, in addition to other normal activities. Each name
is indented to show how deep in the #include stack it is.
Precompiled header <br>
files are also printed, even if they are found to be
invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with
...x and a valid one with ...! .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
--version <br>
Print out GNU CPP&rsquo;s version number. With one dash,
proceed to preprocess as normal. With two dashes, exit
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing Options to the Assembler
<br>
You can pass options to the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wa,option <br>
Pass option as an option to the assembler. If option
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xassembler option <br>
Pass option as an option to the assembler. You can use this
to supply system-specific assembler options that GCC does
not know how to recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to pass an option
that takes an argument, you must use -Xassembler twice, once
for the option and once for the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Linking <br>
These options come into play when the compiler links object
files into an executable output file. They are meaningless
if the compiler is not doing a link step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object-file-name <br>
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix
is considered to name an object file or library. (Object
files are distinguished from libraries by the linker <br>
according to the file contents.) If linking is done, these
object files are used as input to the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
-S <br>
-E If any of these options is used, then the linker is not
run, and object file names should not be used as
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llibrary <br>
-l library <br>
Search the library named library when linking. (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only
for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It makes a difference where in
the command you write this option; the linker searches and
processes libraries and object files in the order they are
specified. Thus, foo.o <br>
-lz bar.o searches library z after file foo.o but before
bar.o. If bar.o refers to functions in z, those functions
may not be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The linker searches a standard
list of directories for the library, which is actually a
file named liblibrary.a. The linker then uses this file as
if it had been specified <br>
precisely by name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directories searched include
several standard system directories plus any that you
specify with -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the files found this
way are library files---archive files whose members are
object files. The linker handles an archive file by scanning
through it for members <br>
which define symbols that have so far been referenced but
not defined. But if the file that is found is an ordinary
object file, it is linked in the usual fashion. The only
<br>
difference between using an -l option and specifying a file
name is that -l surrounds library with lib and .a and
searches several directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lobjc <br>
You need this special case of the -l option in order to link
an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostartfiles <br>
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless
-nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodefaultlibs <br>
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking. Only
the libraries you specify will be passed to the linker,
options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such
<br>
as &quot;-static-libgcc&quot; or &quot;-shared-libgcc&quot;,
will be ignored. The standard startup files are used
normally, unless -nostartfiles is used. The compiler may
generate calls to <br>
&quot;memcmp&quot;, &quot;memset&quot;, &quot;memcpy&quot;
and &quot;memmove&quot;. These entries are usually resolved
by entries in libc. These entry points should be supplied
through some other mechanism when <br>
this option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdlib <br>
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries
when linking. No startup files and only the libraries you
specify will be passed to the linker, options specifying
<br>
linkage of the system libraries, such as
&quot;-static-libgcc&quot; or &quot;-shared-libgcc&quot;,
will be ignored. The compiler may generate calls to
&quot;memcmp&quot;, &quot;memset&quot;, &quot;memcpy&quot;
and <br>
&quot;memmove&quot;. These entries are usually resolved by
entries in libc. These entry points should be supplied
through some other mechanism when this option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the standard libraries
bypassed by -nostdlib and -nodefaultlibs is libgcc.a, a
library of internal subroutines which GCC uses to overcome
shortcomings of particular <br>
machines, or special needs for some languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, you need libgcc.a
even when you want to avoid other standard libraries. In
other words, when you specify -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs
you should usually <br>
specify -lgcc as well. This ensures that you have no
unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines.
(For example, __main, used to ensure C++ constructors will
<br>
be called.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pie <br>
Produce a position independent executable on targets that
support it. For predictable results, you must also specify
the same set of options that were used to generate code <br>
(-fpie, -fPIE, or model suboptions) when you specify this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rdynamic <br>
Pass the flag -export-dynamic to the ELF linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all
symbols, not only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table.
<br>
This option is needed for some uses of &quot;dlopen&quot; or
to allow obtaining backtraces from within a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Remove all symbol table and
relocation information from the executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static <br>
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents
linking with the shared libraries. On other systems, this
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared <br>
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
objects to form an executable. Not all systems support this
option. For predictable results, you must also <br>
specify the same set of options that were used to generate
code (-fpic, -fPIC, or model suboptions) when you specify
this option.[1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared-libgcc <br>
-static-libgcc <br>
On systems that provide libgcc as a shared library, these
options force the use of either the shared or static version
respectively. If no shared version of libgcc was built <br>
when the compiler was configured, these options have no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several situations in
which an application should use the shared libgcc instead of
the static version. The most common of these is when the
application wishes to <br>
throw and catch exceptions across different shared
libraries. In that case, each of the libraries as well as
the application itself should use the shared libgcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore, the G++ and GCJ
drivers automatically add -shared-libgcc whenever you build
a shared library or a main executable, because C++ and Java
programs typically use <br>
exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, instead, you use the GCC
driver to create shared libraries, you may find that they
will not always be linked with the shared libgcc. If GCC
finds, at its configuration <br>
time, that you have a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that
does not support option --eh-frame-hdr, it will link the
shared version of libgcc into shared libraries by default.
<br>
Otherwise, it will take advantage of the linker and optimize
away the linking with the shared version of libgcc, linking
with the static version of libgcc by default. This <br>
allows exceptions to propagate through such shared
libraries, without incurring relocation costs at library
load time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if a library or main
executable is supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you
must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate for
the languages used in the <br>
program, or using the option -shared-libgcc, such that it is
linked with the shared libgcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libstdc++ <br>
When the g++ program is used to link a C++ program, it will
normally automatically link against libstdc++. If libstdc++
is available as a shared library, and the -static <br>
option is not used, then this will link against the shared
version of libstdc++. That is normally fine. However, it is
sometimes useful to freeze the version of libstdc++ <br>
used by the program without going all the way to a fully
static link. The -static-libstdc++ option directs the g++
driver to link libstdc++ statically, without necessarily
<br>
linking other libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-symbolic <br>
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared
object. Warn about any unresolved references (unless
overridden by the link editor option -Xlinker -z -Xlinker
<br>
defs). Only a few systems support this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T script <br>
Use script as the linker script. This option is supported by
most systems using the GNU linker. On some targets, such as
bare-board targets without an operating system, the <br>
-T option may be required when linking to avoid references
to undefined symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xlinker option <br>
Pass option as an option to the linker. You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not
recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to pass an option
that takes a separate argument, you must use -Xlinker twice,
once for the option and once for the argument. For example,
to pass -assert <br>
definitions, you must write -Xlinker -assert -Xlinker
definitions. It does not work to write -Xlinker
&quot;-assert definitions&quot;, because this passes the
entire string as a <br>
single argument, which is not what the linker expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the GNU linker, it is
usually more convenient to pass arguments to linker options
using the option=value syntax than as separate arguments.
For example, you can <br>
specify -Xlinker -Map=output.map rather than -Xlinker -Map
-Xlinker output.map. Other linkers may not support this
syntax for command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wl,option <br>
Pass option as an option to the linker. If option contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas. You
can use this syntax to pass an argument to the <br>
option. For example, -Wl,-Map,output.map passes -Map
output.map to the linker. When using the GNU linker, you can
also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: In Ubuntu 8.10 and later
versions, for LDFLAGS, the option -Wl,-z,relro is used. To
disable, use -Wl,-z,norelro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u symbol <br>
Pretend the symbol symbol is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it. You can use -u multiple times
with different symbols to force loading of additional <br>
library modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Directory Search
<br>
These options specify directories to search for header
files, for libraries and for parts of the compiler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idir <br>
Add the directory dir to the head of the list of directories
to be searched for header files. This can be used to
override a system header file, substituting your own <br>
version, since these directories are searched before the
system header file directories. However, you should not use
this option to add directories that contain vendor- <br>
supplied system header files (use -isystem for that). If you
use more than one -I option, the directories are scanned in
left-to-right order; the standard system directories <br>
come after.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a standard system include
directory, or a directory specified with -isystem, is also
specified with -I, the -I option will be ignored. The
directory will still be <br>
searched but as a system directory at its normal position in
the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC&rsquo;s
procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering <br>
for the include_next directive are not inadvertently
changed. If you really need to change the search order for
system directories, use the -nostdinc and/or -isystem <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iplugindir=dir <br>
Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed by
-fplugin=name instead of -fplugin=path/name.so. This option
is not meant to be used by the user, but only passed <br>
by the driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iquotedir <br>
Add the directory dir to the head of the list of directories
to be searched for header files only for the case of
#include &quot;file&quot;; they are not searched for
#include &lt;file&gt;, <br>
otherwise just like -I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ldir <br>
Add directory dir to the list of directories to be searched
for -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bprefix <br>
This option specifies where to find the executables,
libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler driver program runs
one or more of the subprograms cpp, cc1, as and ld. It tries
prefix as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both
with and without <br>
machine/version/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each subprogram to be run,
the compiler driver first tries the -B prefix, if any. If
that name is not found, or if -B was not specified, the
driver tries two standard <br>
prefixes, /usr/lib/gcc/ and /usr/local/lib/gcc/. If neither
of those results in a file name that is found, the
unmodified program name is searched for using the
directories <br>
specified in your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler will check to see
if the path provided by the -B refers to a directory, and if
necessary it will add a directory separator character at the
end of the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B prefixes that effectively
specify directory names also apply to libraries in the
linker, because the compiler translates these options into
-L options for the linker. <br>
They also apply to includes files in the preprocessor,
because the compiler translates these options into -isystem
options for the preprocessor. In this case, the compiler
<br>
appends include to the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The runtime support file
libgcc.a can also be searched for using the -B prefix, if
needed. If it is not found there, the two standard prefixes
above are tried, and that is <br>
all. The file is left out of the link if it is not found by
those means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to specify a prefix
much like the -B prefix is to use the environment variable
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special kludge, if the path
provided by -B is [dir/]stageN/, where N is a number in the
range 0 to 9, then it will be replaced by [dir/]include.
This is to help with <br>
boot-strapping the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-specs=file <br>
Process file after the compiler reads in the standard specs
file, in order to override the defaults which the gcc driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass <br>
to cc1, cc1plus, as, ld, etc. More than one -specs=file can
be specified on the command line, and they are processed in
order, from left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sysroot=dir <br>
Use dir as the logical root directory for headers and
libraries. For example, if the compiler would normally
search for headers in /usr/include and libraries in
/usr/lib, it <br>
will instead search dir/usr/include and dir/usr/lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use both this option and
the -isysroot option, then the --sysroot option will apply
to libraries, but the -isysroot option will apply to header
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU linker (beginning with
version 2.16) has the necessary support for this option. If
your linker does not support this option, the header file
aspect of --sysroot will <br>
still work, but the library aspect will not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I- This option has been
deprecated. Please use -iquote instead for -I directories
before the -I- and remove the -I-. Any directories you
specify with -I options before the -I- <br>
option are searched only for the case of #include
&quot;file&quot;; they are not searched for #include
&lt;file&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If additional directories are
specified with -I options after the -I-, these directories
are searched for all #include directives. (Ordinarily all -I
directories are used <br>
this way.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the -I- option
inhibits the use of the current directory (where the current
input file came from) as the first search directory for
#include &quot;file&quot;. There is no <br>
way to override this effect of -I-. With -I. you can specify
searching the directory that was current when the compiler
was invoked. That is not exactly the same as what <br>
the preprocessor does by default, but it is often
satisfactory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I- does not inhibit the use of
the standard system directories for header files. Thus, -I-
and -nostdinc are independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying Target Machine and
Compiler Version <br>
The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called
gcc, or machine-gcc when cross-compiling, or
machine-gcc-version to run a version other than the one that
was installed <br>
last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hardware Models and
Configurations <br>
Each target machine types can have its own special options,
starting with -m, to choose among various hardware models or
configurations---for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating <br>
coprocessor or none. A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration,
according to the options specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some configurations of the
compiler also support additional special options, usually
for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adapteva Epiphany Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
Adapteva Epiphany:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhalf-reg-file <br>
Don&rsquo;t allocate any register in the range
&quot;r32&quot;...&quot;r63&quot;. That allows code to run
on hardware variants that lack these registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprefer-short-insn-regs <br>
Preferrentially allocate registers that allow short
instruction generation. This can result in increasesd
instruction count, so if this reduces or increases code size
might <br>
vary from case to case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=num <br>
Set the cost of branches to roughly num &quot;simple&quot;
instructions. This cost is only a heuristic and is not
guaranteed to produce consistent results across
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmove <br>
Enable the generation of conditional moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnops=num <br>
Emit num nops before every other generated instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-soft-cmpsf <br>
For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an
fsub instruction and test the flags. This is faster than a
software comparison, but can get incorrect results in the
<br>
presence of NaNs, or when two different small numbers are
compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is -msoft-cmpsf, which uses slower, but <br>
IEEE-compliant, software comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-offset=num <br>
Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack
pointer. E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in
the range sp+0...sp+7 can be used by leaf functions <br>
without stack allocation. Values other than 8 or 16 are
untested and unlikely to work. Note also that this option
changes the ABI, compiling a program with a different <br>
stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with will
generally not work. This option can be useful if you want to
evaluate if a different stack offset would give you <br>
better code, but to actually use a different stack offset to
build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate --with-stack-offset=num <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-round-nearest <br>
Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been
set to truncating. The default is -mround-nearest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls
might be beyond the offset range of the b / bl instructions,
and therefore load the function address into a <br>
register before performing a (otherwise direct) call. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshort-calls <br>
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all
direct calls are in the range of the b / bl instructions, so
use these instructions for direct calls. The default is <br>
-mlong-calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall16 <br>
Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.
This does not apply to function addresses for which
-mlong-calls semantics are in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-mode=mode <br>
Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit. This
determines the floating-point mode that is provided and
expected at function call and return time. Making this mode
<br>
match the mode you predominantly need at function start can
make your programs smaller and faster by avoiding
unnecessary mode switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode can be set to one the
following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caller <br>
Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or
restored when the function returns, and when it calls other
functions. This mode is useful for compiling libraries <br>
or other compilation units you might want to incorporate
into different programs with different prevailing FPU modes,
and the convenience of being able to use a single <br>
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any
extra mode switching that might be needed, compared with
what would be needed with a more specific choice of <br>
prevailing FPU mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncate <br>
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode. That
includes conversion from floating point to integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">round-nearest <br>
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int This is the mode used to
perform integer calculations in the FPU, e.g. integer
multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mfp-mode=caller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnosplit-lohi <br>
-mno-postinc <br>
-mno-postmodify <br>
Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting
of 32-bit loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and
generation of post-modify addresses. The defaults <br>
are msplit-lohi, -mpost-inc, and -mpost-modify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnovect-double <br>
Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode. The default is
-mvect-double, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max-vect-align=num <br>
The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types. num may be
4 or 8. The default is 8. Note that this is an ABI change,
even though many library function interfaces will <br>
be unaffected, if they don&rsquo;t use SIMD vector modes in
places where they affect size and/or alignment of relevant
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msplit-vecmove-early <br>
Split vector moves into single word moves before reload. In
theory this could give better register allocation, but so
far the reverse seems to be generally the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m1reg-reg <br>
Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes
loading small negative constants and certain bitmasks
faster. Allowable values for reg are r43 and r63, which
specify <br>
to use that register as a fixed register, and none, which
means that no register is used for this purpose. The default
is -m1reg-none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AArch64 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
AArch64 implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate big-endian code. This is the default when GCC is
configured for an aarch64_be-*-* target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgeneral-regs-only <br>
Generate code which uses only the general registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate little-endian code. This is the default when GCC is
configured for an aarch64-*-* but not an aarch64_be-*-*
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=tiny <br>
Generate code for the tiny code model. The program and its
statically defined symbols must be within 1GB of each other.
Pointers are 64 bits. Programs can be statically or <br>
dynamically linked. This model is not fully implemented and
mostly treated as &quot;small&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=small <br>
Generate code for the small code model. The program and its
statically defined symbols must be within 4GB of each other.
Pointers are 64 bits. Programs can be statically <br>
or dynamically linked. This is the default code model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=large <br>
Generate code for the large code model. This makes no
assumptions about addresses and sizes of sections. Pointers
are 64 bits. Programs can be statically linked only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstrict-align <br>
Do not assume that unaligned memory references will be
handled by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions. The former
behaviour is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=desc <br>
Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism
for dynamic accesses of TLS variables. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=traditional <br>
Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism
for dynamic accesses of TLS variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=name <br>
Specify the name of the target architecture, optionally
suffixed by one or more feature modifiers. This option has
the form -march=arch{+[no]feature}*, where the only value
<br>
for arch is armv8-a. The possible values for feature are
documented in the sub-section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where conflicting feature
modifiers are specified, the right-most feature is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC uses this name to determine
what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code. This option can be used in conjunction with
or instead of the -mcpu= <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Specify the name of the target processor, optionally
suffixed by one or more feature modifiers. This option has
the form -mcpu=cpu{+[no]feature}*, where the possible values
<br>
for cpu are generic, large. The possible values for feature
are documented in the sub-section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where conflicting feature
modifiers are specified, the right-most feature is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC uses this name to determine
what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=name <br>
Specify the name of the processor to tune the performance
for. The code will be tuned as if the target processor were
of the type specified in this option, but still using <br>
instructions compatible with the target processor specified
by a -mcpu= option. This option cannot be suffixed by
feature modifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march and -mcpu feature
modifiers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature modifiers used with
-march and -mcpu can be one the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crypto <br>
Enable Crypto extension. This implies Advanced SIMD is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fp Enable floating-point
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">simd <br>
Enable Advanced SIMD instructions. This implies
floating-point instructions are enabled. This is the default
for all current possible values for options -march and
-mcpu=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARM Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) architectures:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=name <br>
Generate code for the specified ABI. Permissible values are:
apcs-gnu, atpcs, aapcs, aapcs-linux and iwmmxt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapcs-frame <br>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM
Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even if this is
not strictly necessary for correct execution of the code.
<br>
Specifying -fomit-frame-pointer with this option will cause
the stack frames not to be generated for leaf functions. The
default is -mno-apcs-frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapcs <br>
This is a synonym for -mapcs-frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthumb-interwork <br>
Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and
Thumb instruction sets. Without this option, on pre-v5
architectures, the two instruction sets cannot be reliably
<br>
used inside one program. The default is
-mno-thumb-interwork, since slightly larger code is
generated when -mthumb-interwork is specified. In AAPCS
configurations this <br>
option is meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-prolog <br>
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function
prologue, or the merging of those instruction with the
instructions in the function&rsquo;s body. This means that
all <br>
functions will start with a recognizable set of instructions
(or in fact one of a choice from a small set of different
function prologues), and this information can be used <br>
to locate the start if functions inside an executable piece
of code. The default is -msched-prolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat-abi=name <br>
Specifies which floating-point ABI to use. Permissible
values are: soft, softfp and hard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying soft causes GCC to
generate output containing library calls for floating-point
operations. softfp allows the generation of code using
hardware floating-point <br>
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling
conventions. hard allows generation of floating-point
instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default depends on the
specific target configuration. Note that the hard-float and
soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile
your entire program with the <br>
same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.
This is the default for all standard configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode;
the default is to compile code for a little-endian
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwords-little-endian <br>
This option only applies when generating code for big-endian
processors. Generate code for a little-endian word order but
a big-endian byte order. That is, a byte order of <br>
the form 32107654. Note: this option should only be used if
you require compatibility with code for big-endian ARM
processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
<br>
2.8. This option is now deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=name <br>
This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture. GCC
uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can
emit when generating assembly code. This option can <br>
be used in conjunction with or instead of the -mcpu= option.
Permissible names are: armv2, armv2a, armv3, armv3m, armv4,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=name <br>
This option specifies the name of the target ARM processor

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=generic-arch specifies
that GCC should tune the performance for a blend of
processors within architecture arch. The aim is to generate
code that run well on the <br>
current most popular processors, balancing between
optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the range, and
avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs. The effects of
this <br>
option may change in future GCC versions as CPU models come
and go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=native causes the
compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the build computer. At
present, this feature is only supported on Linux, and not
all architectures are <br>
recognized. If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the option
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
This specifies the name of the target ARM processor. GCC
uses this name to derive the name of the target ARM
architecture (as if specified by -march) and the ARM
processor <br>
type for which to tune for performance (as if specified by
-mtune). Where this option is used in conjunction with
-march or -mtune, those options take precedence over the
<br>
appropriate part of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissible names for this
option are the same as those for -mtune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=generic-arch is also
permissible, and is equivalent to -march=arch
-mtune=generic-arch. See -mtune for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=native causes the compiler
to auto-detect the CPU of the build computer. At present,
this feature is only supported on Linux, and not all
architectures are recognized. <br>
If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the option has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu=name <br>
-mfpe=number <br>
-mfp=number <br>
This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware
emulation) is available on the target. Permissible names
are: fpa, fpe2, fpe3, maverick, vfp, vfpv3, vfpv3-fp16, <br>
vfpv3-d16, vfpv3-d16-fp16, vfpv3xd, vfpv3xd-fp16, neon,
neon-fp16, vfpv4, vfpv4-d16, fpv4-sp-d16 and neon-vfpv4.
-mfp and -mfpe are synonyms for -mfpu=fpenumber, for <br>
compatibility with older versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -msoft-float is specified
this specifies the format of floating-point values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the selected floating-point
hardware includes the NEON extension (e.g. -mfpu=neon), note
that floating-point operations will not be used by
GCC&rsquo;s auto-vectorization pass <br>
unless -funsafe-math-optimizations is also specified. This
is because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE
754 standard for floating-point arithmetic (in <br>
particular denormal values are treated as zero), so the use
of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp16-format=name <br>
Specify the format of the &quot;__fp16&quot; half-precision
floating-point type. Permissible names are none, ieee, and
alternative; the default is none, in which case the
&quot;__fp16&quot; <br>
type is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstructure-size-boundary=n <br>
The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to
a multiple of the number of bits set by this option.
Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64. The default value <br>
varies for different toolchains. For the COFF targeted
toolchain the default value is 8. A value of 64 is only
allowed if the underlying ABI supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying the larger number can
produce faster, more efficient code, but can also increase
the size of the program. Different values are potentially
incompatible. Code <br>
compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to work
with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they
exchange information using structures or unions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabort-on-noreturn <br>
Generate a call to the function &quot;abort&quot; at the end
of a &quot;noreturn&quot; function. It will be executed if
the function tries to return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first
loading the address of the function into a register and then
performing a subroutine call on this register. This switch
<br>
is needed if the target function will lie outside of the 64
megabyte addressing range of the offset based version of
subroutine call instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if this switch is enabled,
not all function calls will be turned into long calls. The
heuristic is that static functions, functions that have the
short-call attribute, <br>
functions that are inside the scope of a #pragma
no_long_calls directive and functions whose definitions have
already been compiled within the current compilation unit,
will <br>
not be turned into long calls. The exception to this rule is
that weak function definitions, functions with the long-call
attribute or the section attribute, and functions <br>
that are within the scope of a #pragma long_calls directive,
will always be turned into long calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is not enabled by
default. Specifying -mno-long-calls will restore the default
behavior, as will placing the function calls within the
scope of a #pragma <br>
long_calls_off directive. Note these switches have no effect
on how the compiler generates code to handle function calls
via function pointers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-pic-base <br>
Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only,
rather than loading it in the prologue for each function.
The runtime system is responsible for initializing this <br>
register with an appropriate value before execution
begins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpic-register=reg <br>
Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing. The
default is R10 unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcirrus-fix-invalid-insns <br>
Insert NOPs into the instruction stream to in order to work
around problems with invalid Maverick instruction
combinations. This option is only valid if the -mcpu=ep9312
<br>
option has been used to enable generation of instructions
for the Cirrus Maverick floating-point co-processor. This
option is not enabled by default, since the problem is <br>
only present in older Maverick implementations. The default
can be re-enabled by use of the
-mno-cirrus-fix-invalid-insns switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpoke-function-name <br>
Write the name of each function into the text section,
directly preceding the function prologue. The generated code
is similar to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t0 <br>
.ascii &quot;arm_poke_function_name&quot;, 0 <br>
.align <br>
t1 <br>
.word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0) <br>
arm_poke_function_name <br>
mov ip, sp <br>
stmfd sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc} <br>
sub fp, ip, #4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing a stack
backtrace, code can inspect the value of &quot;pc&quot;
stored at &quot;fp + 0&quot;. If the trace function then
looks at location &quot;pc - 12&quot; and the top 8 bits are
set, <br>
then we know that there is a function name embedded
immediately preceding this location and has length
&quot;((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthumb <br>
-marm <br>
Select between generating code that executes in ARM and
Thumb states. The default for most configurations is to
generate code that executes in ARM state, but the default
can <br>
be changed by configuring GCC with the --with-mode=state
configure option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtpcs-frame <br>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb
Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf functions. (A leaf
function is one that does not call any other functions.)
<br>
The default is -mno-tpcs-frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtpcs-leaf-frame <br>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb
Procedure Call Standard for all leaf functions. (A leaf
function is one that does not call any other functions.) The
<br>
default is -mno-apcs-leaf-frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcallee-super-interworking <br>
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being
compiled an ARM instruction set header which switches to
Thumb mode before executing the rest of the function. This
<br>
allows these functions to be called from non-interworking
code. This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcaller-super-interworking <br>
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual
functions) to execute correctly regardless of whether the
target code has been compiled for interworking or not. There
<br>
is a small overhead in the cost of executing a function
pointer if this option is enabled. This option is not valid
in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled <br>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtp=name <br>
Specify the access model for the thread local storage
pointer. The valid models are soft, which generates calls to
&quot;__aeabi_read_tp&quot;, cp15, which fetches the thread
pointer <br>
from &quot;cp15&quot; directly (supported in the arm6k
architecture), and auto, which uses the best available
method for the selected processor. The default setting is
auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=dialect <br>
Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local
storage. Two dialects are supported --- gnu and gnu2. The
gnu dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting
<br>
local and global dynamic TLS models. The gnu2 dialect
selects the GNU descriptor scheme, which provides better
performance for shared libraries. The GNU descriptor scheme
<br>
is compatible with the original scheme, but does require new
assembler, linker and library support. Initial and local
exec TLS models are unaffected by this option and <br>
always use the original scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mword-relocations <br>
Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values
(i.e. R_ARM_ABS32). This is enabled by default on targets
(uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime loader imposes this
<br>
restriction, and when -fpic or -fPIC is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd <br>
Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when
&quot;ldrd&quot; instructions with overlapping destination
and base registers are used. This option avoids generating
these <br>
instructions. This option is enabled by default when
-mcpu=cortex-m3 is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munaligned-access <br>
-mno-unaligned-access <br>
Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit
values from addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned.
By default unaligned access is disabled for all <br>
pre-ARMv6 and all ARMv6-M architectures, and enabled for all
other architectures. If unaligned access is not enabled then
words in packed data structures will be accessed a <br>
byte at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ARM attribute
&quot;Tag_CPU_unaligned_access&quot; will be set in the
generated object file to either true or false, depending
upon the setting of this option. If unaligned access <br>
is enabled then the preprocessor symbol
&quot;__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED&quot; will also be
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mneon-for-64bits <br>
Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations. This
is disabled by default since the cost of moving data from
core registers to Neon is high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVR Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmcu=mcu <br>
Specify Atmel AVR instruction set architectures (ISA) or MCU
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for this option
is@tie{}&quot;avr2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC supports the following AVR

Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release

in function prologue/epilogue. Without this option, <br>
outgoing arguments are pushed before calling a function and
popped afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popping the arguments after the

Functions prologues/epilogues are expanded as calls to

Assume &quot;int&quot; to be 8-bit integer. This affects the

results in smaller code size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-interrupts <br>
Generated code is not compatible with hardware interrupts.
Code size is smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Try to replace &quot;CALL&quot; resp. &quot;JMP&quot;
instruction by the shorter &quot;RCALL&quot; resp.
&quot;RJMP&quot; instruction if applicable. Setting
&quot;-mrelax&quot; just adds the &quot;--relax&quot; option
to the linker <br>
command line when the linker is called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jump relaxing is performed by
the linker because jump offsets are not known before code is
located. Therefore, the assembler code generated by the
compiler is the same, but <br>
the instructions in the executable may differ from
instructions in the assembler code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relaxing must be turned on if
linker stubs are needed, see the section on &quot;EIND&quot;
and linker stubs below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshort-calls <br>
This option has been deprecated and will be removed in GCC
4.8. See &quot;-mrelax&quot; for a replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use
&quot;RCALL&quot;/&quot;RJMP&quot; instructions even on

devices that have the &quot;CALL&quot; and &quot;JMP&quot;
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msp8 <br>
Treat the stack pointer register as an 8-bit register, i.e.
assume the high byte of the stack pointer is zero. In
general, you don&rsquo;t need to set this option by
hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is used internally
by the compiler to select and build multilibs for
architectures &quot;avr2&quot; and &quot;avr25&quot;. These
architectures mix devices with and without &quot;SPH&quot;.
<br>
For any setting other than &quot;-mmcu=avr2&quot; or
&quot;-mmcu=avr25&quot; the compiler driver will add or
remove this option from the compiler proper&rsquo;s command
line, because the compiler then <br>
knows if the device or architecture has an 8-bit stack
pointer and thus no &quot;SPH&quot; register or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstrict-X <br>
Use address register &quot;X&quot; in a way proposed by the
hardware. This means that &quot;X&quot; is only used in
indirect, post-increment or pre-decrement addressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, the
&quot;X&quot; register may be used in the same way as
&quot;Y&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; which then is emulated by
additional instructions. For example, loading a value with
<br>
&quot;X+const&quot; addressing with a small non-negative
&quot;const &lt; 64&quot; to a register Rn is performed
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adiw r26, const ; X += const

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;EIND&quot; and Devices
with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pointers in the implementation
are 16@tie{}bits wide. The address of a function or label is
represented as word address so that indirect jumps and calls
can target any code <br>
address in the range of 64@tie{}Ki words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to facilitate indirect
jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki bytes of program
memory space, there is a special function register called
&quot;EIND&quot; that serves as most <br>
significant part of the target address when
&quot;EICALL&quot; or &quot;EIJMP&quot; instructions are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indirect jumps and calls on
these devices are handled as follows by the compiler and are
subject to some limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The compiler
never sets &quot;EIND&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The compiler
uses &quot;EIND&quot; implicitely in
&quot;EICALL&quot;/&quot;EIJMP&quot; instructions or might
read &quot;EIND&quot; directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a &quot;RET&quot;
instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The compiler
assumes that &quot;EIND&quot; never changes during the
startup code or during the application. In particular,
&quot;EIND&quot; is not saved/restored in function or
interrupt service <br>
routine prologue/epilogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For indirect
calls to functions and computed goto, the linker generates
stubs. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
trampolines. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to <br>
such a stub. The stub contains a direct jump to the desired
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Linker
relaxation must be turned on so that the linker will
generate the stubs correctly an all situaltion. See the
compiler option &quot;-mrelax&quot; and the linler option
&quot;--relax&quot;. <br>
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to
generate stubs but aborts without relaxation and without a
helpful error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The default
linker script is arranged for code with &quot;EIND =
0&quot;. If code is supposed to work for a setup with
&quot;EIND != 0&quot;, a custom linker script has to be used
in order to <br>
place the sections whose name start with
&quot;.trampolines&quot; into the segment where
&quot;EIND&quot; points to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The startup code
from libgcc never sets &quot;EIND&quot;. Notice that startup
code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC. For the
impact of AVR-LibC on &quot;EIND&quot;, see the AVR- <br>
LibC user manual
(&quot;http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is legitimate
for user-specific startup code to set up &quot;EIND&quot;
early, for example by means of initialization code located
in section &quot;.init3&quot;. Such code runs prior to <br>
general startup code that initializes RAM and calls
constructors, but after the bit of startup code from
AVR-LibC that sets &quot;EIND&quot; to the segment where the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of the
&quot;RAMPD&quot;, &quot;RAMPX&quot;, &quot;RAMPY&quot; and
&quot;RAMPZ&quot; Special Function Registers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some AVR devices support
memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range that can be
accessed with 16-bit pointers. To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the <br>
contentent of a &quot;RAMP&quot; register is used as high
part of the address: The &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;,
&quot;Z&quot; address register is concatenated with the
&quot;RAMPX&quot;, &quot;RAMPY&quot;, &quot;RAMPZ&quot;
special function <br>
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
&quot;RAMPD&quot; is used together with direct
addressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The startup code
initializes the &quot;RAMP&quot; special function registers
with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a AVR Named
Address Spaces,named address space other than generic or
&quot;__flash&quot; is used, then &quot;RAMPZ&quot; is set
as needed before the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the device
supports RAM larger than 64@tie{KiB} and the compiler needs
to change &quot;RAMPZ&quot; to accomplish an operation,
&quot;RAMPZ&quot; is reset to zero after the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the device
comes with a specific &quot;RAMP&quot; register, the ISR
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it
with zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) <br>
use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; RAM larger than
64@tie{KiB} is not supported by GCC for AVR targets. If you
use inline assembler to read from locations outside the
16-bit address range and change one of <br>
the &quot;RAMP&quot; registers, you must reset it to zero
after the access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVR Built-in Macros</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines several built-in
macros so that the user code can test for the presence or
absence of features. Almost any of the following built-in
macros are deduced from device <br>
capabilities and thus triggered by the &quot;-mmcu=&quot;
command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For even more AVR-specific
built-in macros see AVR Named Address Spaces and AVR
Built-in Functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_ARCH__&quot; <br>
Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that
identifies the architecture and depends on the
&quot;-mmcu=mcu&quot; option. Possible values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2, 25, 3, 31, 35, 4, 5, 51, 6,
102, 104, 105, 106, 107</p>

&quot;avrxmega4&quot;, &quot;avrxmega5&quot;,
&quot;avrxmega6&quot;, &quot;avrxmega7&quot;, respectively.
If mcu <br>
specifies a device, this built-in macro is set accordingly.
For example, with &quot;-mmcu=atmega8&quot; the macro will
be defined to 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_Device__&quot; <br>
Setting &quot;-mmcu=device&quot; defines this built-in macro
which reflects the device&rsquo;s name. For example,
&quot;-mmcu=atmega8&quot; defines the built-in macro
&quot;__AVR_ATmega8__&quot;, <br>
&quot;-mmcu=attiny261a&quot; defines
&quot;__AVR_ATtiny261A__&quot;, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The built-in macros&rsquo; names
follow the scheme &quot;__AVR_Device__&quot; where Device is
the device name as from the AVR user manual. The difference
between Device in the built-in macro <br>
and device in &quot;-mmcu=device&quot; is that the latter is
always lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If device is not a device but
only a core architecture like &quot;avr51&quot;, this macro
will not be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_XMEGA__&quot; <br>
The device/architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_ELPM__&quot;

The device has the the &quot;ELPM&quot; instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_ELPMX__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;ELPM Rn,Z&quot; and &quot;ELPM
Rn,Z+&quot; instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_MOVW__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;MOVW&quot; instruction to perform
16-bit register-register moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_LPMX__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;LPM Rn,Z&quot; and &quot;LPM
Rn,Z+&quot; instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_MUL__&quot;
<br>
The device has a hardware multiplier.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;JMP&quot; and &quot;CALL&quot;
instructions. This is the case for devices with at least
16@tie{}KiB of program memory and if
&quot;-mshort-calls&quot; is not set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_EIJMP_EICALL__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_3_BYTE_PC__&quot; <br>
The device has the &quot;EIJMP&quot; and &quot;EICALL&quot;
instructions. This is the case for devices with more than
128@tie{}KiB of program memory. This also means that the
program counter <br>
(PC) is 3@tie{}bytes wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_2_BYTE_PC__&quot;
<br>
The program counter (PC) is 2@tie{}bytes wide. This is the
case for devices with up to 128@tie{}KiB of program
memory.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_8BIT_SP__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_16BIT_SP__&quot; <br>
The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit
respectively 16-bit register by the compiler. The definition
of these macros is affected by &quot;-mtiny-stack&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_SPH__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_SP8__&quot; <br>
The device has the SPH (high part of stack pointer) special
function register or has an 8-bit stack pointer,
respectively. The definition of these macros is affected by
<br>
&quot;-mmcu=&quot; and in the cases of
&quot;-mmcu=avr2&quot; and &quot;-mmcu=avr25&quot; also by
&quot;-msp8&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPD__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPX__&quot; <br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPY__&quot; <br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPZ__&quot; <br>
The device has the &quot;RAMPD&quot;, &quot;RAMPX&quot;,
&quot;RAMPY&quot;, &quot;RAMPZ&quot; special function
register, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__NO_INTERRUPTS__&quot;
<br>
This macro reflects the &quot;-mno-interrupts&quot; command
line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP_JMP_CALL__&quot; <br>
Some AVR devices (AT90S8515, ATmega103) must not skip 32-bit
instructions because of a hardware erratum. Skip
instructions are &quot;SBRS&quot;, &quot;SBRC&quot;,
&quot;SBIS&quot;, &quot;SBIC&quot; and &quot;CPSE&quot;.
<br>
The second macro is only defined if
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__&quot; is also set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_SFR_OFFSET__=offset&quot;
<br>
Instructions that can address I/O special function registers
directly like &quot;IN&quot;, &quot;OUT&quot;,
&quot;SBI&quot;, etc. may use a different address as if
addressed by an instruction to access <br>
RAM like &quot;LD&quot; or &quot;STS&quot;. This offset
depends on the device architecture and has to be subtracted
from the RAM address in order to get the respective
I/O@tie{}address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__WITH_AVRLIBC__&quot;
<br>
The compiler is configured to be used together with
AVR-Libc. See the &quot;--with-avrlibc&quot; configure
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackfin Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu[-sirevision] <br>
Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.
Currently, cpu can be one of bf512, bf514, bf516, bf518,
bf522, bf523, bf524, bf525, bf526, bf527, bf531, bf532,

bf548, bf549, bf542m, bf544m, bf547m, bf548m, bf549m, bf561,
bf592. The optional sirevision specifies the silicon <br>
revision of the target Blackfin processor. Any workarounds
available for the targeted silicon revision will be enabled.
If sirevision is none, no workarounds are enabled. <br>
If sirevision is any, all workarounds for the targeted
processor will be enabled. The
&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; macro is defined to two
hexadecimal digits representing the <br>
major and minor numbers in the silicon revision. If
sirevision is none, the &quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; is
not defined. If sirevision is any, the
&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; is <br>
defined to be 0xffff. If this optional sirevision is not
used, GCC assumes the latest known silicon revision of the
targeted Blackfin processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for bf561 is incomplete.
For bf561, Only the processor macro is defined. Without this
option, bf532 is used as the processor by default. The
corresponding <br>
predefined processor macros for cpu is to be defined. And
for bfin-elf toolchain, this causes the hardware BSP
provided by libgloss to be linked in if -msim is not
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
This causes the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be
linked in. This option has effect only for bfin-elf <br>
toolchain. Certain other options, such as
-mid-shared-library and -mfdpic, imply -msim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf
functions. This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available
<br>
in leaf functions. The option -fomit-frame-pointer removes
the frame pointer for all functions, which might make
debugging harder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspecld-anomaly <br>
When enabled, the compiler will ensure that the generated
code does not contain speculative loads after jump
instructions. If this option is used, <br>
&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-specld-anomaly <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate extra code to prevent speculative loads
from occurring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcsync-anomaly <br>
When enabled, the compiler will ensure that the generated
code does not contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon
after conditional branches. If this option is used, <br>
&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-csync-anomaly <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC
instructions from occurring too soon after a conditional
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlow-64k <br>
When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the
knowledge that the entire program fits into the low 64k of
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-low-64k <br>
Assume that the program is arbitrarily large. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-check-l1 <br>
Do stack checking using information placed into L1
scratchpad memory by the uClinux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mid-shared-library <br>
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
ID method. This allows for execute in place and shared
libraries in an environment without virtual memory <br>
management. This option implies -fPIC. With a bfin-elf
target, this option implies -msim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-id-shared-library <br>
Generate code that doesn&rsquo;t assume ID based shared
libraries are being used. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mleaf-id-shared-library <br>
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
ID method, but assumes that this library or executable
won&rsquo;t link against any other ID shared libraries. That
<br>
allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps and
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-leaf-id-shared-library <br>
Do not assume that the code being compiled won&rsquo;t link
against any ID shared libraries. Slower code will be
generated for jump and call insns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared-library-id=n <br>
Specified the identification number of the ID based shared
library being compiled. Specifying a value of 0 will
generate more compact code, specifying other values will
<br>
force the allocation of that number to the current library
but is no more space or time efficient than omitting this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msep-data <br>
Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in
a different area of memory from the text segment. This
allows for execute in place in an environment without <br>
virtual memory management by eliminating relocations against
the text section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sep-data <br>
Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the
text segment. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first
loading the address of the function into a register and then
performing a subroutine call on this register. This switch
<br>
is needed if the target function lies outside of the 24-bit
addressing range of the offset-based version of subroutine
call instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is not enabled by
default. Specifying -mno-long-calls will restore the default
behavior. Note these switches have no effect on how the
compiler generates code <br>
to handle function calls via function pointers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfast-fp <br>
Link with the fast floating-point library. This library
relaxes some of the IEEE floating-point standard&rsquo;s
rules for checking inputs against Not-a-Number (NAN), in the
<br>
interest of performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-plt <br>
Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to
functions that are not known to bind locally. It has no
effect without -mfdpic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmulticore <br>
Build standalone application for multicore Blackfin
processor. Proper start files and link scripts will be used
to support multicore. This option defines
&quot;__BFIN_MULTICORE&quot;. <br>
It can only be used with -mcpu=bf561[-sirevision]. It can be
used with -mcorea or -mcoreb. If it&rsquo;s used without
-mcorea or -mcoreb, single application/dual core programming
<br>
model is used. In this model, the main function of Core B
should be named as coreb_main. If it&rsquo;s used with
-mcorea or -mcoreb, one application per core programming
model is <br>
used. If this option is not used, single core application
programming model is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcorea <br>
Build standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using
one application per core programming model. Proper start
files and link scripts will be used to support Core A. <br>
This option defines &quot;__BFIN_COREA&quot;. It must be
used with -mmulticore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcoreb <br>
Build standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using
one application per core programming model. Proper start
files and link scripts will be used to support Core B. <br>
This option defines &quot;__BFIN_COREB&quot;. When this
option is used, coreb_main should be used instead of main.
It must be used with -mmulticore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdram <br>
Build standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files
and link scripts will be used to put the application into
SDRAM. Loader should initialize SDRAM before loading the
<br>
application into SDRAM. This option defines
&quot;__BFIN_SDRAM&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-micplb <br>
Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time. This has an
effect on certain anomaly workarounds. For Linux targets,
the default is to assume ICPLBs are enabled; for <br>
standalone applications the default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C6X Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=name <br>
This specifies the name of the target architecture. GCC uses
this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit
when generating assembly code. Permissible names <br>
are: c62x, c64x, c64x+, c67x, c67x+, c674x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a big-endian target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate code for a little-endian target. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=default <br>
Put small global and static data in the .neardata section,
which is pointed to by register &quot;B14&quot;. Put small
uninitialized global and static data in the .bss section,
which <br>
is adjacent to the .neardata section. Put small read-only
data into the .rodata section. The corresponding sections
used for large pieces of data are .fardata, .far and <br>
.const.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=all <br>
Put all data, not just small objets, into the sections
reserved for small data, and use addressing relative to the
&quot;B14&quot; register to access them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=none <br>
Make no use of the sections reserved for small data, and use
absolute addresses to access all data. Put all initialized
global and static data in the .fardata section, and <br>
all uninitialized data in the .far section. Put all constant
data into the .const section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRIS Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the CRIS ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=architecture-type <br>
-mcpu=architecture-type <br>
Generate code for the specified architecture. The choices
for architecture-type are v3, v8 and v10 for respectively
ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX. Default is v0 <br>
except for cris-axis-linux-gnu, where the default is
v10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=architecture-type <br>
Tune to architecture-type everything applicable about the
generated code, except for the ABI and the set of available
instructions. The choices for architecture-type are the <br>
same as for -march=architecture-type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmax-stack-frame=n <br>
Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds n bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-metrax4 <br>
-metrax100 <br>
The options -metrax4 and -metrax100 are synonyms for
-march=v3 and -march=v8 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmul-bug-workaround <br>
-mno-mul-bug-workaround <br>
Work around a bug in the &quot;muls&quot; and
&quot;mulu&quot; instructions for CPU models where it
applies. This option is active by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpdebug <br>
Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in
the assembly code. This option also has the effect to turn
off the #NO_APP formatted-code indicator to the <br>
assembler at the beginning of the assembly file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcc-init <br>
Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction;
always emit compare and test instructions before use of
condition codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-side-effects <br>
Do not emit instructions with side-effects in addressing
modes other than post-increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-align <br>
-mno-stack-align <br>
-mdata-align <br>
-mno-data-align <br>
-mconst-align <br>
-mno-const-align <br>
These options (no-options) arranges (eliminate arrangements)
for the stack-frame, individual data and constants to be
aligned for the maximum single data access size for the <br>
chosen CPU model. The default is to arrange for 32-bit
alignment. ABI details such as structure layout are not
affected by these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32-bit <br>
-m16-bit <br>
-m8-bit <br>
Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above,
these options arrange for stack-frame, writable data and
constants to all be 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit aligned. The
<br>
default is 32-bit alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-prologue-epilogue <br>
-mprologue-epilogue <br>
With -mno-prologue-epilogue, the normal function prologue
and epilogue which set up the stack frame are omitted and no
return instructions or return sequences are generated <br>
in the code. Use this option only together with visual
inspection of the compiled code: no warnings or errors are
generated when call-saved registers must be saved, or <br>
storage for local variable needs to be allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-gotplt <br>
-mgotplt <br>
With -fpic and -fPIC, don&rsquo;t generate (do generate)
instruction sequences that load addresses for functions from
the PLT part of the GOT rather than (traditional on other
<br>
architectures) calls to the PLT. The default is
-mgotplt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-melf <br>
Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf
and cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlinux <br>
Legacy no-op option only recognized with the
cris-axis-linux-gnu target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sim <br>
This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf arranges to
link with input-output functions from a simulator library.
Code, initialized data and zero-initialized data are <br>
allocated consecutively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sim2 <br>
Like -sim, but pass linker options to locate initialized
data at 0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at
0x80000000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CR16 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the CR16 ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmac <br>
Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcr16cplus <br>
-mcr16c <br>
Generate code for CR16C or CR16C+ architecture. CR16C+
architecture is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Links the library libsim.a which is in compatible with
simulator. Applicable to elf compiler only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint32 <br>
Choose integer type as 32-bit wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbit-ops <br>
Generates sbit/cbit instructions for bit manipulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdata-model=model <br>
Choose a data model. The choices for model are near, far or
medium. medium is default. However, far is not valid when
-mcr16c option is chosen as CR16C architecture does not <br>
support far data model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darwin Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
all architectures running the Darwin operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FSF GCC on Darwin does not
create &quot;fat&quot; object files; it will create an
object file for the single architecture that it was built to
target. Apple&rsquo;s GCC on Darwin does create <br>
&quot;fat&quot; files if multiple -arch options are used; it
does so by running the compiler or linker multiple times and
joining the results together with lipo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The subtype of the file created
(like ppc7400 or ppc970 or i686) is determined by the flags
that specify the ISA that GCC is targetting, like -mcpu or
-march. The <br>
-force_cpusubtype_ALL option can be used to override
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Darwin tools vary in their
behavior when presented with an ISA mismatch. The assembler,
as, will only permit instructions to be used that are valid
for the subtype of the <br>
file it is generating, so you cannot put 64-bit instructions
in a ppc750 object file. The linker for shared libraries,
/usr/bin/libtool, will fail and print an error if asked to
<br>
create a shared library with a less restrictive subtype than
its input files (for instance, trying to put a ppc970 object
file in a ppc7400 library). The linker for executables, <br>
ld, will quietly give the executable the most restrictive
subtype of any of its input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fdir <br>
Add the framework directory dir to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files. These
directories are interleaved with those specified by -I
options <br>
and are scanned in a left-to-right order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A framework directory is a
directory with frameworks in it. A framework is a directory
with a &quot;Headers&quot; and/or &quot;PrivateHeaders&quot;
directory contained directly in it that ends <br>
in &quot;.framework&quot;. The name of a framework is the
name of this directory excluding the &quot;.framework&quot;.
Headers associated with the framework are found in one of
those two <br>
directories, with &quot;Headers&quot; being searched first.
A subframework is a framework directory that is in a
framework&rsquo;s &quot;Frameworks&quot; directory. Includes
of subframework headers <br>
can only appear in a header of a framework that contains the
subframework, or in a sibling subframework header. Two
subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same <br>
framework. A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework, a warning will be issued if this is violated.
Currently a subframework cannot have subframeworks, in <br>
the future, the mechanism may be extended to support this.
The standard frameworks can be found in
&quot;/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; and
&quot;/Library/Frameworks&quot;. An example <br>
include looks like &quot;#include
&lt;Framework/header.h&gt;&quot;, where Framework denotes
the name of the framework and header.h is found in the
&quot;PrivateHeaders&quot; or &quot;Headers&quot;
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iframeworkdir <br>
Like -F except the directory is a treated as a system
directory. The main difference between this -iframework and
-F is that with -iframework the compiler does not warn <br>
about constructs contained within header files found via
dir. This option is valid only for the C family of
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gused <br>
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used. For
STABS debugging format, this enables
-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols. This is by default ON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gfull <br>
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmacosx-version-min=version
<br>
The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will
run on is version. Typical values of version include 10.1,
10.2, and 10.3.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the compiler was built to use
the system&rsquo;s headers by default, then the default for
this option is the system version on which the compiler is
running, otherwise the <br>
default is to make choices that are compatible with as many
systems and code bases as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mkernel <br>
Enable kernel development mode. The -mkernel option sets
-static, -fno-common, -fno-cxa-atexit, -fno-exceptions,
-fno-non-call-exceptions, -fapple-kext, -fno-weak and <br>
-fno-rtti where applicable. This mode also sets
-mno-altivec, -msoft-float, -fno-builtin and -mlong-branch
for PowerPC targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mone-byte-bool <br>
Override the defaults for bool so that sizeof(bool)==1. By
default sizeof(bool) is 4 when compiling for Darwin/PowerPC
and 1 when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option <br>
has no effect on x86.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The -mone-byte-bool
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch. Using
this switch may require <br>
recompiling all other modules in a program, including system
libraries. Use this switch to conform to a non-default data
model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-and-continue <br>
-ffix-and-continue <br>
-findirect-data <br>
Generate code suitable for fast turn around development.
Needed to enable gdb to dynamically load &quot;.o&quot;
files into already running programs. -findirect-data and
<br>
-ffix-and-continue are provided for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all_load <br>
Loads all members of static archive libraries. See man ld(1)
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arch_errors_fatal <br>
Cause the errors having to do with files that have the wrong
architecture to be fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bind_at_load <br>
Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic
linker will bind all undefined references when the file is
loaded or launched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bundle <br>
Produce a Mach-o bundle format file. See man ld(1) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bundle_loader executable <br>
This option specifies the executable that will be loading
the build output file being linked. See man ld(1) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dynamiclib <br>
When passed this option, GCC will produce a dynamic library
instead of an executable when linking, using the Darwin
libtool command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force_cpusubtype_ALL <br>
This causes GCC&rsquo;s output file to have the ALL subtype,
instead of one controlled by the -mcpu or -march option.</p>

These options are passed to the Darwin linker. The Darwin

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEC Alpha Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the DEC Alpha implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-soft-float <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions
for floating-point operations. When -msoft-float is
specified, functions in libgcc.a will be used to perform
<br>
floating-point operations. Unless they are replaced by
routines that emulate the floating-point operations, or
compiled in such a way as to call such emulations routines,
<br>
these routines will issue floating-point operations. If you
are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as
<br>
not to call them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Alpha implementations
without floating-point operations are required to have
floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-reg <br>
-mno-fp-regs <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
register set. -mno-fp-regs implies -msoft-float. If the
floating-point register set is not used, floating-point <br>
operands are passed in integer registers as if they were
integers and floating-point results are passed in $0 instead
of $f0. This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any <br>
function with a floating-point argument or return value
called by code compiled with -mno-fp-regs must also be
compiled with that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical use of this option is
building a kernel that does not use, and hence need not save
and restore, any floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee <br>
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware
optimized for maximum performance. It is mostly compliant
with the IEEE floating-point standard. However, for full
<br>
compliance, software assistance is required. This option
generates code fully IEEE-compliant code except that the
inexact-flag is not maintained (see below). If this option
<br>
is turned on, the preprocessor macro &quot;_IEEE_FP&quot; is
defined during compilation. The resulting code is less
efficient but is able to correctly support denormalized
numbers and <br>
exceptional IEEE values such as not-a-number and plus/minus
infinity. Other Alpha compilers call this option
-ieee_with_no_inexact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee-with-inexact <br>
This is like -mieee except the generated code also maintains
the IEEE inexact-flag. Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math. <br>
In addition to &quot;_IEEE_FP&quot;,
&quot;_IEEE_FP_EXACT&quot; is defined as a preprocessor
macro. On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may
execute significantly slower than the <br>
code generated by default. Since there is very little code
that depends on the inexact-flag, you should normally not
specify this option. Other Alpha compilers call this <br>
option -ieee_with_inexact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode <br>
This option controls what floating-point related traps are
enabled. Other Alpha compilers call this option -fptm
trap-mode. The trap mode can be set to one of four
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n This is the default (normal)
setting. The only traps that are enabled are the ones that
cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u In addition to the traps
enabled by n, underflow traps are enabled as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su Like u, but the instructions
are marked to be safe for software completion (see Alpha
architecture manual for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sui Like su, but inexact traps
are enabled as well.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-rounding-mode=rounding-mode
<br>
Selects the IEEE rounding mode. Other Alpha compilers call
this option -fprm rounding-mode. The rounding-mode can be
one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Normal IEEE rounding mode.
Floating-point numbers are rounded towards the nearest
machine number or towards the even machine number in case of
a tie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Round towards minus
infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Chopped rounding mode.
Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Dynamic rounding mode. A field
in the floating-point control register (fpcr, see Alpha
architecture reference manual) controls the rounding mode in
effect. The C <br>
library initializes this register for rounding towards plus
infinity. Thus, unless your program modifies the fpcr, d
corresponds to round towards plus infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtrap-precision=trap-precision
<br>
In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are
imprecise. This means without software assistance it is
impossible to recover from a floating trap and program
execution <br>
normally needs to be terminated. GCC can generate code that
can assist operating system trap handlers in determining the
exact location that caused a floating-point trap. <br>
Depending on the requirements of an application, different
levels of precisions can be selected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Program precision. This option
is the default and means a trap handler can only identify
which program caused a floating-point exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Function precision. The trap
handler can determine the function that caused a
floating-point exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Instruction precision. The
trap handler can determine the exact instruction that caused
a floating-point exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Alpha compilers provide
the equivalent options called -scope_safe and
-resumption_safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee-conformant <br>
This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant. You
must not use this option unless you also specify
-mtrap-precision=i and either -mfp-trap-mode=su or <br>
-mfp-trap-mode=sui. Its only effect is to emit the line
.eflag 48 in the function prologue of the generated assembly
file. Under DEC Unix, this has the effect that IEEE- <br>
conformant math library routines will be linked in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbuild-constants <br>
Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or
three instructions. If it cannot, it will output the <br>
constant as a literal and generate code to load it from the
data segment at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option to require GCC
to construct all integer constants using code, even if it
takes more instructions (the maximum is six).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You would typically use this
option to build a shared library dynamic loader. Itself a
shared library, it must relocate itself in memory before it
can find the variables and <br>
constants in its own data segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malpha-as <br>
-mgas <br>
Select whether to generate code to be assembled by the
vendor-supplied assembler (-malpha-as) or by the GNU
assembler -mgas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbwx <br>
-mno-bwx <br>
-mcix <br>
-mno-cix <br>
-mfix <br>
-mno-fix <br>
-mmax <br>
-mno-max <br>
Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the
optional BWX, CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets. The default
is to use the instruction sets supported by the CPU type
<br>
specified via -mcpu= option or that of the CPU on which GCC
was built if none was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat-vax <br>
-mfloat-ieee <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G
floating-point arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexplicit-relocs <br>
-mno-explicit-relocs <br>
Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol
relocations except via assembler macros. Use of these macros
does not allow optimal instruction scheduling. GNU <br>
binutils as of version 2.12 supports a new syntax that
allows the compiler to explicitly mark which relocations
should apply to which instructions. This option is mostly
<br>
useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of the
assembler when it is built and sets the default
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-data <br>
-mlarge-data <br>
When -mexplicit-relocs is in effect, static data is accessed
via gp-relative relocations. When -msmall-data is used,
objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a small <br>
data area (the &quot;.sdata&quot; and &quot;.sbss&quot;
sections) and are accessed via 16-bit relocations off of the
$gp register. This limits the size of the small data area to
64KB, but <br>
allows the variables to be directly accessed via a single
instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -mlarge-data.
With this option the data area is limited to just below 2GB.
Programs that require more than 2GB of data must use
&quot;malloc&quot; or &quot;mmap&quot; to <br>
allocate the data in the heap instead of in the
program&rsquo;s data segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating code for shared
libraries, -fpic implies -msmall-data and -fPIC implies
-mlarge-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-text <br>
-mlarge-text <br>
When -msmall-text is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB,
and is thus reachable with a branch instruction. When <br>
-msmall-data is used, the compiler can assume that all local
symbols share the same $gp value, and thus reduce the number

to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -mlarge-text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type cpu_type. You can specify either
the EV style name or the corresponding chip number. GCC <br>
supports scheduling parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6
family of processors and will choose the default values for
the instruction set from the processor you specify. If <br>
you do not specify a processor type, GCC will default to the
processor on which the compiler was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported values for cpu_type
are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev4 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native toolchains also support
the value native, which selects the best architecture option
for the host processor. -mcpu=native has no effect if GCC

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu_type <br>
Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemory-latency=time <br>
Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical
memory references as seen by the application. This number is
highly dependent on the memory access patterns used by <br>
the application and the size of the external cache on the
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid options for time are</p>

EV5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEC Alpha/VMS Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the DEC Alpha/VMS implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvms-return-codes <br>
Return VMS condition codes from main. The default is to
return POSIX style condition (e.g. error) codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug-main=prefix <br>
Flag the first routine whose name starts with prefix as the
main routine for the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmalloc64 <br>
Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FR30 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the FR30 port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-model <br>
Use the small address space model. This can produce smaller
code, but it does assume that all symbolic values and
addresses will fit into a 20-bit range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-lsim <br>
Assume that runtime support has been provided and so there
is no need to include the simulator library (libsim.a) on
the linker command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FRV Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgpr-32 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Use library routines for floating-point operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malloc-cc <br>
Dynamically allocate condition code registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-cc <br>
Do not try to dynamically allocate condition code registers,
only use &quot;icc0&quot; and &quot;fcc0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdword <br>
Change ABI to use double word insns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-dword <br>
Do not use double word instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdouble <br>
Use floating-point double instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-double <br>
Do not use floating-point double instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmedia <br>
Use media instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-media <br>
Do not use media instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmuladd <br>
Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-muladd <br>
Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfdpic <br>
Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses function descriptors to
represent pointers to functions. Without any PIC/PIE-related
options, it implies -fPIE. With -fpic or -fpie, it <br>
assumes GOT entries and small data are within a 12-bit range
from the GOT base address; with -fPIC or -fPIE, GOT offsets
are computed with 32 bits. With a bfin-elf target, <br>
this option implies -msim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-plt <br>
Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to
functions that are not known to bind locally. It has no
effect without -mfdpic. It&rsquo;s enabled by default if
optimizing <br>
for speed and compiling for shared libraries (i.e., -fPIC or
-fpic), or when an optimization option such as -O3 or above
is present in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mTLS <br>
Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls <br>
Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating
thread-local code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgprel-ro <br>
Enable the use of &quot;GPREL&quot; relocations in the FDPIC
ABI for data that is known to be in read-only sections.
It&rsquo;s enabled by default, except for -fpic or -fpie:
even though it <br>
may help make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1
instruction for 4. With -fPIC or -fPIE, it trades 3
instructions for 4, one of which may be shared by multiple
<br>
symbols, and it avoids the need for a GOT entry for the
referenced symbol, so it&rsquo;s more likely to be a win. If
it is not, -mno-gprel-ro can be used to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multilib-library-pic <br>
Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries. It&rsquo;s
implied by -mlibrary-pic, as well as by -fPIC and -fpic
without -mfdpic. You should never have to use it
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlinked-fp <br>
Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame
pointer whenever a stack frame is allocated. This option is
enabled by default and can be disabled with <br>
-mno-linked-fp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the
current compilation unit. This allows the functions to be
placed anywhere within the 32-bit address space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-labels <br>
Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting nops
into the previous packet. This option only has an effect
when VLIW packing is enabled. It doesn&rsquo;t create new
<br>
packets; it merely adds nops to existing ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlibrary-pic <br>
Generate position-independent EABI code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-macc-4 <br>
Use only the first four media accumulator registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-macc-8 <br>
Use all eight media accumulator registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpack <br>
Pack VLIW instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-pack <br>
Do not pack VLIW instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-eflags <br>
Do not mark ABI switches in e_flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcond-move <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-moptimize-membar <br>
This switch removes redundant &quot;membar&quot;
instructions from the compiler generated code. It is enabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-optimize-membar <br>
This switch disables the automatic removal of redundant
&quot;membar&quot; instructions from the generated code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtomcat-stats <br>
Cause gas to print out tomcat statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu <br>
Select the processor type for which to generate code.
Possible values are frv, fr550, tomcat, fr500, fr450, fr405,
fr400, fr300 and simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU/Linux Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
GNU/Linux targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mglibc <br>
Use the GNU C library. This is the default except on
*-*-linux-*uclibc* and *-*-linux-*android* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muclibc <br>
Use uClibc C library. This is the default on
*-*-linux-*uclibc* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbionic <br>
Use Bionic C library. This is the default on
*-*-linux-*android* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mandroid <br>
Compile code compatible with Android platform. This is the
default on *-*-linux-*android* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling, this option
enables -mbionic, -fPIC, -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti by
default. When linking, this option makes the GCC driver pass
Android-specific options <br>
to the linker. Finally, this option causes the preprocessor
macro &quot;__ANDROID__&quot; to be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tno-android-cc <br>
Disable compilation effects of -mandroid, i.e., do not
enable -mbionic, -fPIC, -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tno-android-ld <br>
Disable linking effects of -mandroid, i.e., pass standard
Linux linking options to the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H8/300 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the H8/300 implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Shorten some address references at link time, when possible;
uses the linker option -relax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mh Generate code for the
H8/300H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ms Generate code for the

either with -mh or -ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ms2600 <br>
Generate code for the H8S/2600. This switch must be used
with -ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint32 <br>
Make &quot;int&quot; data 32 bits by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-300 <br>
On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for
the H8/300. The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align
longs and floats on 4-byte boundaries. -malign-300 <br>
causes them to be aligned on 2-byte boundaries. This option
has no effect on the H8/300.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HPPA Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the HPPA family of computers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=architecture-type <br>
Generate code for the specified architecture. The choices
for architecture-type are 1.0 for PA 1.0, 1.1 for PA 1.1,
and 2.0 for PA 2.0 processors. Refer to <br>
/usr/lib/sched.models on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper architecture option for your machine. Code compiled
for lower numbered architectures will run on higher <br>
numbered architectures, but not the other way around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpa-risc-1-0 <br>
-mpa-risc-1-1 <br>
-mpa-risc-2-0 <br>
Synonyms for -march=1.0, -march=1.1, and -march=2.0
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-switch <br>
Generate code suitable for big switch tables. Use this
option only if the assembler/linker complain about out of
range branches within a switch table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mjump-in-delay <br>
Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump
instructions by modifying the return pointer for the
function call to be the target of the conditional jump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdisable-fpregs <br>
Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any
manner. This is necessary for compiling kernels that perform
lazy context switching of floating-point registers. If <br>
you use this option and attempt to perform floating-point
operations, the compiler aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdisable-indexing <br>
Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes. This
avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG
generated code under MACH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-space-regs <br>
Generate code that assumes the target has no space
registers. This allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls
and use unscaled index address modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such code is suitable for level
0 PA systems and kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfast-indirect-calls <br>
Generate code that assumes calls never cross space
boundaries. This allows GCC to emit code that performs
faster indirect calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will not work in the
presence of shared libraries or nested functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator can not use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-load-store <br>
Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes
required by the HP-UX 10 linker. This is equivalent to the
+k option to the HP compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mportable-runtime <br>
Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgas <br>
Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS
understands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mschedule=cpu-type <br>
Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine
type cpu-type. The choices for cpu-type are 700 7100,
7100LC, 7200, 7300 and 8000. Refer to /usr/lib/sched.models
<br>
on an HP-UX system to determine the proper scheduling option
for your machine. The default scheduling is 8000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlinker-opt <br>
Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker. Note this
makes symbolic debugging impossible. It also triggers a bug
in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they <br>
give bogus error messages when linking some programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
Warning: the requisite libraries are not available for all
HPPA targets. Normally the facilities of the <br>
machine&rsquo;s usual C compiler are used, but this cannot
be done directly in cross-compilation. You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
<br>
cross-compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float changes the calling
convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful
if you compile all of a program with this option. In
particular, you need to <br>
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msio <br>
Generate the predefine, &quot;_SIO&quot;, for server IO. The
default is -mwsio. This generates the predefines,
&quot;__hp9000s700&quot;, &quot;__hp9000s700__&quot; and
&quot;_WSIO&quot;, for workstation IO. <br>
These options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgnu-ld <br>
Use GNU ld specific options. This passes -shared to ld when
building a shared library. It is the default when GCC is
configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU <br>
linker. This option does not have any affect on which ld is
called, it only changes what parameters are passed to that
ld. The ld that is called is determined by the <br>
--with-ld configure option, GCC&rsquo;s program search path,
and finally by the user&rsquo;s PATH. The linker used by GCC
can be printed using which &lsquo;gcc
-print-prog-name=ld&lsquo;. This <br>
option is only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e.
configured with hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhp-ld <br>
Use HP ld specific options. This passes -b to ld when
building a shared library and passes +Accept TypeMismatch to
ld on all links. It is the default when GCC is <br>
configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the HP linker.
This option does not have any affect on which ld is called,
it only changes what parameters are passed to that ld. <br>
The ld that is called is determined by the --with-ld
configure option, GCC&rsquo;s program search path, and
finally by the user&rsquo;s PATH. The linker used by GCC can
be printed using <br>
which &lsquo;gcc -print-prog-name=ld&lsquo;. This option is
only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
Generate code that uses long call sequences. This ensures
that a call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.
The default is to generate long calls only when the <br>
distance from the call site to the beginning of the function
or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used. The <br>
limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes,
respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.
Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Distances are measured from the
beginning of functions when using the -ffunction-sections
option, or when using the -mgas and -mno-portable-runtime
options together under HP- <br>
UX with the SOM linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is normally not desirable to
use this option as it will degrade performance. However, it
may be useful in large applications, particularly when
partial linking is used to <br>
build the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The types of long calls used
depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker, and
the type of code being generated. The impact on systems that
support long absolute <br>
calls, and long pic symbol-difference or pc-relative calls
should be relatively small. However, an indirect call is
used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code and it is quite <br>
long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munix=unix-std <br>
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the
specified UNIX standard. The choices for unix-std are 93, 95
and 98. 93 is supported on all HP-UX versions. 95 <br>
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later. 98 is available on
HP-UX 11.11 and later. The default values are 93 for HP-UX
10.00, 95 for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and 98 for <br>
HP-UX 11.11 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munix=93 provides the same
predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4. -munix=95 provides additional
predefines for &quot;XOPEN_UNIX&quot; and
&quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;, and the startfile <br>
unix95.o. -munix=98 provides additional predefines for
&quot;_XOPEN_UNIX&quot;, &quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;,
&quot;_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE&quot; and
&quot;_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500&quot;, and the startfile
<br>
unix98.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to note that
this option changes the interfaces for various library
routines. It also affects the operational behavior of the C
library. Thus, extreme care <br>
is needed in using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Library code that is intended to
operate with more than one UNIX standard must test, set and
restore the variable __xpg4_extended_mask as appropriate.
Most GNU software <br>
doesn&rsquo;t provide this capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolibdld <br>
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl
when the -static option is specified on HP-UX 10 and
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static <br>
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a
dependency on libdld.sl. There isn&rsquo;t an archive
version of libdld.sl. Thus, when the -static option is
specified, <br>
special link options are needed to resolve this
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC
driver adds the necessary options to link with libdld.sl
when the -static option is specified. This causes the
resulting binary to be dynamic. <br>
On the 64-bit port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by
default in any case. The -nolibdld option can be used to
prevent the GCC driver from adding these link options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-threads <br>
Add support for multithreading with the dce thread library
under HP-UX. This option sets flags for both the
preprocessor and linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Intel 386 and AMD x86-64
Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the i386 and x86-64 family of computers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu-type <br>
Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated
code, except for the ABI and the set of available
instructions. The choices for cpu-type are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generic <br>
Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T
processors. If you know the CPU on which your code will run,
then you should use the corresponding -mtune <br>
option instead of -mtune=generic. But, if you do not know
exactly what CPU users of your application will have, then
you should use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As new processors are deployed
in the marketplace, the behavior of this option will change.
Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of GCC, the
code generated <br>
option will change to reflect the processors that were most
common when that version of GCC was released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no -march=generic
option because -march indicates the instruction set the
compiler can use, and there is no generic instruction set
applicable to all processors. <br>
In contrast, -mtune indicates the processor (or, in this
case, collection of processors) for which the code is
optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">native <br>
This selects the CPU to tune for at compilation time by
determining the processor type of the compiling machine.
Using -mtune=native will produce code optimized for the <br>
local machine under the constraints of the selected
instruction set. Using -march=native will enable all
instruction subsets supported by the local machine (hence
the <br>
result might not run on different machines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i386 <br>
Original Intel&rsquo;s i386 CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i486 <br>

Same as &quot;generic&quot;, but when used as
&quot;march&quot; option, PentiumPro instruction set will be
used, so the code will run on all i686 family chips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pentium2 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c3-2 <br>
Via C3-2 CPU with MMX and SSE instruction set support. (No
scheduling is implemented for this chip.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geode <br>
Embedded AMD CPU with MMX and 3DNow! instruction set
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While picking a specific
cpu-type will schedule things appropriately for that
particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code
that does not run on the default <br>
machine type without the -march=cpu-type option being used.
For example, if GCC is configured for i686-pc-linux-gnu then
-mtune=pentium4 will generate code that is tuned for <br>
Pentium4 but will still run on i686 machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=cpu-type <br>
Generate instructions for the machine type cpu-type. The
choices for cpu-type are the same as for -mtune. Moreover,
specifying -march=cpu-type implies -mtune=cpu-type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu-type <br>
A deprecated synonym for -mtune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpmath=unit <br>
Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit unit.
The choices for unit are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">387 Use the standard 387
floating-point coprocessor present on the majority of chips
and emulated otherwise. Code compiled with this option runs
almost everywhere. The <br>
temporary results are computed in 80-bit precision instead
of the precision specified by the type, resulting in
slightly different results compared to most of other <br>
chips. See -ffloat-store for more detailed description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default choice for
i386 compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sse Use scalar floating-point
instructions present in the SSE instruction set. This
instruction set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in
the AMD line by Athlon-4, <br>
Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips. The earlier version of SSE
instruction set supports only single-precision arithmetic,
thus the double and extended-precision arithmetic <br>
are still done using 387. A later version, present only in
Pentium4 and the future AMD x86-64 chips, supports
double-precision arithmetic too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the i386 compiler, you need
to use -march=cpu-type, -msse or -msse2 switches to enable
SSE extensions and make this option effective. For the
x86-64 compiler, these <br>
extensions are enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting code should be
considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid the
numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break
some existing code that <br>
expects temporaries to be 80 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default choice for
the x86-64 compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sse,387 <br>
sse+387 <br>
both <br>
Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once. This
effectively double the amount of available registers and on
chips with separate execution units for 387 and SSE <br>
the execution resources too. Use this option with care, as
it is still experimental, because the GCC register allocator
does not model separate functional units well <br>
resulting in instable performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-masm=dialect <br>
Output asm instructions using selected dialect. Supported
choices are intel or att (the default one). Darwin does not
support intel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee-fp <br>
-mno-ieee-fp <br>
Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating-point
comparisons. These handle correctly the case where the
result of a comparison is unordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
Warning: the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.
Normally the facilities of the machine&rsquo;s usual C
compiler <br>
are used, but this can&rsquo;t be done directly in
cross-compilation. You must make your own arrangements to
provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On machines where a function
returns floating-point results in the 80387 register stack,
some floating-point opcodes may be emitted even if
-msoft-float is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fp-ret-in-387 <br>
Do not use the FPU registers for return values of
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual calling convention has
functions return values of types &quot;float&quot; and
&quot;double&quot; in an FPU register, even if there is no
FPU. The idea is that the operating system <br>
should emulate an FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -mno-fp-ret-in-387
causes such values to be returned in ordinary CPU registers
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fancy-math-387 <br>
Some 387 emulators do not support the &quot;sin&quot;,
&quot;cos&quot; and &quot;sqrt&quot; instructions for the
387. Specify this option to avoid generating those
instructions. This option is the <br>
default on FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. This option is
overridden when -march indicates that the target CPU will
always have an FPU and so the instruction will not need <br>
emulation. As of revision 2.6.1, these instructions are not
generated unless you also use the
-funsafe-math-optimizations switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-double <br>
-mno-align-double <br>
Control whether GCC aligns &quot;double&quot;, &quot;long
double&quot;, and &quot;long long&quot; variables on a
two-word boundary or a one-word boundary. Aligning
&quot;double&quot; variables on a two-word <br>
boundary produces code that runs somewhat faster on a
Pentium at the expense of more memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On x86-64, -malign-double is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use the
-malign-double switch, structures containing the above types
will be aligned differently than the published application
binary interface <br>
specifications for the 386 and will not be binary compatible
with structures in code compiled without that switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m96bit-long-double <br>
-m128bit-long-double <br>
These switches control the size of &quot;long double&quot;
type. The i386 application binary interface specifies the
size to be 96 bits, so -m96bit-long-double is the default in
<br>
32-bit mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modern architectures (Pentium
and newer) prefer &quot;long double&quot; to be aligned to
an 8- or 16-byte boundary. In arrays or structures
conforming to the ABI, this is not <br>
possible. So specifying -m128bit-long-double aligns
&quot;long double&quot; to a 16-byte boundary by padding the
&quot;long double&quot; with an additional 32-bit zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the x86-64 compiler,
-m128bit-long-double is the default choice as its ABI
specifies that &quot;long double&quot; is to be aligned on
16-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that neither of these
options enable any extra precision over the x87 standard of
80 bits for a &quot;long double&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you override the
default value for your target ABI, the structures and arrays
containing &quot;long double&quot; variables will change
their size as well as function <br>
calling convention for function taking &quot;long
double&quot; will be modified. Hence they will not be binary
compatible with arrays or structures in code compiled
without that <br>
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlarge-data-threshold=number
<br>
When -mcmodel=medium is specified, the data greater than
threshold are placed in large data section. This value must
be the same across all object linked into the binary and
<br>
defaults to 65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrtd <br>
Use a different function-calling convention, in which
functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with
the &quot;ret&quot; num instruction, which pops their
arguments while <br>
returning. This saves one instruction in the caller since
there is no need to pop the arguments there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify that an
individual function is called with this calling sequence
with the function attribute stdcall. You can also override
the -mrtd option by using the <br>
function attribute cdecl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: this calling convention
is incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you
cannot use it if you need to call libraries compiled with
the Unix compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you must provide function
prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of
arguments (including &quot;printf&quot;); otherwise
incorrect code will be generated for <br>
calls to those functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, seriously incorrect
code will result if you call a function with too many
arguments. (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly
ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mregparm=num <br>
Control how many registers are used to pass integer
arguments. By default, no registers are used to pass
arguments, and at most 3 registers can be used. You can
control <br>
this behavior for a specific function by using the function
attribute regparm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use this switch,
and num is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the
same value, including any libraries. This includes the
system libraries and <br>
startup modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msseregparm <br>
Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double
arguments and return values. You can control this behavior
for a specific function by using the function attribute <br>
sseregparm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use this switch
then you must build all modules with the same value,
including any libraries. This includes the system libraries
and startup modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvect8-ret-in-mem <br>
Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.
This is the default on Solaris@tie{}8 and 9 and VxWorks to
match the ABI of the Sun Studio compilers until version <br>
12. Later compiler versions (starting with Studio 12
Update@tie{}1) follow the ABI used by other x86 targets,
which is the default on Solaris@tie{}10 and later. Only use
<br>
this option if you need to remain compatible with existing
code produced by those previous compiler versions or older
versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpc32 <br>
-mpc64 <br>
-mpc80 <br>
Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.
When -mpc32 is specified, the significands of results of
floating-point operations are rounded to 24 bits (single
<br>
precision); -mpc64 rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 53 bits (double precision) and
-mpc80 rounds the significands of results of floating- <br>
point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision),
which is the default. When this option is used,
floating-point operations in higher precisions are not
available to <br>
the programmer without setting the FPU control word
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the rounding of
floating-point operations to less than the default 80 bits
can speed some programs by 2% or more. Note that some
mathematical libraries assume that <br>
extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations are
enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer
significant loss of accuracy, typically through so- <br>
called &quot;catastrophic cancellation&quot;, when this
option is used to set the precision to less than extended
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstackrealign <br>
Realign the stack at entry. On the Intel x86, the
-mstackrealign option will generate an alternate prologue
and epilogue that realigns the run-time stack if necessary.
This <br>
supports mixing legacy codes that keep a 4-byte aligned
stack with modern codes that keep a 16-byte stack for SSE
compatibility. See also the attribute <br>
&quot;force_align_arg_pointer&quot;, applicable to
individual functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num
<br>
Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to
num byte boundary. If -mpreferred-stack-boundary is not
specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: When generating code
for the x86-64 architecture with SSE extensions disabled,
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 can be used to keep the stack
boundary aligned to 8 byte <br>
boundary. You must build all modules with
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3, including any libraries. This
includes the system libraries and startup modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mincoming-stack-boundary=num
<br>
Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to num
byte boundary. If -mincoming-stack-boundary is not
specified, the one specified by -mpreferred-stack-boundary
will <br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Pentium and PentiumPro,
&quot;double&quot; and &quot;long double&quot; values should
be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see -malign-double) or
suffer significant run time performance <br>
penalties. On Pentium III, the Streaming SIMD Extension
(SSE) data type &quot;__m128&quot; may not work properly if
it is not 16-byte aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ensure proper alignment of
this values on the stack, the stack boundary must be as
aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must <br>
be generated such that it keeps the stack aligned. Thus
calling a function compiled with a higher preferred stack
boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred
<br>
stack boundary will most likely misalign the stack. It is
recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the
default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This extra alignment does
consume extra stack space, and generally increases code
size. Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such as
embedded systems and operating <br>
system kernels, may want to reduce the preferred alignment
to -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2.</p>

These switches enable or disable the use of instructions in
the MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, AES,
PCLMUL, FSGSBASE, RDRND, F16C, FMA, SSE4A, FMA4, XOP, <br>
LWP, ABM, BMI, BMI2, LZCNT or 3DNow! <br>
extended instruction sets. These extensions are also
available as built-in functions: see X86 Built-in Functions,
for details of the functions enabled and disabled by these
<br>
switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To have SSE/SSE2 instructions
generated automatically from floating-point code (as opposed
to 387 instructions), see -mfpmath=sse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC depresses SSEx instructions
when -mavx is used. Instead, it generates new AVX
instructions or AVX equivalence for all SSEx instructions
when needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options will enable GCC to
use these extended instructions in generated code, even
without -mfpmath=sse. Applications that perform run-time CPU
detection must compile <br>
separate files for each supported architecture, using the
appropriate flags. In particular, the file containing the
CPU detection code should be compiled without these <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcld <br>
This option instructs GCC to emit a &quot;cld&quot;
instruction in the prologue of functions that use string
instructions. String instructions depend on the DF flag to
select between <br>
autoincrement or autodecrement mode. While the ABI specifies
the DF flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
systems violate this specification by not clearing <br>
the DF flag in their exception dispatchers. The exception
handler can be invoked with the DF flag set, which leads to
wrong direction mode when string instructions are used. <br>
This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets
by configuring GCC with the --enable-cld configure option.
Generation of &quot;cld&quot; instructions can be suppressed
<br>
with the -mno-cld compiler option in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvzeroupper <br>
This option instructs GCC to emit a &quot;vzeroupper&quot;
instruction before a transfer of control flow out of the
function to minimize AVX to SSE transition penalty as well
as remove <br>
unnecessary zeroupper intrinsics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprefer-avx128 <br>
This option instructs GCC to use 128-bit AVX instructions
instead of 256-bit AVX instructions in the
auto-vectorizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcx16 <br>
This option will enable GCC to use CMPXCHG16B instruction in
generated code. CMPXCHG16B allows for atomic operations on
128-bit double quadword (or oword) data types. This <br>
is useful for high resolution counters that could be updated
by multiple processors (or cores). This instruction is
generated as part of atomic built-in functions: see <br>
__sync Builtins or __atomic Builtins for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msahf <br>
This option will enable GCC to use SAHF instruction in
generated 64-bit code. Early Intel CPUs with Intel 64 lacked
LAHF and SAHF instructions supported by AMD64 until <br>
introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December 2005. LAHF and
SAHF are load and store instructions, respectively, for
certain status flags. In 64-bit mode, SAHF instruction <br>
is used to optimize &quot;fmod&quot;, &quot;drem&quot; or
&quot;remainder&quot; built-in functions: see Other Builtins
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmovbe <br>
This option will enable GCC to use movbe instruction to
implement &quot;__builtin_bswap32&quot; and
&quot;__builtin_bswap64&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcrc32 <br>
This option will enable built-in functions,
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32qi&quot;,
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32hi&quot;.
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32si&quot; and
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32di&quot; to generate the crc32
<br>
machine instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip <br>
This option will enable GCC to use RCPSS and RSQRTSS
instructions (and their vectorized variants RCPPS and
RSQRTPS) with an additional Newton-Raphson step to increase
<br>
precision instead of DIVSS and SQRTSS (and their vectorized
variants) for single-precision floating-point arguments.
These instructions are generated only when <br>
-funsafe-math-optimizations is enabled together with
-finite-math-only and -fno-trapping-math. Note that while
the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
<br>
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the
sequence can be decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse
of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that GCC implements
&quot;1.0f/sqrtf(x)&quot; in terms of RSQRTSS (or RSQRTPS)
already with -ffast-math (or the above option combination),
and doesn&rsquo;t need -mrecip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that GCC emits the
above sequence with additional Newton-Raphson step for
vectorized single-float division and vectorized
&quot;sqrtf(x)&quot; already with -ffast-math (or <br>
the above option combination), and doesn&rsquo;t need
-mrecip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip=opt <br>
This option allows to control which reciprocal estimate
instructions may be used. opt is a comma separated list of
options, which may be preceded by a &quot;!&quot; to invert
the <br>
option: &quot;all&quot;: enable all estimate instructions,
&quot;default&quot;: enable the default instructions,
equivalent to -mrecip, &quot;none&quot;: disable all
estimate instructions, equivalent to <br>
-mno-recip, &quot;div&quot;: enable the approximation for
scalar division, &quot;vec-div&quot;: enable the
approximation for vectorized division, &quot;sqrt&quot;:
enable the approximation for scalar <br>
square root, &quot;vec-sqrt&quot;: enable the approximation
for vectorized square root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So for example,
-mrecip=all,!sqrt would enable all of the reciprocal
approximations, except for square root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mveclibabi=type <br>
Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics
using an external library. Supported types are
&quot;svml&quot; for the Intel short vector math library and
&quot;acml&quot; for the AMD <br>
math core library style of interfacing. GCC will currently
emit calls to &quot;vmldExp2&quot;, &quot;vmldLn2&quot;,
&quot;vmldLog102&quot;, &quot;vmldLog102&quot;,
&quot;vmldPow2&quot;, &quot;vmldTanh2&quot;,
&quot;vmldTan2&quot;, &quot;vmldAtan2&quot;, <br>
&quot;vmldAtanh2&quot;, &quot;vmldCbrt2&quot;,
&quot;vmldSinh2&quot;, &quot;vmldSin2&quot;,
&quot;vmldAsinh2&quot;, &quot;vmldAsin2&quot;,
&quot;vmldCosh2&quot;, &quot;vmldCos2&quot;,
&quot;vmldAcosh2&quot;, &quot;vmldAcos2&quot;,
&quot;vmlsExp4&quot;, &quot;vmlsLn4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsLog104&quot;, <br>
&quot;vmlsLog104&quot;, &quot;vmlsPow4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsTanh4&quot;, &quot;vmlsTan4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsAtan4&quot;, &quot;vmlsAtanh4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsCbrt4&quot;, &quot;vmlsSinh4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsSin4&quot;, &quot;vmlsAsinh4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsAsin4&quot;, &quot;vmlsCosh4&quot;,
&quot;vmlsCos4&quot;, <br>
&quot;vmlsAcosh4&quot; and &quot;vmlsAcos4&quot; for
corresponding function type when -mveclibabi=svml is used
and &quot;__vrd2_sin&quot;, &quot;__vrd2_cos&quot;,
&quot;__vrd2_exp&quot;, &quot;__vrd2_log&quot;,
&quot;__vrd2_log2&quot;, <br>
&quot;__vrd2_log10&quot;, &quot;__vrs4_sinf&quot;,
&quot;__vrs4_cosf&quot;, &quot;__vrs4_expf&quot;,
&quot;__vrs4_logf&quot;, &quot;__vrs4_log2f&quot;,
&quot;__vrs4_log10f&quot; and &quot;__vrs4_powf&quot; for
corresponding function type when <br>
-mveclibabi=acml is used. Both -ftree-vectorize and
-funsafe-math-optimizations have to be enabled. A SVML or
ACML ABI compatible library will have to be specified at
link <br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=name <br>
Generate code for the specified calling convention.
Permissible values are: sysv for the ABI used on GNU/Linux
and other systems and ms for the Microsoft ABI. The default
<br>
is to use the Microsoft ABI when targeting Windows. On all
other systems, the default is the SYSV ABI. You can control
this behavior for a specific function by using the <br>
function attribute ms_abi/sysv_abi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=type <br>
Generate code to access thread-local storage using the gnu
or gnu2 conventions. gnu is the conservative default; gnu2
is more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time <br>
requirements that cannot be satisfied on all systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpush-args <br>
-mno-push-args <br>
Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters. This
method is shorter and usually equally fast as method using
SUB/MOV operations and is enabled by default. In some <br>
cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maccumulate-outgoing-args <br>
If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for
outgoing arguments will be computed in the function
prologue. This is faster on most modern CPUs because of
reduced <br>
dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2. The
drawback is a notable increase in code size. This switch
<br>
implies -mno-push-args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthreads <br>
Support thread-safe exception handling on Mingw32. Code that
relies on thread-safe exception handling must compile and
link all code with the -mthreads option. When <br>
compiling, -mthreads defines -D_MT; when linking, it links
in a special thread helper library -lmingwthrd which cleans
up per thread exception handling data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-align-stringops <br>
Do not align destination of inlined string operations. This
switch reduces code size and improves performance in case
the destination is already aligned, but GCC doesn&rsquo;t
<br>
know about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-all-stringops <br>
By default GCC inlines string operations only when the
destination is known to be aligned to least a 4-byte
boundary. This enables more inlining, increase code size,
but may <br>
improve performance of code that depends on fast memcpy,
strlen and memset for short lengths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-stringops-dynamically
<br>
For string operations of unknown size, use run-time checks
with inline code for small blocks and a library call for
large blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstringop-strategy=alg <br>
Overwrite internal decision heuristic about particular
algorithm to inline string operation with. The allowed
values are &quot;rep_byte&quot;, &quot;rep_4byte&quot;,
&quot;rep_8byte&quot; for expanding <br>
using i386 &quot;rep&quot; prefix of specified size,
&quot;byte_loop&quot;, &quot;loop&quot;,
&quot;unrolled_loop&quot; for expanding inline loop,
&quot;libcall&quot; for always expanding library call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf
functions. This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available
<br>
in leaf functions. The option -fomit-frame-pointer removes
the frame pointer for all functions, which might make
debugging harder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-direct-seg-refs <br>
-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs <br>
Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets
from the TLS segment register (%gs for 32-bit, %fs for
64-bit), or whether the thread base pointer must be added.
<br>
Whether or not this is legal depends on the operating
system, and whether it maps the segment to cover the entire
TLS area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For systems that use GNU libc,
the default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msse2avx <br>
-mno-sse2avx <br>
Specify that the assembler should encode SSE instructions
with VEX prefix. The option -mavx turns this on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfentry <br>
-mno-fentry <br>
If profiling is active -pg put the profiling counter call
before prologue. Note: On x86 architectures the attribute
&quot;ms_hook_prologue&quot; isn&rsquo;t possible at the
moment for <br>
-mfentry and -pg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m8bit-idiv <br>
-mno-8bit-idiv <br>
On some processors, like Intel Atom, 8-bit unsigned integer
divide is much faster than 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.
This option generates a run-time check. If both <br>
dividend and divisor are within range of 0 to 255, 8-bit
unsigned integer divide is used instead of 32-bit/64-bit
integer divide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mavx256-split-unaligned-load
<br>
-mavx256-split-unaligned-store <br>
Split 32-byte AVX unaligned load and store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m switches are supported
in addition to the above on AMD x86-64 processors in 64-bit
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
-mx32 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. The -m32
option sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and generates
code that runs on any i386 system. The -m64 option <br>
sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits and
generates code for AMD&rsquo;s x86-64 architecture. The
-mx32 option sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and
generates <br>
code for AMD&rsquo;s x86-64 architecture. For darwin only
the -m64 option turns off the -fno-pic and -mdynamic-no-pic
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-red-zone <br>
Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64 code. The red
zone is mandated by the x86-64 ABI, it is a 128-byte area
beyond the location of the stack pointer that will not be
<br>
modified by signal or interrupt handlers and therefore can
be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer. The flag -mno-red-zone disables this red zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=small <br>
Generate code for the small code model: the program and its
symbols must be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address
space. Pointers are 64 bits. Programs can be statically <br>
or dynamically linked. This is the default code model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=kernel <br>
Generate code for the kernel code model. The kernel runs in
the negative 2 GB of the address space. This model has to be
used for Linux kernel code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=medium <br>
Generate code for the medium model: The program is linked in
the lower 2 GB of the address space. Small symbols are also
placed there. Symbols with sizes larger than <br>
-mlarge-data-threshold are put into large data or bss
sections and can be located above 2GB. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=large <br>
Generate code for the large model: This model makes no
assumptions about addresses and sizes of sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maddress-mode=long <br>
Generate code for long address mode. This is only supported
for 64-bit and x32 environments. It is the default address
mode for 64-bit environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maddress-mode=short <br>
Generate code for short address mode. This is only supported
for 32-bit and x32 environments. It is the default address
mode for 32-bit and x32 environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i386 and x86-64 Windows
Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These additional options are
available for Windows targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconsole <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that a console application is to be generated, by
instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem <br>
type required for console applications. This is the default
behavior for Cygwin and MinGW targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdll <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that a DLL - a dynamic link library - is to be
generated, enabling the selection of the required runtime
<br>

that the UNICODE macro is getting pre-defined and that the
unicode capable runtime startup code is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwin32 <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that the typical Windows pre-defined macros are to
be set in the pre-processor, but does not influence <br>
the choice of runtime library/startup code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwindows <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that a GUI application is to be generated by
instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type
<br>
appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-set-stack-executable <br>
This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies
that the executable flag for stack used by nested functions
isn&rsquo;t set. This is necessary for binaries running in
<br>
kernel mode of Windows, as there the user32 API, which is
used to set executable privileges, isn&rsquo;t
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpe-aligned-commons <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that the GNU extension to the PE file format that
permits the correct alignment of COMMON variables <br>
should be used when generating code. It will be enabled by
default if GCC detects that the target assembler found
during configuration supports the feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmultiply-enabled <br>
Enable multiply instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msign-extend-enabled <br>
Enable sign extend instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muser-enabled <br>
Enable user-defined instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M32C Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Select the CPU for which code is generated. name may be one
of r8c for the R8C/Tiny series, m16c for the M16C (up to
/60) series, m32cm for the M16C/80 series, or m32c for <br>
the M32C/80 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
This causes an alternate runtime library to be linked in
which supports, for example, file I/O. You must not use <br>
this option when generating programs that will run on real
hardware; you must provide your own runtime library for
whatever I/O functions are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memregs=number <br>
Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC
will use during code generation. These pseudo-registers will
be used like real registers, so there is a tradeoff <br>
between GCC&rsquo;s ability to fit the code into available
registers, and the performance penalty of using memory
instead of registers. Note that all modules in a program
must be <br>
compiled with the same value for this option. Because of
that, you must not use this option with the default runtime
libraries gcc builds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M32R/D Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
Renesas M32R/D architectures:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32r2 <br>
Generate code for the M32R/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32rx <br>
Generate code for the M32R/X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32r <br>
Generate code for the M32R. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodel=small <br>
Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that
their addresses can be loaded with the &quot;ld24&quot;
instruction), and assume all subroutines are reachable with
the <br>
&quot;bl&quot; instruction. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The addressability of a
particular object can be set with the &quot;model&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodel=medium <br>
Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space
(the compiler will generate &quot;seth/add3&quot;
instructions to load their addresses), and assume all
subroutines are <br>
reachable with the &quot;bl&quot; instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodel=large <br>
Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space
(the compiler will generate &quot;seth/add3&quot;
instructions to load their addresses), and assume
subroutines may not be <br>
reachable with the &quot;bl&quot; instruction (the compiler
will generate the much slower &quot;seth/add3/jl&quot;
instruction sequence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=none <br>
Disable use of the small data area. Variables will be put
into one of .data, bss, or .rodata (unless the
&quot;section&quot; attribute has been specified). This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The small data area consists of
sections .sdata and .sbss. Objects may be explicitly put in
the small data area with the &quot;section&quot; attribute
using one of these sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=sdata <br>
Put small global and static data in the small data area, but
do not generate special code to reference them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=use <br>
Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
generate special instructions to reference them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G num <br>
Put global and static objects less than or equal to num
bytes into the small data or bss sections instead of the
normal data or bss sections. The default value of num is 8.
<br>
The -msdata option must be set to one of sdata or use for
this option to have any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All modules should be compiled
with the same -G num value. Compiling with different values
of num may or may not work; if it doesn&rsquo;t the linker
will give an error <br>
message---incorrect code will not be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug <br>
Makes the M32R specific code in the compiler display some
statistics that might help in debugging programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-loops <br>
Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-align-loops <br>
Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-missue-rate=number <br>
Issue number instructions per cycle. number can only be 1 or
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=number <br>
number can only be 1 or 2. If it is 1 then branches will be
preferred over conditional code, if it is 2, then the
opposite will apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflush-trap=number <br>
Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache. The
default is 12. Valid numbers are between 0 and 15
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-flush-trap <br>
Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a
trap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflush-func=name <br>
Specifies the name of the operating system function to call
to flush the cache. The default is _flush_cache, but a
function call will only be used if a trap is not <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-flush-func <br>
Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M680x0 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for M680x0 and ColdFire processors. The default settings
depend on which architecture was selected when the compiler
was configured; the <br>
defaults for the most common choices are given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=arch <br>
Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction
set architecture. Permissible values of arch for M680x0
architectures are: 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, <br>
68060 and cpu32. ColdFire architectures are selected
according to Freescale&rsquo;s ISA classification and the
permissible values are: isaa, isaaplus, isab and isac.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc defines a macro __mcfarch__
whenever it is generating code for a ColdFire target. The
arch in this macro is one of the -march arguments given
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used together, -march and
-mtune select code that runs on a family of similar
processors but that is optimized for a particular
microarchitecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu <br>
Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire processor.
The M680x0 cpus are: 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040,
68060, 68302, 68332 and cpu32. The ColdFire cpus are <br>
given by the table below, which also classifies the CPUs
into families:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Family : -mcpu arguments <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu overrides -march=arch
if arch is compatible with cpu. Other combinations of -mcpu
and -march are rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc defines the macro
__mcf_cpu_cpu when ColdFire target cpu is selected. It also
defines __mcf_family_family, where the value of family is
given by the table above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=tune <br>
Tune the code for a particular microarchitecture, within the
constraints set by -march and -mcpu. The M680x0
microarchitectures are: 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040,
68060 <br>
and cpu32. The ColdFire microarchitectures are: cfv1, cfv2,
cfv3, cfv4 and cfv4e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use -mtune=68020-40
for code that needs to run relatively well on 68020, 68030

68060 targets as well. <br>
These two options select the same tuning decisions as
-m68020-40 and -m68020-60 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc defines the macros __mcarch
and __mcarch__ when tuning for 680x0 architecture arch. It
also defines mcarch unless either -ansi or a non-GNU -std
option is used. If gcc <br>

-mtune=68020-40 or -mtune=68020-60, it defines the macros
for every architecture in the range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc also defines the macro
__muarch__ when tuning for ColdFire microarchitecture uarch,
where uarch is one of the arguments given above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68000 <br>
-mc68000 <br>
Generate output for a 68000. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68000-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option for
microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core, including the
68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68010 <br>
Generate output for a 68010. This is the default when the

equivalent to -march=68010.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68020 <br>
-mc68020 <br>
Generate output for a 68020. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68020-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68020.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68030 <br>
Generate output for a 68030. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68030-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68030.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68040 <br>
Generate output for a 68040. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68040-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68040.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option inhibits the use of
68881/68882 instructions that have to be emulated by
software on the 68040. Use this option if your 68040 does
not have code to emulate those <br>
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68060 <br>
Generate output for a 68060. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68060-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68060.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option inhibits the use of
68020 and 68881/68882 instructions that have to be emulated
by software on the 68060. Use this option if your 68060 does

emulate those instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu32 <br>
Generate output for a CPU32. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for CPU32-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=cpu32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option for
microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+ core, including the
68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334, 68336, 68340, 68341,
68349 and 68360.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5200 <br>
Generate output for a 520X ColdFire CPU. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems. It
is equivalent to -mcpu=5206, and is now deprecated <br>
in favor of that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option for
microcontroller with a 5200 core, including the MCF5202,
MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5206.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5206e <br>
Generate output for a 5206e ColdFire CPU. The option is now
deprecated in favor of the equivalent -mcpu=5206e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m528x <br>
Generate output for a member of the ColdFire 528X family.
The option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent
-mcpu=528x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5307 <br>
Generate output for a ColdFire 5307 CPU. The option is now
deprecated in favor of the equivalent -mcpu=5307.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5407 <br>
Generate output for a ColdFire 5407 CPU. The option is now
deprecated in favor of the equivalent -mcpu=5407.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcfv4e <br>
Generate output for a ColdFire V4e family CPU (e.g.
547x/548x). This includes use of hardware floating-point
instructions. The option is equivalent to -mcpu=547x, and is
<br>
now deprecated in favor of that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68020-40 <br>
Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
instructions. This results in code that can run relatively
efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a <br>
68040. The generated code does use the 68881 instructions
that are emulated on the 68040.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option is equivalent to
-march=68020 -mtune=68020-40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68020-60 <br>
Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
instructions. This results in code that can run relatively
efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a <br>
68040. The generated code does use the 68881 instructions
that are emulated on the 68060.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option is equivalent to
-march=68020 -mtune=68020-60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
-m68881 <br>
Generate floating-point instructions. This is the default
for 68020 and above, and for ColdFire devices that have an
FPU. It defines the macro __HAVE_68881__ on M680x0 <br>
targets and __mcffpu__ on ColdFire targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Do not generate floating-point instructions; use library
calls instead. This is the default for 68000, 68010, and
68832 targets. It is also the default for ColdFire devices
<br>
that have no FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv <br>
-mno-div <br>
Generate (do not generate) ColdFire hardware divide and
remainder instructions. If -march is used without -mcpu, the
default is &quot;on&quot; for ColdFire architectures and
&quot;off&quot; for <br>
M680x0 architectures. Otherwise, the default is taken from
the target CPU (either the default CPU, or the one specified
by -mcpu). For example, the default is &quot;off&quot; for
<br>
-mcpu=5206 and &quot;on&quot; for -mcpu=5206e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc defines the macro
__mcfhwdiv__ when this option is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshort <br>
Consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16 bits wide, like
&quot;short int&quot;. Additionally, parameters passed on
the stack are also aligned to a 16-bit boundary even on
targets whose API <br>
mandates promotion to 32-bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-short <br>
Do not consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16 bits wide.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnobitfield <br>
-mno-bitfield <br>
Do not use the bit-field instructions. The -m68000, -mcpu32
and -m5200 options imply -mnobitfield.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbitfield <br>
Do use the bit-field instructions. The -m68020 option
implies -mbitfield. This is the default if you use a
configuration designed for a 68020.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrtd <br>
Use a different function-calling convention, in which
functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with
the &quot;rtd&quot; instruction, which pops their arguments
while <br>
returning. This saves one instruction in the caller since
there is no need to pop the arguments there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This calling convention is
incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you
cannot use it if you need to call libraries compiled with
the Unix compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you must provide function
prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of
arguments (including &quot;printf&quot;); otherwise
incorrect code will be generated for <br>
calls to those functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, seriously incorrect
code will result if you call a function with too many
arguments. (Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly
ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;rtd&quot; instruction
is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060 and
CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-rtd <br>
Do not use the calling conventions selected by -mrtd. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-int <br>
-mno-align-int <br>
Control whether GCC aligns &quot;int&quot;,
&quot;long&quot;, &quot;long long&quot;, &quot;float&quot;,
&quot;double&quot;, and &quot;long double&quot; variables on
a 32-bit boundary (-malign-int) or a 16-bit boundary <br>
(-mno-align-int). Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries
produces code that runs somewhat faster on processors with
32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use the
-malign-int switch, GCC will align structures containing the
above types differently than most published application
binary interface specifications <br>
for the m68k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpcrel <br>
Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly,
instead of using a global offset table. At present, this
option implies -fpic, allowing at most a 16-bit offset <br>
for pc-relative addressing. -fPIC is not presently supported
with -mpcrel, though this could be supported for 68020 and
higher processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-strict-align <br>
-mstrict-align <br>
Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references will be
handled by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msep-data <br>
Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in
a different area of memory from the text segment. This
allows for execute in place in an environment without <br>
virtual memory management. This option implies -fPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sep-data <br>
Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the
text segment. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mid-shared-library <br>
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
ID method. This allows for execute in place and shared
libraries in an environment without virtual memory <br>
management. This option implies -fPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-id-shared-library <br>
Generate code that doesn&rsquo;t assume ID based shared
libraries are being used. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared-library-id=n <br>
Specified the identification number of the ID based shared
library being compiled. Specifying a value of 0 will
generate more compact code, specifying other values will
<br>
force the allocation of that number to the current library
but is no more space or time efficient than omitting this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxgot <br>
-mno-xgot <br>
When generating position-independent code for ColdFire,
generate code that works if the GOT has more than 8192
entries. This code is larger and slower than code generated
<br>
without this option. On M680x0 processors, this option is
not needed; -fPIC suffices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC normally uses a single
instruction to load values from the GOT. While this is
relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is smaller
than about 64k. Anything larger <br>
causes the linker to report an error such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relocation truncated to fit:
R_68K_GOT16O foobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this happens, you should
recompile your code with -mxgot. It should then work with
very large GOTs. However, code generated with -mxgot is less
efficient, since it takes <br>
4 instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some linkers,
including newer versions of the GNU linker, can create
multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries. If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use <br>
-mxgot when compiling a single object file that accesses
more than 8192 GOT entries. Very few do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options have no effect
unless GCC is generating position-independent code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MCore Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for the Motorola M*Core processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhardlit <br>
-mno-hardlit <br>
Inline constants into the code stream if it can be done in
two instructions or less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv <br>
-mno-div <br>
Use the divide instruction. (Enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax-immediate <br>
-mno-relax-immediate <br>
Allow arbitrary sized immediates in bit operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwide-bitfields <br>
-mno-wide-bitfields <br>
Always treat bit-fields as int-sized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4byte-functions <br>
-mno-4byte-functions <br>
Force all functions to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcallgraph-data <br>
-mno-callgraph-data <br>
Emit callgraph information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mslow-bytes <br>
-mno-slow-bytes <br>
Prefer word access when reading byte quantities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a little-endian target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m210 <br>
-m340 <br>
Generate code for the 210 processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-lsim <br>
Assume that runtime support has been provided and so omit
the simulator library (libsim.a) from the linker command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-increment=size <br>
Set the maximum amount for a single stack increment
operation. Large values can increase the speed of programs
that contain functions that need a large amount of stack
<br>
space, but they can also trigger a segmentation fault if the
stack is extended too much. The default value is 0x1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MeP Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabsdiff <br>
Enables the &quot;abs&quot; instruction, which is the
absolute difference between two registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mall-opts <br>
Enables all the optional instructions - average, multiply,
divide, bit operations, leading zero, absolute difference,
min/max, clip, and saturation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maverage <br>
Enables the &quot;ave&quot; instruction, which computes the
average of two registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbased=n <br>
Variables of size n bytes or smaller will be placed in the
&quot;.based&quot; section by default. Based variables use
the $tp register as a base register, and there is a 128-byte
<br>
limit to the &quot;.based&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbitops <br>
Enables the bit operation instructions - bit test
(&quot;btstm&quot;), set (&quot;bsetm&quot;), clear
(&quot;bclrm&quot;), invert (&quot;bnotm&quot;), and
test-and-set (&quot;tas&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mc=name <br>
Selects which section constant data will be placed in. name
may be &quot;tiny&quot;, &quot;near&quot;, or
&quot;far&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mclip <br>
Enables the &quot;clip&quot; instruction. Note that
&quot;-mclip&quot; is not useful unless you also provide
&quot;-mminmax&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconfig=name <br>
Selects one of the build-in core configurations. Each MeP
chip has one or more modules in it; each module has a core
CPU and a variety of coprocessors, optional <br>
instructions, and peripherals. The
&quot;MeP-Integrator&quot; tool, not part of GCC, provides
these configurations through this option; using this option
is the same as using all the <br>
corresponding command-line options. The default
configuration is &quot;default&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcop <br>
Enables the coprocessor instructions. By default, this is a
32-bit coprocessor. Note that the coprocessor is normally
enabled via the &quot;-mconfig=&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcop32 <br>
Enables the 32-bit coprocessor&rsquo;s instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcop64 <br>
Enables the 64-bit coprocessor&rsquo;s instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mivc2 <br>
Enables IVC2 scheduling. IVC2 is a 64-bit VLIW
coprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdc <br>
Causes constant variables to be placed in the
&quot;.near&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv <br>
Enables the &quot;div&quot; and &quot;divu&quot;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmult <br>
Enables the multiplication and multiply-accumulate
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-opts <br>
Disables all the optional instructions enabled by
&quot;-mall-opts&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrepeat <br>
Enables the &quot;repeat&quot; and &quot;erepeat&quot;
instructions, used for low-overhead looping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ms Causes all variables to
default to the &quot;.tiny&quot; section. Note that there is
a 65536-byte limit to this section. Accesses to these
variables use the %gp base register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msatur <br>
Enables the saturation instructions. Note that the compiler
does not currently generate these itself, but this option is
included for compatibility with other tools, like <br>
&quot;as&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdram <br>
Link the SDRAM-based runtime instead of the default
ROM-based runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Link the simulator runtime libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msimnovec <br>
Link the simulator runtime libraries, excluding built-in
support for reset and exception vectors and tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtf <br>
Causes all functions to default to the &quot;.far&quot;
section. Without this option, functions default to the
&quot;.near&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtiny=n <br>
Variables that are n bytes or smaller will be allocated to
the &quot;.tiny&quot; section. These variables use the $gp
base register. The default for this option is 4, but note
that <br>
there&rsquo;s a 65536-byte limit to the &quot;.tiny&quot;
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MicroBlaze Options</p>

This option is deprecated. Use -fno-zero-initialized-in-bss
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu-type <br>
Use features of and schedule code for given CPU. Supported
values are in the format vX.YY.Z, where X is a major
version, YY is the minor version, and Z is compatibility
<br>
code. Example values are v3.00.a, v4.00.b, v5.00.a, v5.00.b,
v5.00.b, v6.00.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxl-mode-app-model <br>
Select application model app-model. Valid models are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">executable <br>
normal executable (default), uses startup code crt0.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xmdstub <br>
for use with Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) based

transferring control on a processor reset to the bootloader
rather than the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">novectors <br>
for applications that do not require any of the MicroBlaze

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIPS Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-EB Generate big-endian

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-EL Generate little-endian code.
This is the default for mips*el-*-* configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=arch <br>
Generate code that will run on arch, which can be the name
of a generic MIPS ISA, or the name of a particular
processor. The ISA names are: mips1, mips2, mips3, mips4,
<br>
mips32, mips32r2, mips64 and mips64r2. The processor names
are: 4kc, 4km, 4kp, 4ksc, 4kec, 4kem, 4kep, 4ksd, 5kc, 5kf,

<br>
vr5400, vr5500 and xlr. The special value from-abi selects
the most compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that
is, mips1 for 32-bit ABIs and mips3 for 64-bit ABIs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native Linux/GNU and IRIX
toolchains also support the value native, which selects the
best architecture option for the host processor.
-march=native has no effect if GCC <br>
does not recognize the processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In processor names, a final 000
can be abbreviated as k (for example, -march=r2k). Prefixes
are optional, and vr may be written r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Names of the form nf2_1 refer to
processors with FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core,
names of the form nf1_1 refer to processors with FPUs
clocked at the same rate as <br>
the core, and names of the form nf3_2 refer to processors
with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, nf is accepted as a synonym <br>
for nf2_1 while nx and bfx are accepted as synonyms for
nf1_1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines two macros based on
the value of this option. The first is _MIPS_ARCH, which
gives the name of target architecture, as a string. The
second has the form <br>
_MIPS_ARCH_foo, where foo is the capitalized value of
_MIPS_ARCH. For example, -march=r2000 will set _MIPS_ARCH to
&quot;r2000&quot; and define the macro _MIPS_ARCH_R2000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the _MIPS_ARCH macro
uses the processor names given above. In other words, it
will have the full prefix and will not abbreviate 000 as k.
In the case of from-abi, <br>
the macro names the resolved architecture (either
&quot;mips1&quot; or &quot;mips3&quot;). It names the
default architecture when no -march option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=arch <br>
Optimize for arch. Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost
of arithmetic operations. The list of arch values is <br>
the same as for -march.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is not used,
GCC will optimize for the processor specified by -march. By
using -march and -mtune together, it is possible to generate
code that will run on <br>
a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune defines the macros
_MIPS_TUNE and _MIPS_TUNE_foo, which work in the same way as
the -march ones described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips1 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips2 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips3 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips3.</p>

Equivalent to -march=mips4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips32 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips32r2 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips32r2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips64 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips64r2 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips64r2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips16 <br>
-mno-mips16 <br>
Generate (do not generate) MIPS16 code. If GCC is targetting
a MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture, it will make use of the
MIPS16e ASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIPS16 code generation can also
be controlled on a per-function basis by means of
&quot;mips16&quot; and &quot;nomips16&quot; attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflip-mips16 <br>
Generate MIPS16 code on alternating functions. This option
is provided for regression testing of mixed
MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code generation, and is not intended for
ordinary <br>
use in compiling user code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minterlink-mips16 <br>
-mno-interlink-mips16 <br>
Require (do not require) that non-MIPS16 code be
link-compatible with MIPS16 code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, non-MIPS16 code
cannot jump directly to MIPS16 code; it must either use a
call or an indirect jump. -minterlink-mips16 therefore
disables direct jumps unless <br>
GCC knows that the target of the jump is not MIPS16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=32 <br>
-mabi=o64 <br>
-mabi=n32 <br>
-mabi=64 <br>
-mabi=eabi <br>
Generate code for the given ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the EABI has a 32-bit
and a 64-bit variant. GCC normally generates 64-bit code
when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you can use
-mgp32 to get 32-bit code <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information about the O64
ABI, see
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC supports a variant of the
o32 ABI in which floating-point registers are 64 rather than
32 bits wide. You can select this combination with -mabi=32
-mfp64. This ABI <br>
relies on the mthc1 and mfhc1 instructions and is therefore
only supported for MIPS32R2 processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The register assignments for
arguments and return values remain the same, but each scalar
value is passed in a single 64-bit register rather than a
pair of 32-bit registers. <br>
For example, scalar floating-point values are returned in
$f0 only, not a $f0/$f1 pair. The set of call-saved
registers also remains the same, but all 64 bits are
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabicalls <br>
-mno-abicalls <br>
Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for
SVR4-style dynamic objects. -mabicalls is the default for
SVR4-based systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared <br>
-mno-shared <br>
Generate (do not generate) code that is fully
position-independent, and that can therefore be linked into
shared libraries. This option only affects -mabicalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All -mabicalls code has
traditionally been position-independent, regardless of
options like -fPIC and -fpic. However, as an extension, the
GNU toolchain allows executables <br>
to use absolute accesses for locally-binding symbols. It can
also use shorter GP initialization sequences and generate
direct calls to locally-defined functions. This mode <br>
is selected by -mno-shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-shared depends on binutils
2.16 or higher and generates objects that can only be linked
by the GNU linker. However, the option does not affect the
ABI of the final <br>
executable; it only affects the ABI of relocatable objects.
Using -mno-shared will generally make executables both
smaller and quicker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mplt <br>
-mno-plt <br>
Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers
support PLTs and copy relocations. This option only affects
-mno-shared -mabicalls. For the n64 ABI, this option <br>
has no effect without -msym32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can make -mplt the default
by configuring GCC with --with-mips-plt. The default is
-mno-plt otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxgot <br>
-mno-xgot <br>
Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the
global offset table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC normally uses a single
instruction to load values from the GOT. While this is
relatively efficient, it will only work if the GOT is
smaller than about 64k. Anything <br>
larger will cause the linker to report an error such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relocation truncated to fit:
R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this happens, you should
recompile your code with -mxgot. It should then work with
very large GOTs, although it will also be less efficient,
since it will take three <br>
instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some linkers can
create multiple GOTs. If you have such a linker, you should
only need to use -mxgot when a single object file accesses
more than 64k&rsquo;s worth of <br>
GOT entries. Very few do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options have no effect
unless GCC is generating position independent code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgp32 <br>
Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgp64 <br>
Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp32 <br>
Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp64 <br>
Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Do not use floating-point coprocessor instructions.
Implement floating-point calculations using library calls
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-float <br>
Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports
single-precision operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdouble-float <br>
Assume that the floating-point coprocessor supports
double-precision operations. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mllsc <br>
-mno-llsc <br>
Use (do not use) ll, sc, and sync instructions to implement
atomic memory built-in functions. When neither option is
specified, GCC will use the instructions if the target <br>
architecture supports them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mllsc is useful if the runtime
environment can emulate the instructions and -mno-llsc can
be useful when compiling for nonstandard ISAs. You can make
either option the <br>
default by configuring GCC with --with-llsc and
--without-llsc respectively. --with-llsc is the default for
some configurations; see the installation documentation for
<br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdsp <br>
-mno-dsp <br>
Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS DSP ASE. <br>
This option defines the preprocessor macro __mips_dsp. It
also defines __mips_dsp_rev to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdspr2 <br>
-mno-dspr2 <br>
Use (do not use) revision 2 of the MIPS DSP ASE. <br>
This option defines the preprocessor macros __mips_dsp and
__mips_dspr2. It also defines __mips_dsp_rev to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmartmips <br>
-mno-smartmips <br>
Use (do not use) the MIPS SmartMIPS ASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpaired-single <br>
-mno-paired-single <br>
Use (do not use) paired-single floating-point instructions.
<br>
This option requires hardware floating-point support to be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdmx <br>
-mno-mdmx <br>
Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media Extension instructions.
This option can only be used when generating 64-bit code and
requires hardware floating-point support to be <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips3d <br>
-mno-mips3d <br>
Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE. The option -mips3d implies
-mpaired-single.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmt <br>
-mno-mt <br>
Use (do not use) MT Multithreading instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong64 <br>
Force &quot;long&quot; types to be 64 bits wide. See
-mlong32 for an explanation of the default and the way that
the pointer size is determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong32 <br>
Force &quot;long&quot;, &quot;int&quot;, and pointer types
to be 32 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default size of
&quot;int&quot;s, &quot;long&quot;s and pointers depends on
the ABI. All the supported ABIs use 32-bit &quot;int&quot;s.
The n64 ABI uses 64-bit &quot;long&quot;s, as does the
64-bit EABI; the <br>
others use 32-bit &quot;long&quot;s. Pointers are the same
size as &quot;long&quot;s, or the same size as integer
registers, whichever is smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msym32 <br>
-mno-sym32 <br>
Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values,
regardless of the selected ABI. This option is useful in
combination with -mabi=64 and -mno-abicalls because it <br>
allows GCC to generate shorter and faster references to
symbolic addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G num <br>
Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data
section if that data is no bigger than num bytes. GCC can
then access the data more efficiently; see -mgpopt for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default -G option depends on
the configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlocal-sdata <br>
-mno-local-sdata <br>
Extend (do not extend) the -G behavior to local data too,
such as to static variables in C. -mlocal-sdata is the
default for all configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the linker complains that an
application is using too much small data, you might want to
try rebuilding the less performance-critical parts with
-mno-local-sdata. You <br>
might also want to build large libraries with
-mno-local-sdata, so that the libraries leave more room for
the main program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mextern-sdata <br>
-mno-extern-sdata <br>
Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data will be
in a small data section if that data is within the -G limit.
-mextern-sdata is the default for all <br>
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you compile a module Mod with
-mextern-sdata -G num -mgpopt, and Mod references a variable
Var that is no bigger than num bytes, you must make sure
that Var is placed in a <br>
small data section. If Var is defined by another module, you
must either compile that module with a high-enough -G
setting or attach a &quot;section&quot; attribute to
Var&rsquo;s <br>
definition. If Var is common, you must link the application
with a high-enough -G setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest way of satisfying
these restrictions is to compile and link every module with
the same -G option. However, you may wish to build a library
that supports several <br>
different small data limits. You can do this by compiling
the library with the highest supported -G setting and
additionally using -mno-extern-sdata to stop the library
from <br>
making assumptions about externally-defined data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgpopt <br>
-mno-gpopt <br>
Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are
known to be in a small data section; see -G, -mlocal-sdata
and -mextern-sdata. -mgpopt is the default for all <br>
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-gpopt is useful for cases
where the $gp register might not hold the value of
&quot;_gp&quot;. For example, if the code is part of a
library that might be used in a boot monitor, <br>
programs that call boot monitor routines will pass an
unknown value in $gp. (In such situations, the boot monitor
itself would usually be compiled with -G0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-gpopt implies
-mno-local-sdata and -mno-extern-sdata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-membedded-data <br>
-mno-embedded-data <br>
Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if
possible, then next in the small data section if possible,
otherwise in data. This gives slightly slower code than <br>
the default, but reduces the amount of RAM required when
executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muninit-const-in-rodata <br>
-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata <br>
Put uninitialized &quot;const&quot; variables in the
read-only data section. This option is only meaningful in
conjunction with -membedded-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=setting <br>
Specify whether GCC may generate code that reads from
executable sections. There are three possible settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=yes <br>
Instructions may freely access executable sections. This is
the default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=pcrel <br>
MIPS16 PC-relative load instructions can access executable
sections, but other instructions must not do so. This option
is useful on 4KSc and 4KSd processors when the <br>
code TLBs have the Read Inhibit bit set. It is also useful
on processors that can be configured to have a dual
instruction/data SRAM interface and that, like the M4K, <br>
automatically redirect PC-relative loads to the instruction
RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=no <br>
Instructions must not access executable sections. This
option can be useful on targets that are configured to have
a dual instruction/data SRAM interface but that <br>
(unlike the M4K) do not automatically redirect PC-relative
loads to the instruction RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msplit-addresses <br>
-mno-split-addresses <br>
Enable (disable) use of the &quot;%hi()&quot; and
&quot;%lo()&quot; assembler relocation operators. This
option has been superseded by -mexplicit-relocs but is
retained for backwards <br>
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexplicit-relocs <br>
-mno-explicit-relocs <br>
Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing
with symbolic addresses. The alternative, selected by
-mno-explicit-relocs, is to use assembler macros
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexplicit-relocs is the default
if GCC was configured to use an assembler that supports
relocation operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcheck-zero-division <br>
-mno-check-zero-division <br>
Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mcheck-zero-division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdivide-traps <br>
-mdivide-breaks <br>
MIPS systems check for division by zero by generating either
a conditional trap or a break instruction. Using traps
results in smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II
<br>
and later. Also, some versions of the Linux kernel have a
bug that prevents trap from generating the proper signal
(&quot;SIGFPE&quot;). Use -mdivide-traps to allow
conditional traps <br>
on architectures that support them and -mdivide-breaks to
force the use of breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is usually
-mdivide-traps, but this can be overridden at configure time
using --with-divide=breaks. Divide-by-zero checks can be
completely disabled using <br>
-mno-check-zero-division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemcpy <br>
-mno-memcpy <br>
Force (do not force) the use of &quot;memcpy()&quot; for
non-trivial block moves. The default is -mno-memcpy, which
allows GCC to inline most constant-sized copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Disable (do not disable) use of the &quot;jal&quot;
instruction. Calling functions using &quot;jal&quot; is more
efficient but requires the caller and callee to be in the
same 256 megabyte <br>
segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect on
abicalls code. The default is -mno-long-calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmad <br>
-mno-mad <br>
Enable (disable) use of the &quot;mad&quot;,
&quot;madu&quot; and &quot;mul&quot; instructions, as
provided by the R4650 ISA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Enable (disable) use of the floating-point
multiply-accumulate instructions, when they are available.
The default is -mfused-madd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When multiply-accumulate
instructions are used, the intermediate product is
calculated to infinite precision and is not subject to the
FCSR Flush to Zero bit. This may be <br>
undesirable in some circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocpp <br>
Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over
user assembler files (with a .s suffix) when assembling
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-24k <br>
-mno-fix-24k <br>
Work around the 24K E48 (lost data on stores during refill)
errata. The workarounds are implemented by the assembler
rather than by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-r4000 <br>
-mno-fix-r4000 <br>
Work around certain R4000 CPU errata:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A double-word or a variable
shift may give an incorrect result if executed immediately
after starting an integer division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A double-word or a variable
shift may give an incorrect result if executed while an
integer multiplication is in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- An integer division may give
an incorrect result if started in a delay slot of a taken
branch or a jump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-r4400 <br>

Work around certain R4400 CPU errata:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- A double-word or a variable
shift may give an incorrect result if executed immediately
after starting an integer division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-r10000 <br>
-mno-fix-r10000 <br>
Work around certain R10000 errata:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &quot;ll&quot;/&quot;sc&quot;
sequences may not behave atomically on revisions prior to
3.0. They may deadlock on revisions 2.6 and earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can only be used if
the target architecture supports branch-likely instructions.
-mfix-r10000 is the default when -march=r10000 is used;
-mno-fix-r10000 is the <br>
default otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-vr4120 <br>
-mno-fix-vr4120 <br>
Work around certain VR4120 errata:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &quot;dmultu&quot; does not
always produce the correct result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- &quot;div&quot; and
&quot;ddiv&quot; do not always produce the correct result if
one of the operands is negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The workarounds for the division
errata rely on special functions in libgcc.a. At present,
these functions are only provided by the
&quot;mips64vr*-elf&quot; configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other VR4120 errata require a
nop to be inserted between certain pairs of instructions.
These errata are handled by the assembler, not by GCC
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-vr4130 <br>
Work around the VR4130 &quot;mflo&quot;/&quot;mfhi&quot;
errata. The workarounds are implemented by the assembler
rather than by GCC, although GCC will avoid using
&quot;mflo&quot; and &quot;mfhi&quot; if the <br>
VR4130 &quot;macc&quot;, &quot;macchi&quot;,
&quot;dmacc&quot; and &quot;dmacchi&quot; instructions are
available instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-sb1 <br>
-mno-fix-sb1 <br>
Work around certain SB-1 CPU core errata. (This flag
currently works around the SB-1 revision 2 &quot;F1&quot;
and &quot;F2&quot; floating-point errata.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting
<br>
Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid
the side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In common with many processors,
the R10K tries to predict the outcome of a conditional
branch and speculatively executes instructions from the
&quot;taken&quot; branch. It later <br>
aborts these instructions if the predicted outcome was
wrong. However, on the R10K, even aborted instructions can
have side effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem only affects kernel
stores and, depending on the system, kernel loads. As an
example, a speculatively-executed store may load the target
memory into cache and <br>
mark the cache line as dirty, even if the store itself is
later aborted. If a DMA operation writes to the same area of
memory before the &quot;dirty&quot; line is flushed, the
cached <br>
data will overwrite the DMA-ed data. See the R10K processor
manual for a full description, including other potential
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One workaround is to insert
cache barrier instructions before every memory access that
might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted. <br>
-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting controls GCC&rsquo;s
implementation of this workaround. It assumes that aborted
accesses to any byte in the following regions will not have
side <br>
effects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the memory occupied by the
current function&rsquo;s stack frame;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. the memory occupied by an
incoming stack argument;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. the memory occupied by an
object with a link-time-constant address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is the kernel&rsquo;s
responsibility to ensure that speculative accesses to these
regions are indeed safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input program contains a
function declaration such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void foo (void);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the implementation of
&quot;foo&quot; must allow &quot;j foo&quot; and &quot;jal
foo&quot; to be executed speculatively. GCC honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself. It expects
<br>
non-GCC functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do
the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option has three forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store
<br>
Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=store <br>
Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=none <br>
Disable the insertion of cache barriers. This is the default
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflush-func=func <br>
-mno-flush-func <br>
Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches,
or to not call any such function. If called, the function
must take the same arguments as the common <br>
&quot;_flush_func()&quot;, that is, the address of the
memory range for which the cache is being flushed, the size
of the memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both
caches). The <br>
default depends on the target GCC was configured for, but
commonly is either _flush_func or __cpu_flush.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbranch-cost=num <br>
Set the cost of branches to roughly num &quot;simple&quot;
instructions. This cost is only a heuristic and is not
guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases. A
zero <br>
cost redundantly selects the default, which is based on the
-mtune setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-likely <br>
-mno-branch-likely <br>
Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions,
regardless of the default for the selected architecture. By
default, Branch Likely instructions may be generated if they
<br>
are supported by the selected architecture. An exception is
for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures and processors that
implement those architectures; for those, Branch <br>
Likely instructions will not be generated by default because
the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate
their use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-exceptions <br>
-mno-fp-exceptions <br>
Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled. This affects
how we schedule FP instructions for some processors. The
default is that FP exceptions are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, on the SB-1, if FP
exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting 64-bit code,
then we can use both FP pipes. Otherwise, we can only use
one FP pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvr4130-align <br>
-mno-vr4130-align <br>
The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only
issue two instructions together if the first one is 8-byte
aligned. When this option is enabled, GCC will align <br>
pairs of instructions that it thinks should execute in
parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option only has an effect
when optimizing for the VR4130. It normally makes code
faster, but at the expense of making it bigger. It is
enabled by default at <br>
optimization level -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msynci <br>
-mno-synci <br>
Enable (disable) generation of &quot;synci&quot;
instructions on architectures that support it. The
&quot;synci&quot; instructions (if enabled) will be
generated when <br>
&quot;__builtin___clear_cache()&quot; is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option defaults to
&quot;-mno-synci&quot;, but the default can be overridden by
configuring with &quot;--with-synci&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling code for single
processor systems, it is generally safe to use
&quot;synci&quot;. However, on many multi-core (SMP)
systems, it will not invalidate the instruction <br>
caches on all cores and may lead to undefined behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax-pic-calls <br>
-mno-relax-pic-calls <br>
Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via
register $25 into direct calls. This is only possible if the
linker can resolve the destination at link-time and if <br>
the destination is within range for a direct call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax-pic-calls is the default
if GCC was configured to use an assembler and a linker that
supports the &quot;.reloc&quot; assembly directive and
&quot;-mexplicit-relocs&quot; is in effect. <br>
With &quot;-mno-explicit-relocs&quot;, this optimization can
be performed by the assembler and the linker alone without
help from the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmcount-ra-address <br>
-mno-mcount-ra-address <br>
Emit (do not emit) code that allows &quot;_mcount&quot; to
modify the calling function&rsquo;s return address. When
enabled, this option extends the usual &quot;_mcount&quot;
interface with a new ra- <br>
address parameter, which has type &quot;intptr_t *&quot; and
is passed in register $12. &quot;_mcount&quot; can then
modify the return address by doing both of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Returning the
new address in register $31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Storing the new
address in &quot;*ra-address&quot;, if ra-address is
nonnull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mno-mcount-ra-address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMIX Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
the MMIX:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlibfuncs <br>
-mno-libfuncs <br>
Specify that intrinsic library functions are being compiled,
passing all values in registers, no matter the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mepsilon <br>
-mno-epsilon <br>
Generate floating-point comparison instructions that compare
with respect to the &quot;rE&quot; epsilon register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=mmixware <br>
-mabi=gnu <br>
Generate code that passes function parameters and return
values that (in the called function) are seen as registers
$0 and up, as opposed to the GNU ABI which uses global <br>
registers $231 and up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mzero-extend <br>
-mno-zero-extend <br>
When reading data from memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits,
use (do not use) zero-extending load instructions by
default, rather than sign-extending ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mknuthdiv <br>
-mno-knuthdiv <br>
Make the result of a division yielding a remainder have the
same sign as the divisor. With the default, -mno-knuthdiv,
the sign of the remainder follows the sign of the <br>
dividend. Both methods are arithmetically valid, the latter
being almost exclusively used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtoplevel-symbols <br>
-mno-toplevel-symbols <br>
Prepend (do not prepend) a : to all global symbols, so the
assembly code can be used with the &quot;PREFIX&quot;
assembly directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-melf <br>
Generate an executable in the ELF format, rather than the
default mmo format used by the mmix simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-predict <br>
-mno-branch-predict <br>
Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when
static branch prediction indicates a probable branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbase-addresses <br>
-mno-base-addresses <br>
Generate (do not generate) code that uses base addresses.
Using a base address automatically generates a request
(handled by the assembler and the linker) for a constant to
<br>
be set up in a global register. The register is used for one
or more base address requests within the range 0 to 255 from
the value held in the register. The generally <br>
leads to short and fast code, but the number of different
data items that can be addressed is limited. This means that
a program that uses lots of static data may require <br>
-mno-base-addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-exit <br>
-mno-single-exit <br>
Force (do not force) generated code to have a single exit
point in each function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MN10300 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mam33 <br>
Generate code using features specific to the AM33

Generate code using features specific to the AM33/2.0
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mam34 <br>
Generate code using features specific to the AM34
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu-type <br>
Use the timing characteristics of the indicated CPU type
when scheduling instructions. This does not change the
targeted processor type. The CPU type must be one of <br>
mn10300, am33, am33-2 or am34.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mreturn-pointer-on-d0 <br>
When generating a function that returns a pointer, return
the pointer in both &quot;a0&quot; and &quot;d0&quot;.
Otherwise, the pointer is returned only in a0, and attempts
to call such <br>
functions without a prototype would result in errors. Note
that this option is on by default; use
-mno-return-pointer-on-d0 to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-crt0 <br>
Do not link in the C run-time initialization object
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation
optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and absolute
memory addresses. This option only has an effect when <br>
used on the command line for the final link step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option makes symbolic
debugging impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mliw <br>
Allow the compiler to generate Long Instruction Word

default. This option defines the preprocessor macro <br>
__LIW__.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnoliw <br>
Do not allow the compiler to generate Long Instruction Word
instructions. This option defines the preprocessor macro
__NO_LIW__.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msetlb <br>
Allow the compiler to generate the SETLB and Lcc
instructions if the target is the AM33 or later. This is the
default. This option defines the preprocessor macro
__SETLB__.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnosetlb <br>
Do not allow the compiler to generate SETLB or Lcc

<p style="margin-top: 1em">picoChip Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
picoChip implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=ae_type <br>
Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
scheduling parameters for array element type ae_type.
Supported values for ae_type are ANY, MUL, and MAC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=ANY selects a completely
generic AE type. Code generated with this option will run on
any of the other AE types. The code will not be as efficient
as it would be if <br>
compiled for a specific AE type, and some types of operation
(e.g., multiplication) will not work properly on all types
of AE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=MUL selects a MUL AE type.
This is the most useful AE type for compiled code, and is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=MAC selects a DSP-style MAC
AE. Code compiled with this option may suffer from poor
performance of byte (char) manipulation, since the DSP AE
does not provide hardware <br>
support for byte load/stores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msymbol-as-address <br>
Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an
address in a load/store instruction, without first loading
it into a register. Typically, the use of this option will
<br>
generate larger programs, which run faster than when the
option isn&rsquo;t used. However, the results vary from
program to program, so it is left as a user option, rather
than <br>
being permanently enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-inefficient-warnings <br>
Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.
These warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling
code that performs byte-level memory operations on <br>
the MAC AE type. The MAC AE has no hardware support for
byte-level memory operations, so all byte load/stores must
be synthesized from word load/store operations. This is <br>
inefficient and a warning will be generated indicating to
the programmer that they should rewrite the code to avoid
byte operations, or to target an AE type that has the <br>
necessary hardware support. This option enables the warning
to be turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmul=none <br>
-mmul=g13 <br>
-mmul=rl78 <br>
Specifies the type of hardware multiplication support to be

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC
Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpower <br>

-mno-mfpgpr <br>
-mhard-dfp <br>
-mno-hard-dfp <br>
GCC supports two related instruction set architectures for
the RS/6000 and PowerPC. The POWER instruction set are those
instructions supported by the rios chip set used in <br>
the original RS/6000 systems and the PowerPC instruction set
is the architecture of the Freescale MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx
microprocessors, and the IBM 4xx, 6xx, and follow-on <br>
microprocessors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither architecture is a subset
of the other. However there is a large common subset of
instructions supported by both. An MQ register is included
in processors supporting <br>
the POWER architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You use these options to specify
which instructions are available on the processor you are
using. The default value of these options is determined when
configuring GCC. <br>
Specifying the -mcpu=cpu_type overrides the specification of
these options. We recommend you use the -mcpu=cpu_type
option rather than the options listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mpower option allows GCC to
generate instructions that are found only in the POWER
architecture and to use the MQ register. Specifying -mpower2
implies -power and also <br>
allows GCC to generate instructions that are present in the
POWER2 architecture but not the original POWER
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mpowerpc option allows GCC
to generate instructions that are found only in the 32-bit
subset of the PowerPC architecture. Specifying
-mpowerpc-gpopt implies -mpowerpc <br>
and also allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture
instructions in the General Purpose group, including
floating-point square root. Specifying -mpowerpc-gfxopt <br>
implies -mpowerpc and also allows GCC to use the optional
PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics group,
including floating-point select.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mmfcrf option allows GCC to
generate the move from condition register field instruction
implemented on the POWER4 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC <br>
V2.01 architecture. The -mpopcntb option allows GCC to
generate the popcount and double-precision FP reciprocal
estimate instruction implemented on the POWER5 processor and
<br>
other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture. The -mpopcntd option allows GCC to generate
the popcount instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor
and <br>
other processors that support the PowerPC V2.06
architecture. The -mfprnd option allows GCC to generate the
FP round to integer instructions implemented on the POWER5+
<br>
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC
V2.03 architecture. The -mcmpb option allows GCC to generate
the compare bytes instruction implemented on the POWER6 <br>
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC
V2.05 architecture. The -mmfpgpr option allows GCC to
generate the FP move to/from general-purpose register <br>
instructions implemented on the POWER6X processor and other
processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05
architecture. The -mhard-dfp option allows GCC to generate
the <br>
decimal floating-point instructions implemented on some
POWER processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mpowerpc64 option allows
GCC to generate the additional 64-bit instructions that are
found in the full PowerPC64 architecture and to treat GPRs
as 64-bit, doubleword <br>
quantities. GCC defaults to -mno-powerpc64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify both -mno-power
and -mno-powerpc, GCC will use only the instructions in the
common subset of both architectures plus some special AIX
common-mode calls, and <br>
will not use the MQ register. Specifying both -mpower and
-mpowerpc permits GCC to use any instruction from either
architecture and to allow use of the MQ register; specify
<br>
this for the Motorola MPC601.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnew-mnemonics <br>
-mold-mnemonics <br>
Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler
code. With -mnew-mnemonics, GCC uses the assembler mnemonics
defined for the PowerPC architecture. With <br>
-mold-mnemonics it uses the assembler mnemonics defined for
the POWER architecture. Instructions defined in only one
architecture have only one mnemonic; GCC uses that <br>
mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defaults to the mnemonics
appropriate for the architecture in use. Specifying
-mcpu=cpu_type sometimes overrides the value of these
option. Unless you are building a <br>
cross-compiler, you should normally not specify either
-mnew-mnemonics or -mold-mnemonics, but should instead
accept the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu_type <br>
Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics,
and instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
cpu_type. Supported values for cpu_type are 401, 403, 405,
<br>
405fp, 440, 440fp, 464, 464fp, 476, 476fp, 505, 601, 602,
603, 603e, 604, 604e, 620, 630, 740, 7400, 7450, 750, 801,
821, 823, 860, 970, 8540, a2, e300c2, e300c3, e500mc, <br>
e500mc64, ec603e, G3, G4, G5, titan, power, power2, power3,
power4, power5, power5+, power6, power6x, power7, common,
powerpc, powerpc64, rios, rios1, rios2, rsc, and rs64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=common selects a
completely generic processor. Code generated under this
option will run on any POWER or PowerPC processor. GCC will
use only the instructions in the <br>
common subset of both architectures, and will not use the MQ
register. GCC assumes a generic processor model for
scheduling purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=power, -mcpu=power2,
-mcpu=powerpc, and -mcpu=powerpc64 specify generic POWER,
POWER2, pure 32-bit PowerPC (i.e., not MPC601), and 64-bit
PowerPC architecture machine <br>
types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed
for scheduling purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other options specify a
specific processor. Code generated under those options will
run best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mcpu options automatically
enable or disable the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maltivec -mfprnd -mhard-float
-mmfcrf -mmultiple -mnew-mnemonics -mpopcntb -mpopcntd
-mpower -mpower2 -mpowerpc64 -mpowerpc-gpopt
-mpowerpc-gfxopt -msingle-float <br>
-mdouble-float -msimple-fpu -mstring -mmulhw -mdlmzb
-mmfpgpr -mvsx</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The particular options set for
any particular CPU will vary between compiler versions,
depending on what setting seems to produce optimal code for
that CPU; it doesn&rsquo;t <br>
necessarily reflect the actual hardware&rsquo;s
capabilities. If you wish to set an individual option to a
particular value, you may specify it after the -mcpu option,
like <br>
-mcpu=970 -mno-altivec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On AIX, the -maltivec and
-mpowerpc64 options are not enabled or disabled by the -mcpu
option at present because AIX does not have full support for
these options. You may <br>
still enable or disable them individually if you&rsquo;re
sure it&rsquo;ll work in your environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
cpu_type, but do not set the architecture type, register
usage, or choice of mnemonics, as -mcpu=cpu_type would. <br>
The same values for cpu_type are used for -mtune as for
-mcpu. If both are specified, the code generated will use
the architecture, registers, and mnemonics set by -mcpu,
<br>
but the scheduling parameters set by -mtune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=small <br>
Generate PowerPC64 code for the small model: The TOC is
limited to 64k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=medium <br>
Generate PowerPC64 code for the medium model: The TOC and
other static data may be up to a total of 4G in size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=large <br>
Generate PowerPC64 code for the large model: The TOC may be
up to 4G in size. Other data and code is only limited by the
64-bit address space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maltivec <br>
-mno-altivec <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions,
and also enable the use of built-in functions that allow
more direct access to the AltiVec instruction set. You <br>
may also need to set -mabi=altivec to adjust the current ABI
with AltiVec ABI enhancements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvrsave <br>
-mno-vrsave <br>
Generate VRSAVE instructions when generating AltiVec
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgen-cell-microcode <br>
Generate Cell microcode instructions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-cell-microcode <br>
Warning when a Cell microcode instruction is going to
emitted. An example of a Cell microcode instruction is a
variable shift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msecure-plt <br>
Generate code that allows ld and ld.so to build executables
and shared libraries with non-exec .plt and .got sections.
This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbss-plt <br>
Generate code that uses a BSS .plt section that ld.so fills
in, and requires .plt and .got sections that are both
writable and executable. This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI
<br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-misel <br>
-mno-isel <br>
This switch enables or disables the generation of ISEL
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-misel=yes/no <br>
This switch has been deprecated. Use -misel and -mno-isel
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspe <br>
-mno-spe <br>
This switch enables or disables the generation of SPE simd
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpaired <br>
-mno-paired <br>
This switch enables or disables the generation of PAIRED
simd instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspe=yes/no <br>
This option has been deprecated. Use -mspe and -mno-spe
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvsx <br>
-mno-vsx <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) vector/scalar (VSX)
instructions, and also enable the use of built-in functions
that allow more direct access to the VSX instruction <br>
set.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat-gprs=yes/single/double/no
<br>
-mfloat-gprs <br>
This switch enables or disables the generation of
floating-point operations on the general-purpose registers
for architectures that support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument yes or single
enables the use of single-precision floating-point
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument double enables the
use of single and double-precision floating-point
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument no disables
floating-point operations on the general-purpose
registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is currently only
available on the MPC854x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin
and SVR4 targets (including GNU/Linux). The 32-bit
environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and
generates <br>
code that runs on any PowerPC variant. The 64-bit
environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64
bits, and generates code for PowerPC64, as for
-mpowerpc64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfull-toc <br>
-mno-fp-in-toc <br>
-mno-sum-in-toc <br>
-mminimal-toc <br>
Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is
created for every executable file. The -mfull-toc option is
selected by default. In that case, GCC will allocate <br>
at least one TOC entry for each unique non-automatic
variable reference in your program. GCC will also place
floating-point constants in the TOC. However, only 16,384
<br>
entries are available in the TOC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you receive a linker error
message that saying you have overflowed the available TOC
space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used with the
-mno-fp-in-toc and <br>
-mno-sum-in-toc options. -mno-fp-in-toc prevents GCC from
putting floating-point constants in the TOC and
-mno-sum-in-toc forces GCC to generate code to calculate the
sum of <br>
an address and a constant at run time instead of putting
that sum into the TOC. You may specify one or both of these
options. Each causes GCC to produce very slightly <br>
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you still run out of space in
the TOC even when you specify both of these options, specify
-mminimal-toc instead. This option causes GCC to make only
one TOC entry for <br>
every file. When you specify this option, GCC will produce
code that is slower and larger but which uses extremely
little TOC space. You may wish to use this option only on
<br>
files that contain less frequently executed code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maix64 <br>
-maix32 <br>
Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit
pointers, 64-bit &quot;long&quot; type, and the
infrastructure needed to support them. Specifying -maix64
implies -mpowerpc64 and <br>
-mpowerpc, while -maix32 disables the 64-bit ABI and implies
-mno-powerpc64. GCC defaults to -maix32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxl-compat <br>
-mno-xl-compat <br>
Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler
semantics when using AIX-compatible ABI. Pass floating-point
arguments to prototyped functions beyond the register <br>
save area (RSA) on the stack in addition to argument FPRs.
Do not assume that most significant double in 128-bit long
double value is properly rounded when comparing values <br>
and converting to double. Use XL symbol names for long
double support routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AIX calling convention was
extended but not initially documented to handle an obscure
K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the address
of its arguments with fewer <br>
arguments than declared. IBM XL compilers access
floating-point arguments that do not fit in the RSA from the
stack when a subroutine is compiled without optimization.
<br>
Because always storing floating-point arguments on the stack
is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled
by default and only is necessary when calling <br>
subroutines compiled by IBM XL compilers without
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpe <br>
Support IBM RS/6000 SP Parallel Environment (PE). Link an
application written to use message passing with special
startup code to enable the application to run. The system
<br>
must have PE installed in the standard location
(/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/), or the specs file must be overridden
with the -specs= option to specify the appropriate directory
<br>
location. The Parallel Environment does not support threads,
so the -mpe option and the -pthread option are
incompatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-natural <br>
-malign-power <br>
On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the
option -malign-natural overrides the ABI-defined alignment
of larger types, such as floating-point doubles, on their
<br>
natural size-based boundary. The option -malign-power
instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified alignment rules.
GCC defaults to the standard alignment defined in the
ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On 64-bit Darwin, natural
alignment is the default, and -malign-power is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
-mhard-float <br>
Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point
register set. Software floating-point emulation is provided
if you use the -msoft-float option, and pass the option <br>
to GCC when linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-float <br>
-mdouble-float <br>
Generate code for single- or double-precision floating-point
operations. -mdouble-float implies -msingle-float.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msimple-fpu <br>
Do not generate sqrt and div instructions for hardware
floating-point unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu <br>
Specify type of floating-point unit. Valid values are
sp_lite (equivalent to -msingle-float -msimple-fpu), dp_lite
(equivalent to -mdouble-float -msimple-fpu), sp_full <br>
(equivalent to -msingle-float), and dp_full (equivalent to
-mdouble-float).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxilinx-fpu <br>
Perform optimizations for the floating-point unit on Xilinx
PPC 405/440.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmultiple <br>
-mno-multiple <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple
word instructions and the store multiple word instructions.
These instructions are generated by default on POWER <br>
systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems. Do not use
-mmultiple on little-endian PowerPC systems, since those
instructions do not work when the processor is in little-
<br>
endian mode. The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which
permit these instructions in little-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstring <br>
-mno-string <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string
instructions and the store string word instructions to save
multiple registers and do small block moves. These <br>
instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and
not generated on PowerPC systems. Do not use -mstring on
little-endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions <br>
do not work when the processor is in little-endian mode. The
exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit these
instructions in little-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mupdate <br>
-mno-update <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store
instructions that update the base register to the address of
the calculated memory location. These instructions are <br>
generated by default. If you use -mno-update, there is a
small window between the time that the stack pointer is
updated and the address of the previous frame is stored,
<br>
which means code that walks the stack frame across
interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mavoid-indexed-addresses <br>
-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses <br>
Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of
indexed load or store instructions. These instructions can
incur a performance penalty on Power6 processors in <br>
certain situations, such as when stepping through large
arrays that cross a 16M boundary. This option is enabled by
default when targetting Power6 and disabled otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
multiply and accumulate instructions. These instructions are
generated by default if hardware floating point is <br>
used. The machine-dependent -mfused-madd option is now
mapped to the machine-independent -ffp-contract=fast option,
and -mno-fused-madd is mapped to -ffp-contract=off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmulhw <br>
-mno-mulhw <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word
multiply and multiply-accumulate instructions on the IBM
405, 440, 464 and 476 processors. These instructions are
<br>
generated by default when targetting those processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdlmzb <br>
-mno-dlmzb <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search
dlmzb instruction on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476
processors. This instruction is generated by default when
<br>
targetting those processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-bit-align <br>
-mbit-align <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force
structures and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned
to the base type of the bit-field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, by default a
structure containing nothing but 8 &quot;unsigned&quot;
bit-fields of length 1 is aligned to a 4-byte boundary and
has a size of 4 bytes. By using <br>
-mno-bit-align, the structure is aligned to a 1-byte
boundary and is 1 byte in size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-strict-align <br>
-mstrict-align <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do)
assume that unaligned memory references will be handled by
the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelocatable <br>
-mno-relocatable <br>
Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static
executable to be relocated to a different address at run
time. A simple embedded PowerPC system loader should
relocate <br>
the entire contents of &quot;.got2&quot; and 4-byte
locations listed in the &quot;.fixup&quot; section, a table
of 32-bit addresses generated by this option. For this to
work, all objects <br>
linked together must be compiled with -mrelocatable or
-mrelocatable-lib. -mrelocatable code aligns the stack to an
8-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelocatable-lib <br>
-mno-relocatable-lib <br>
Like -mrelocatable, -mrelocatable-lib generates a
&quot;.fixup&quot; section to allow static executables to be
relocated at run time, but -mrelocatable-lib does not use
the smaller <br>
stack alignment of -mrelocatable. Objects compiled with
-mrelocatable-lib may be linked with objects compiled with
any combination of the -mrelocatable options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-toc <br>
-mtoc <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do)
assume that register 2 contains a pointer to a global area
pointing to the addresses used in the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle <br>
-mlittle-endian <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for
the processor in little-endian mode. The -mlittle-endian
option is the same as -mlittle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig <br>
-mbig-endian <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for
the processor in big-endian mode. The -mbig-endian option is
the same as -mbig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdynamic-no-pic <br>
On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is
not relocatable, but that its external references are
relocatable. The resulting code is suitable for <br>
applications, but not shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-pic-base <br>
Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only,
rather than loading it in the prologue for each function.
The runtime system is responsible for initializing this <br>
register with an appropriate value before execution
begins.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprioritize-restricted-insns=priority
<br>
This option controls the priority that is assigned to
dispatch-slot restricted instructions during the second
scheduling pass. The argument priority takes the value 0/1/2
to <br>
assign no/highest/second-highest priority to dispatch slot
restricted instructions.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-costly-dep=dependence_type
<br>
This option controls which dependences are considered costly
by the target during instruction scheduling. The argument
dependence_type takes one of the following values: no: <br>
no dependence is costly, all: all dependences are costly,
true_store_to_load: a true dependence from store to load is
costly, store_to_load: any dependence from store to load
<br>
is costly, number: any dependence for which latency &gt;=
number is costly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minsert-sched-nops=scheme <br>
This option controls which nop insertion scheme will be used
during the second scheduling pass. The argument scheme takes
one of the following values: no: Don&rsquo;t insert nops.
<br>
pad: Pad with nops any dispatch group that has vacant issue
slots, according to the scheduler&rsquo;s grouping.
regroup_exact: Insert nops to force costly dependent insns
into <br>
separate groups. Insert exactly as many nops as needed to
force an insn to a new group, according to the estimated
processor grouping. number: Insert nops to force costly <br>
dependent insns into separate groups. Insert number nops to
force an insn to a new group.</p>

Return structures smaller than 8 bytes in registers (as
specified by the SVR4 ABI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=abi-type <br>
Extend the current ABI with a particular extension, or
remove such extension. Valid values are altivec, no-altivec,
spe, no-spe, ibmlongdouble, ieeelongdouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=spe <br>
Extend the current ABI with SPE ABI extensions. This does
not change the default ABI, instead it adds the SPE ABI
extensions to the current ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=no-spe <br>
Disable Booke SPE ABI extensions for the current ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=ibmlongdouble <br>
Change the current ABI to use IBM extended-precision long

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=ieeelongdouble <br>
Change the current ABI to use IEEE extended-precision long
double. This is a PowerPC 32-bit Linux ABI option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprototype <br>
-mno-prototype <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all
calls to variable argument functions are properly
prototyped. Otherwise, the compiler must insert an
instruction <br>
before every non prototyped call to set or clear bit 6 of
the condition code register (CR) to indicate whether
floating-point values were passed in the floating-point <br>
registers in case the function takes variable arguments.
With -mprototype, only calls to prototyped variable argument
functions will set or clear the bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module
is called sim-crt0.o and that the standard C libraries are
libsim.a and libc.a. This is the default for <br>
powerpc-*-eabisim configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmvme <br>

On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, specify that you
are compiling for a VxWorks system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memb <br>
On embedded PowerPC systems, set the PPC_EMB bit in the ELF
flags header to indicate that eabi extended relocations are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meabi <br>
-mno-eabi <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not)
adhere to the Embedded Applications Binary Interface (eabi)
which is a set of modifications to the System V.4 <br>
specifications. Selecting -meabi means that the stack is
aligned to an 8-byte boundary, a function &quot;__eabi&quot;
is called to from &quot;main&quot; to set up the eabi
environment, and the <br>
-msdata option can use both &quot;r2&quot; and
&quot;r13&quot; to point to two separate small data areas.
Selecting -mno-eabi means that the stack is aligned to a
16-byte boundary, do not call <br>
an initialization function from &quot;main&quot;, and the
-msdata option will only use &quot;r13&quot; to point to a
single small data area. The -meabi option is on by default
if you configured <br>
GCC using one of the powerpc*-*-eabi* options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=eabi <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small
initialized &quot;const&quot; global and static data in the
.sdata2 section, which is pointed to by register
&quot;r2&quot;. Put small <br>
initialized non-&quot;const&quot; global and static data in
the .sdata section, which is pointed to by register
&quot;r13&quot;. Put small uninitialized global and static
data in the .sbss <br>
section, which is adjacent to the .sdata section. The
-msdata=eabi option is incompatible with the -mrelocatable
option. The -msdata=eabi option also sets the -memb
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=sysv <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global
and static data in the .sdata section, which is pointed to
by register &quot;r13&quot;. Put small uninitialized global
and <br>
static data in the .sbss section, which is adjacent to the
.sdata section. The -msdata=sysv option is incompatible with
the -mrelocatable option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=default <br>
-msdata <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, if -meabi is
used, compile code the same as -msdata=eabi, otherwise
compile code the same as -msdata=sysv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=data <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems, put small global
data in the .sdata section. Put small uninitialized global
data in the .sbss section. Do not use register
&quot;r13&quot; <br>
to address small data however. This is the default behavior
unless other -msdata options are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=none <br>
-mno-sdata <br>
On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and
static data in the .data section, and all uninitialized data
in the .bss section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mblock-move-inline-limit=num
<br>
Inline all block moves (such as calls to &quot;memcpy&quot;
or structure copies) less than or equal to num bytes. The
minimum value for num is 32 bytes on 32-bit targets and 64
bytes <br>
on 64-bit targets. The default value is target-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G num <br>
On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items
less than or equal to num bytes into the small data or bss
sections instead of the normal data or bss section. By <br>
default, num is 8. The -G num switch is also passed to the
linker. All modules should be compiled with the same -G num
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mregnames <br>
-mno-regnames <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit
register names in the assembly language output using
symbolic forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlongcall <br>
-mno-longcall <br>
By default assume that all calls are far away so that a
longer more expensive calling sequence is required. This is
required for calls further than 32 megabytes (33,554,432
<br>
bytes) from the current location. A short call will be
generated if the compiler knows the call cannot be that far
away. This setting can be overridden by the
&quot;shortcall&quot; <br>
function attribute, or by &quot;#pragma
longcall(0)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some linkers are capable of
detecting out-of-range calls and generating glue code on the
fly. On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code. As of <br>
this writing, the AIX linker can do this, as can the GNU
linker for PowerPC/64. It is planned to add this feature to
the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Darwin/PPC systems,
&quot;#pragma longcall&quot; will generate &quot;jbsr
callee, L42&quot;, plus a &quot;branch island&quot; (glue
code). The two target addresses represent the callee and the
&quot;branch <br>
island&quot;. The Darwin/PPC linker will prefer the first
address and generate a &quot;bl callee&quot; if the PPC
&quot;bl&quot; instruction will reach the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker <br>
will generate &quot;bl L42&quot; to call the &quot;branch
island&quot;. The &quot;branch island&quot; is appended to
the body of the calling function; it computes the full
32-bit address of the callee <br>
and jumps to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this
option directs the compiler emit to the glue for every
direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether to use or
discard it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the future, we may cause GCC
to ignore all longcall specifications when the linker is
known to generate glue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-markers <br>
-mno-tls-markers <br>
Mark (do not mark) calls to &quot;__tls_get_addr&quot; with
a relocation specifying the function argument. The
relocation allows ld to reliably associate function call
with argument <br>
setup instructions for TLS optimization, which in turn
allows gcc to better schedule the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pthread <br>
Adds support for multithreading with the pthreads library.
This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip <br>
-mno-recip <br>
This option will enable GCC to use the reciprocal estimate
and reciprocal square root estimate instructions with
additional Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision
instead <br>
of doing a divide or square root and divide for
floating-point arguments. You should use the -ffast-math
option when using -mrecip (or at least
-funsafe-math-optimizations, <br>
-finite-math-only, -freciprocal-math and
-fno-trapping-math). Note that while the throughput of the
sequence is generally higher than the throughput of the
non-reciprocal <br>
instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased
by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994)
for reciprocal square roots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip=opt <br>
This option allows to control which reciprocal estimate
instructions may be used. opt is a comma separated list of
options, which may be preceded by a &quot;!&quot; to invert
the <br>
option: &quot;all&quot;: enable all estimate instructions,
&quot;default&quot;: enable the default instructions,
equivalent to -mrecip, &quot;none&quot;: disable all
estimate instructions, equivalent to <br>
-mno-recip; &quot;div&quot;: enable the reciprocal
approximation instructions for both single and double
precision; &quot;divf&quot;: enable the single-precision
reciprocal approximation <br>
instructions; &quot;divd&quot;: enable the double-precision
reciprocal approximation instructions; &quot;rsqrt&quot;:
enable the reciprocal square root approximation instructions
for both single <br>
and double precision; &quot;rsqrtf&quot;: enable the
single-precision reciprocal square root approximation
instructions; &quot;rsqrtd&quot;: enable the
double-precision reciprocal square root <br>
approximation instructions;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So for example,
-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd would enable the all of the reciprocal
estimate instructions, except for the &quot;FRSQRTE&quot;,
&quot;XSRSQRTEDP&quot;, and &quot;XVRSQRTEDP&quot;
instructions which <br>
handle the double-precision reciprocal square root
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip-precision <br>
-mno-recip-precision <br>
Assume (do not assume) that the reciprocal estimate
instructions provide higher-precision estimates than is
mandated by the PowerPC ABI. Selecting -mcpu=power6 or <br>
-mcpu=power7 automatically selects -mrecip-precision. The
double-precision square root estimate instructions are not
generated by default on low-precision machines, since <br>
they do not provide an estimate that converges after three
steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mveclibabi=type <br>
Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics
using an external library. The only type supported at
present is &quot;mass&quot;, which specifies to use
IBM&rsquo;s Mathematical <br>
Acceleration Subsystem (MASS) libraries for vectorizing
intrinsics using external libraries. GCC will currently emit
calls to &quot;acosd2&quot;, &quot;acosf4&quot;,
&quot;acoshd2&quot;, &quot;acoshf4&quot;, <br>
&quot;asind2&quot;, &quot;asinf4&quot;, &quot;asinhd2&quot;,

&quot;sqrtf4&quot;, &quot;tand2&quot;, &quot;tanf4&quot;,
&quot;tanhd2&quot;, and &quot;tanhf4&quot; when <br>
generating code for power7. Both -ftree-vectorize and
-funsafe-math-optimizations have to be enabled. The MASS
libraries will have to be specified at link time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfriz <br>
-mno-friz <br>
Generate (do not generate) the &quot;friz&quot; instruction
when the -funsafe-math-optimizations option is used to
optimize rounding of floating-point values to 64-bit integer
and back <br>
to floating point. The &quot;friz&quot; instruction does not
return the same value if the floating-point number is too
large to fit in an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpointers-to-nested-functions
<br>
-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions <br>
Generate (do not generate) code to load up the static chain
register (r11) when calling through a pointer on AIX and
64-bit Linux systems where a function pointer points to a
<br>
3-word descriptor giving the function address, TOC value to
be loaded in register r2, and static chain value to be
loaded in register r11. The -mpointers-to-nested-functions
<br>
is on by default. You will not be able to call through
pointers to nested functions or pointers to functions
compiled in other languages that use the static chain if you
use <br>
the -mno-pointers-to-nested-functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msave-toc-indirect <br>
-mno-save-toc-indirect <br>
Generate (do not generate) code to save the TOC value in the
reserved stack location in the function prologue if the
function calls through a pointer on AIX and 64-bit Linux
<br>
systems. If the TOC value is not saved in the prologue, it
is saved just before the call through the pointer. The
-mno-save-toc-indirect option is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RX Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These command-line options are
defined for RX targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m64bit-doubles <br>
-m32bit-doubles <br>
Make the &quot;double&quot; data type be 64 bits
(-m64bit-doubles) or 32 bits (-m32bit-doubles) in size. The
default is -m32bit-doubles. Note RX floating-point hardware
only works on <br>
32-bit values, which is why the default is
-m32bit-doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpu <br>
-nofpu <br>
Enables (-fpu) or disables (-nofpu) the use of RX
floating-point hardware. The default is enabled for the
RX600 series and disabled for the RX200 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating-point instructions will
only be generated for 32-bit floating-point values however,
so if the -m64bit-doubles option is in use then the FPU
hardware will not be used <br>
for doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note If the -fpu option is
enabled then -funsafe-math-optimizations is also enabled
automatically. This is because the RX FPU instructions are
themselves unsafe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted. Currently three
types are supported, the generic RX600 and RX200 series
hardware and the specific RX610 CPU. The default is <br>
RX600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only difference between
RX600 and RX610 is that the RX610 does not support the
&quot;MVTIPL&quot; instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RX200 series does not have a
hardware floating-point unit and so -nofpu is enabled by
default when this type is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian-data <br>
-mlittle-endian-data <br>
Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format. The
default is -mlittle-endian-data, i.e. to store data in the
little-endian format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-data-limit=N <br>
Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static
variables which can be placed into the small data area.
Using the small data area can lead to smaller and faster
<br>
code, but the size of area is limited and it is up to the
programmer to ensure that the area does not overflow. Also
when the small data area is used one of the RX&rsquo;s <br>
registers (usually &quot;r13&quot;) is reserved for use
pointing to this area, so it is no longer available for use
by the compiler. This could result in slower and/or larger
code if <br>
variables which once could have been held in the reserved
register are now pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, common variables
(variables that have not been initialized) and constants are
not placed into the small data area as they are assigned to
other sections in the output <br>
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is zero, which
disables this feature. Note, this feature is not enabled by
default with higher optimization levels (-O2 etc) because of
the potentially <br>
detrimental effects of reserving a register. It is up to the
programmer to experiment and discover whether this feature
is of benefit to their program. See the description <br>
of the -mpid option for a description of how the actual
register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
-mno-sim <br>
Use the simulator runtime. The default is to use the
libgloss board specific runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mas100-syntax <br>
-mno-as100-syntax <br>
When generating assembler output use a syntax that is
compatible with Renesas&rsquo;s AS100 assembler. This syntax
can also be handled by the GAS assembler but it has some
<br>
restrictions so generating it is not the default option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmax-constant-size=N <br>
Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can
be used as an operand in a RX instruction. Although the RX
instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes <br>
in length to be used in instructions, a longer value equates
to a longer instruction. Thus in some circumstances it can
be beneficial to restrict the size of constants that <br>
are used in instructions. Constants that are too big are
instead placed into a constant pool and referenced via
register indirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value N can be between 0 and
4. A value of 0 (the default) or 4 means that constants of
any size are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Enable linker relaxation. Linker relaxation is a process
whereby the linker will attempt to reduce the size of a
program by finding shorter versions of various instructions.
<br>
Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint-register=N <br>
Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast
interrupt handler functions. The value N can be between 0
and 4. A value of 1 means that register &quot;r13&quot; will
be reserved <br>
for the exclusive use of fast interrupt handlers. A value of
2 reserves &quot;r13&quot; and &quot;r12&quot;. A value of 3
reserves &quot;r13&quot;, &quot;r12&quot; and
&quot;r11&quot;, and a value of 4 reserves &quot;r13&quot;
<br>
through &quot;r10&quot;. A value of 0, the default, does not
reserve any registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msave-acc-in-interrupts <br>
Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve
the accumulator register. This is only necessary if normal
code might use the accumulator register, for example <br>
because it performs 64-bit multiplications. The default is
to ignore the accumulator as this makes the interrupt
handlers faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpid <br>
-mno-pid <br>
Enables the generation of position independent data. When
enabled any access to constant data will done via an offset
from a base address held in a register. This allows <br>
the location of constant data to be determined at run time
without requiring the executable to be relocated, which is a
benefit to embedded applications with tight memory <br>
constraints. Data that can be modified is not affected by
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, using this feature
reserves a register, usually &quot;r13&quot;, for the
constant data base address. This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual register chosen to
hold the constant data base address depends upon whether the
-msmall-data-limit and/or the -mint-register command-line
options are enabled. <br>
Starting with register &quot;r13&quot; and proceeding
downwards, registers are allocated first to satisfy the
requirements of -mint-register, then -mpid and finally
-msmall-data-limit. <br>
Thus it is possible for the small data area register to be
&quot;r8&quot; if both -mint-register=4 and -mpid are
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default this feature is not
enabled. The default can be restored via the -mno-pid
command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The generic GCC
command-line option -ffixed-reg has special significance to
the RX port when used with the &quot;interrupt&quot;
function attribute. This attribute indicates a <br>
function intended to process fast interrupts. GCC will will
ensure that it only uses the registers &quot;r10&quot;,
&quot;r11&quot;, &quot;r12&quot; and/or &quot;r13&quot; and
only provided that the normal use of the <br>
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
-ffixed-reg or -mint-register command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S/390 and zSeries Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions
and registers for floating-point operations. When
-msoft-float is specified, functions in libgcc.a will be
used to <br>
perform floating-point operations. When -mhard-float is
specified, the compiler generates IEEE floating-point
instructions. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-dfp <br>
-mno-hard-dfp <br>
Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point
instructions for decimal-floating-point operations. When
-mno-hard-dfp is specified, functions in libgcc.a will be
used <br>
to perform decimal-floating-point operations. When
-mhard-dfp is specified, the compiler generates
decimal-floating-point hardware instructions. This is the
default for <br>
-march=z9-ec or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-double-64 <br>
-mlong-double-128 <br>
These switches control the size of &quot;long double&quot;
type. A size of 64 bits makes the &quot;long double&quot;
type equivalent to the &quot;double&quot; type. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbackchain <br>
-mno-backchain <br>
Store (do not store) the address of the caller&rsquo;s frame
as backchain pointer into the callee&rsquo;s stack frame. A
backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that
do <br>
not understand DWARF-2 call frame information. When
-mno-packed-stack is in effect, the backchain pointer is
stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when -mpacked-stack
is <br>
in effect, the backchain is placed into the topmost word of
the 96/160 byte register save area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, code compiled with
-mbackchain is call-compatible with code compiled with
-mmo-backchain; however, use of the backchain for debugging
purposes usually requires <br>
that the whole binary is built with -mbackchain. Note that
the combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and
-mhard-float is not supported. In order to build a linux
<br>
kernel use -msoft-float.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to not maintain
the backchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpacked-stack <br>
-mno-packed-stack <br>
Use (do not use) the packed stack layout. When
-mno-packed-stack is specified, the compiler uses the all
fields of the 96/160 byte register save area only for their
default <br>
purpose; unused fields still take up stack space. When
-mpacked-stack is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space
<br>
is reused for other purposes, allowing for more efficient
use of the available stack space. However, when -mbackchain
is also in effect, the topmost word of the save area is <br>
always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As long as the stack frame
backchain is not used, code generated with -mpacked-stack is
call-compatible with code generated with -mno-packed-stack.
Note that some non-FSF <br>
releases of GCC 2.95 for S/390 or zSeries generated code
that uses the stack frame backchain at run time, not just
for debugging purposes. Such code is not call-compatible
<br>
with code compiled with -mpacked-stack. Also, note that the
combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and -mhard-float
is not supported. In order to build a linux kernel <br>
use -msoft-float.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to not use the
packed stack layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-exec <br>
-mno-small-exec <br>
Generate (or do not generate) code using the
&quot;bras&quot; instruction to do subroutine calls. This
only works reliably if the total executable size does not
exceed 64k. The <br>
default is to use the &quot;basr&quot; instruction instead,
which does not have this limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m64 <br>
-m31 <br>
When -m31 is specified, generate code compliant to the
GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI. When -m64 is specified, generate
code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI. This <br>
allows GCC in particular to generate 64-bit instructions.
For the s390 targets, the default is -m31, while the s390x
targets default to -m64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mzarch <br>
-mesa <br>
When -mzarch is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on z/Architecture. When -mesa is
specified, generate code using the instructions available on
<br>
ESA/390. Note that -mesa is not possible with -m64. When
generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI,
the default is -mesa. When generating code compliant to <br>
the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is -mzarch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmvcle <br>
-mno-mvcle <br>
Generate (or do not generate) code using the
&quot;mvcle&quot; instruction to perform block moves. When
-mno-mvcle is specified, use a &quot;mvc&quot; loop instead.
This is the default unless <br>
optimizing for size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug <br>
-mno-debug <br>
Print (or do not print) additional debug information when
compiling. The default is to not print debug
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=cpu-type <br>
Generate code that will run on cpu-type, which is the name
of a system representing a certain processor type. Possible
values for cpu-type are g5, g6, z900, z990, z9-109, <br>
z9-ec and z10. When generating code using the instructions
available on z/Architecture, the default is -march=z900.
Otherwise, the default is -march=g5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu-type <br>
Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated
code, except for the ABI and the set of available
instructions. The list of cpu-type values is the same as for
<br>
-march. The default is the value used for -march.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtpf-trace <br>
-mno-tpf-trace <br>
Generate code that adds (does not add) in TPF OS specific
branches to trace routines in the operating system. This
option is off by default, even when compiling for the TPF
<br>
OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
multiply and accumulate instructions. These instructions are
generated by default if hardware floating point is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-framesize=framesize <br>
Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given
frame size. Because this is a compile-time check it
doesn&rsquo;t need to be a real problem when the program
runs. It is <br>
intended to identify functions that most probably cause a
stack overflow. It is useful to be used in an environment
with limited stack size e.g. the linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-dynamicstack <br>
Emit a warning if the function calls alloca or uses
dynamically sized arrays. This is generally a bad idea with
a limited stack size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-guard=stack-guard <br>
-mstack-size=stack-size <br>
If these options are provided the s390 back end emits
additional instructions in the function prologue which
trigger a trap if the stack size is stack-guard bytes above
the <br>
stack-size (remember that the stack on s390 grows downward).
If the stack-guard option is omitted the smallest power of 2
larger than the frame size of the compiled function <br>
is chosen. These options are intended to be used to help
debugging stack overflow problems. The additionally emitted
code causes only little overhead and hence can also be <br>
used in production like systems without greater performance
degradation. The given values have to be exact powers of 2
and stack-size has to be greater than stack-guard <br>
without exceeding 64k. In order to be efficient the extra
code makes the assumption that the stack starts at an
address aligned to the value given by stack-size. The stack-
<br>
guard option can only be used in conjunction with
stack-size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Score Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
Score implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meb <br>
Compile code for big-endian mode. This is the default.</p>

Generate code for the SH2a without FPU, or for a SH2a-FPU in
such a way that the floating-point unit is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m2a-single-only <br>
Generate code for the SH2a-FPU, in such a way that no
double-precision floating-point operations are used.</p>

Generate code for the SH4 with a floating-point unit that
only supports single-precision arithmetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-single <br>
Generate code for the SH4 assuming the floating-point unit
is in single-precision mode by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4 Generate code for the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a-nofpu <br>
Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a SH4a in such a way
that the floating-point unit is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a-single-only <br>
Generate code for the SH4a, in such a way that no
double-precision floating-point operations are used.</p>

Generate code for the SH4a assuming the floating-point unit
is in single-precision mode by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a <br>
Generate code for the SH4a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4al <br>
Same as -m4a-nofpu, except that it implicitly passes -dsp to
the assembler. GCC doesn&rsquo;t generate any DSP
instructions at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mb Compile code for the
processor in big-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ml Compile code for the
processor in little-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdalign <br>
Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries. Note that this changes
the calling conventions, and thus some functions from the
standard C library will not work unless you recompile it
<br>
first with -mdalign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Shorten some address references at link time, when possible;
uses the linker option -relax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbigtable <br>
Use 32-bit offsets in &quot;switch&quot; tables. The default
is to use 16-bit offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbitops <br>
Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on SH2A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfmovd <br>
Enable the use of the instruction &quot;fmovd&quot;. Check
-mdalign for alignment constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhitachi <br>
Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrenesas <br>
Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-renesas <br>
Comply with the calling conventions defined for GCC before
the Renesas conventions were available. This option is the
default for all targets of the SH toolchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnomacsave <br>
Mark the &quot;MAC&quot; register as call-clobbered, even if
-mhitachi is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee <br>
-mno-ieee <br>
Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons,
which affects the handling of cases where the result of a
comparison is unordered. By default -mieee is implicitly
<br>
enabled. If -ffinite-math-only is enabled -mno-ieee is
implicitly set, which results in faster floating-point
greater-equal and less-equal comparisons. The implcit
settings <br>
can be overridden by specifying either -mieee or
-mno-ieee.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-ic_invalidate <br>
Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after
setting up nested function trampolines. This option has no
effect if -musermode is in effect and the selected code <br>
generation option (e.g. -m4) does not allow the use of the
icbi instruction. If the selected code generation option
does not allow the use of the icbi instruction, and <br>
-musermode is not in effect, the inlined code will
manipulate the instruction cache address array directly with
an associative write. This not only requires privileged
mode, <br>
but it will also fail if the cache line had been mapped via
the TLB and has become unmapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-misize <br>
Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpadstruct <br>
This option is deprecated. It pads structures to multiple of
4 bytes, which is incompatible with the SH ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-atomic <br>
Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences
for the atomic built-in functions. The generated atomic
sequences require support from the interrupt / exception
<br>
handling code of the system and are only suitable for
single-core systems. They will not perform correctly on
multi-core systems. This option is enabled by default when
the <br>
target is &quot;sh-*-linux*&quot;. For details on the atomic
built-in functions see __atomic Builtins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspace <br>
Optimize for space instead of speed. Implied by -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprefergot <br>
When generating position-independent code, emit function
calls using the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure
Linkage Table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-musermode <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate privileged mode only code; implies
-mno-inline-ic_invalidate if the inlined code would not work
in user mode. This is the default when the target is <br>
&quot;sh-*-linux*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multcost=number <br>
Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv=strategy <br>
Set the division strategy to be used for integer division
operations. For SHmedia strategy can be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fp Performs the operation in
floating point. This has a very high latency, but needs only
a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if your
code has enough easily- <br>
exploitable ILP to allow the compiler to schedule the
floating-point instructions together with other
instructions. Division by zero causes a floating-point
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inv Uses integer operations to
calculate the inverse of the divisor, and then multiplies
the dividend with the inverse. This strategy allows CSE and
hoisting of the inverse <br>
calculation. Division by zero calculates an unspecified
result, but does not trap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inv:minlat <br>
A variant of inv where, if no CSE or hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted
to the same place, the last stages of the inverse <br>
calculation are intertwined with the final multiply to
reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling <br>
opportunities with other code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call <br>
Calls a library function that usually implements the
inv:minlat strategy. This gives high code density for
&quot;m5-*media-nofpu&quot; compilations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call2 <br>
Uses a different entry point of the same library function,
where it assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has
already been set up, which exposes the pointer load to <br>
CSE and code hoisting optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inv:call <br>
inv:call2 <br>
inv:fp <br>
Use the inv algorithm for initial code generation, but if
the code stays unoptimized, revert to the call, call2, or fp
strategies, respectively. Note that the <br>
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is
carried by a separate instruction, so it is possible that
all the integer instructions are hoisted out, but the <br>
marker for the side effect stays where it is. A
recombination to floating-point operations or a call is not
possible in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inv20u <br>
inv20l <br>
Variants of the inv:minlat strategy. In the case that the
inverse calculation is not separated from the multiply, they
speed up division where the dividend fits into 20 <br>
bits (plus sign where applicable) by inserting a test to
skip a number of operations in this case; this test slows
down the case of larger dividends. inv20u assumes the <br>
case of a such a small dividend to be unlikely, and inv20l
assumes it to be likely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For targets other than SHmedia
strategy can be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call-div1 <br>
Calls a library function that uses the single-step division
instruction &quot;div1&quot; to perform the operation.
Division by zero calculates an unspecified result and does
not <br>
trap. This is the default except for SH4, SH2A and
SHcompact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call-fp <br>
Calls a library function that performs the operation in
double precision floating point. Division by zero causes a
floating-point exception. This is the default for <br>
SHcompact with FPU. Specifying this for targets that do not
have a double precision FPU will default to
&quot;call-div1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call-table <br>
Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small
divisors and the &quot;div1&quot; instruction with case
distinction for larger divisors. Division by zero calculates
an <br>
unspecified result and does not trap. This is the default
for SH4. Specifying this for targets that do not have
dynamic shift instructions will default to
&quot;call-div1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a division strategy has not
been specified the default strategy will be selected based
on the current target. For SH2A the default strategy is to
use the &quot;divs&quot; and <br>
&quot;divu&quot; instructions instead of library function
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maccumulate-outgoing-args <br>
Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function
prologue rather than around each call. Generally beneficial
for performance and size. Also needed for unwinding to <br>
avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdivsi3_libfunc=name <br>
Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed
division to name. This only affect the name used in the call
and inv:call division strategies, and the compiler <br>
will still expect the same sets of input/output/clobbered
registers as if this option was not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator can not use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-madjust-unroll <br>
Throttle unrolling to avoid thrashing target registers. This
option only has an effect if the gcc code base supports the
TARGET_ADJUST_UNROLL_MAX target hook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mindexed-addressing <br>
Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for
SHmedia32/SHcompact. This is only safe if the hardware
and/or OS implement 32-bit wrap-around semantics for the
indexed <br>
addressing mode. The architecture allows the implementation
of processors with 64-bit MMU, which the OS could use to get
32-bit addressing, but since no current hardware <br>
implementation supports this or any other way to make the
indexed addressing mode safe to use in the 32-bit ABI, the
default is -mno-indexed-addressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgettrcost=number <br>
Set the cost assumed for the gettr instruction to number.
The default is 2 if -mpt-fixed is in effect, 100
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpt-fixed <br>
Assume pt* instructions won&rsquo;t trap. This will
generally generate better scheduled code, but is unsafe on
current hardware. The current architecture definition says
that <br>
ptabs and ptrel trap when the target anded with 3 is 3. This
has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule
ptabs / ptrel before a branch, or hoist it out of a <br>
loop. For example, __do_global_ctors, a part of libgcc that
runs constructors at program startup, calls functions in a
list which is delimited by -1. With the -mpt-fixed <br>
option, the ptabs will be done before testing against -1.
That means that all the constructors will be run a bit
quicker, but when the loop comes to the end of the list, the
<br>
program crashes because ptabs loads -1 into a target
register. Since this option is unsafe for any hardware
implementing the current architecture specification, the
default <br>
is -mno-pt-fixed. Unless the user specifies a specific cost
with -mgettrcost, -mno-pt-fixed also implies
-mgettrcost=100; this deters register allocation using
target <br>
registers for storing ordinary integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minvalid-symbols <br>
Assume symbols might be invalid. Ordinary function symbols
generated by the compiler will always be valid to load with
movi/shori/ptabs or movi/shori/ptrel, but with <br>
assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible to generate
symbols that will cause ptabs / ptrel to trap. This option
is only meaningful when -mno-pt-fixed is in effect. It <br>
will then prevent cross-basic-block cse, hoisting and most
scheduling of symbol loads. The default is
-mno-invalid-symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=num <br>
Assume num to be the cost for a branch instruction. Higher
numbers will make the compiler try to generate more
branch-free code if possible. If not specified the value is
<br>
selected depending on the processor type that is being
compiled for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcbranchdi <br>
Enable the &quot;cbranchdi4&quot; instruction pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmpeqdi <br>
Emit the &quot;cmpeqdi_t&quot; instruction pattern even when
-mcbranchdi is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
Allow the usage of the &quot;fmac&quot; instruction
(floating-point multiply-accumulate) if the processor type
supports it. Enabling this option might generate code that
produces <br>
different numeric floating-point results compared to strict
IEEE 754 arithmetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpretend-cmove <br>
Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for
conditional move instruction patterns. This can result in
faster code on the SH4 processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris 2 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on Solaris 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mimpure-text <br>
-mimpure-text, used in addition to -shared, tells the
compiler to not pass -z text to the linker when linking a
shared object. Using this option, you can link position-
<br>
dependent code into a shared object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mimpure-text suppresses the
&quot;relocations remain against allocatable but
non-writable sections&quot; linker error message. However,
the necessary relocations will trigger copy- <br>
on-write, and the shared object is not actually shared
across processes. Instead of using -mimpure-text, you should
compile all source code with -fpic or -fPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These switches are supported in
addition to the above on Solaris 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pthreads <br>
Add support for multithreading using the POSIX threads
library. This option sets flags for both the preprocessor
and linker. This option does not affect the thread safety
<br>
of object code produced by the compiler or that of libraries
supplied with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pthread <br>
This is a synonym for -pthreads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPARC Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on the SPARC:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-app-regs <br>
-mapp-regs <br>
Specify -mapp-regs to generate output using the global
registers 2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for
applications. Like the global register 1, each global <br>
register 2 through 4 is then treated as an allocable
register that is clobbered by function calls. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant
at the cost of some performance loss, specify -mno-app-regs.
You should compile libraries and system software with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflat <br>
-mno-flat <br>
With -mflat, the compiler does not generate save/restore
instructions and uses a &quot;flat&quot; or single register
window model. This model is compatible with the regular
register <br>
window model. The local registers and the input registers
(0--5) are still treated as &quot;call-saved&quot; registers
and will be saved on the stack as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mno-flat (the default),
the compiler generates save/restore instructions (except for
leaf functions). This is the normal operating mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu <br>
-mhard-float <br>
Generate output containing floating-point instructions. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fpu <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
Warning: the requisite libraries are not available for all
SPARC targets. Normally the facilities of the <br>
machine&rsquo;s usual C compiler are used, but this cannot
be done directly in cross-compilation. You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
<br>
cross-compilation. The embedded targets sparc-*-aout and
sparclite-*-* do provide software floating-point
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float changes the calling
convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful
if you compile all of a program with this option. In
particular, you need to <br>
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-quad-float <br>
Generate output containing quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-quad-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
double) floating-point instructions. The functions called
are those specified in the SPARC ABI. This is the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of this writing, there are no
SPARC implementations that have hardware support for the
quad-word floating-point instructions. They all invoke a
trap handler for one of <br>
these instructions, and then the trap handler emulates the
effect of the instruction. Because of the trap handler
overhead, this is much slower than calling the ABI library
<br>
routines. Thus the -msoft-quad-float option is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-unaligned-doubles <br>
-munaligned-doubles <br>
Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -munaligned-doubles, GCC
assumes that doubles have 8-byte alignment only if they are
contained in another type, or if they have an absolute
address. Otherwise, it <br>
assumes they have 4-byte alignment. Specifying this option
avoids some rare compatibility problems with code generated
by other compilers. It is not the default because it <br>
results in a performance loss, especially for floating-point
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-faster-structs <br>
-mfaster-structs <br>
With -mfaster-structs, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8-byte alignment. This enables the use of pairs
of &quot;ldd&quot; and &quot;std&quot; instructions for
copies in <br>
structure assignment, in place of twice as many
&quot;ld&quot; and &quot;st&quot; pairs. However, the use of
this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC ABI.
Thus, it&rsquo;s intended only <br>
for use on targets where the developer acknowledges that
their resulting code will not be directly in line with the
rules of the ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type. Supported
values for cpu_type are v7, cypress, v8, supersparc, <br>
hypersparc, leon, sparclite, f930, f934, sparclite86x,
sparclet, tsc701, v9, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara,
niagara2, niagara3, and niagara4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native Solaris and GNU/Linux
toolchains also support the value native, which selects the
best architecture option for the host processor.
-mcpu=native has no effect if GCC <br>
does not recognize the processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default instruction scheduling
parameters are used for values that select an architecture
and not an implementation. These are v7, v8, sparclite,
sparclet, v9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of each supported
architecture and their supported implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v7 cypress</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v8 supersparc, hypersparc,
leon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sparclite <br>
f930, f934, sparclite86x</p>

tsc701</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v9 ultrasparc, ultrasparc3,
niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default (unless configured
otherwise), GCC generates code for the V7 variant of the
SPARC architecture. With -mcpu=cypress, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the <br>
Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series. This is also
appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=v8, GCC generates
code for the V8 variant of the SPARC architecture. The only
difference from V7 code is that the compiler emits the
integer multiply and integer <br>
divide instructions which exist in SPARC-V8 but not in
SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=supersparc, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the <br>
SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=sparclite, GCC
generates code for the SPARClite variant of the SPARC
architecture. This adds the integer multiply, integer divide
step and scan (&quot;ffs&quot;) <br>
instructions which exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7.
With -mcpu=f930, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
the Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the original <br>
SPARClite, with no FPU. With -mcpu=f934, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip,
which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=sparclet, GCC
generates code for the SPARClet variant of the SPARC
architecture. This adds the integer multiply,
multiply/accumulate, integer divide step and scan <br>
(&quot;ffs&quot;) instructions which exist in SPARClet but
not in SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=tsc701, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=v9, GCC generates
code for the V9 variant of the SPARC architecture. This adds
64-bit integer and floating-point move instructions, 3
additional floating-point <br>
condition code registers and conditional move instructions.
With -mcpu=ultrasparc, the compiler additionally optimizes
it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips. With <br>
-mcpu=ultrasparc3, the compiler additionally optimizes it
for the Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips.
With -mcpu=niagara, the compiler additionally optimizes it
<br>
for Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips. With -mcpu=niagara2, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2
chips. With -mcpu=niagara3, the compiler additionally <br>
optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T3 chips. With
-mcpu=niagara4, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
cpu_type, but do not set the instruction set or register set
that the option -mcpu=cpu_type would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same values for
-mcpu=cpu_type can be used for -mtune=cpu_type, but the only
useful values are those that select a particular CPU
implementation. Those are cypress, <br>
supersparc, hypersparc, leon, f930, f934, sparclite86x,
tsc701, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2, niagara3
and niagara4. With native Solaris and GNU/Linux <br>
toolchains, native can also be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mv8plus <br>
-mno-v8plus <br>
With -mv8plus, GCC generates code for the SPARC-V8+ ABI. The
difference from the V8 ABI is that the global and out
registers are considered 64 bits wide. This is enabled by
<br>
default on Solaris in 32-bit mode for all SPARC-V9
processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis <br>
-mno-vis <br>
With -mvis, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions. The default is
-mno-vis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis2 <br>
-mno-vis2 <br>
With -mvis2, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
version 2.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
extensions. The default is -mvis2 when targetting a cpu that
<br>
supports such instructions, such as UltraSPARC-III and
later. Setting -mvis2 also sets -mvis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis3 <br>
-mno-vis3 <br>
With -mvis3, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
version 3.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
extensions. The default is -mvis3 when targetting a cpu that
<br>
supports such instructions, such as niagara-3 and later.
Setting -mvis3 also sets -mvis2 and -mvis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpopc <br>
-mno-popc <br>
With -mpopc, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC population count instruction. The default is
-mpopc when targetting a cpu that supports such <br>
instructions, such as Niagara-2 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfmaf <br>
-mno-fmaf <br>
With -mfmaf, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC Fused Multiply-Add Floating-point extensions. The
default is -mfmaf when targetting a cpu that <br>
supports such instructions, such as Niagara-3 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-at697f <br>
Enable the documented workaround for the single erratum of
the Atmel AT697F processor (which corresponds to erratum #13
of the AT697E processor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
in addition to the above on SPARC-V9 processors in 64-bit
environments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. The 32-bit
environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits. The
64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and <br>
pointer to 64 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=which <br>
Set the code model to one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">medlow <br>
The Medium/Low code model: 64-bit addresses, programs must
be linked in the low 32 bits of memory. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">medmid <br>
The Medium/Middle code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
must be linked in the low 44 bits of memory, the text and
data segments must be less than 2GB in size and the <br>
data segment must be located within 2GB of the text
segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">medany <br>
The Medium/Anywhere code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
may be linked anywhere in memory, the text and data segments
must be less than 2GB in size and the data segment <br>
must be located within 2GB of the text segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">embmedany <br>
The Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems: 64-bit
addresses, the text and data segments must be less than 2GB
in size, both starting anywhere in memory <br>
(determined at link time). The global register %g4 points to
the base of the data segment. Programs are statically linked
and PIC is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemory-model=mem-model <br>
Set the memory model in force on the processor to one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
The default memory model for the processor and operating
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rmo Relaxed Memory Order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pso Partial Store Order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tso Total Store Order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc Sequential Consistency</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These memory models are formally
defined in Appendix D of the Sparc V9 architecture manual,
as set in the processor&rsquo;s &quot;PSTATE.MM&quot;
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-bias <br>
-mno-stack-bias <br>
With -mstack-bias, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and
frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be
added back when making stack frame references. This is <br>
the default in 64-bit mode. Otherwise, assume no such offset
is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPU Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on the SPU:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-reloc <br>
-merror-reloc <br>
The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations. By
default, GCC will give an error when it generates code that
requires a dynamic relocation. -mno-error-reloc <br>
disables the error, -mwarn-reloc will generate a warning
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msafe-dma <br>
-munsafe-dma <br>
Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must
not be reordered with respect to loads and stores of the
memory that is being accessed. Users typically address <br>
this problem using the volatile keyword, but that can lead
to inefficient code in places where the memory is known to
not change. Rather than mark the memory as volatile we <br>
treat the DMA instructions as potentially effecting all
memory. With -munsafe-dma users must use the volatile
keyword to protect memory accesses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-hints <br>
By default, GCC will generate a branch hint instruction to
avoid pipeline stalls for always taken or probably taken
branches. A hint will not be generated closer than 8 <br>
instructions away from its branch. There is little reason to
disable them, except for debugging purposes, or to make an
object a little bit smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-mem <br>
-mlarge-mem <br>
By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are
never larger than 18 bits. With -mlarge-mem code is
generated that assumes a full 32-bit address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstdmain <br>
By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the
SPU-style main function interface (which has an
unconventional parameter list). With -mstdmain, GCC will
link <br>
your program against startup code that assumes a C99-style
interface to &quot;main&quot;, including a local copy of
&quot;argv&quot; strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator can not use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mea32 <br>
-mea64 <br>
Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space
accessed via the &quot;__ea&quot; named address space
qualifier are either 32 or 64 bits wide. The default is 32
bits. As <br>
this is an ABI changing option, all object code in an
executable must be compiled with the same setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maddress-space-conversion <br>
-mno-address-space-conversion <br>
Allow/disallow treating the &quot;__ea&quot; address space
as superset of the generic address space. This enables
explicit type casts between &quot;__ea&quot; and generic
pointer as well as <br>
implicit conversions of generic pointers to &quot;__ea&quot;
pointers. The default is to allow address space pointer
conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcache-size=cache-size <br>
This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler
links to an executable and selects a software-managed cache
for accessing variables in the &quot;__ea&quot; address
space <br>
with a particular cache size. Possible options for
cache-size are 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128. The default cache size
is 64KB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matomic-updates <br>
-mno-atomic-updates <br>
This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler
links to an executable and selects whether atomic updates to
the software-managed cache of PPU-side variables are <br>
used. If you use atomic updates, changes to a PPU variable
from SPU code using the &quot;__ea&quot; named address space
qualifier will not interfere with changes to other PPU <br>
variables residing in the same cache line from PPU code. If
you do not use atomic updates, such interference may occur;
however, writing back cache lines will be more <br>
efficient. The default behavior is to use atomic
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdual-nops <br>
-mdual-nops=n <br>
By default, GCC will insert nops to increase dual issue when
it expects it to increase performance. n can be a value from
0 to 10. A smaller n will insert fewer nops. 10 <br>
is the default, 0 is the same as -mno-dual-nops. Disabled
with -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhint-max-nops=n <br>
Maximum number of nops to insert for a branch hint. A branch
hint must be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it
is effecting. GCC will insert up to n nops to <br>
enforce this, otherwise it will not generate the branch
hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhint-max-distance=n <br>
The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint
to be within 256 instructions of the branch it is effecting.
By default, GCC makes sure it is within 125.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msafe-hints <br>
Work around a hardware bug that causes the SPU to stall
indefinitely. By default, GCC will insert the
&quot;hbrp&quot; instruction to make sure this stall
won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for System V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These additional options are
available on System V Release 4 for compatibility with other
compilers on those systems:</p>

Search the directories dirs, and no others, for libraries
specified with -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ym,dir <br>
Look in the directory dir to find the M4 preprocessor. The
assembler uses this option.</p>

supported type is tilegx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. The 32-bit
environment sets int, long, and pointer to 32 bits. The
64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and <br>
pointer to 64 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TILEPro Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int,
long, and pointer to 32 bits. This is the only supported
behavior so the flag is essentially ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V850 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
V850 implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Treat all calls as being far away (near). If calls are
assumed to be far away, the compiler will always load the
functions address up into a register, and call indirect <br>
through the pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-ep <br>
-mep <br>
Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same
index pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the
&quot;ep&quot; register, and use the shorter &quot;sld&quot;
and &quot;sst&quot; <br>
instructions. The -mep option is on by default if you
optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-prolog-function <br>
-mprolog-function <br>
Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore
registers at the prologue and epilogue of a function. The
external functions are slower, but use less code space <br>
if more than one function saves the same number of
registers. The -mprolog-function option is on by default if
you optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspace <br>
Try to make the code as small as possible. At present, this
just turns on the -mep and -mprolog-function options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtda=n <br>
Put static or global variables whose size is n bytes or less
into the tiny data area that register &quot;ep&quot; points
to. The tiny data area can hold up to 256 bytes in total
(128 <br>
bytes for byte references).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msda=n <br>
Put static or global variables whose size is n bytes or less

Specify that the target processor is the V850.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-switch <br>
Generate code suitable for big switch tables. Use this
option only if the assembler/linker complain about out of
range branches within a switch table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapp-regs <br>
This option will cause r2 and r5 to be used in the code
generated by the compiler. This setting is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-app-regs <br>
This option will cause r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mv850e2v3 <br>
Specify that the target processor is the V850E2V3. The
preprocessor constants __v850e2v3__ will be defined if this
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mv850e2 <br>
Specify that the target processor is the V850E2. The

This has no effect if the floating-point option is not also
<br>
enabled. Disabling fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.
This <br>
may be desirable in some cases where strict IEEE
754-compliant results are required: the fused multiply
add/subtract instructions do not round the intermediate
result, <br>
thereby producing results with more bits of precision than
specified by the IEEE standard. Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program <br>
output is not sensitive to the compiler&rsquo;s ability to
combine multiply and add/subtract operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mserialize-volatile <br>
-mno-serialize-volatile <br>
When this option is enabled, GCC inserts &quot;MEMW&quot;
instructions before &quot;volatile&quot; memory references
to guarantee sequential consistency. The default is
-mserialize-volatile. <br>
Use -mno-serialize-volatile to omit the &quot;MEMW&quot;
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mforce-no-pic <br>
For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code
must be position-independent code (PIC), this option
disables PIC for compiling kernel code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtext-section-literals <br>
-mno-text-section-literals <br>
Control the treatment of literal pools. The default is
-mno-text-section-literals, which places literals in a
separate section in the output file. This allows the literal
<br>
pool to be placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the
linker to combine literal pools from separate object files
to remove redundant literals and improve code size. <br>
With -mtext-section-literals, the literals are interspersed
in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references. This may be necessary for <br>
large assembly files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtarget-align <br>
-mno-target-align <br>
When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties
at the expense of some code density. The assembler <br>
attempts to widen density instructions to align branch
targets and the instructions following call instructions. If
there are not enough preceding safe density instructions
<br>
to align a target, no widening will be performed. The
default is -mtarget-align. These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like
&quot;LOOP&quot;, which <br>
the assembler will always align, either by widening density
instructions or by inserting no-op instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlongcalls <br>
-mno-longcalls <br>
When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
translate direct calls to indirect calls unless it can
determine that the target of a direct call is in the range
<br>
allowed by the call instruction. This translation typically
occurs for calls to functions in other source files.
Specifically, the assembler translates a direct
&quot;CALL&quot; <br>
instruction into an &quot;L32R&quot; followed by a
&quot;CALLX&quot; instruction. The default is
-mno-longcalls. This option should be used in programs where
the call target can potentially be <br>
out of range. This option is implemented in the assembler,
not the compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC will
still show direct call instructions---look at the <br>
disassembled object code to see the actual instructions.
Note that the assembler will use an indirect call for every
cross-file call, not just those that really will be out <br>
of range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zSeries Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are listed under</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Code Generation
Conventions <br>
These machine-independent options control the interface
conventions used in code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of them have both positive
and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo would be
-fno-foo. In the table below, only one of the forms is
listed---the one that is not the <br>
default. You can figure out the other form by either
removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbounds-check <br>
For front ends that support it, generate additional code to
check that indices used to access arrays are within the
declared range. This is currently only supported by the <br>
Java and Fortran front ends, where this option defaults to
true and false respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftrapv <br>
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition,
subtraction, multiplication operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwrapv <br>
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed
arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and
multiplication wraps around using twos-complement
representation. <br>
This flag enables some optimizations and disables others.
This option is enabled by default for the Java front end, as
required by the Java language specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexceptions <br>
Enable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to
propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC
will generate frame unwind information for all functions,
<br>
which can produce significant data size overhead, although
it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this
option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like
<br>
C++ that normally require exception handling, and disable it
for languages like C that do not normally require it.
However, you may need to enable this option when compiling
<br>
C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception
handlers written in C++. You may also wish to disable this
option if you are compiling older C++ programs that <br>
don&rsquo;t use exception handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnon-call-exceptions <br>
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw
exceptions. Note that this requires platform-specific
runtime support that does not exist everywhere. Moreover, it
<br>
only allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions, i.e.
memory references or floating-point instructions. It does
not allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal <br>
handlers such as &quot;SIGALRM&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funwind-tables <br>
Similar to -fexceptions, except that it will just generate
any needed static data, but will not affect the generated
code in any other way. You will normally not enable this
<br>
option; instead, a language processor that needs this
handling would enable it on your behalf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fasynchronous-unwind-tables
<br>
Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by
target machine. The table is exact at each instruction
boundary, so it can be used for stack unwinding from <br>
asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage
collector).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpcc-struct-return <br>
Return &quot;short&quot; &quot;struct&quot; and
&quot;union&quot; values in memory like longer ones, rather
than in registers. This convention is less efficient, but it
has the advantage of allowing <br>
intercallability between GCC-compiled files and files
compiled with other compilers, particularly the Portable C
Compiler (pcc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The precise convention for
returning structures in memory depends on the target
configuration macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short structures and unions are
those whose size and alignment match that of some integer
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: code compiled with the
-fpcc-struct-return switch is not binary compatible with
code compiled with the -freg-struct-return switch. Use it to
conform to a non- <br>
default application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freg-struct-return <br>
Return &quot;struct&quot; and &quot;union&quot; values in
registers when possible. This is more efficient for small
structures than -fpcc-struct-return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify neither
-fpcc-struct-return nor -freg-struct-return, GCC defaults to
whichever convention is standard for the target. If there is
no standard convention, GCC <br>
defaults to -fpcc-struct-return, except on targets where GCC
is the principal compiler. In those cases, we can choose the
standard, and we chose the more efficient register <br>
return alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: code compiled with the
-freg-struct-return switch is not binary compatible with
code compiled with the -fpcc-struct-return switch. Use it to
conform to a non- <br>
default application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshort-enums <br>
Allocate to an &quot;enum&quot; type only as many bytes as
it needs for the declared range of possible values.
Specifically, the &quot;enum&quot; type will be equivalent
to the smallest integer <br>
type that has enough room.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fshort-enums
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch. Use it
to conform to a non-default <br>
application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshort-double <br>
Use the same size for &quot;double&quot; as for
&quot;float&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fshort-double
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch. Use it
to conform to a non-default <br>
application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshort-wchar <br>
Override the underlying type for wchar_t to be short
unsigned int instead of the default for the target. This
option is useful for building programs to run under
WINE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fshort-wchar
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch. Use it
to conform to a non-default <br>
application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-common <br>
In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global
variables. Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted
multiple definitions of such variables in different <br>
compilation units by placing the variables in a common
block. This is the behavior specified by -fcommon, and is
the default for GCC on most targets. On the other hand, <br>
this behavior is not required by ISO C, and on some targets
may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable
references. The -fno-common option specifies that the
compiler <br>
should place uninitialized global variables in the data
section of the object file, rather than generating them as
common blocks. This has the effect that if the same <br>
variable is declared (without &quot;extern&quot;) in two
different compilations, you will get a multiple-definition
error when you link them. In this case, you must compile
with <br>
-fcommon instead. Compiling with -fno-common is useful on
targets for which it provides better performance, or if you
wish to verify that the program will work on other <br>
systems that always treat uninitialized variable
declarations this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-ident <br>
Ignore the #ident directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finhibit-size-directive <br>
Don&rsquo;t output a &quot;.size&quot; assembler directive,
or anything else that would cause trouble if the function is
split in the middle, and the two halves are placed at
locations far <br>
apart in memory. This option is used when compiling
crtstuff.c; you should not need to use it for anything
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fverbose-asm <br>
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly
code to make it more readable. This option is generally only
of use to those who actually need to read the <br>
generated assembly code (perhaps while debugging the
compiler itself).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-verbose-asm, the default,
causes the extra information to be omitted and is useful
when comparing two assembler files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frecord-gcc-switches <br>
This switch causes the command line that was used to invoke
the compiler to be recorded into the object file that is
being created. This switch is only implemented on some <br>
targets and the exact format of the recording is target and
binary file format dependent, but it usually takes the form
of a section containing ASCII text. This switch is <br>
related to the -fverbose-asm switch, but that switch only
records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file. See also <br>
-grecord-gcc-switches for another way of storing compiler
options into the object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpic <br>
Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in
a shared library, if supported for the target machine. Such
code accesses all constant addresses through a <br>
global offset table (GOT). The dynamic loader resolves the
GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader is
not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system). <br>
If the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a
machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from
the linker indicating that -fpic does not work; in that
case, <br>
recompile with -fPIC instead. (These maximums are 8k on the
SPARC and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000. The 386 has no such
limit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Position-independent code
requires special support, and therefore works only on
certain machines. For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i. Code <br>
generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this flag is set, the
macros &quot;__pic__&quot; and &quot;__PIC__&quot; are
defined to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fPIC <br>
If supported for the target machine, emit
position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and
avoiding any limit on the size of the global offset table.
This option <br>
makes a difference on the m68k, PowerPC and SPARC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Position-independent code
requires special support, and therefore works only on
certain machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this flag is set, the
macros &quot;__pic__&quot; and &quot;__PIC__&quot; are
defined to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpie <br>
-fPIE <br>
These options are similar to -fpic and -fPIC, but generated
position independent code can be only linked into
executables. Usually these options are used when -pie GCC
<br>
option will be used during linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpie and -fPIE both define the
macros &quot;__pie__&quot; and &quot;__PIE__&quot;. The
macros have the value 1 for -fpie and 2 for -fPIE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-jump-tables <br>
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it
would be more efficient than other code generation
strategies. This option is of use in conjunction with -fpic
or <br>
-fPIC for building code that forms part of a dynamic linker
and cannot reference the address of a jump table. On some
targets, jump tables do not require a GOT and this <br>
option is not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffixed-reg <br>
Treat the register named reg as a fixed register; generated
code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack
pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reg must be the name of a
register. The register names accepted are machine-specific
and are defined in the &quot;REGISTER_NAMES&quot; macro in
the machine description macro file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag does not have a
negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcall-used-reg <br>
Treat the register named reg as an allocable register that
is clobbered by function calls. It may be allocated for
temporaries or variables that do not live across a call.
<br>
Functions compiled this way will not save and restore the
register reg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error to used this flag
with the frame pointer or stack pointer. Use of this flag
for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in the
machine&rsquo;s execution <br>
model will produce disastrous results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag does not have a
negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcall-saved-reg <br>
Treat the register named reg as an allocable register saved
by functions. It may be allocated even for temporaries or
variables that live across a call. Functions compiled <br>
this way will save and restore the register reg if they use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error to used this flag
with the frame pointer or stack pointer. Use of this flag
for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in the
machine&rsquo;s execution <br>
model will produce disastrous results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A different sort of disaster
will result from the use of this flag for a register in
which function values may be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag does not have a
negative form, because it specifies a three-way choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpack-struct[=n] <br>
Without a value specified, pack all structure members
together without holes. When a value is specified (which
must be a small power of two), pack structure members <br>
according to this value, representing the maximum alignment
(that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger
than this will be output potentially unaligned at the <br>
next fitting location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fpack-struct
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code <br>
suboptimal. Use it to conform to a non-default application
binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions <br>
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to
functions. Just after function entry and just before
function exit, the following profiling functions will be
called <br>
with the address of the current function and its call site.
(On some platforms, &quot;__builtin_return_address&quot;
does not work beyond the current function, so the call site
<br>
information may not be available to the profiling functions
otherwise.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void __cyg_profile_func_enter
(void *this_fn, <br>
void *call_site); <br>
void __cyg_profile_func_exit (void *this_fn, <br>
void *call_site);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first argument is the
address of the start of the current function, which may be
looked up exactly in the symbol table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This instrumentation is also
done for functions expanded inline in other functions. The
profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and <br>
exited. This means that addressable versions of such
functions must be available. If all your uses of a function
are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion
<br>
of code size. If you use extern inline in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.
(This is normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky
<br>
and the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you
might have gotten away without providing static copies.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A function may be given the
attribute &quot;no_instrument_function&quot;, in which case
this instrumentation will not be done. This can be used, for
example, for the profiling <br>
functions listed above, high-priority interrupt routines,
and any functions from which the profiling functions cannot
safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the <br>
profiling routines generate output or allocate memory).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=file,file,...
<br>
Set the list of functions that are excluded from
instrumentation (see the description of
&quot;-finstrument-functions&quot;). If the file that
contains a function definition matches <br>
with one of file, then that function is not instrumented.
The match is done on substrings: if the file parameter is a
substring of the file name, it is considered to be a <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will exclude any inline function
defined in files whose pathnames contain
&quot;/bits/stl&quot; or &quot;include/sys&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, for some reason, you want to
include letter &rsquo;,&rsquo; in one of sym, write
&rsquo;,&rsquo;. For example,
&quot;-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=&rsquo;,,tmp&rsquo;&quot;
(note the single quote <br>
surrounding the option).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,...
<br>
This is similar to
&quot;-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list&quot;, but
this option sets the list of function names to be excluded
from instrumentation. The function name to be <br>
matched is its user-visible name, such as
&quot;vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt;
&amp;)&quot;, not the internal mangled name (e.g.,
&quot;_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE&quot;). The match is done on
<br>
substrings: if the sym parameter is a substring of the
function name, it is considered to be a match. For C99 and
C++ extended identifiers, the function name must be given
<br>
in UTF-8, not using universal character names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-check <br>
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the
boundary of the stack. You should specify this flag if you
are running in an environment with multiple threads, but
<br>
only rarely need to specify it in a single-threaded
environment since stack overflow is automatically detected
on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this switch does not
actually cause checking to be done; the operating system or
the language runtime must do that. The switch causes
generation of code to ensure <br>
that they see the stack being extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can additionally specify a
string parameter: &quot;no&quot; means no checking,
&quot;generic&quot; means force the use of old-style
checking, &quot;specific&quot; means use the best checking
method <br>
and is equivalent to bare -fstack-check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old-style checking is a generic
mechanism that requires no specific target support in the
compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Modified allocation strategy
for large objects: they will always be allocated dynamically
if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Fixed limit on the size of
the static frame of functions: when it is topped by a
particular function, stack checking is not reliable and a
warning is issued by the <br>
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Inefficiency: because of both
the modified allocation strategy and the generic
implementation, the performances of the code are
hampered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that old-style stack
checking is also the fallback method for
&quot;specific&quot; if no target support has been added in
the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-limit-register=reg <br>
-fstack-limit-symbol=sym <br>
-fno-stack-limit <br>
Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond
a certain value, either the value of a register or the
address of a symbol. If the stack would grow beyond the <br>
value, a signal is raised. For most targets, the signal is
raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so it is
possible to catch the signal without taking special <br>
precautions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if the stack
starts at absolute address 0x80000000 and grows downwards,
you can use the flags -fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit and
<br>
-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000 to enforce a stack
limit of 128KB. Note that this may only work with the GNU
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-stack <br>
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it
overflows. The resulting program has a discontiguous stack
which can only overflow if the program is unable to <br>
allocate any more memory. This is most useful when running
threaded programs, as it is no longer necessary to calculate
a good stack size to use for each thread. This is <br>
currently only implemented for the i386 and x86_64 back ends
running GNU/Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When code compiled with
-fsplit-stack calls code compiled without -fsplit-stack,
there may not be much stack space available for the latter
code to run. If compiling all <br>
code, including library code, with -fsplit-stack is not an
option, then the linker can fix up these calls so that the
code compiled without -fsplit-stack always has a large <br>
stack. Support for this is implemented in the gold linker in
GNU binutils release 2.21 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fleading-underscore <br>
This option and its counterpart, -fno-leading-underscore,
forcibly change the way C symbols are represented in the
object file. One use is to help link with legacy assembly
<br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the
-fleading-underscore switch causes GCC to generate code that
is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch. Use it to conform to a non- <br>
default application binary interface. Not all targets
provide complete support for this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftls-model=model <br>
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used. The model
argument should be one of &quot;global-dynamic&quot;,
&quot;local-dynamic&quot;, &quot;initial-exec&quot; or
&quot;local-exec&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default without -fpic is
&quot;initial-exec&quot;; with -fpic the default is
&quot;global-dynamic&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvisibility=default|internal|hidden|protected
<br>
Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified
option---all symbols will be marked with this unless
overridden within the code. Using this feature can very <br>
substantially improve linking and load times of shared
object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide
near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes. It is
<br>
strongly recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite the nomenclature,
&quot;default&quot; always means public; i.e., available to
be linked against from outside the shared object.
&quot;protected&quot; and &quot;internal&quot; are pretty
useless <br>
in real-world usage so the only other commonly used option
will be &quot;hidden&quot;. The default if -fvisibility
isn&rsquo;t specified is &quot;default&quot;, i.e., make
every symbol public---this <br>
causes the same behavior as previous versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good explanation of the
benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols have the correct
visibility is given by &quot;How To Write Shared
Libraries&quot; by Ulrich Drepper (which can be <br>
found at
&lt;http://people.redhat.com/~drepper/&gt;)---however a
superior solution made possible by this option to marking
things hidden when the default is public is to make the <br>
default hidden and mark things public. This is the norm with
DLL&rsquo;s on Windows and with -fvisibility=hidden and
&quot;__attribute__
((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))&quot; instead of <br>
&quot;__declspec(dllexport)&quot; you get almost identical
semantics with identical syntax. This is a great boon to
those working with cross-platform projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those adding visibility
support to existing code, you may find #pragma GCC
visibility of use. This works by you enclosing the
declarations you wish to set visibility for <br>
with (for example) #pragma GCC visibility push(hidden) and
#pragma GCC visibility pop. Bear in mind that symbol
visibility should be viewed as part of the API interface
<br>
contract and thus all new code should always specify
visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should always be marked
<br>
explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection
overheads---making this abundantly clear also aids
readability and self-documentation of the code. Note that
due to ISO <br>
C++ specification requirements, operator new and operator
delete must always be of default visibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that headers from
outside your project, in particular system headers and
headers from any other library you use, may not be expecting
to be compiled with visibility <br>
other than the default. You may need to explicitly say
#pragma GCC visibility push(default) before including any
such headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern declarations are not
affected by -fvisibility, so a lot of code can be recompiled
with -fvisibility=hidden with no modifications. However,
this means that calls to <br>
extern functions with no explicit visibility will use the
PLT, so it is more effective to use __attribute
((visibility)) and/or #pragma GCC visibility to tell the
compiler <br>
which extern declarations should be treated as hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -fvisibility does
affect C++ vague linkage entities. This means that, for
instance, an exception class that will be thrown between
DSOs must be explicitly marked <br>
with default visibility so that the type_info nodes will be
unified between the DSOs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An overview of these techniques,
their benefits and how to use them is at
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields <br>
This option should be used if accesses to volatile
bit-fields (or other structure fields, although the compiler
usually honors those types anyway) should use a single
access <br>
of the width of the field&rsquo;s type, aligned to a natural
alignment if possible. For example, targets with
memory-mapped peripheral registers might require all such
accesses to <br>
be 16 bits wide; with this flag the user could declare all
peripheral bit-fields as &quot;unsigned short&quot;
(assuming short is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to
use 16-bit <br>
accesses instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is disabled, the
compiler will use the most efficient instruction. In the
previous example, that might be a 32-bit load instruction,
even though that will <br>
access bytes that do not contain any portion of the
bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to the one
being updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the target requires strict
alignment, and honoring the field type would require
violating this alignment, a warning is issued. If the field
has &quot;packed&quot; attribute, the <br>
access is done without honoring the field type. If the field
doesn&rsquo;t have &quot;packed&quot; attribute, the access
is done honoring the field type. In both cases, GCC assumes
that <br>
the user knows something about the target hardware that it
is unaware of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of this option
is determined by the application binary interface for the
target processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
This section describes several environment variables that
affect how GCC operates. Some of them work by specifying
directories or prefixes to use when searching for various
<br>
kinds of files. Some are used to specify other aspects of
the compilation environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can also specify
places to search using options such as -B, -I and -L. These
take precedence over places specified using environment
variables, which in turn take <br>
precedence over those specified by the configuration of
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG <br>
LC_CTYPE <br>
LC_MESSAGES <br>
LC_ALL <br>
These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information which allows GCC to work with
different national conventions. GCC inspects the locale <br>
categories LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES if it has been
configured to do so. These locale categories can be set to
any value supported by your installation. A typical value is
<br>
en_GB.UTF-8 for English in the United Kingdom encoded in
UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LC_CTYPE environment
variable specifies character classification. GCC uses it to
determine the character boundaries in a string; this is
needed for some multibyte <br>
encodings that contain quote and escape characters that
would otherwise be interpreted as a string end or
escape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LC_MESSAGES environment
variable specifies the language to use in diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the LC_ALL environment
variable is set, it overrides the value of LC_CTYPE and
LC_MESSAGES; otherwise, LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES default to
the value of the LANG <br>
environment variable. If none of these variables are set,
GCC defaults to traditional C English behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR <br>
If TMPDIR is set, it specifies the directory to use for
temporary files. GCC uses temporary files to hold the output
of one stage of compilation which is to be used as input
<br>
to the next stage: for example, the output of the
preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler proper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG <br>
Setting GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG is nearly equivalent to passing
-fcompare-debug to the compiler driver. See the
documentation of this option for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX <br>
If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is set, it specifies a prefix to use in
the names of the subprograms executed by the compiler. No
slash is added when this prefix is combined with the <br>
name of a subprogram, but you can specify a prefix that ends
with a slash if you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is not set,
GCC will attempt to figure out an appropriate prefix to use
based on the pathname it was invoked with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If GCC cannot find the
subprogram using the specified prefix, it tries looking in
the usual places for the subprogram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is prefix/lib/gcc/ where prefix is the
prefix to the installed compiler. In many cases prefix is
the value of &quot;prefix&quot; when you ran the <br>
configure script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other prefixes specified with -B
take precedence over this prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prefix is also used for
finding files such as crt0.o that are used for linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the prefix is used
in an unusual way in finding the directories to search for
header files. For each of the standard directories whose
name normally begins with <br>
/usr/local/lib/gcc (more precisely, with the value of
GCC_INCLUDE_DIR), GCC tries replacing that beginning with
the specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.
<br>
Thus, with -Bfoo/, GCC will search foo/bar where it would
normally search /usr/local/lib/bar. These alternate
directories are searched first; the standard directories
come <br>
next. If a standard directory begins with the configured
prefix then the value of prefix is replaced by
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX when looking for header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPILER_PATH <br>
The value of COMPILER_PATH is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like PATH. GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can&rsquo;t
<br>
find the subprograms using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBRARY_PATH <br>
The value of LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like PATH. When configured as a native
compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when <br>
searching for special linker files, if it can&rsquo;t find
them using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX. Linking using GCC also uses
these directories when searching for ordinary libraries for
the <br>
-l option (but directories specified with -L come
first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG <br>
This variable is used to pass locale information to the
compiler. One way in which this information is used is to
determine the character set to be used when character <br>
literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and
C++. When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte
characters, the following values for LANG are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-JIS <br>
Recognize JIS characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-SJIS <br>
Recognize SJIS characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-EUCJP <br>
Recognize EUCJP characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LANG is not defined, or if it
has some other value, then the compiler will use mblen and
mbtowc as defined by the default locale to recognize and
translate multibyte <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some additional environments
variables affect the behavior of the preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPATH <br>
C_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
Each variable&rsquo;s value is a list of directories
separated by a special character, much like PATH, in which
to look for header files. The special character,
&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, <br>
is target-dependent and determined at GCC build time. For
Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for
almost all other targets it is a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPATH specifies a list of
directories to be searched as if specified with -I, but
after any paths given with -I options on the command line.
This environment variable is <br>
used regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining environment
variables apply only when preprocessing the particular
language indicated. Each specifies a list of directories to
be searched as if specified with <br>
-isystem, but after any paths given with -isystem options on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all these variables, an empty
element instructs the compiler to search its current working
directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end
of a path. For <br>
instance, if the value of CPATH is
&quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
-I. -I/special/include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT <br>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files
processed by the compiler. System header files are <br>
ignored in the dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are
written to that file, guessing the target name from the
source file name. Or the <br>
value can have the form file target, in which case the rules
are written to file file using target as the target
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, this environment
variable is equivalent to combining the options -MM and -MF,
with an optional -MT switch too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES <br>
This variable is the same as DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see
above), except that system header files are not ignored, so
it implies -M rather than -MM. However, the dependence on
<br>
the main input file is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>

&lt;file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.7/README.Bugs&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOOTNOTES <br>
1. On some systems, gcc -shared needs to build supplementary
stub code for constructors to work. On multi-libbed systems,
gcc -shared must select the correct support libraries <br>
to link against. Failing to supply the correct flags may
lead to subtle defects. Supplying them in cases where they
are not necessary is innocuous.</p>
