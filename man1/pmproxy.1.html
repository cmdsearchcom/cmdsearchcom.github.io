<p>PMPROXY(1) General Commands Manual PMPROXY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmproxy - proxy for performance metrics collector daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmproxy [-Af] [-C dirname] [-i ipaddress] [-l logfile] [-L
bytes] [-M certname] [-p port[,port ...] [-P passfile] [-U
username] [-x file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmproxy acts as a protocol proxy for pmcd(1), allowing
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to
one or more pmcd(1) instances via pmproxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmproxy is deployed in
a firewall domain, or on a &lsquo;&lsquo;head&rsquo;&rsquo;
node of a cluster where the IP (Internet Protocol) address
of the hosts where pmcd(1) is running may be <br>
unknown to the PCP monitoring clients, although the IP
address of the host where pmproxy is running is known to
these clients. Similarly, the clients may have network
connectiv&acirc; <br>
ity only to the host where pmproxy is running, while there
is network connectivity from that host to the hosts of
interest where pmcd(1) is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behaviour of the PCP
monitoring clients is controlled by either the PMPROXY_HOST
environment variable or through the extended hostname
specification (see PCPIntro(1) for <br>
details). If neither of these mechanisms is used, clients
will make their connections directly to pmcd(1). If the
proxy hostname syntax is used or PMPROXY_HOST is set, then
<br>
this should be the hostname or IP address of the system
where pmproxy is running, and the clients will connect to
pmcd(1) indirectly through the protocol proxy services of
<br>
pmproxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options to pmproxy are as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Disable service
advertisement. By default, pmproxy will advertise its
presence on the network using any available mechanisms (such
as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote mon&acirc; <br>
itoring tools with finding it. These mechanisms are disabled
with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dirname <br>
Specify the path to the Network Security Services
certificate database, for (optional) secure connections. The
default is /etc/pki/nssdb. Refer also to the -P option. <br>
If it does not already exist, this database can be created
using the certutil utility. This process and other
certificate database maintenance information is provided in
<br>
the PCPIntro(1) manual page and the online PCP
tutorials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f By default pmproxy is started
as a daemon. The -f option indicates that it should run in
the foreground. This is most useful when trying to diagnose
problems with estab&acirc; <br>
lishing connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i ipaddress <br>
This option is usually only used on hosts with more than one
network interface (very common for firewall and
&lsquo;&lsquo;head&rsquo;&rsquo; node hosts where pmproxy is
most likely to be <br>
deployed). If no -i options are specified pmproxy accepts
PCP client connections on any of its host&rsquo;s IP
addresses. The -i option is used to specify explicitly an IP
<br>
address that PCP client connections should be accepted on.
ipaddress should be in the standard dotted form (e.g.
100.23.45.6). The -i option may be used multiple times <br>
to define a list of IP addresses. When one or more -i
options is specified, attempted connections made on any
other IP addresses will be refused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile <br>
By default a log file named pmproxy.log is written in the
current directory. The -l option causes the log file to be
written to logfile instead of the default. If the <br>
log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L bytes <br>
PDUs received by pmproxy from PCP monitoring clients are
restricted to a maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to
defend against Denial of Service attacks. The -L option <br>
may be used to change the maximum incoming PDU size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M certname <br>
By default, pmproxy will try to use a certificate called PCP
Collector certificate in its server role. The -M option
allows this to be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P passfile <br>
Specify the path to a file containing the Network Security
Services certificate database password for (optional) secure
connections, and for databases that are password <br>
protected. Refer also to the -C option. When using this
option, great care should be exercised to ensure appropriate
ownership (&quot;pcp&quot; user, typically) and permissions
on <br>
this file (0400, so as to be unreadable by any user other
than the user running the pmproxy process).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username <br>
Assume the identity of username before starting to accept
incoming packets from PCP monitoring clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x file <br>
Before the pmproxy logfile can be opened, pmproxy may
encounter a fatal error which prevents it from starting. By
default, the output describing this error is sent to <br>
/dev/tty but it may redirected to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTING AND STOPPING PMPROXY
<br>
Normally, pmproxy is started automatically at boot time and
stopped when the system is being brought down. Under certain
circumstances it is necessary to start or stop pmproxy <br>
manually. To do this one must become superuser and type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy start</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to start pmproxy, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy stop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to stop pmproxy. Starting
pmproxy when it is already running is the same as stopping
it and then starting it again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmproxy listens for PCP
client connections on TCP/IP port number 44322 (registered
at http://www.iana.org/). Either the environment variable
PMPROXY_PORT -p command <br>
line option may be used to specify alternative port
number(s) when PMPROXY_PORT or the -p command line option
may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
pmproxy is <br>
started; in each case, the specification is a
comma-separated list of one or more numerical port numbers.
Should both methods be used or multiple -p options appear on
the com&acirc; <br>
mand line, pmproxy will listen on the union of the set of
ports specified via all -p options and the PMPROXY_PORT
environment variable. If non-default ports are used with
<br>
pmproxy care should be taken to ensure that PMPROXY_PORT is
also set in the environment of any client application that
will connect to pmproxy, or that the extended host
specifi&acirc; <br>
cation syntax is used (see PCPIntro(1) for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
PCP_PMPROXYOPTIONS_PATH <br>
command line options for pmproxy when launched from
$PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy All the command line option lines should
start with a hyphen as the first character. <br>
$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmproxy <br>
additional environment variables that will be set when
pmproxy executes. Only settings of the form
&quot;PMPROXY_VARIABLE=value&quot; will be honoured. <br>
./pmproxy.log <br>
(or $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmproxy/pmproxy.log when started
automatically) <br>
All messages and diagnostics are directed here <br>
/etc/pki/nssdb <br>
default Network Security Services (NSS) certificate database
directory, used for optional Secure Socket Layer
connections. This database can be created and queried using
<br>
the NSS certutil tool, amongst others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
In addition to the PCP environment variables described in
the PCP ENVIRONMENT section below, there are several
environment variables that influence the interactions
between a PCP <br>
monitoring client, pmcd and pmcd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMCD_PORT <br>
For the PCP monitoring client this (or the default port
number) is passed to pmproxy and used to connect to pmcd(1).
In the environment of pmproxy PMCD_PORT is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMPROXY_HOST <br>
For the PCP monitoring client this is the hostname or IP
address of the host where pmproxy is running. In recent
versions of PCP (since version 3) this has been super&acirc;
<br>
seded by the extended hostname syntax (see PCPIntro(1) for
details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMPROXY_PORT <br>
For the PCP monitoring client this is the port on which
pmproxy will accept connections. The default is 44322.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT,
PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT and PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT <br>
(see PCPIntro(1)) For the PCP monitoring client, setting
these environment variables will modify the timeouts used
for interactions between the client and pmproxy (inde&acirc;
<br>
pendent of which pmcd(1) is being used). For pmproxy these
same environment variables control the timeouts between
pmproxy and all pmcd(1) instances (independent of which <br>
monitoring client is involved).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to the value 1, the
PMPROXY_LOCAL environment variable will cause pmproxy to run
in a localhost-only mode of operation, where it binds only
to the loopback interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PMPROXY_MAXPENDING variable
can be set to indicate the maximum length to which the queue
of pending client connections may grow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), pmdbg(1), pcp.conf(5) and
pcp.env(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If pmproxy is already running the message &quot;Error:
OpenRequestSocket bind: Address already in use&quot; will
appear. This may also appear if pmproxy was shutdown with an
outstanding <br>
request from a client. In this case, a request socket has
been left in the TIME_WAIT state and until the system closes
it down (after some timeout period) it will not be
possi&acirc; <br>
ble to run pmproxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the standard PCP
debugging flags, see pmdbg(1), pmproxy currently uses
DBG_TRACE_CONTEXT for tracing client connections and
disconnections</p>
