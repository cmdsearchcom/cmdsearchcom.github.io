<b>pmproxy</b> acts as a protocol proxy for <b>pmcd</b>(1), allowing Performance
  Co-Pilot (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to one or more <b>pmcd</b>(1)
  instances via <b>pmproxy</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally <b>pmproxy</b> is deployed in a firewall domain, or on a ``head'' node
  of a cluster where the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the hosts where
  <b>pmcd</b>(1) is running may be unknown to the PCP monitoring clients,
  although the IP address of the host where <b>pmproxy</b> is running is known
  to these clients. Similarly, the clients may have network connectivity only to
  the host where <b>pmproxy</b> is running, while there is network connectivity
  from that host to the hosts of interest where <b>pmcd</b>(1) is running.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The behaviour of the PCP monitoring clients is controlled by either the
  <b>PMPROXY_HOST</b> environment variable or through the extended hostname
  specification (see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for details). If neither of these
  mechanisms is used, clients will make their connections directly to
  <b>pmcd</b>(1). If the proxy hostname syntax is used or <b>PMPROXY_HOST</b> is
  set, then this should be the hostname or IP address of the system where
  <b>pmproxy</b> is running, and the clients will connect to <b>pmcd</b>(1)
  indirectly through the protocol proxy services of <b>pmproxy.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The options to <b>pmproxy</b> are as follows.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-A</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disable service advertisement. By default, <b>pmproxy</b>
      will advertise its presence on the network using any available mechanisms
      (such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote monitoring tools with finding it.
      These mechanisms are disabled with this option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-C</b> <i>dirname</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the path to the Network Security Services
      certificate database, for (optional) secure connections. The default is
      <b>/etc/pki/nssdb</b>. Refer also to the <b>-P</b> option. If it does not
      already exist, this database can be created using the <b>certutil</b>
      utility. This process and other certificate database maintenance
      information is provided in the <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) manual page and the
      online PCP tutorials.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default <b>pmproxy</b> is started as a daemon. The
      <b>-f</b> option indicates that it should run in the foreground. This is
      most useful when trying to diagnose problems with establishing
      connections.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b> <i>ipaddress</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option is usually only used on hosts with more than
      one network interface (very common for firewall and ``head'' node hosts
      where <b>pmproxy</b> is most likely to be deployed). If no <b>-i</b>
      options are specified <b>pmproxy</b> accepts PCP client connections on any
      of its host's IP addresses. The <b>-i</b> option is used to specify
      explicitly an IP address that PCP client connections should be accepted
      on. <i>ipaddress</i> should be in the standard dotted form (e.g.
      100.23.45.6). The <b>-i</b> option may be used multiple times to define a
      list of IP addresses. When one or more <b>-i</b> options is specified,
      attempted connections made on any other IP addresses will be refused.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b> <i>logfile</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default a log file named <i>pmproxy.log</i> is written
      in the current directory. The <b>-l</b> option causes the log file to be
      written to <i>logfile</i> instead of the default. If the log file cannot
      be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error
      instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-L</b> <i>bytes</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>PDU</i>s received by <b>pmproxy</b> from PCP monitoring
      clients are restricted to a maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to
      defend against Denial of Service attacks. The <b>-L</b> option may be used
      to change the maximum incoming <i>PDU</i> size.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-M</b> <i>certname</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">By default, pmproxy will try to use a certificate called
      <b>PCP Collector certificate</b> in its server role. The <b>-M</b> option
      allows this to be changed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-P</b> <i>passfile</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the path to a file containing the Network Security
      Services certificate database password for (optional) secure connections,
      and for databases that are password protected. Refer also to the <b>-C</b>
      option. When using this option, great care should be exercised to ensure
      appropriate ownership (&quot;pcp&quot; user, typically) and permissions on
      this file (0400, so as to be unreadable by any user other than the user
      running the <b>pmproxy</b> process).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-U</b> <i>username</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Assume the identity of <i>username</i> before starting to
      accept incoming packets from PCP monitoring clients.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-x</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Before the <b>pmproxy</b> <i>logfile</i> can be opened,
      <b>pmproxy</b> may encounter a fatal error which prevents it from
      starting. By default, the output describing this error is sent to
      <b>/dev/tty</b> but it may redirected to <i>file</i>.</dd>

  AND STOPPING PMPROXY</a></h1>
Normally, <b>pmproxy</b> is started automatically at boot time and stopped when
  the system is being brought down. Under certain circumstances it is necessary
  to start or stop <b>pmproxy</b> manually. To do this one must become superuser
  and type
<div class="Pp"></div>
# $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy start
<div class="Pp"></div>
to start <b>pmproxy</b>, or
<div class="Pp"></div>
# $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy stop
<div class="Pp"></div>
to stop <b>pmproxy</b>. Starting <b>pmproxy</b> when it is already running is
  the same as stopping it and then starting it again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally <b>pmproxy</b> listens for PCP client connections on TCP/IP port number
  44322 (registered at <i>http://www.iana.org/</i>). Either the environment
  variable <b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> <b>-p</b> command line option may be used to
  specify alternative port number(s) when <b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> or the <b>-p</b>
  command line option may be used to specify alternative port number(s) when
  <b>pmproxy</b> is started; in each case, the specification is a
  comma-separated list of one or more numerical port numbers. Should both
  methods be used or multiple <b>-p</b> options appear on the command line,
  <b>pmproxy</b> will listen on the union of the set of ports specified via all
  <b>-p</b> options and the <b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> environment variable. If
  non-default ports are used with <b>pmproxy</b> care should be taken to ensure
  that <b>PMPROXY_PORT</b> is also set in the environment of any client
  application that will connect to <b>pmproxy</b>, or that the extended host
  specification syntax is used (see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for details).

In addition to the PCP environment variables described in the <b>PCP
  ENVIRONMENT</b> section below, there are several environment variables that
  influence the interactions between a PCP monitoring client, <b>pmcd</b> and
  <b>pmcd</b>(1).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PMCD_PORT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For the PCP monitoring client this (or the default port
      number) is passed to <b>pmproxy</b> and used to connect to <b>pmcd</b>(1).
      In the environment of <b>pmproxy</b> <b>PMCD_PORT is not used.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PMPROXY_HOST</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For the PCP monitoring client this is the hostname or IP
      address of the host where <b>pmproxy</b> is running. In recent versions of
      PCP (since version 3) this has been superseded by the extended hostname
      syntax (see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for details).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PMPROXY_PORT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For the PCP monitoring client this is the port on which
      <b>pmproxy</b> will accept connections. The default is 44322.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>, <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
    and <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(see <b>PCPIntro</b>(1)) For the PCP monitoring client,
      setting these environment variables will modify the timeouts used for
      interactions between the client and <b>pmproxy</b> (independent of which
      <b>pmcd</b>(1) is being used). For <b>pmproxy</b> these same environment
      variables control the timeouts between <b>pmproxy</b> and all
      <b>pmcd</b>(1) instances (independent of which monitoring client is
      involved).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If set to the value 1, the <b>PMPROXY_LOCAL</b> environment variable will cause
  <b>pmproxy</b> to run in a localhost-only mode of operation, where it binds
  only to the loopback interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>PMPROXY_MAXPENDING</b> variable can be set to indicate the maximum length
  to which the queue of pending client connections may grow.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PCP_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#PCP_ENVIRONMENT">PCP
  ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the
  file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
  <b>/etc/pcp.conf</b> contains the local values for these variables. The
  <b>PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
  file, as described in <b>pcp.conf</b>(5).

  ALSO</a></h1>
<b>PCPIntro</b>(1), <b>pmcd</b>(1), <b>pmdbg</b>(1), <b>pcp.conf</b>(5) and
  <b>pcp.env</b>(5).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
If <b>pmproxy</b> is already running the message &quot;Error: OpenRequestSocket
  bind: Address already in use&quot; will appear. This may also appear if
  <b>pmproxy</b> was shutdown with an outstanding request from a client. In this
  case, a request socket has been left in the TIME_WAIT state and until the
  system closes it down (after some timeout period) it will not be possible to
  run <b>pmproxy</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the standard <b>PCP</b> debugging flags, see <b>pmdbg</b>(1),
  <b>pmproxy</b> currently uses <b>DBG_TRACE_CONTEXT</b> for tracing client
  connections and disconnections</div>
