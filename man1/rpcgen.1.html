<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rpcgen - an RPC protocol compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rpcgen infile <br>
rpcgen [-Dname[=value]] [-T] [-K secs] infile <br>
rpcgen -c|-h|-l|-m|-M|-t [-o outfile ] infile <br>
rpcgen [-I] -s nettype [-o outfile] infile <br>
rpcgen -n netid [-o outfile] infile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rpcgen is a tool that generates C code to implement an RPC
protocol. The input to rpcgen is a language similar to C
known as RPC Language (Remote Procedure Call Language).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpcgen is normally used as in
the first synopsis where it takes an input file and
generates up to four output files. If the infile is named
proto.x, then rpcgen will generate a <br>
header file in proto.h, XDR routines in proto_xdr.c,
server-side stubs in proto_svc.c, and client-side stubs in
proto_clnt.c. With the -T option, it will also generate the
RPC <br>
dispatch table in proto_tbl.i. With the -Sc option, it will
also generate sample code which would illustrate how to use
the remote procedures on the client side. This code <br>
would be created in proto_client.c. With the -Ss option, it
will also generate a sample server code which would
illustrate how to write the remote procedures. This code
would <br>
be created in proto_server.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server created can be
started both by the port monitors (for example, inetd or
listen) or by itself. When it is started by a port monitor,
it creates servers only for the <br>
transport for which the file descriptor 0 was passed. The
name of the transport must be specified by setting up the
environmental variable PM_TRANSPORT. When the server
gener&acirc; <br>
ated by rpcgen is executed, it creates server handles for
all the transports specified in NETPATH environment
variable, or if it is unset, it creates server handles for
all the <br>
visible transports from /etc/netconfig file. Note: the
transports are chosen at run time and not at compile
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When built for a port monitor
(rpcgen -I), and that the server is self-started, it
backgrounds itself by default. A special define symbol
RPC_SVC_FG can be used to run the <br>
server process in foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second synopsis provides
special features which allow for the creation of more
sophisticated RPC servers. These features include support
for user provided #defines and RPC <br>
dispatch tables. The entries in the RPC dispatch table
contain: <br>
&Acirc;&middot; pointers to the service routine
corresponding to that procedure, <br>
&Acirc;&middot; a pointer to the input and output arguments
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; the size of these routines <br>
A server can use the dispatch table to check authorization
and then to execute the service routine; a client library
may use it to deal with the details of storage management
and <br>
XDR data conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other three synopses shown
above are used when one does not want to generate all the
output files, but only a particular one. Some examples of
their usage is described in <br>
the EXAMPLE section below. When rpcgen is executed with the
-s option, it creates servers for that particular class of
transports. When executed with the -n option, it creates
<br>
a server for the transport specified by netid. If infile is
not specified, rpcgen accepts the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C preprocessor, cc -E [see
cc(1)], is run on the input file before it is actually
interpreted by rpcgen. For each type of output file, rpcgen
defines a special preprocessor <br>
symbol for use by the rpcgen programmer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RPC_HDR defined when compiling
into header files <br>
RPC_XDR defined when compiling into XDR routines <br>
RPC_SVC defined when compiling into server-side stubs <br>
RPC_CLNT defined when compiling into client-side stubs <br>
RPC_TBL defined when compiling into RPC dispatch tables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any line beginning with
&lsquo;%&rsquo; is passed directly into the output file,
uninterpreted by rpcgen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For every data type referred to
in infile, rpcgen assumes that there exists a routine with
the string xdr_ prepended to the name of the data type. If
this routine does not exist <br>
in the RPC/XDR library, it must be provided. Providing an
undefined data type allows customization of XDR
routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Generate all the files
including sample code for client and server side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b This generates code for the
SunOS4.1 style of rpc. It is for backward compatibility.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-5 This generates code for the
SysVr4 style of rpc. It is used by the Transport Independent
RPC that is in Svr4 systems. By default rpcgen generates
code for SunOS4.1 stype <br>
of rpc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Compile into XDR
routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Generate code in ANSI C. This
option also generates code that could be compiled with the
C++ compiler. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Generate code in K&amp;R C.
The default is ANSI C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname[=value] <br>
Define a symbol name. Equivalent to the #define directive in
the source. If no value is given, value is defined as 1.
This option may be specified more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Compile into C
data-definitions (a header file). -T option can be used in
conjunction to produce a header file which supports RPC
dispatch tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Generate a service that can
be started from inetd. The default is to generate a static
service that handles transports selected with -s. Using -I
allows starting a ser&acirc; <br>
vice by either method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K secs <br>
By default, services created using rpcgen wait 120 seconds
after servicing a request before exiting. That interval can
be changed using the -K flag. To create a server <br>
that exits immediately upon servicing a request, -K 0 can be
used. To create a server that never exits, the appropriate
argument is -K -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When monitoring for a server,
some portmonitors, like listen(1M), always spawn a new
process in response to a service request. If it is known
that a server will be used <br>
with such a monitor, the server should exit immediately on
completion. For such servers, rpcgen should be used with -K
-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Compile into client-side
stubs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Compile into server-side
stubs, but do not generate a &acirc;main&acirc; routine.
This option is useful for doing callback-routines and for
users who need to write their own &acirc;main&acirc; <br>
routine to do initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Generate multithread-safe
stubs for passing arguments and results between
rpcgen-generated code and user written code. This option is
useful for users who want to use <br>
threads in their code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n netid <br>
Compile into server-side stubs for the transport specified
by netid. There should be an entry for netid in the
netconfig database. This option may be specified more than
<br>
once, so as to compile a server that serves multiple
transports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Use the newstyle of rpcgen.
This allows procedures to have multiple arguments. It also
uses the style of parameter passing that closely resembles
C. So, when passing an <br>
argument to a remote procedure you do not have to pass a
pointer to the argument but the argument itself. This
behaviour is different from the oldstyle of rpcgen
gener&acirc; <br>
ated code. The newstyle is not the default case because of
backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Specify the name of the output file. If none is specified,
standard output is used (-c, -h, -l, -m, -n, -s, -Sc, -Sm,
-Ss, and -t modes only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s nettype <br>
Compile into server-side stubs for all the transports
belonging to the class nettype. The supported classes are
netpath, visible, circuit_n, circuit_v, datagram_n,
data&acirc; <br>
gram_v, tcp, and udp [see rpc(3N) for the meanings
associated with these classes]. This option may be specified
more than once. Note: the transports are chosen at run <br>
time and not at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sc Generate sample code to show
the use of remote procedure and how to bind to the server
before calling the client side stubs generated by
rpcgen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sm Generate a sample Makefile
which can be used for compiling the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ss Generate skeleton code for
the remote procedures on the server side. You would need to
fill in the actual code for the remote procedures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Compile into RPC dispatch
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Generate the code to support
RPC dispatch tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options -c, -h, -l, -m, -s
and -t are used exclusively to generate a particular type of
file, while the options -D and -T are global and can be used
with the other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The RPC Language does not support nesting of structures. As
a work-around, structures can be declared at the top-level,
and their name used inside other structures in order to <br>
achieve the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name clashes can occur when
using program definitions, since the apparent scoping does
not really apply. Most of these can be avoided by giving
unique names for programs, ver&acirc; <br>
sions, procedures and types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server code generated with
-n option refers to the transport indicated by netid and
hence is very site specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
The following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rpcgen -T prot.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generates the five files:
prot.h, prot_clnt.c, prot_svc.c, prot_xdr.c and
prot_tbl.i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example sends the
C data-definitions (header file) to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rpcgen -h prot.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To send the test version of the
-DTEST, server side stubs for all the transport belonging to
the class datagram_n to standard output, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rpcgen -s datagram_n -DTEST
prot.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create the server side stubs
for the transport indicated by netid tcp, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ rpcgen -n tcp -o prot_svc.c
prot.x</p>
