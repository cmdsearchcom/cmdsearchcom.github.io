hmount - introduce a new HFS volume and make it current

hmount <i>source-path</i> [<i>partition-no</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>hmount</b> is used to introduce a new HFS volume. A UNIX pathname to the
  volume's source must be specified. The source may be a block device or a
  regular file containing an HFS volume image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the source medium is partitioned, one partition must be selected to be
  mounted. If there is only one HFS partition on the medium, it will be selected
  by default. Otherwise, the desired partition number must be specified (as the
  ordinal <i>n</i>th HFS partition) on the command-line. Partition number
  <b>0</b> can be specified to refer to the entire medium, ignoring what might
  otherwise be perceived as a partition map, although in practice this is
  probably only useful if you want this command to fail when the medium is
  partitioned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The mounted volume becomes &quot;current&quot; so subsequent commands will refer
  to it. The current working directory for the volume is set to the root of the
  volume. This information is kept in a file named <i>.hcwd</i> in the user's
  home directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the source medium is changed (e.g. floppy or CD-ROM disc exchanged) after
  <b>hmount</b> has been called, subsequent HFS commands will fail until the
  original medium is replaced or a different volume is made current. To use the
  same source path with the different medium, reissue the <b>hmount</b> command.

<b>hmount</b> does not actually mount an HFS partition over a UNIX directory in
  the traditional mount(8) sense. It is merely a &quot;virtual&quot; mount, as a
  point of convenience for future HFS operations. Each HFS command independently
  opens, operates on, and closes the named source path given to <b>hmount</b>.
