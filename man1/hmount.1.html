<p>HMOUNT(1) General Commands Manual HMOUNT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hmount - introduce a new HFS volume and make it current</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hmount source-path [partition-no]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hmount is used to introduce a new HFS volume. A UNIX
pathname to the volume&rsquo;s source must be specified. The
source may be a block device or a regular file containing an
HFS vol&acirc; <br>
ume image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source medium is
partitioned, one partition must be selected to be mounted.
If there is only one HFS partition on the medium, it will be
selected by default. Otherwise, <br>
the desired partition number must be specified (as the
ordinal nth HFS partition) on the command-line. Partition
number 0 can be specified to refer to the entire medium,
ignoring <br>
what might otherwise be perceived as a partition map,
although in practice this is probably only useful if you
want this command to fail when the medium is
partitioned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mounted volume becomes
&quot;current&quot; so subsequent commands will refer to it.
The current working directory for the volume is set to the
root of the volume. This information is <br>
kept in a file named .hcwd in the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source medium is changed
(e.g. floppy or CD-ROM disc exchanged) after hmount has been
called, subsequent HFS commands will fail until the original
medium is replaced or a <br>
different volume is made current. To use the same source
path with the different medium, reissue the hmount
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
% hmount /dev/fd0 <br>
If a Macintosh floppy disk is available as /dev/fd0, this
command makes the floppy current for other HFS commands such
as hls(1), hcd(1), hcopy(1), etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% hmount /dev/sd2 1 <br>
If a SCSI disk is available as /dev/sd2, this command finds
the first HFS partition on the medium and makes it available
for other HFS operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
hmount does not actually mount an HFS partition over a UNIX
directory in the traditional mount(8) sense. It is merely a
&quot;virtual&quot; mount, as a point of convenience for
future HFS <br>
operations. Each HFS command independently opens, operates
on, and closes the named source path given to hmount.</p>
