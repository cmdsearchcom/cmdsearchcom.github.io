<p>Lazarus(1) Free Pascal RAD IDE Lazarus(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Lazarus - is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) for the
Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) including an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lazarus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This binary is an integrated development environment for the
Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) which is an advanced Turbo Pascal
and Delphi (7.0) compatible multi-target Pascal com&acirc;
<br>
piler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The IDE uses FPC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current main supported
targets are Linux, Mac OS X, Freebsd, and Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other targets are either
based on older versions of the compiler or are still in
development.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manpage is meant for
quick-reference only. Lazarus comes with an online manual,
which is updated constantly, while this man page can be out
of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage <br>
The user interface of the IDE has been designed to be
similar to Delphi. It provides the user with a user
friendly, but rather powerful editor, a form editor, an
extensive <br>
on-line help system and a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A windowing system is the base
of the user interface. The user will usually open a few text
editor windows in which he will design his program, during
which he can regularly <br>
check and debug through the use of hot keys. The high speed
of the compiler ensures that programmers can do this often
and therefore allows speedy development of code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help files <br>
No help files are provided by default. The user must
download the Lazarus and Free Pascal documentation in HTML
format and install it into the IDE using the
Help-&gt;Configure Help. <br>
Files can also be installed in this menu and can be useful
for source code that ships with HTML files as
documentation.</p>
