<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dbutil - database utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dbutil {-d | --dump} dbfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbutil {-q | --query} [-t]
dbfile key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbutil {-u | --update} [-n]
dbfile key [value]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbutil {-x | --delete} dbfile
key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbutil -t [date |
[+|-]interval]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The dbutil program maintains a database of key-value pairs
that can be queried and updated from the command line. For
each such pair in the database, it also keeps an expiration
<br>
time, so that unused entries can be purged from the
database. dbutil must be given an option specifying in which
mode to run the program. The following modes are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump (-d) <br>
Prints the contents of the database. Each database entry is
printed in one of the the following two formats, depending
on whether the record has an expiration time:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key value (expiration-time)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--query (-q) <br>
Prints the value of a particular key in the database. If the
-t flag is also specified, prints the expiration time of the
record. In addition, the --expire flag can be <br>
specified to update the expiration time on the record. Exits
0 if the key was found, 1 if the key was not in the
database, or 2 if there is a system error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update (-u) <br>
Sets the value of a key in the database to a particular
value. If no value is supplied, sets the value to the empty
string (which is not the same as deleting the record). <br>
The --expire flag can also be specified to set an expiration
time on the record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ordinarily, this option
overwrites any previous value in the database. If the -n
option is supplied, dbutil will not overwrite a previously
stored value in the database (and <br>
will not update the expiration time on the record). Exits 0
if the key was found, 1 if -n was specified and the key was
already in the database, or 2 if there is a system <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--expire={date | [+|-]interval}
<br>
This option can be specified in conjunction with --update or
--query to set an expiration time on the record. The option
has two formats. You can either specify an absolute <br>
time, as the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 GMT, or you
can specify an offset from the current time with the
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+|-]countunits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where + means in the future, -
means in the past, count is a number, and units is one of
the following characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s - seconds <br>
m - minutes <br>
h - hours <br>
D - days <br>
W - weeks <br>
M - months <br>
Y - years</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example --expire=+36D means
the record will be deleted in 36 days. If you always look up
key with the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbutil --query --expire=+36D
key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the key will only expire if
you do not look it up within 36 days.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that dbutil keeps a sorted
list of the records by time of last access. Thus, purging
old records is not an inherently expensive operation, and
happens automatically <br>
whenever you modify the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nosync (-N) <br>
Ordinarily, dbutil synchronously flushes the database file
to disk after making any modifications, to minimize the
window of vulnerability in which a crash could corrupt the
<br>
database (if the --dbhome option is not supplied).
Synchronously flushing the database file is slow, however.
This option suppresses that behavior, and can be used to
build <br>
lookup tables efficiently. For example, you might have a
script that builds a file x.db by issuing the following
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh -e <br>
rm -f x.db~ <br>
dbutil -Nu x.db~ key1 val1 <br>
dbutil -Nu x.db~ key2 val2 <br>
# ... <br>
dbutil -Nu x.db~ keyn valn <br>
dbutil -u @ @ <br>
mv -f x.db~ x.db</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete (-x) <br>
Deletes a particular key from the database (if the database
contains the key). Exits 0 if the key was found, 1 if the
key was not in the database, or 2 if there was a system <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t [date|interval] <br>
With no options, prints the number of seconds since Jan 1,
1970, GMT. With an argument that takes the same format as
--expire, prints the expiration time as an absolute <br>
number of seconds since 1970. Not really a database
function, but useful hen you want to store a timestamp in
the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -t can also be
combined with the --query option, in which case it causes
dbutil to print the expiration time of the key, rather than
its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dbutil attempts to minimize the
damage from an inopportune crash by flushing the database
file to disk whenever it is modified. However, there is
still a small window in which <br>
your database can be irrevocably corrupted. This may be
alright if you are just using the database to store
&quot;soft state&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want the database to be
recoverable under any circumstances, you must use
write-ahead logging, in which case dbutil needs to keep a
directory with database logs, not just <br>
a single database file. The following option specifies where
to keep the log files. It must be used in conjunction with
the other options for each mode except -t:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbhome=dbhome <br>
Specifies that database log files should be kept in
directory dbhome (which will be created if it does not
already exist). Note that database files with relative
pathnames <br>
will also be stored in this directory. It is highly
recommended that you use relative pathnames so as to store
database files and log files together. Otherwise, you run
the <br>
risk of accessing a logged database without the --dbhome
option and trashing its contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
When set, specifies a directory in which to keep log files,
so as to make the database crash-recoverable. This is
equivalent to specifying the option --dbhome=$DB_HOME <br>
(except that any actual --dbhome argument will override the
environment variable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you do not use the --dbhome option or DB_HOME environment
variable and your machine crashes at the wrong time, you can
lose your whole database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --dbhome may or may not work
if the directory is stored on NFS; it depends on the NFS
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you access the database from
multiple machines simultaneously, you will likely corrupt
the database. Accessing from multiple processes on one
machine is fine, because dbutil <br>
does locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you ever access the same
database file with and without the --dbhome option (or
DB_HOME), you will probably irrevocably trash it. For that
reason, databases with relative <br>
pathnames are actually stored in the log directory.</p>
