<p>deweb(1) General Commands Manual deweb(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
deweb - strips away C &amp; CWEB commands from CWEB
sources</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
deweb [ file1 file2 ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
deweb filters away all C &amp; CWEB commands from a CWEB
source code. This leaves only the LaTeX code. This stripped
code, in turn, may then be passed to a suitable syntax
checker <br>
for LaTeX, like ChkTeX and lacheck, or spell-checkers like
ispell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The chkweb tool, included in the
ChkTeX distribution will do just this; writing similar
scripts should be trivial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When deweb strips away the C
code from your CWEB source, it tries to preserve line
breaks. This means that the error reports from &lt;your
favorite tool&gt; will be correct regarding <br>
to line numbers. In most cases, the column position will
also be correct. This significantly simplifies finding the
errors in the LaTeX source (in contrast to the output from
<br>
cweave, which output is truly difficult to figure anything
out from).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deweb accepts a list of
filenames on the argument line, and will send its output to
stdout. If no filenames are given, it will read from stdin,
acting as a filter. No options <br>
are currently accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macho users may try to pipe the
output from deweb directly into LaTeX, theoretically, this
should work. This would ease the debugging of the LaTeX code
significantly, as when <br>
LaTeX complains about wrong syntax, you&rsquo;ll be able to
find the erroneous line much more easily. Don&rsquo;t expect
that the output looks very much like the final one,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deweb should now understand all
correct CWEB opcodes. If it complains about not
understanding a correct opcode, please inform the
author.</p>

cweave(1), perl(1), chktex, lacheck(1), ispell(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Doesn&rsquo;t even compile under Perl versions before perl
v5. Unfortunately, this means that we can&rsquo;t even tell
the user why we failed; Perl will just complain about not
being able to <br>
compile the regexps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will try to swallow
the whole input file at once, instead of processing it on a
line-by-line basis.</p>
