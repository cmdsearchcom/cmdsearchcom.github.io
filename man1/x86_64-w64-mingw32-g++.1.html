<p>GCC(1) GNU GCC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gcc [-c|-S|-E] [-std=standard] <br>
[-g] [-pg] [-Olevel] <br>
[-Wwarn...] [-Wpedantic] <br>
[-Idir...] [-Ldir...] <br>
[-Dmacro[=defn]...] [-Umacro] <br>
[-foption...] [-mmachine-option...] <br>
[-o outfile] [@file] infile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the most useful options are
listed here; see below for the remainder. g++ accepts mostly
the same options as gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing,
compilation, assembly and linking. The &quot;overall
options&quot; allow you to stop this process at an
intermediate stage. For <br>
example, the -c option says not to run the linker. Then the
output consists of object files output by the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options are passed on to
one or more stages of processing. Some options control the
preprocessor and others the compiler itself. Yet other
options control the assembler <br>
and linker; most of these are not documented here, since you
rarely need to use any of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the command-line options
that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an
option is only useful with another language (usually C++),
the explanation says so <br>
explicitly. If the description for a particular option does
not mention a source language, you can use that option with
all supported languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual way to run GCC is to
run the executable called gcc, or machine-gcc when
cross-compiling, or machine-gcc-version to run a specific
version of GCC. When you compile C++ <br>
programs, you should invoke GCC as g++ instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gcc program accepts options
and file names as operands. Many options have multi-letter
names; therefore multiple single-letter options may not be
grouped: -dv is very <br>
different from -d -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can mix options and other
arguments. For the most part, the order you use
doesn&rsquo;t matter. Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if <br>
you specify -L more than once, the directories are searched
in the order specified. Also, the placement of the -l option
is significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many options have long names
starting with -f or with -W---for example,
-fmove-loop-invariants, -Wformat and so on. Most of these
have both positive and negative forms; the <br>
negative form of -ffoo is -fno-foo. This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling the Kind of
Output <br>
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing,
compilation proper, assembly and linking, always in that
order. GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several
<br>
files either into several assembler input files, or into one
assembler input file; then each assembler input file
produces an object file, and linking combines all the object
<br>
files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For any given input file, the
file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is

BRIG files (binary representation of HSAIL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.ads <br>
Ada source code file that contains a library unit
declaration (a declaration of a package, subprogram, or
generic, or a generic instantiation), or a library unit
renaming <br>
declaration (a package, generic, or subprogram renaming
declaration). Such files are also called specs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other <br>
An object file to be fed straight into linking. Any file
name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify the input
language explicitly with the -x option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x language <br>
Specify explicitly the language for the following input
files (rather than letting the compiler choose a default
based on the file name suffix). This option applies to all
<br>
following input files until the next -x option. Possible
values for language are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c c-header cpp-output <br>
c++ c++-header c++-cpp-output <br>
objective-c objective-c-header objective-c-cpp-output <br>

ada <br>
f77 f77-cpp-input f95 f95-cpp-input <br>
go <br>
brig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x none <br>
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent
files are handled according to their file name suffixes (as
they are if -x has not been used at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only want some of the
stages of compilation, you can use -x (or filename suffixes)
to tell gcc where to start, and one of the options -c, -S,
or -E to say where gcc is to <br>
stop. Note that some combinations (for example, -x
cpp-output -E) instruct gcc to do nothing at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Compile or assemble the
source files, but do not link. The linking stage simply is
not done. The ultimate output is in the form of an object
file for each source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the object file name
for a source file is made by replacing the suffix .c, .i,
.s, etc., with .o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized input files, not
requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Stop after the stage of
compilation proper; do not assemble. The output is in the
form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the assembler file
name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix .c,
.i, etc., with .s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input files that don&rsquo;t
require compilation are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Stop after the preprocessing
stage; do not run the compiler proper. The output is in the
form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input files that don&rsquo;t
require preprocessing are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Place output in file file. This applies to whatever sort of
output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C <br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -o is not specified, the
default is to put an executable file in a.out, the object
file for source.suffix in source.o, its assembler file in
source.s, a precompiled header <br>
file in source.suffix.gch, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print (on standard error
output) the commands executed to run the stages of
compilation. Also print the version number of the compiler
driver program and of the preprocessor <br>
and the compiler proper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-### <br>
Like -v except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters
or &quot;./-_&quot;. This is useful for shell scripts to
capture <br>
the driver-generated command lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
Print (on the standard output) a description of the
command-line options understood by gcc. If the -v option is
also specified then --help is also passed on to the various
<br>
processes invoked by gcc, so that they can display the
command-line options they accept. If the -Wextra option has
also been specified (prior to the --help option), then <br>
command-line options that have no documentation associated
with them are also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--target-help <br>
Print (on the standard output) a description of
target-specific command-line options for each tool. For some
targets extra target-specific information may also be
printed.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...]
<br>
Print (on the standard output) a description of the
command-line options understood by the compiler that fit
into all specified classes and qualifiers. These are the
<br>
supported classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimizers <br>
Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warnings <br>
Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target <br>
Display target-specific options. Unlike the --target-help
option however, target-specific options of the linker and
assembler are not displayed. This is because those <br>
tools do not currently support the extended --help=
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">params <br>
Display the values recognized by the --param option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">language <br>
Display the options supported for language, where language
is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common <br>
Display the options that are common to all languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the supported
qualifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undocumented <br>
Display only those options that are undocumented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">joined <br>
Display options taking an argument that appears after an
equal sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
--help=target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separate <br>
Display options taking an argument that appears as a
separate word following the original option, such as: -o
output-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus for example to display all
the undocumented target-specific switches supported by the
compiler, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help=target,undocumented</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sense of a qualifier can be
inverted by prefixing it with the ^ character, so for
example to display all binary warning options (i.e., ones
that are either on or off and <br>
that do not take an argument) that have a description,
use:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument to --help= should
not consist solely of inverted qualifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combining several classes is
possible, although this usually restricts the output so much
that there is nothing to display. One case where it does
work, however, is when one <br>
of the classes is target. For example, to display all the
target-specific optimization options, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help=target,optimizers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --help= option can be
repeated on the command line. Each successive use displays
its requested class of options, skipping those that have
already been displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -Q option appears on the
command line before the --help= option, then the descriptive
text displayed by --help= is changed. Instead of describing
the displayed <br>
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is
enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that
the compiler knows this at the point where the --help= <br>
option is used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a truncated example from
the ARM port of gcc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target
-c <br>
The following options are target specific: <br>
-mabi= 2 <br>
-mabort-on-noreturn [disabled] <br>
-mapcs [disabled]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output is sensitive to the
effects of previous command-line options, so for example it
is possible to find out which optimizations are enabled at
-O2 by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q -O2 --help=optimizers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively you can discover
which binary optimizations are enabled by -O3 by using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers
&gt; /tmp/O3-opts <br>
gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts <br>
diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pass-exit-codes <br>
Normally the gcc program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code. If
you specify -pass-exit-codes, the gcc program instead <br>
returns with the numerically highest error produced by any
phase returning an error indication. The C, C++, and Fortran
front ends return 4 if an internal compiler error is <br>
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pipe <br>
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
between the various stages of compilation. This fails to
work on some systems where the assembler is unable to read
<br>
from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has no trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-specs=file <br>
Process file after the compiler reads in the standard specs
file, in order to override the defaults which the gcc driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass <br>
to cc1, cc1plus, as, ld, etc. More than one -specs=file can
be specified on the command line, and they are processed in
order, from left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wrapper <br>
Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program. The name of
the wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma
separated list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c t.c -wrapper
gdb,--args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This invokes all subprograms of
gcc under gdb --args, thus the invocation of cc1 is gdb
--args cc1 ....</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fplugin=name.so <br>
Load the plugin code in file name.so, assumed to be a shared
object to be dlopen&rsquo;d by the compiler. The base name
of the shared object file is used to identify the plugin
<br>
for the purposes of argument parsing (See
-fplugin-arg-name-key=value below). Each plugin should
define the callback functions specified in the Plugins
API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fplugin-arg-name-key=value <br>
Define an argument called key with a value of value for the
plugin called name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-ada-spec[-slim] <br>
For C and C++ source and include files, generate
corresponding Ada specs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fada-spec-parent=unit <br>
In conjunction with -fdump-ada-spec[-slim] above, generate
Ada specs as child units of parent unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-go-spec=file <br>
For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in file. This generates Go &quot;const&quot;,
&quot;type&quot;, &quot;var&quot;, and &quot;func&quot;
declarations which may be a useful way <br>
to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compiling C++ Programs <br>
C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes .C,
.cc, .cpp, .CPP, .c++, .cp, or .cxx; C++ header files often
use .hh, .hpp, .H, or (for shared template code) .tcc; and
<br>
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix .ii. GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs
even if you call the compiler the same way as for compiling
C <br>
programs (usually with the name gcc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, the use of gcc does not
add the C++ library. g++ is a program that calls GCC and
automatically specifies linking against the C++ library. It
treats .c, .h and .i files <br>
as C++ source files instead of C source files unless -x is
used. This program is also useful when precompiling a C
header file with a .h extension for use in C++ compilations.
<br>
On many systems, g++ is also installed with the name
c++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you compile C++ programs,
you may specify many of the same command-line options that
you use for compiling programs in any language; or
command-line options meaningful for C <br>
and related languages; or options that are meaningful only
for C++ programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling C Dialect
<br>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages
derived from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++)
that the compiler accepts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ansi <br>
In C mode, this is equivalent to -std=c90. In C++ mode, it
is equivalent to -std=c++98.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This turns off certain features
of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C
code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as
the &quot;asm&quot; and <br>
&quot;typeof&quot; keywords, and predefined macros such as
&quot;unix&quot; and &quot;vax&quot; that identify the type
of system you are using. It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO <br>
trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables
recognition of C++ style // comments as well as the
&quot;inline&quot; keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alternate keywords
&quot;__asm__&quot;, &quot;__extension__&quot;,
&quot;__inline__&quot; and &quot;__typeof__&quot; continue
to work despite -ansi. You would not want to use them in an
ISO C program, of <br>
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that
might be included in compilations done with -ansi. Alternate
predefined macros such as &quot;__unix__&quot; and
&quot;__vax__&quot; are <br>
also available, with or without -ansi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -ansi option does not cause
non-ISO programs to be rejected gratuitously. For that,
-Wpedantic is required in addition to -ansi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macro
&quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot; is predefined when the -ansi
option is used. Some header files may notice this macro and
refrain from declaring certain functions or defining <br>
certain macros that the ISO standard doesn&rsquo;t call for;
this is to avoid interfering with any programs that might
use these names for other things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions that are normally
built in but do not have semantics defined by ISO C (such as
&quot;alloca&quot; and &quot;ffs&quot;) are not built-in

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-std= <br>
Determine the language standard. This option is currently
only supported when compiling C or C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler can accept several
base standards, such as c90 or c++98, and GNU dialects of
those standards, such as gnu90 or gnu++98. When a base
standard is specified, the <br>
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus
those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it. For
example, -std=c90 turns off certain features of GCC that
<br>
are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the &quot;asm&quot;
and &quot;typeof&quot; keywords, but not other GNU
extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as
omitting the middle term <br>
of a &quot;?:&quot; expression. On the other hand, when a
GNU dialect of a standard is specified, all features
supported by the compiler are enabled, even when those
features change <br>
the meaning of the base standard. As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected. The particular
standard is used by -Wpedantic to identify which features
are <br>
GNU extensions given that version of the standard. For
example -std=gnu90 -Wpedantic warns about C++ style //
comments, while -std=gnu99 -Wpedantic does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnu89-inline <br>
The option -fgnu89-inline tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for &quot;inline&quot; functions when in C99
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option is roughly
equivalent to adding the &quot;gnu_inline&quot; function
attribute to all inline functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -fno-gnu89-inline
explicitly tells GCC to use the C99 semantics for
&quot;inline&quot; when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior). This option is <br>
not supported in -std=c90 or -std=gnu90 mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=style
<br>
ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 defines new permissible values for
&quot;FLT_EVAL_METHOD&quot; that indicate that operations
and constants with a semantic type that is an interchange or
extended <br>
format should be evaluated to the precision and range of
that type. These new values are a superset of those
permitted under C99/C11, which does not specify the meaning
of <br>
other positive values of &quot;FLT_EVAL_METHOD&quot;. As
such, code conforming to C11 may not have been written
expecting the possibility of the new values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aux-info filename <br>
Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all
functions declared and/or defined in a translation unit,
including those in header files. This option is <br>
silently ignored in any language other than C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides declarations, the file
indicates, in comments, the origin of each declaration
(source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped <br>
(I, N for new or O for old, respectively, in the first
character after the line number and the colon), and whether
it came from a declaration or a definition (C or F, <br>
respectively, in the following character). In the case of
function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of arguments
followed by their declarations is also provided, inside <br>
comments, after the declaration.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions
<br>
Accept variadic functions without named parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although it is possible to
define such a function, this is not very useful as it is not
possible to read the arguments. This is only supported for C
as this construct is <br>
allowed by C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-asm <br>
Do not recognize &quot;asm&quot;, &quot;inline&quot; or
&quot;typeof&quot; as a keyword, so that code can use these
words as identifiers. You can use the keywords
&quot;__asm__&quot;, &quot;__inline__&quot; and
&quot;__typeof__&quot; <br>
instead. -ansi implies -fno-asm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C++, this switch only affects
the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword, since &quot;asm&quot; and
&quot;inline&quot; are standard keywords. You may want to
use the -fno-gnu-keywords flag instead, which has the <br>
same effect. In C99 mode (-std=c99 or -std=gnu99), this
switch only affects the &quot;asm&quot; and
&quot;typeof&quot; keywords, since &quot;inline&quot; is a
standard keyword in ISO C99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-builtin <br>
-fno-builtin-function <br>
Don&rsquo;t recognize built-in functions that do not begin
with __builtin_ as prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC normally generates special
code to handle certain built-in functions more efficiently;
for instance, calls to &quot;alloca&quot; may become single
instructions which adjust the <br>
stack directly, and calls to &quot;memcpy&quot; may become
inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as
<br>
such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can
you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a
different library. In addition, when a function is <br>
recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information
about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if
<br>
the resulting code still contains calls to that function.
For example, warnings are given with -Wformat for bad calls
to &quot;printf&quot; when &quot;printf&quot; is built in
and &quot;strlen&quot; is <br>
known not to modify global memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the -fno-builtin-function
option only the built-in function function is disabled.
function must not begin with __builtin_. If a function is
named that is not built-in <br>
in this version of GCC, this option is ignored. There is no
corresponding -fbuiltin-function option; if you wish to
enable built-in functions selectively when using <br>
-fno-builtin or -ffreestanding, you may define macros such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define abs(n) __builtin_abs
((n)) <br>
#define strcpy(d, s) __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgimple <br>
Enable parsing of function definitions marked with
&quot;__GIMPLE&quot;. This is an experimental feature that
allows unit testing of GIMPLE passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fhosted <br>
Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment. This
implies -fbuiltin. A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <br>
&quot;main&quot; has a return type of &quot;int&quot;.
Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. This is
equivalent to -fno-freestanding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffreestanding <br>
Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.
This implies -fno-builtin. A freestanding environment is one
in which the standard library may not exist, and <br>
program startup may not necessarily be at &quot;main&quot;.
The most obvious example is an OS kernel. This is equivalent
to -fno-hosted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopenacc <br>
Enable handling of OpenACC directives &quot;#pragma
acc&quot; in C/C++ and &quot;!$acc&quot; in Fortran. When
-fopenacc is specified, the compiler generates accelerated
code according to the <br>
OpenACC Application Programming Interface v2.0
&lt;http://www.openacc.org/&gt;. This option implies
-pthread, and thus is only supported on targets that have
support for -pthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopenacc-dim=geom <br>
Specify default compute dimensions for parallel offload
regions that do not explicitly specify. The geom value is a
triple of &rsquo;:&rsquo;-separated sizes, in order
&rsquo;gang&rsquo;, &rsquo;worker&rsquo; <br>
and, &rsquo;vector&rsquo;. A size can be omitted, to use a
target-specific default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopenmp <br>
Enable handling of OpenMP directives &quot;#pragma omp&quot;
in C/C++ and &quot;!$omp&quot; in Fortran. When -fopenmp is
specified, the compiler generates parallel code according to
the OpenMP <br>
Application Program Interface v4.5
&lt;http://www.openmp.org/&gt;. This option implies
-pthread, and thus is only supported on targets that have
support for -pthread. -fopenmp <br>
implies -fopenmp-simd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopenmp-simd <br>
Enable handling of OpenMP&rsquo;s SIMD directives with
&quot;#pragma omp&quot; in C/C++ and &quot;!$omp&quot; in
Fortran. Other OpenMP directives are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcilkplus <br>
Enable the usage of Cilk Plus language extension features
for C/C++. When the option -fcilkplus is specified, enable
the usage of the Cilk Plus Language extension features <br>
for C/C++. The present implementation follows ABI version
1.2. This is an experimental feature that is only partially
complete, and whose interface may change in future <br>
versions of GCC as the official specification changes.
Currently, all features but &quot;_Cilk_for&quot; have been
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnu-tm <br>
When the option -fgnu-tm is specified, the compiler
generates code for the Linux variant of Intel&rsquo;s
current Transactional Memory ABI specification document
(Revision 1.1, May <br>
6 2009). This is an experimental feature whose interface may
change in future versions of GCC, as the official
specification changes. Please note that not all
architectures <br>
are supported for this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on
GCC&rsquo;s support for transactional memory,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the transactional
memory feature is not supported with non-call exceptions
(-fnon-call-exceptions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fms-extensions <br>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C++ code, this allows member
names in structures to be similar to previous types
declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef int UOW; <br>
struct ABC { <br>
UOW UOW; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some cases of unnamed fields in
structures and unions are only accepted with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option is off for
all targets but x86 targets using ms-abi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fplan9-extensions <br>
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This enables -fms-extensions,
permits passing pointers to structures with anonymous fields
to functions that expect pointers to elements of the type of
the field, and permits <br>
referring to anonymous fields declared using a typedef. This
is only supported for C, not C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcond-mismatch <br>
Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the
second and third arguments. The value of such an expression
is void. This option is not supported for C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flax-vector-conversions <br>
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing
numbers of elements and/or incompatible element types. This
option should not be used for new code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funsigned-char <br>
Let the type &quot;char&quot; be unsigned, like
&quot;unsigned char&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each kind of machine has a
default for what &quot;char&quot; should be. It is either
like &quot;unsigned char&quot; by default or like
&quot;signed char&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ideally, a portable program
should always use &quot;signed char&quot; or &quot;unsigned
char&quot; when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use <br>
plain &quot;char&quot; and expect it to be signed, or expect
it to be unsigned, depending on the machines they were
written for. This option, and its inverse, let you make such
a <br>
program work with the opposite default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type &quot;char&quot; is
always a distinct type from each of &quot;signed char&quot;
or &quot;unsigned char&quot;, even though its behavior is
always just like one of those two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsigned-char <br>
Let the type &quot;char&quot; be signed, like &quot;signed
char&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this is equivalent to
-fno-unsigned-char, which is the negative form of
-funsigned-char. Likewise, the option -fno-signed-char is
equivalent to -funsigned-char.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsigned-bitfields <br>
-funsigned-bitfields <br>
-fno-signed-bitfields <br>
-fno-unsigned-bitfields <br>
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or
unsigned, when the declaration does not use either
&quot;signed&quot; or &quot;unsigned&quot;. By default, such
a bit-field is signed, <br>
because this is consistent: the basic integer types such as
&quot;int&quot; are signed types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsso-struct=endianness <br>
Set the default scalar storage order of structures and
unions to the specified endianness. The accepted values are
big-endian, little-endian and native for the native <br>
endianness of the target (the default). This option is not
supported for C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fsso-struct switch
causes GCC to generate code that is not binary compatible
with code generated without it if the specified endianness
is not the native <br>
endianness of the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling C++ Dialect
<br>
This section describes the command-line options that are
only meaningful for C++ programs. You can also use most of
the GNU compiler options regardless of what language your
<br>
program is in. For example, you might compile a file
firstClass.C like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c
firstClass.C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, only
-fstrict-enums is an option meant only for C++ programs; you
can use the other options with any language supported by
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options for compiling C
programs, such as -std, are also relevant for C++
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of options that
are only for compiling C++ programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fabi-version=n <br>
Use version n of the C++ ABI. The default is version 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 0 refers to the version
conforming most closely to the C++ ABI specification.
Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change in
different versions of G++ as <br>
ABI bugs are fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 1 is the version of the
C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 2 is the version of the
C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4, and was the default
through G++ 4.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 3 corrects an error in
mangling a constant address as a template argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 4, which first appeared
in G++ 4.5, implements a standard mangling for vector
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 5, which first appeared
in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of attribute
const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function <br>
parameter in the declaration of another parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 6, which first appeared
in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion behavior of C++11 scoped
enums and the mangling of template argument packs,
const/static_cast, prefix ++ <br>
and --, and a class scope function used as a template
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 7, which first appeared
in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a builtin type and
corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 8, which first appeared
in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution behavior of function
types with function-cv-qualifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 9, which first appeared
in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
&quot;nullptr_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 10, which first appeared
in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of attributes that affect type
identity, such as ia32 calling convention attributes (e.g.
stdcall).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 11, which first appeared
in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of sizeof... expressions and
operator names. For multiple entities with the same name
within a function, <br>
that are declared in different scopes, the mangling now
changes starting with the twelfth occurrence. It also
implies -fnew-inheriting-ctors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also -Wabi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fabi-compat-version=n <br>
On targets that support strong aliases, G++ works around
mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect
mangled <br>
name. This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the
alias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fabi-version=0 (the
default), this defaults to 8 (GCC 5 compatibility). If
another ABI version is explicitly selected, this defaults to
0. For compatibility with GCC <br>
versions 3.2 through 4.9, use -fabi-compat-version=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not provided
but -Wabi=n is, that version is used for compatibility
aliases. If this option is provided along with -Wabi
(without the version), the version <br>
from this option is used for the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-access-control <br>
Turn off all access checking. This switch is mainly useful
for working around bugs in the access control code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-faligned-new <br>
Enable support for C++17 &quot;new&quot; of types that
require more alignment than &quot;void* ::operator
new(std::size_t)&quot; provides. A numeric argument such as
&quot;-faligned-new=32&quot; can be <br>
used to specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by
that function, but few users will need to override the
default of &quot;alignof(std::max_align_t)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcheck-new <br>
Check that the pointer returned by &quot;operator new&quot;
is non-null before attempting to modify the storage
allocated. This check is normally unnecessary because the
C++ standard <br>
specifies that &quot;operator new&quot; only returns 0 if it
is declared &quot;throw()&quot;, in which case the compiler
always checks the return value even without this option. In
all other <br>
cases, when &quot;operator new&quot; has a non-empty
exception specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by
throwing &quot;std::bad_alloc&quot;. See also new
(nothrow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconcepts <br>
Enable support for the C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical
Specification, ISO 19217 (2015), which allows code like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">template &lt;class T&gt; concept
bool Addable = requires (T t) { t + t; }; <br>
template &lt;Addable T&gt; T add (T a, T b) { return a + b;
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconstexpr-depth=n <br>
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr
functions to n. A limit is needed to detect endless
recursion during constant expression evaluation. The minimum
<br>
specified by the standard is 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconstexpr-loop-limit=n <br>
Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14
constexpr functions to n. A limit is needed to detect
infinite loops during constant expression evaluation. The
<br>
default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdeduce-init-list <br>
Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
&quot;std::initializer_list&quot; from a brace-enclosed
initializer list, i.e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">template &lt;class T&gt; auto
forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t)) <br>
{ <br>
return realfn (t); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void f() <br>
{ <br>
forward({1,2}); // call
forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This deduction was implemented
as a possible extension to the originally proposed semantics
for the C++11 standard, but was not part of the final
standard, so it is disabled <br>
by default. This option is deprecated, and may be removed in
a future version of G++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffriend-injection <br>
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so
that they are visible outside the scope of the class in
which they are declared. Friend functions were documented to
<br>
work this way in the old Annotated C++ Reference Manual.
However, in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument <br>
dependent lookup. GCC defaults to the standard behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is for
compatibility, and may be removed in a future release of
G++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-elide-constructors <br>
The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a
temporary that is only used to initialize another object of
the same type. Specifying this option disables that <br>
optimization, and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in
all cases. This option also causes G++ to call trivial
member functions which otherwise would be expanded <br>
inline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C++17, the compiler is
required to omit these temporaries, but this option still
affects trivial member functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-enforce-eh-specs <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate code to check for violation of
exception specifications at run time. This option violates
the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code size
in <br>
production builds, much like defining &quot;NDEBUG&quot;.
This does not give user code permission to throw exceptions
in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still <br>
optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fextern-tls-init <br>
-fno-extern-tls-init <br>
The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow
&quot;thread_local&quot; and &quot;threadprivate&quot;
variables to have dynamic (runtime) initialization. To
support this, any use of such a variable goes <br>
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary
initialization. When the use and definition of the variable
are in the same translation unit, this overhead can be <br>
optimized away, but when the use is in a different
translation unit there is significant overhead even if the
variable doesn&rsquo;t actually need dynamic initialization.
If the <br>
programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization
(either because the variable is statically initialized, or a
<br>
use of the variable in the defining TU will be executed
before any uses in another TU), they can avoid this overhead
with the -fno-extern-tls-init option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On targets that support symbol
aliases, the default is -fextern-tls-init. On targets that
do not support symbol aliases, the default is
-fno-extern-tls-init.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffor-scope <br>
-fno-for-scope <br>
If -ffor-scope is specified, the scope of variables declared
in a for-init-statement is limited to the &quot;for&quot;
loop itself, as specified by the C++ standard. If
-fno-for-scope <br>
is specified, the scope of variables declared in a
for-init-statement extends to the end of the enclosing
scope, as was the case in old versions of G++, and other
<br>
(traditional) implementations of C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither flag is given, the
default is to follow the standard, but to allow and give a
warning for old-style code that would otherwise be invalid,
or have different <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-gnu-keywords <br>
Do not recognize &quot;typeof&quot; as a keyword, so that
code can use this word as an identifier. You can use the
keyword &quot;__typeof__&quot; instead. This option is
implied by the strict <br>
ISO C++ dialects: -ansi, -std=c++98, -std=c++11, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-implicit-templates <br>
Never emit code for non-inline templates that are
instantiated implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for
explicit instantiations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-implicit-inline-templates
<br>
Don&rsquo;t emit code for implicit instantiations of inline
templates, either. The default is to handle inlines
differently so that compiles with and without optimization
need the <br>
same set of explicit instantiations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-implement-inlines <br>
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline
functions controlled by &quot;#pragma implementation&quot;.
This causes linker errors if these functions are not inlined
<br>
everywhere they are called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fms-extensions <br>
Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC,
such as implicit int and getting a pointer to member
function via non-standard syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnew-inheriting-ctors <br>
Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11
constructor inheritance. This is part of C++17 but also
considered to be a Defect Report against C++11 and C++14.
This <br>
flag is enabled by default unless -fabi-version=10 or lower
is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnew-ttp-matching <br>
Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template
template parameters and default arguments: this allows a
template with default template arguments as an argument for
a <br>
template template parameter with fewer template parameters.
This flag is enabled by default for -std=c++1z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-nonansi-builtins <br>
Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not
mandated by ANSI/ISO C. These include &quot;ffs&quot;,
&quot;alloca&quot;, &quot;_exit&quot;, &quot;index&quot;,
&quot;bzero&quot;, &quot;conjf&quot;, and other related <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnothrow-opt <br>
Treat a &quot;throw()&quot; exception specification as if it
were a &quot;noexcept&quot; specification to reduce or
eliminate the text size overhead relative to a function with
no exception <br>
specification. If the function has local variables of types
with non-trivial destructors, the exception specification
actually makes the function smaller because the EH <br>
cleanups for those variables can be optimized away. The
semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of a
function with such an exception specification results in a
call <br>
to &quot;terminate&quot; rather than
&quot;unexpected&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-operator-names <br>
Do not treat the operator name keywords &quot;and&quot;,
&quot;bitand&quot;, &quot;bitor&quot;, &quot;compl&quot;,
&quot;not&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and &quot;xor&quot; as
synonyms as keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-optional-diags <br>
Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does
not need to issue. Currently, the only such diagnostic
issued by G++ is the one for a name having multiple <br>
meanings within a class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpermissive <br>
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from
errors to warnings. Thus, using -fpermissive allows some
nonconforming code to compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-pretty-templates <br>
When an error message refers to a specialization of a
function template, the compiler normally prints the
signature of the template followed by the template arguments
and any <br>
typedefs or typenames in the signature (e.g. &quot;void f(T)
[with T = int]&quot; rather than &quot;void f(int)&quot;) so
that it&rsquo;s clear which template is involved. When an
error message <br>
refers to a specialization of a class template, the compiler
omits any template arguments that match the default template
arguments for that template. If either of these <br>
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message
rather than easier, you can use -fno-pretty-templates to
disable them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frepo <br>
Enable automatic template instantiation at link time. This
option also implies -fno-implicit-templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-rtti <br>
Disable generation of information about every class with
virtual functions for use by the C++ run-time type
identification features (&quot;dynamic_cast&quot; and
&quot;typeid&quot;). If you <br>
don&rsquo;t use those parts of the language, you can save
some space by using this flag. Note that exception handling
uses the same information, but G++ generates it as needed.
<br>
The &quot;dynamic_cast&quot; operator can still be used for
casts that do not require run-time type information, i.e.
casts to &quot;void *&quot; or to unambiguous base
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsized-deallocation <br>
Enable the built-in global declarations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void operator delete (void *,
std::size_t) noexcept; <br>
void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as introduced in C++14. This is
useful for user-defined replacement deallocation functions
that, for example, use the size of the object to make
deallocation faster. <br>
Enabled by default under -std=c++14 and above. The flag
-Wsized-deallocation warns about places that might want to
add a definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-enums <br>
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a
value of enumerated type can only be one of the values of
the enumeration (as defined in the C++ standard; <br>
basically, a value that can be represented in the minimum
number of bits needed to represent all the enumerators).
This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a <br>
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrong-eval-order <br>
Evaluate member access, array subscripting, and shift
expressions in left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment
in right-to-left order, as adopted for C++17. Enabled by
<br>
default with -std=c++1z. -fstrong-eval-order=some enables
just the ordering of member access and shift expressions,
and is the default without -std=c++1z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=n
<br>
Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a
single warning or error to n. The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftemplate-depth=n <br>
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to
n. A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to
detect endless recursions during template class <br>
instantiation. ANSI/ISO C++ conforming programs must not
rely on a maximum depth greater than 17 (changed to 1024 in
C++11). The default value is 900, as the compiler can <br>
run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some
situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-threadsafe-statics <br>
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in
the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.
You can use this option to reduce code size slightly <br>
in code that doesn&rsquo;t need to be thread-safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-cxa-atexit <br>
Register destructors for objects with static storage
duration with the &quot;__cxa_atexit&quot; function rather
than the &quot;atexit&quot; function. This option is
required for fully <br>
standards-compliant handling of static destructors, but only
works if your C library supports
&quot;__cxa_atexit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr
<br>
Don&rsquo;t use the &quot;__cxa_get_exception_ptr&quot;
runtime routine. This causes
&quot;std::uncaught_exception&quot; to be incorrect, but is
necessary if the runtime routine is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvisibility-inlines-hidden <br>
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to
compare pointers to inline functions or methods where the
addresses of the two functions are taken in different shared
<br>
objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of this is that GCC
may, effectively, mark inline methods with
&quot;__attribute__ ((visibility
(&quot;hidden&quot;)))&quot; so that they do not appear in
the export table of a DSO <br>
and do not require a PLT indirection when used within the
DSO. Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect on load
and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the <br>
size of the dynamic export table when the library makes
heavy use of templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The behavior of this switch is
not quite the same as marking the methods as hidden
directly, because it does not affect static variables local
to the function or cause the <br>
compiler to deduce that the function is defined in only one
shared object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may mark a method as having
a visibility explicitly to negate the effect of the switch
for that method. For example, if you do want to compare
pointers to a particular <br>
inline method, you might mark it as having default
visibility. Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explicitly instantiated inline
methods are unaffected by this option as their linkage might
otherwise cross a shared library boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvisibility-ms-compat <br>
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make
GCC&rsquo;s C++ linkage model compatible with that of
Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag makes these changes to
GCC&rsquo;s linkage model:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. It sets the default
visibility to &quot;hidden&quot;, like
-fvisibility=hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Types, but not their members,
are not hidden by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The One Definition Rule is
relaxed for types without explicit visibility specifications
that are defined in more than one shared object: those
declarations are permitted <br>
if they are permitted when this option is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In new code it is better to use
-fvisibility=hidden and export those classes that are
intended to be externally visible. Unfortunately it is
possible for code to rely, <br>
perhaps accidentally, on the Visual Studio behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Among the consequences of these
changes are that static data members of the same type with
the same name but defined in different shared objects are
different, so changing <br>
one does not change the other; and that pointers to function
members defined in different shared objects may not compare
equal. When this flag is given, it is a violation of <br>
the ODR to define types with the same name differently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-weak <br>
Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by
the linker. By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are
available. This option exists only for testing, and <br>
should not be used by end-users; it results in inferior code
and has no benefits. This option may be removed in a future
release of G++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc++ <br>
Do not search for header files in the standard directories
specific to C++, but do still search the other standard
directories. (This option is used when building the C++ <br>
library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, these optimization,
warning, and code generation options have meanings only for
C++ programs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wabi (C, Objective-C, C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when G++ it generates code that is probably not
compatible with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI. Since G++ now
defaults to updating the ABI with each major release,
normally <br>
-Wabi will warn only if there is a check added later in a
release series for an ABI issue discovered since the initial
release. -Wabi will warn about more things if an older <br>
ABI version is selected (with -fabi-version=n).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wabi can also be used with an
explicit version number to warn about compatibility with a
particular -fabi-version level, e.g. -Wabi=2 to warn about
changes relative to <br>
-fabi-version=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an explicit version number is
provided and -fabi-compat-version is not specified, the
version number from this option is used for compatibility
aliases. If no explicit <br>
version number is provided with this option, but
-fabi-compat-version is specified, that version number is
used for ABI warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although an effort has been made
to warn about all such cases, there are probably some cases
that are not warned about, even though G++ is generating
incompatible code. <br>
There may also be cases where warnings are emitted even
though the code that is generated is compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should rewrite your code to
avoid these warnings if you are concerned about the fact
that code generated by G++ may not be binary compatible with
code generated by other <br>
compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known incompatibilities in
-fabi-version=2 (which was the default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9)
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A template with a non-type
template parameter of reference type was mangled
incorrectly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern int N; <br>
template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {}; <br>
void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was fixed in
-fabi-version=3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* SIMD vector types declared
using &quot;__attribute ((vector_size))&quot; were mangled
in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of <br>
different sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mangling was changed in
-fabi-version=4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &quot;__attribute
((const))&quot; and &quot;noreturn&quot; were mangled as
type qualifiers, and &quot;decltype&quot; of a plain
declaration was folded away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These mangling issues were fixed
in -fabi-version=5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Scoped enumerators passed as
arguments to a variadic function are promoted like unscoped
enumerators, causing &quot;va_arg&quot; to complain. On most
targets this does not <br>
actually affect the parameter passing ABI, as there is no
way to pass an argument smaller than &quot;int&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the ABI changed the
mangling of template argument packs, &quot;const_cast&quot;,
&quot;static_cast&quot;, prefix increment/decrement, and a
class scope function used as a template <br>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These issues were corrected in
-fabi-version=6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Lambdas in default argument
scope were mangled incorrectly, and the ABI changed the
mangling of &quot;nullptr_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These issues were corrected in
-fabi-version=7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* When mangling a function type
with function-cv-qualifiers, the un-qualified function type
was incorrectly treated as a substitution candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was fixed in
-fabi-version=8, the default for GCC 5.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &quot;decltype(nullptr)&quot;
incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to unaligned
accesses. Note that this did not affect the ABI of a
function with a &quot;nullptr_t&quot; parameter, <br>
as parameters have a minimum alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was fixed in
-fabi-version=9, the default for GCC 5.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Target-specific attributes
that affect the identity of a type, such as ia32 calling
conventions on a function type (stdcall, regparm, etc.), did
not affect the mangled <br>
name, leading to name collisions when function pointers were
used as template arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This was fixed in
-fabi-version=10, the default for GCC 6.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also warns about
psABI-related changes. The known psABI changes at this point
include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For SysV/x86-64, unions with
&quot;long double&quot; members are passed in memory as
specified in psABI. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">union U { <br>
long double ld; <br>
int i; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;union U&quot; is always
passed in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wabi-tag (C++ and Objective-C++
only) <br>
Warn when a type with an ABI tag is used in a context that
does not have that ABI tag. See C++ Attributes for more
information about ABI tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wctor-dtor-privacy (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the
constructors or destructors in that class are private, and
it has neither friends nor public static member functions.
Also <br>
warn if there are no non-private methods, and there&rsquo;s
at least one private member function that isn&rsquo;t a
constructor or destructor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor (C++
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when &quot;delete&quot; is used to destroy an instance
of a class that has virtual functions and non-virtual
destructor. It is unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class <br>
through a pointer to a base class if the base class does not
have a virtual destructor. This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wliteral-suffix (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a
ud-suffix which does not begin with an underscore. As a
conforming extension, GCC treats such suffixes as separate
<br>
preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from
&quot;&lt;inttypes.h&gt;&quot;. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
<br>
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt; <br>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int main() { <br>
int64_t i64 = 123; <br>
printf(&quot;My int64: %&quot; PRId64&quot;0, i64); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, &quot;PRId64&quot;
is treated as a separate preprocessing token.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, warn when a
user-defined literal operator is declared with a literal
suffix identifier that doesn&rsquo;t begin with an
underscore. Literal suffix identifiers that <br>
don&rsquo;t begin with an underscore are reserved for future
standardization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlto-type-mismatch <br>
During the link-time optimization warn about type mismatches
in global declarations from different compilation units.
Requires -flto to be enabled. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-narrowing (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
For C++11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are
diagnosed by default, as required by the standard. A
narrowing conversion from a constant produces an error, and
a <br>
narrowing conversion from a non-constant produces a warning,
but -Wno-narrowing suppresses the diagnostic. Note that this
does not affect the meaning of well-formed code; <br>
narrowing conversions are still considered ill-formed in
SFINAE contexts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -Wnarrowing in C++98, warn
when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs
within { }, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int i = { 2.2 }; // error:
narrowing from double to int</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is included in -Wall
and -Wc++11-compat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnoexcept (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because
of a call to a function that does not have a non-throwing
exception specification (i.e. &quot;throw()&quot; or
&quot;noexcept&quot;) <br>
but is known by the compiler to never throw an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnoexcept (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if the C++1z feature making &quot;noexcept&quot; part
of a function type changes the mangled name of a symbol
relative to C++14. Enabled by -Wabi and -Wc++1z-compat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">template &lt;class T&gt; void
f(T t) { t(); }; <br>
void g() noexcept; <br>
void h() { f(g); } // in C++14 calls f&lt;void(*)()&gt;, in
C++1z calls f&lt;void(*)()noexcept&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnon-virtual-dtor (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible
non-virtual destructor itself or in an accessible
polymorphic base class, in which case it is possible but
unsafe to <br>
delete an instance of a derived class through a pointer to
the class itself or base class. This warning is
automatically enabled if -Weffc++ is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wregister (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn on uses of the &quot;register&quot; storage class
specifier, except when it is part of the GNU Explicit
Register Variables extension. The use of the
&quot;register&quot; keyword as storage <br>
class specifier has been deprecated in C++11 and removed in
C++17. Enabled by default with -std=c++1z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wreorder (C++ and Objective-C++
only) <br>
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code
does not match the order in which they must be executed. For
instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A { <br>
int i; <br>
int j; <br>
A(): j (0), i (1) { } <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler rearranges the
member initializers for &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; to
match the declaration order of the members, emitting a
warning to that effect. This warning is enabled by <br>
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fext-numeric-literals (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Accept imaginary, fixed-point, or machine-defined literal
number suffixes as GNU extensions. When this option is
turned off these suffixes are treated as C++11 user-defined
<br>
literal numeric suffixes. This is on by default for all
pre-C++11 dialects and all GNU dialects: -std=c++98,
-std=gnu++98, -std=gnu++11, -std=gnu++14. This option is off
by <br>
default for ISO C++11 onwards (-std=c++11, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following -W... options are
not affected by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Weffc++ (C++ and Objective-C++
only) <br>
Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
Scott Meyers&rsquo; Effective C++ series of books:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Define a copy constructor and
an assignment operator for classes with
dynamically-allocated memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Prefer initialization to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also enables
-Wnon-virtual-dtor, which is also one of the effective C++
recommendations. However, the check is extended to warn
about the lack of virtual <br>
destructor in accessible non-polymorphic bases classes
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selecting this option, be
aware that the standard library headers do not obey all of
these guidelines; use grep -v to filter out those
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-null-sentinel (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about the use of an uncasted &quot;NULL&quot; as
sentinel. When compiling only with GCC this is a valid
sentinel, as &quot;NULL&quot; is defined to
&quot;__null&quot;. Although it is a null pointer <br>
constant rather than a null pointer, it is guaranteed to be
of the same size as a pointer. But this use is not portable
across different compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-non-template-friend (C++
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Disable warnings when non-template friend functions are
declared within a template. In very old versions of GCC that
predate implementation of the ISO standard, declarations
<br>
such as friend int foo(int), where the name of the friend is
an unqualified-id, could be interpreted as a particular
specialization of a template function; the warning exists
<br>
to diagnose compatibility problems, and is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-style-cast (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is
used within a C++ program. The new-style casts
(&quot;dynamic_cast&quot;, &quot;static_cast&quot;,
&quot;reinterpret_cast&quot;, and <br>
&quot;const_cast&quot;) are less vulnerable to unintended
effects and much easier to search for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverloaded-virtual (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions
from a base class. For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A { <br>
virtual void f(); <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct B: public A { <br>
void f(int); <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the &quot;A&quot; class version
of &quot;f&quot; is hidden in &quot;B&quot;, and code
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B* b; <br>
b-&gt;f();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fails to compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pmf-conversions (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to
member function to a plain pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsign-promo (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from
unsigned or enumerated type to a signed type, over a
conversion to an unsigned type of the same size. Previous
<br>
versions of G++ tried to preserve unsignedness, but the
standard mandates the current behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtemplates (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.
Some coding rules disallow templates, and this may be used
to enforce that rule. The warning is inactive inside a <br>
system header file, such as the STL, so one can still use
the STL. One may also instantiate or specialize
templates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmultiple-inheritance (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base
classes. Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance,
and this may be used to enforce that rule. The warning is
<br>
inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so
one can still use the STL. One may also define classes that
indirectly use multiple inheritance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvirtual-inheritance <br>
Warn when a class is defined with a virtual direct base
class. Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and
this may be used to enforce that rule. The warning is <br>
inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so
one can still use the STL. One may also define classes that
indirectly use virtual inheritance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnamespaces <br>
Warn when a namespace definition is opened. Some coding
rules disallow namespaces, and this may be used to enforce
that rule. The warning is inactive inside a system header
<br>
file, such as the STL, so one can still use the STL. One may
also use using directives and qualified names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-terminate (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Disable the warning about a throw-expression that will
immediately result in a call to &quot;terminate&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling Objective-C
and Objective-C++ Dialects <br>
(NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and
Objective-C++ languages themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section describes the
command-line options that are only meaningful for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs. You can also use
most of the language-independent GNU <br>
compiler options. For example, you might compile a file
some_class.m like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c
some_class.m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, -fgnu-runtime
is an option meant only for Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since Objective-C is
an extension of the C language, Objective-C compilations may
also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
-Wtraditional). Similarly, <br>
Objective-C++ compilations may use C++-specific options
(e.g., -Wabi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of options that
are only for compiling Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconstant-string-class=class-name
<br>
Use class-name as the name of the class to instantiate for
each literal string specified with the syntax
&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot;. The default class name is
&quot;NXConstantString&quot; if the GNU <br>
runtime is being used, and &quot;NSConstantString&quot; if
the NeXT runtime is being used (see below). The
-fconstant-cfstrings option, if also present, overrides the
<br>
-fconstant-string-class setting and cause
&quot;@&quot;...&quot;&quot; literals to be laid out as
constant CoreFoundation strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgnu-runtime <br>
Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU
Objective-C runtime. This is the default for most types of
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnext-runtime <br>
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime. This is
the default for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac
OS X. The macro &quot;__NEXT_RUNTIME__&quot; is predefined
if <br>
(and only if) this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-nil-receivers <br>
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches
(&quot;[receiver message:arg]&quot;) in this translation
unit ensure that the receiver is not &quot;nil&quot;. This
allows for more efficient <br>
entry points in the runtime to be used. This option is only
available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime and ABI
version 0 or 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-abi-version=n <br>
Use version n of the Objective-C ABI for the selected
runtime. This option is currently supported only for the
NeXT runtime. In that case, Version 0 is the traditional
<br>
(32-bit) ABI without support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions. Version 1 is the traditional
(32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C <br>
2.0 additions. Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI. If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit
target machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target
machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors <br>
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance
variables is a C++ object with a non-trivial default
constructor. If so, synthesize a special &quot;- (id) <br>
.cxx_construct&quot; instance method which runs non-trivial
default constructors on any such instance variables, in
order, and then return &quot;self&quot;. Similarly, check if
any <br>
instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
destructor, and if so, synthesize a special &quot;- (void)
.cxx_destruct&quot; method which runs all such default
destructors, in <br>
reverse order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;- (id)
.cxx_construct&quot; and &quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot;
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those
<br>
inherited from superclasses. It is the responsibility of the
Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods in an
object&rsquo;s inheritance hierarchy. The &quot;- (id) <br>
.cxx_construct&quot; methods are invoked by the runtime
immediately after a new object instance is allocated; the
&quot;- (void) .cxx_destruct&quot; methods are invoked
immediately before <br>
the runtime deallocates an object instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of this writing, only the
NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has support for
invoking the &quot;- (id) .cxx_construct&quot; and &quot;-
(void) .cxx_destruct&quot; methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-direct-dispatch <br>
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher. On Darwin this
is accomplished via the comm page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-exceptions <br>
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling
in Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++. This
option is required to use the Objective-C keywords @try,
<br>
@throw, @catch, @finally and @synchronized. This option is
available with both the GNU runtime and the NeXT runtime
(but not available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime <br>
on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-gc <br>
Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and
Objective-C++ programs. This option is only available with
the NeXT runtime; the GNU runtime has a different garbage
<br>
collection implementation that does not require special
compiler flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-nilcheck <br>
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a
nil receiver in method invocations before doing the actual
method call. This is the default and can be disabled <br>
using -fno-objc-nilcheck. Class methods and super calls are
never checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag
is set to. Currently this flag does nothing when the <br>
GNU runtime, or an older version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fobjc-std=objc1 <br>
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the
language recognized by GCC 4.0. This only affects the
Objective-C additions to the C/C++ language; it does not
affect <br>
conformance to C/C++ standards, which is controlled by the
separate C/C++ dialect option flags. When this option is
used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler, any
<br>
Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is
rejected. This is useful if you need to make sure that your
Objective-C code can be compiled with older versions of <br>
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freplace-objc-classes <br>
Emit a special marker instructing ld(1) not to statically
link in the resulting object file, and allow dyld(1) to load
it in at run time instead. This is used in conjunction <br>
with the Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, where the object
file in question may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded
in the course of program execution, without the need to <br>
restart the program itself. Currently, Fix-and-Continue
functionality is only available in conjunction with the NeXT
runtime on Mac OS X 10.3 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fzero-link <br>
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily
replaces calls to &quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;
(when the name of the class is known at compile time) with
static class <br>
references that get initialized at load time, which improves
run-time performance. Specifying the -fzero-link flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <br>
&quot;objc_getClass(&quot;...&quot;)&quot; to be retained.
This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during
program <br>
execution. The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to
&quot;objc_get_class(&quot;...&quot;)&quot; regardless of
command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-local-ivars <br>
By default instance variables in Objective-C can be accessed
as if they were local variables from within the methods of
the class they&rsquo;re declared in. This can lead to <br>
shadowing between instance variables and other variables
declared either locally inside a class method or globally
with the same name. Specifying the -fno-local-ivars flag
<br>
disables this behavior thus avoiding variable shadowing
issues.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fivar-visibility=[public|protected|private|package]
<br>
Set the default instance variable visibility to the
specified option so that instance variables declared outside
the scope of any access modifier directives default to the
<br>
specified visibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gen-decls <br>
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the
source file to a file named sourcename.decl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted
by the garbage collector.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is
issued for every method in the protocol that is not
implemented by the class. The default behavior is to issue a
<br>
warning for every method not explicitly implemented in the
class, even if a method implementation is inherited from the
superclass. If you use the -Wno-protocol option, then <br>
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be
implemented, and no warning is issued for them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wselector (Objective-C and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same
selector are found during compilation. The check is
performed on the list of methods in the final stage of <br>
compilation. Additionally, a check is performed for each
selector appearing in a &quot;@selector(...)&quot;
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has
been found <br>
during compilation. Because these checks scan the method
table only at the end of compilation, these warnings are not
produced if the final stage of compilation is not <br>
reached, for example because an error is found during
compilation, or because the -fsyntax-only option is being
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-selector-match
(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or
return types are found for a given selector when attempting
to send a message using this selector to a receiver of <br>
type &quot;id&quot; or &quot;Class&quot;. When this flag is
off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such
warnings if any differences found are confined to types that
share the <br>
same size and alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundeclared-selector
(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if a &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression referring to
an undeclared selector is found. A selector is considered
undeclared if no method with that name has been declared
before <br>
the &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression, either explicitly
in an @interface or @protocol declaration, or implicitly in
an @implementation section. This option always performs its
<br>
checks as soon as a &quot;@selector(...)&quot; expression is
found, while -Wselector only performs its checks in the
final stage of compilation. This also enforces the coding
style <br>
convention that methods and selectors must be declared
before being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-objc-runtime-info <br>
Generate C header describing the largest structure that is
passed by value, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to Control Diagnostic
Messages Formatting <br>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted
irrespective of the output device&rsquo;s aspect (e.g. its
width, ...). You can use the options described below to
control the <br>
formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, e.g. how many
characters per line, how often source location information
should be reported. Note that some language front ends may
<br>
not honor these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmessage-length=n <br>
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of
about n characters. If n is zero, then no line-wrapping is
done; each error message appears on a single line. This <br>
is the default for all front ends.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-show-location=once
<br>
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the
diagnostic messages reporter to emit source location
information once; that is, in case the message is too long
to fit <br>
on a single physical line and has to be wrapped, the source
location won&rsquo;t be emitted (as prefix) again, over and
over, in subsequent continuation lines. This is the default
<br>
behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line
<br>
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the
diagnostic messages reporter to emit the same source
location information (as prefix) for physical lines that
result <br>
from the process of breaking a message which is too long to
fit on a single line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-color[=WHEN] <br>
-fno-diagnostics-color <br>
Use color in diagnostics. WHEN is never, always, or auto.
The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
it can be any of the above WHEN options or also never <br>
if GCC_COLORS environment variable isn&rsquo;t present in
the environment, and auto otherwise. auto means to use color
only when the standard error is a terminal. The forms <br>
-fdiagnostics-color and -fno-diagnostics-color are aliases
for -fdiagnostics-color=always and
-fdiagnostics-color=never, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors are defined by the
environment variable GCC_COLORS. Its value is a
colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR <br>
commands are interpreted by the terminal or terminal
emulator. (See the section in the documentation of your text
terminal for permitted values and their meanings as <br>
character attributes.) These substring values are integers
in decimal representation and can be concatenated with
semicolons. Common values to concatenate include 1 for <br>
bold, 4 for underline, 5 for blink, 7 for inverse, 39 for
default foreground color, 30 to 37 for foreground colors, 90
to 97 for 16-color mode foreground colors, 38;5;0 to <br>
38;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors,
49 for default background color, 40 to 47 for background
colors, 100 to 107 for 16-color mode background colors, <br>
and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes
background colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default GCC_COLORS is</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:range1=32:range2=34:locus=01:

is bold magenta, 01;36 is bold cyan, 32 is green, 34 is
blue, 01 is bold, and 31 is red. Setting GCC_COLORS to the
empty string disables <br>
colors. Supported capabilities are as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;error=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for error: markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;warning=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for warning: markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;note=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for note: markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;range1=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for first additional range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;range2=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for second additional range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;locus=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for location information, file:line or
file:line:column etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;quote=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for information printed within quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;fixit-insert=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to be
inserted or replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;fixit-delete=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;diff-filename=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for filename headers within generated
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;diff-hunk=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for the starts of hunks within generated
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;diff-delete=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for deleted lines within generated
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;diff-insert=&quot; <br>
SGR substring for inserted lines within generated
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-diagnostics-show-option
<br>
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating
the command-line option that directly controls the
diagnostic (if such an option is known to the diagnostic
<br>
machinery). Specifying the -fno-diagnostics-show-option flag
suppresses that behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-diagnostics-show-caret <br>
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original
source line and a caret ^ indicating the column. This option
suppresses this information. The source line is <br>
truncated to n characters, if the -fmessage-length=n option
is given. When the output is done to the terminal, the width
is limited to the width given by the COLUMNS <br>
environment variable or, if not set, to the terminal
width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits
<br>
Emit fix-it hints in a machine-parseable format, suitable
for consumption by IDEs. For each fix-it, a line will be
printed after the relevant diagnostic, starting with the
<br>
string &quot;fix-it:&quot;. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">fix-it:&quot;test.c&quot;:{45:3-45:21}:&quot;gtk_widget_show_all&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The location is expressed as a
half-open range, expressed as a count of bytes, starting at
byte 1 for the initial column. In the above example, bytes 3
through 20 of line 45 <br>
of &quot;test.c&quot; are to be replaced with the given
string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">00000000011111111112222222222
<br>
12345678901234567890123456789 <br>
gtk_widget_showall (dlg); <br>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <br>
gtk_widget_show_all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The filename and replacement
string escape backslash as &quot;\&quot;, tab as
&quot;&quot;, newline as &quot;0, double quotes as &quot;
<br>
&quot; 13&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty replacement string
indicates that the given range is to be removed. An empty
range (e.g. &quot;45:3-45:3&quot;) indicates that the string
is to be inserted at the given <br>
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdiagnostics-generate-patch
<br>
Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after
any diagnostics are printed. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- test.c <br>
+++ test.c <br>
@ -42,5 +42,5 @</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg)
<br>
{ <br>
- gtk_widget_showall(dlg); <br>
+ gtk_widget_show_all(dlg); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The diff may or may not be
colorized, following the same rules as for diagnostics (see
-fdiagnostics-color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-show-column <br>
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics. This may be
necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that
does not understand the column numbers, such as dejagnu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to Request or Suppress
Warnings <br>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions
that are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or
suggest there may have been an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following
language-independent options do not enable specific warnings
but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsyntax-only <br>
Check the code for syntax errors, but don&rsquo;t do
anything beyond that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmax-errors=n <br>
Limits the maximum number of error messages to n, at which
point GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue
processing the source code. If n is 0 (the default), there
<br>
is no limit on the number of error messages produced. If
-Wfatal-errors is also specified, then -Wfatal-errors takes
precedence over this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Inhibit all warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror <br>
Make all warnings into errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Werror= <br>
Make the specified warning into an error. The specifier for
a warning is appended; for example -Werror=switch turns the
warnings controlled by -Wswitch into errors. This <br>
switch takes a negative form, to be used to negate -Werror
for specific warnings; for example -Wno-error=switch makes
-Wswitch warnings not be errors, even when -Werror is in
<br>
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The warning message for each
controllable warning includes the option that controls the
warning. That option can then be used with -Werror= and
-Wno-error= as described <br>
above. (Printing of the option in the warning message can be
disabled using the -fno-diagnostics-show-option flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that specifying -Werror=foo
automatically implies -Wfoo. However, -Wno-error=foo does
not imply anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wfatal-errors <br>
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the
first error occurred rather than trying to keep going and
printing further error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can request many specific
warnings with options beginning with -W, for example
-Wimplicit to request warnings on implicit declarations.
Each of these specific warning <br>
options also has a negative form beginning -Wno- to turn off
warnings; for example, -Wno-implicit. This manual lists only
one of the two forms, whichever is not the default. <br>
For further language-specific options also refer to C++
Dialect Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some options, such as -Wall and
-Wextra, turn on other options, such as -Wunused, which may
turn on further options, such as -Wunused-value. The
combined effect of positive and <br>
negative forms is that more specific options have priority
over less specific ones, independently of their position in
the command-line. For options of the same specificity, the
<br>
last one takes effect. Options enabled or disabled via
pragmas take effect as if they appeared at the end of the
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an unrecognized warning
option is requested (e.g., -Wunknown-warning), GCC emits a
diagnostic stating that the option is not recognized.
However, if the -Wno- form is used, <br>
the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for -Wno-unknown-warning unless other diagnostics
are being produced. This allows the use of new -Wno- options
with <br>
old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpedantic <br>
-pedantic <br>
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some
other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. <br>
For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard
specified by any -std option used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs
should compile properly with or without this option (though
a rare few require -ansi or a -std option specifying the
required version of ISO <br>
C). However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and
traditional C and C++ features are supported as well. With
this option, they are rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpedantic does not cause
warning messages for use of the alternate keywords whose
names begin and end with __. Pedantic warnings are also
disabled in the expression that <br>
follows &quot;__extension__&quot;. However, only system
header files should use these escape routes; application
programs should avoid them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some users try to use -Wpedantic
to check programs for strict ISO C conformance. They soon
find that it does not do quite what they want: it finds some
non-ISO practices, <br>
but not all---only those for which ISO C requires a
diagnostic, and some others for which diagnostics have been
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A feature to report any failure
to conform to ISO C might be useful in some instances, but
would require considerable additional work and would be
quite different from <br>
-Wpedantic. We don&rsquo;t have plans to support such a
feature in the near future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the standard specified
with -std represents a GNU extended dialect of C, such as
gnu90 or gnu99, there is a corresponding base standard, the
version of ISO C on which <br>
the GNU extended dialect is based. Warnings from -Wpedantic
are given where they are required by the base standard. (It
does not make sense for such warnings to be given <br>
only for features not in the specified GNU C dialect, since
by definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the
compiler supports with the given option, and there <br>
would be nothing to warn about.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pedantic-errors <br>
Give an error whenever the base standard (see -Wpedantic)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is
undefined behavior at compile-time and in some other cases
that <br>
do not prevent compilation of programs that are valid
according to the standard. This is not equivalent to
-Werror=pedantic, since there are errors enabled by this
option and <br>
not enabled by the latter and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall <br>
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some
users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or
modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction <br>
with macros. This also enables some language-specific
warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C
and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some warning flags are
not implied by -Wall. Some of them warn about constructions
that users generally do not consider questionable, but which
occasionally you <br>
might wish to check for; others warn about constructions
that are necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and there
is no simple way to modify the code to suppress the <br>
warning. Some of them are enabled by -Wextra but many of
them must be enabled individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wextra <br>
This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled
by -Wall. (This option used to be called -W. The older name
is still supported, but the newer name is more <br>
descriptive.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wchar-subscripts <br>
Warn if an array subscript has type &quot;char&quot;. This
is a common cause of error, as programmers often forget that
this type is signed on some machines. This warning is
enabled <br>
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wchkp <br>
Warn about an invalid memory access that is found by Pointer
Bounds Checker (-fcheck-pointer-bounds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-coverage-mismatch <br>
Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
-fprofile-use option. If a source file is changed between
compiling with -fprofile-gen and with -fprofile-use, the
<br>
files with the profile feedback can fail to match the source
file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback information. By
default, this warning is enabled and is treated as <br>
an error. -Wno-coverage-mismatch can be used to disable the
warning or -Wno-error=coverage-mismatch can be used to
disable the error. Disabling the error for this warning <br>
can result in poorly optimized code and is useful only in
the case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an
existing code-base. Completely disabling the warning is not
<br>
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-cpp <br>
(C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppress warning messages
emitted by &quot;#warning&quot; directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdouble-promotion (C, C++,
Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Give a warning when a value of type &quot;float&quot; is
implicitly promoted to &quot;double&quot;. CPUs with a
32-bit &quot;single-precision&quot; floating-point unit
implement &quot;float&quot; in hardware, but <br>
emulate &quot;double&quot; in software. On such a machine,
doing computations using &quot;double&quot; values is much
more expensive because of the overhead required for software
emulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is easy to accidentally do
computations with &quot;double&quot; because floating-point
literals are implicitly of type &quot;double&quot;. For
example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">float area(float radius) <br>
{ <br>
return 3.14159 * radius * radius; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the compiler performs the entire
computation with &quot;double&quot; because the
floating-point literal is a &quot;double&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wduplicate-decl-specifier (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a declaration has duplicate &quot;const&quot;,
&quot;volatile&quot;, &quot;restrict&quot; or
&quot;_Atomic&quot; specifier. This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat <br>
-Wformat=n <br>
Check calls to &quot;printf&quot; and &quot;scanf&quot;,
etc., to make sure that the arguments supplied have types
appropriate to the format string specified, and that the
conversions specified <br>
in the format string make sense. This includes standard
functions, and others specified by format attributes, in the
&quot;printf&quot;, &quot;scanf&quot;, &quot;strftime&quot;
and &quot;strfmon&quot; (an X/Open <br>
extension, not in the C standard) families (or other
target-specific families). Which functions are checked
without format attributes having been specified depends on
the <br>
standard version selected, and such checks of functions
without the attribute specified are disabled by
-ffreestanding or -fno-builtin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The formats are checked against
the format features supported by GNU libc version 2.2. These
include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well as features
from the Single Unix <br>
Specification and some BSD and GNU extensions. Other library
implementations may not support all these features; GCC does
not support warning about features that go beyond a <br>
particular library&rsquo;s limitations. However, if
-Wpedantic is used with -Wformat, warnings are given about
format features not in the selected standard version (but
not for <br>
&quot;strfmon&quot; formats, since those are not in any
version of the C standard).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat=1 <br>
-Wformat <br>
Option -Wformat is equivalent to -Wformat=1, and -Wno-format
is equivalent to -Wformat=0. Since -Wformat also checks for
null format arguments for several functions, <br>
-Wformat also implies -Wnonnull. Some aspects of this level
of format checking can be disabled by the options:
-Wno-format-contains-nul, -Wno-format-extra-args, and <br>
-Wno-format-zero-length. -Wformat is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-format-contains-nul <br>
If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about format strings
that contain NUL bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-format-extra-args <br>
If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about excess arguments
to a &quot;printf&quot; or &quot;scanf&quot; format
function. The C standard specifies that such arguments are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the unused arguments lie
between used arguments that are specified with $ operand
number specifications, normally warnings are still given,
since the implementation <br>
could not know what type to pass to &quot;va_arg&quot; to
skip the unused arguments. However, in the case of
&quot;scanf&quot; formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused <br>
arguments are all pointers, since the Single Unix
Specification says that such unused arguments are
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-overflow <br>
-Wformat-overflow=level <br>
Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as
&quot;sprintf&quot; and &quot;vsprintf&quot; that might
overflow the destination buffer. When the exact number of
bytes written <br>
by a format directive cannot be determined at compile-time
it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the level
argument and on optimization. While enabling <br>
optimization will in most cases improve the accuracy of the
warning, it may also result in false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-overflow <br>
-Wformat-overflow=1 <br>
Level 1 of -Wformat-overflow enabled by -Wformat employs a
conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer. At this level, <br>
numeric arguments to format directives with unknown values
are assumed to have the value of one, and strings of unknown
length to be empty. Numeric arguments that <br>
are known to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or
string arguments whose output is bounded either by their
directive&rsquo;s precision or by a finite set of string
<br>
literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range
that results in the most bytes on output. For example, the
call to &quot;sprintf&quot; below is diagnosed because <br>
even with both a and b equal to zero, the terminating NUL
character (&rsquo; &rsquo;) appended by the function to the
destination buffer will be written past its end. <br>
Increasing the size of the buffer by a single byte is
sufficient to avoid the warning, though it may not be
sufficient to avoid the overflow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void f (int a, int b) <br>
{ <br>
char buf [12]; <br>
sprintf (buf, &quot;a = %i, b = %i0, a, b); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-overflow=2 <br>
Level 2 warns also about calls that might overflow the
destination buffer given an argument of sufficient length or
magnitude. At level 2, unknown numeric arguments <br>
are assumed to have the minimum representable value for
signed types with a precision greater than 1, and the
maximum representable value otherwise. Unknown string <br>
arguments whose length cannot be assumed to be bounded
either by the directive&rsquo;s precision, or by a finite
set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the <br>
character array they may point to, are assumed to be 1
character long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At level 2, the call in the
example above is again diagnosed, but this time because with
a equal to a 32-bit &quot;INT_MIN&quot; the first %i
directive will write some of its <br>
digits beyond the end of the destination buffer. To make the
call safe regardless of the values of the two variables, the
size of the destination buffer must be <br>
increased to at least 34 bytes. GCC includes the minimum
size of the buffer in an informational note following the
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative to increasing the
size of the destination buffer is to constrain the range of
formatted values. The maximum length of string arguments can
be bounded <br>
by specifying the precision in the format directive. When
numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed to be
bounded by less than the precision of their <br>
type, choosing an appropriate length modifier to the format
specifier will reduce the required buffer size. For example,
if a and b in the example above can be <br>
assumed to be within the precision of the &quot;short
int&quot; type then using either the %hi format directive or
casting the argument to &quot;short&quot; reduces the
maximum required <br>
size of the buffer to 24 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void f (int a, int b) <br>
{ <br>
char buf [23]; <br>
sprintf (buf, &quot;a = %hi, b = %i0, a, (short)b); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-format-zero-length <br>
If -Wformat is specified, do not warn about zero-length
formats. The C standard specifies that zero-length formats
are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat=2 <br>
Enable -Wformat plus additional format checks. Currently
equivalent to -Wformat -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security
-Wformat-y2k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-nonliteral <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn if the format string is
not a string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the
format function takes its format arguments as a <br>
&quot;va_list&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-security <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems. At
present, this warns about calls to &quot;printf&quot; and
&quot;scanf&quot; <br>
functions where the format string is not a string literal
and there are no format arguments, as in &quot;printf
(foo);&quot;. This may be a security hole if the format
string came <br>
from untrusted input and contains %n. (This is currently a
subset of what -Wformat-nonliteral warns about, but in
future warnings may be added to -Wformat-security that <br>
are not included in -Wformat-nonliteral.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-signedness <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn if the format string
requires an unsigned argument and the argument is signed and
vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-truncation <br>
-Wformat-truncation=level <br>
Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as
&quot;snprintf&quot; and &quot;vsnprintf&quot; that might
result in output truncation. When the exact number of bytes
written by <br>
a format directive cannot be determined at compile-time it
is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the level
argument and on optimization. While enabling <br>
optimization will in most cases improve the accuracy of the
warning, it may also result in false positives. Except as
noted otherwise, the option uses the same logic <br>
-Wformat-overflow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-truncation <br>
-Wformat-truncation=1 <br>
Level 1 of -Wformat-truncation enabled by -Wformat employs a
conservative approach that warns only about calls to bounded
functions whose return value is unused and <br>
that will most likely result in output truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-truncation=2 <br>
Level 2 warns also about calls to bounded functions whose
return value is used and that might result in truncation
given an argument of sufficient length or <br>
magnitude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wformat-y2k <br>
If -Wformat is specified, also warn about
&quot;strftime&quot; formats that may yield only a two-digit
year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnonnull <br>
Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the &quot;nonnull&quot;
function attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnonnull is included in -Wall
and -Wformat. It can be disabled with the -Wno-nonnull
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnonnull-compare <br>
Warn when comparing an argument marked with the
&quot;nonnull&quot; function attribute against null inside
the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnonnull-compare is included in
-Wall. It can be disabled with the -Wno-nonnull-compare
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnull-dereference <br>
Warn if the compiler detects paths that trigger erroneous or
undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer. This
option is only active when <br>
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks is active, which is enabled by
optimizations in most targets. The precision of the warnings
depends on the optimization options used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winit-self (C, C++, Objective-C
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with
themselves. Note this option can only be used with the
-Wuninitialized option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, GCC warns about
&quot;i&quot; being uninitialized in the following snippet
only when -Winit-self has been specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() <br>
{ <br>
int i = i; <br>
return i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by -Wall
in C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-int (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn when a declaration does not specify a type. This
warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-function-declaration
(C and Objective-C only) <br>
Give a warning whenever a function is used before being
declared. In C99 mode (-std=c99 or -std=gnu99), this warning
is enabled by default and it is made into an error by <br>
-pedantic-errors. This warning is also enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit (C and Objective-C
only) <br>
Same as -Wimplicit-int and -Wimplicit-function-declaration.
This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-fallthrough <br>
-Wimplicit-fallthrough is the same as
-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 and -Wno-implicit-fallthrough is
the same as -Wimplicit-fallthrough=0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wimplicit-fallthrough=n <br>
Warn when a switch case falls through. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch (cond) <br>
{ <br>
case 1: <br>
a = 1; <br>
break; <br>
case 2: <br>
a = 2; <br>
case 3: <br>
a = 3; <br>
break; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning does not warn when
the last statement of a case cannot fall through, e.g. when
there is a return statement or a call to function declared
with the noreturn <br>
attribute. -Wimplicit-fallthrough= also takes into account
control flow statements, such as ifs, and only warns when
appropriate. E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch (cond) <br>
{ <br>
case 1: <br>
if (i &gt; 3) { <br>
bar (5); <br>
break; <br>
} else if (i &lt; 1) { <br>
bar (0); <br>
} else <br>
return; <br>
default: <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since there are occasions where
a switch case fall through is desirable, GCC provides an
attribute, &quot;__attribute__ ((fallthrough))&quot;, that
is to be used along with a null <br>
statement to suppress this warning that would normally
occur:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch (cond) <br>
{ <br>
case 1: <br>
bar (0); <br>
__attribute__ ((fallthrough)); <br>
default: <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C++17 provides a standard way to
suppress the -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning using
&quot;[[fallthrough]];&quot; instead of the GNU attribute.
In C++11 or C++14 users can use <br>
&quot;[[gnu::fallthrough]];&quot;, which is a GNU extension.
Instead of the these attributes, it is also possible to add
a fallthrough comment to silence the warning. The whole body
<br>
of the C or C++ style comment should match the given regular
expressions listed below. The option argument n specifies
what kind of comments are accepted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*&lt;-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0
disables the warning altogether.&gt; <br>
*&lt;-Wimplicit-fallthrough=1 matches &quot;.*&quot;

}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3
warning is enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wignored-qualifiers (C and C++
only) <br>
Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as &quot;const&quot;. For ISO C such a type qualifier
has no effect, since the value returned by a function is not
an <br>
lvalue. For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar
types or &quot;void&quot;. ISO C prohibits qualified
&quot;void&quot; return types on function definitions, so
such return types always <br>
receive a warning even without this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wignored-attributes (C and C++
only) <br>
Warn when an attribute is ignored. This is different from
the -Wattributes option in that it warns whenever the
compiler decides to drop an attribute, not that the
attribute <br>
is either unknown, used in a wrong place, etc. This warning
is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmain <br>
Warn if the type of &quot;main&quot; is suspicious.
&quot;main&quot; should be a function with external linkage,
returning int, taking either zero arguments, two, or three
arguments of <br>
appropriate types. This warning is enabled by default in C++
and is enabled by either -Wall or -Wpedantic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmisleading-indentation (C and
C++ only) <br>
Warn when the indentation of the code does not reflect the
block structure. Specifically, a warning is issued for
&quot;if&quot;, &quot;else&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, and
&quot;for&quot; clauses with a guarded <br>
statement that does not use braces, followed by an unguarded
statement with the same indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following example, the
call to &quot;bar&quot; is misleadingly indented as if it
were guarded by the &quot;if&quot; conditional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (some_condition ()) <br>
foo (); <br>
bar (); /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the
&quot;if&quot;. */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of mixed tabs and
spaces, the warning uses the -ftabstop= option to determine
if the statements line up (defaulting to 8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The warning is not issued for
code involving multiline preprocessor logic such as the
following example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (flagA) <br>
foo (0); <br>
#if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD <br>
if (flagB) <br>
#endif <br>
foo (1);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The warning is not issued after
a &quot;#line&quot; directive, since this typically
indicates autogenerated code, and no assumptions can be made
about the layout of the file that the <br>
directive references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by -Wall
in C and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-braces <br>
Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully
bracketed. In the following example, the initializer for
&quot;a&quot; is not fully bracketed, but that for
&quot;b&quot; is fully <br>
bracketed. This warning is enabled by -Wall in C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
<br>
int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-include-dirs (C, C++,
Objective-C and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wparentheses <br>
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as
when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose <br>
precedence people often get confused about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn if a comparison like
&quot;x&lt;=y&lt;=z&quot; appears; this is equivalent to
&quot;(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z&quot;, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical <br>
notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn for dangerous uses of
the GNU extension to &quot;?:&quot; with omitted middle
operand. When the condition in the &quot;?&quot;: operator
is a boolean expression, the omitted value is <br>
always 1. Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsequence-point <br>
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of
violations of sequence point rules in the C and C++
standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C and C++ standards define
the order in which expressions in a C/C++ program are
evaluated in terms of sequence points, which represent a
partial ordering between the <br>
execution of parts of the program: those executed before the
sequence point, and those executed after it. These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is <br>
not part of a larger expression), after the evaluation of
the first operand of a &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;,
&quot;||&quot;, &quot;? :&quot; or &quot;,&quot; (comma)
operator, before a function is called (but after the <br>
evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the
called function), and in certain other places. Other than as
expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of <br>
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not
specified. All these rules describe only a partial order
rather than a total order, since, for example, if two
functions <br>
are called within one expression with no sequence point
between them, the order in which the functions are called is
not specified. However, the standards committee have <br>
ruled that function calls do not overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not specified when between
sequence points modifications to the values of objects take
effect. Programs whose behavior depends on this have
undefined behavior; the C <br>
and C++ standards specify that &quot;Between the previous
and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
expression. <br>
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine
the value to be stored.&quot;. If a program breaks these
rules, the results on any particular implementation are <br>
entirely unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of code with undefined
behavior are &quot;a = a++;&quot;, &quot;a[n] = b[n++]&quot;
and &quot;a[i++] = i;&quot;. Some more complicated cases are
not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an <br>
occasional false positive result, but in general it has been
found fairly effective at detecting this sort of problem in
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C++17 standard will define
the order of evaluation of operands in more cases: in
particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the <br>
left-hand side, so the above examples are no longer
undefined. But this warning will still warn about them, to
help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C and
<br>
earlier revisions of C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard is worded
confusingly, therefore there is some debate over the precise
meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases. Links
to discussions of the problem, <br>
including proposed formal definitions, may be found on the
GCC readings page, at
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by -Wall
for C and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-return-local-addr <br>
Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in C++, a
reference) to a variable that goes out of scope after the
function returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wreturn-type <br>
Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that
defaults to &quot;int&quot;. Also warn about any
&quot;return&quot; statement with no return value in a
function whose return type is <br>
not &quot;void&quot; (falling off the end of the function
body is considered returning without a value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For C only, warn about a
&quot;return&quot; statement with an expression in a
function whose return type is &quot;void&quot;, unless the
expression type is also &quot;void&quot;. As a GNU
extension, the <br>
latter case is accepted without a warning unless -Wpedantic
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For C++, a function without
return type always produces a diagnostic message, even when
-Wno-return-type is specified. The only exceptions are
&quot;main&quot; and functions defined <br>
in system headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshift-count-negative <br>
Warn if shift count is negative. This warning is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshift-count-overflow <br>
Warn if shift count &gt;= width of type. This warning is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshift-negative-value <br>
Warn if left shifting a negative value. This warning is
enabled by -Wextra in C99 and C++11 modes (and newer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshift-overflow <br>
-Wshift-overflow=n <br>
Warn about left shift overflows. This warning is enabled by
default in C99 and C++11 modes (and newer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshift-overflow=1 <br>
This is the warning level of -Wshift-overflow and is enabled
by default in C99 and C++11 modes (and newer). This warning
level does not warn about left-shifting 1 into <br>
the sign bit. (However, in C, such an overflow is still
rejected in contexts where an integer constant expression is
required.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshift-overflow=2 <br>
This warning level also warns about left-shifting 1 into the
sign bit, unless C++14 mode is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement has an index of
enumerated type and lacks a &quot;case&quot; for one or more
of the named codes of that enumeration. (The presence of a
&quot;default&quot; <br>
label prevents this warning.) &quot;case&quot; labels
outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when
this option is used (even if there is a &quot;default&quot;
label). This warning <br>
is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-default <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement does not have a
&quot;default&quot; case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-enum <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement has an index of
enumerated type and lacks a &quot;case&quot; for one or more
of the named codes of that enumeration. &quot;case&quot;
labels outside the <br>
enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is
used. The only difference between -Wswitch and this option
is that this option gives a warning about an omitted <br>
enumeration code even if there is a &quot;default&quot;
label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-bool <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement has an index of
boolean type and the case values are outside the range of a
boolean type. It is possible to suppress this warning by
<br>
casting the controlling expression to a type other than
&quot;bool&quot;. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch ((int) (a == 4)) <br>
{ <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default for C and C++ programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-unreachable <br>
Warn whenever a &quot;switch&quot; statement contains
statements between the controlling expression and the first
case label, which will never be executed. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch (cond) <br>
{ <br>
i = 15; <br>
... <br>
case 5: <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wswitch-unreachable does not
warn if the statement between the controlling expression and
the first case label is just a declaration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch (cond) <br>
{ <br>
int i; <br>
... <br>
case 5: <br>
i = 5; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default for C and C++ programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsync-nand (C and C++ only)
<br>
Warn when &quot;__sync_fetch_and_nand&quot; and
&quot;__sync_nand_and_fetch&quot; built-in functions are
used. These functions changed semantics in GCC 4.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-but-set-parameter <br>
Warn whenever a function parameter is assigned to, but
otherwise unused (aside from its declaration).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
&quot;unused&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wunused together with -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-but-set-variable <br>
Warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise
unused (aside from its declaration). This warning is enabled
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
&quot;unused&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wunused, which is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-function <br>
Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined
or a non-inline static function is unused. This warning is
enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-label <br>
Warn whenever a label is declared but not used. This warning
is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
&quot;unused&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-local-typedefs (C,
Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a typedef locally defined in a function is not
used. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-parameter <br>
Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
&quot;unused&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-unused-result <br>
Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
&quot;warn_unused_result&quot; does not use its return
value. The default is -Wunused-result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-variable <br>
Warn whenever a local or static variable is unused aside
from its declaration. This option implies
-Wunused-const-variable=1 for C, but not for C++. This
warning is enabled <br>
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
&quot;unused&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-const-variable <br>
-Wunused-const-variable=n <br>
Warn whenever a constant static variable is unused aside
from its declaration. -Wunused-const-variable=1 is enabled
by -Wunused-variable for C, but not for C++. In C this <br>
declares variable storage, but in C++ this is not an error
since const variables take the place of
&quot;#define&quot;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress this warning use the
&quot;unused&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-const-variable=1 <br>
This is the warning level that is enabled by
-Wunused-variable for C. It warns only about unused static
const variables defined in the main compilation unit, but
not <br>
about static const variables declared in any header
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-const-variable=2 <br>
This warning level also warns for unused constant static
variables in headers (excluding system headers). This is the
warning level of -Wunused-const-variable and must <br>
be explicitly requested since in C++ this isn&rsquo;t an
error and in C it might be harder to clean up all headers
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-value <br>
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is
explicitly not used. To suppress this warning cast the
unused expression to &quot;void&quot;. This includes an
expression-statement <br>
or the left-hand side of a comma expression that contains no
side effects. For example, an expression such as
&quot;x[i,j]&quot; causes a warning, while
&quot;x[(void)i,j]&quot; does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused <br>
All the above -Wunused options combined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to get a warning about
an unused function parameter, you must either specify
-Wextra -Wunused (note that -Wall implies -Wunused), or
separately specify <br>
-Wunused-parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wuninitialized <br>
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being
initialized or if a variable may be clobbered by a
&quot;setjmp&quot; call. In C++, warn if a non-static
reference or non- <br>
static &quot;const&quot; member appears in a class without
constructors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to warn about code
that uses the uninitialized value of the variable in its own
initializer, use the -Winit-self option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These warnings occur for
individual uninitialized or clobbered elements of structure,
union or array variables as well as for variables that are
uninitialized or clobbered as <br>
a whole. They do not occur for variables or elements
declared &quot;volatile&quot;. Because these warnings depend
on optimization, the exact variables or elements for which
there are <br>
warnings depends on the precise optimization options and
version of GCC used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there may be no
warning about a variable that is used only to compute a
value that itself is never used, because such computations
may be deleted by data flow <br>
analysis before the warnings are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winvalid-memory-model <br>
Warn for invocations of __atomic Builtins, __sync Builtins,
and the C11 atomic generic functions with a memory
consistency argument that is either invalid for the
operation <br>
or outside the range of values of the
&quot;memory_order&quot; enumeration. For example, since the
&quot;__atomic_store&quot; and &quot;__atomic_store_n&quot;
built-ins are only defined for the relaxed, <br>
release, and sequentially consistent memory orders the
following code is diagnosed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void store (int *i) <br>
{ <br>
__atomic_store_n (i, 0, memory_order_consume); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winvalid-memory-model is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmaybe-uninitialized <br>
For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the
function entry to a use of the variable that is initialized,
but there exist some other paths for which the <br>
variable is not initialized, the compiler emits a warning if
it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not executed at
run time. These warnings are made optional because <br>
GCC is not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code
might be correct in spite of appearing to have an error.
Here is one example of how this can happen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
int x; <br>
switch (y) <br>
{ <br>
case 1: x = 1; <br>
break; <br>
case 2: x = 4; <br>
break; <br>
case 3: x = 5; <br>
} <br>
foo (x); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of &quot;y&quot; is
always 1, 2 or 3, then &quot;x&quot; is always initialized,
but GCC doesn&rsquo;t know this. To suppress the warning,
you need to provide a default case with assert(0) <br>
or similar code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also warns when a
non-volatile automatic variable might be changed by a call
to &quot;longjmp&quot;. These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler sees only the calls
to &quot;setjmp&quot;. It cannot know where
&quot;longjmp&quot; will be called; in fact, a signal
handler could call it at any point in the code. As a result,
<br>
you may get a warning even when there is in fact no problem
because &quot;longjmp&quot; cannot in fact be called at the
place that would cause a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some spurious warnings can be
avoided if you declare all the functions you use that never
return as &quot;noreturn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by -Wall
or -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunknown-pragmas <br>
Warn when a &quot;#pragma&quot; directive is encountered
that is not understood by GCC. If this command-line option
is used, warnings are even issued for unknown pragmas in
system <br>
header files. This is not the case if the warnings are only
enabled by the -Wall command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pragmas <br>
Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect
parameters, invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.
See also -Wunknown-pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-aliasing <br>
This option is only active when -fstrict-aliasing is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing
rules that the compiler is using for optimization. The <br>
warning does not catch all cases, but does attempt to catch
the more common pitfalls. It is included in -Wall. It is
equivalent to -Wstrict-aliasing=3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-aliasing=n <br>
This option is only active when -fstrict-aliasing is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing
rules that the compiler is using for optimization. <br>
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false
positives). Higher levels also correspond to more effort,
similar to the way -O works. -Wstrict-aliasing is <br>
equivalent to -Wstrict-aliasing=3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 1: Most aggressive, quick,
least accurate. Possibly useful when higher levels do not
warn but -fstrict-aliasing still breaks the code, as it has
very few false <br>
negatives. However, it has many false positives. Warns for
all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced. Runs in the front end <br>
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not
too precise. May still have many false positives (not as
many as level 1 though), and few false negatives (but
possibly more than level 1). <br>
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.
Warns about incomplete types. Runs in the front end
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 3 (default for
-Wstrict-aliasing): Should have very few false positives and
few false negatives. Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when
optimization is enabled. <br>
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the
front end: &quot;*(int*)&amp;some_float&quot;. If
optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where
it deals with <br>
multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to
information. Only warns when the converted pointer is
dereferenced. Does not warn about incomplete types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow <br>
-Wstrict-overflow=n <br>
This option is only active when -fstrict-overflow is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on
the assumption that signed overflow does not occur. <br>
Note that it does not warn about all cases where the code
might overflow: it only warns about cases where the compiler
implements some optimization. Thus this warning <br>
depends on the optimization level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optimization that assumes
that signed overflow does not occur is perfectly safe if the
values of the variables involved are such that overflow
never does, in fact, occur. <br>
Therefore this warning can easily give a false positive: a
warning about code that is not actually a problem. To help
focus on important issues, several warning levels are <br>
defined. No warnings are issued for the use of undefined
signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop <br>
will be executed at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=1 <br>
Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to
avoid. For example, with -fstrict-overflow, the compiler
simplifies &quot;x + 1 &gt; x&quot; to 1. This level of <br>
-Wstrict-overflow is enabled by -Wall; higher levels are
not, and must be explicitly requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=2 <br>
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified
to a constant. For example: &quot;abs (x) &gt;= 0&quot;.
This can only be simplified when -fstrict-overflow is in
<br>
effect, because &quot;abs (INT_MIN)&quot; overflows to
&quot;INT_MIN&quot;, which is less than zero.
-Wstrict-overflow (with no level) is the same as
-Wstrict-overflow=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=3 <br>
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is
simplified. For example: &quot;x + 1 &gt; 1&quot; is
simplified to &quot;x &gt; 0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=4 <br>
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the
above cases. For example: &quot;(x * 10) / 5&quot; is
simplified to &quot;x * 2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-overflow=5 <br>
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the
magnitude of a constant involved in a comparison. For
example: &quot;x + 2 &gt; y&quot; is simplified to &quot;x +
1 &gt;= y&quot;. This is <br>
reported only at the highest warning level because this
simplification applies to many comparisons, so this warning
level gives a very large number of false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstringop-overflow <br>
-Wstringop-overflow=type <br>
Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as
&quot;memcpy&quot; and &quot;strcpy&quot; that are
determined to overflow the destination buffer. The optional
argument is one greater <br>
than the type of Object Size Checking to perform to
determine the size of the destination. The argument is
meaningful only for functions that operate on character
arrays but <br>
not for raw memory functions like &quot;memcpy&quot; which
always make use of Object Size type-0. The option also warns
for calls that specify a size in excess of the largest
possible <br>
object or at most &quot;SIZE_MAX / 2&quot; bytes. The option
produces the best results with optimization enabled but can
detect a small subset of simple buffer overflows even
without <br>
optimization in calls to the GCC built-in functions like
&quot;__builtin_memcpy&quot; that correspond to the standard
functions. In any case, the option warns about just a subset
of <br>
buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow
checking built-ins. For example, the option will issue a
warning for the &quot;strcpy&quot; call below because it
copies at <br>
least 5 characters (the string &quot;blue&quot; including
the terminating NUL) into the buffer of size 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enum Color { blue, purple,
yellow }; <br>
const char* f (enum Color clr) <br>
{ <br>
static char buf [4]; <br>
const char *str; <br>
switch (clr) <br>
{ <br>
case blue: str = &quot;blue&quot;; break; <br>
case purple: str = &quot;purple&quot;; break; <br>
case yellow: str = &quot;yellow&quot;; break; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return strcpy (buf, str); //
warning here <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option -Wstringop-overflow=2 is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstringop-overflow <br>
-Wstringop-overflow=1 <br>
The -Wstringop-overflow=1 option uses type-zero Object Size
Checking to determine the sizes of destination objects. This
is the default setting of the option. At this <br>
setting the option will not warn for writes past the end of
subobjects of larger objects accessed by pointers unless the
size of the largest surrounding object is known. <br>
When the destination may be one of several objects it is
assumed to be the largest one of them. On Linux systems,
when optimization is enabled at this setting the option <br>
warns for the same code as when the
&quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE&quot; macro is defined to a non-zero
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstringop-overflow=2 <br>
The -Wstringop-overflow=2 option uses type-one Object Size
Checking to determine the sizes of destination objects. At
this setting the option will warn about overflows <br>
when writing to members of the largest complete objects
whose exact size is known. It will, however, not warn for
excessive writes to the same members of unknown objects <br>
referenced by pointers since they may point to arrays
containing unknown numbers of elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstringop-overflow=3 <br>
The -Wstringop-overflow=3 option uses type-two Object Size
Checking to determine the sizes of destination objects. At
this setting the option warns about overflowing the <br>
smallest object or data member. This is the most restrictive
setting of the option that may result in warnings for safe
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstringop-overflow=4 <br>
The -Wstringop-overflow=4 option uses type-three Object Size
Checking to determine the sizes of destination objects. At
this setting the option will warn about <br>
overflowing any data members, and when the destination is
one of several objects it uses the size of the largest of
them to decide whether to issue a warning. Similarly <br>
to -Wstringop-overflow=3 this setting of the option may
result in warnings for benign code.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-attribute=[pure|const|noreturn|format]
<br>
Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial.
The attributes currently supported are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-attribute=pure <br>
-Wsuggest-attribute=const <br>
-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn <br>
Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
&quot;pure&quot;, &quot;const&quot; or &quot;noreturn&quot;.
The compiler only warns for functions visible in other
compilation units or <br>
(in the case of &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;const&quot;) if
it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A
function returns normally if it doesn&rsquo;t contain an
infinite loop or return <br>
abnormally by throwing, calling &quot;abort&quot; or
trapping. This analysis requires option -fipa-pure-const,
which is enabled by default at -O and higher. Higher
optimization <br>
levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-attribute=format <br>
-Wmissing-format-attribute <br>
Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for
&quot;format&quot; attributes. Note these are only possible
candidates, not absolute ones. GCC guesses that function
<br>
pointers with &quot;format&quot; attributes that are used in
assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding &quot;format&quot;
attribute in <br>
the resulting type. I.e. the left-hand side of the
assignment or initialization, the type of the parameter
variable, or the return type of the containing function <br>
respectively should also have a &quot;format&quot; attribute
to avoid the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC also warns about function
definitions that might be candidates for &quot;format&quot;
attributes. Again, these are only possible candidates. GCC
guesses that &quot;format&quot; <br>
attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls
a function like &quot;vprintf&quot; or &quot;vscanf&quot;,
but this might not always be the case, and some functions
for which <br>
&quot;format&quot; attributes are appropriate may not be
detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-final-types <br>
Warn about types with virtual methods where code quality
would be improved if the type were declared with the C++11
&quot;final&quot; specifier, or, if possible, declared in an
<br>
anonymous namespace. This allows GCC to more aggressively
devirtualize the polymorphic calls. This warning is more
effective with link time optimization, where the <br>
information about the class hierarchy graph is more
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-final-methods <br>
Warn about virtual methods where code quality would be
improved if the method were declared with the C++11
&quot;final&quot; specifier, or, if possible, its type were
declared in an <br>
anonymous namespace or with the &quot;final&quot; specifier.
This warning is more effective with link-time optimization,
where the information about the class hierarchy graph is
more <br>
complete. It is recommended to first consider suggestions of
-Wsuggest-final-types and then rebuild with new
annotations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsuggest-override <br>
Warn about overriding virtual functions that are not marked
with the override keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Walloc-zero <br>
Warn about calls to allocation functions decorated with
attribute &quot;alloc_size&quot; that specify zero bytes,
including those to the built-in forms of the functions <br>
&quot;aligned_alloc&quot;, &quot;alloca&quot;,
&quot;calloc&quot;, &quot;malloc&quot;, and
&quot;realloc&quot;. Because the behavior of these functions
when called with a zero size differs among implementations
(and in the <br>
case of &quot;realloc&quot; has been deprecated) relying on
it may result in subtle portability bugs and should be
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Walloc-size-larger-than=n <br>
Warn about calls to functions decorated with attribute
&quot;alloc_size&quot; that attempt to allocate objects
larger than the specified number of bytes, or where the
result of the <br>
size computation in an integer type with infinite precision
would exceed &quot;SIZE_MAX / 2&quot;. The option argument n
may end in one of the standard suffixes designating a
multiple <br>
of bytes such as &quot;kB&quot; and &quot;KiB&quot; for
kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively, &quot;MB&quot; and
&quot;MiB&quot; for megabyte and mebibyte, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Walloca <br>
This option warns on all uses of &quot;alloca&quot; in the
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Walloca-larger-than=n <br>
This option warns on calls to &quot;alloca&quot; that are
not bounded by a controlling predicate limiting its argument
of integer type to at most n bytes, or calls to
&quot;alloca&quot; where <br>
the bound is unknown. Arguments of non-integer types are
considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained
to the expected range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a bounded case of
&quot;alloca&quot; could be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void func (size_t n) <br>
{ <br>
void *p; <br>
if (n &lt;= 1000) <br>
p = alloca (n); <br>
else <br>
p = malloc (n); <br>
f (p); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example, passing
&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=1000&quot; would not issue a
warning because the call to &quot;alloca&quot; is known to
be at most 1000 bytes. However, if <br>
&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=500&quot; were passed, the
compiler would emit a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbounded uses, on the other
hand, are uses of &quot;alloca&quot; with no controlling
predicate constraining its integer argument. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void func () <br>
{ <br>
void *p = alloca (n); <br>
f (p); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=500&quot; were passed, the above
would trigger a warning, but this time because of the lack
of bounds checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, that even seemingly
correct code involving signed integers could cause a
warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void func (signed int n) <br>
{ <br>
if (n &lt; 500) <br>
{ <br>
p = alloca (n); <br>
f (p); <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above example, n could be
negative, causing a larger than expected argument to be
implicitly cast into the &quot;alloca&quot; call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also warns when
&quot;alloca&quot; is used in a loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is not enabled by
-Wall, and is only active when -ftree-vrp is active (default
for -O2 and above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
-Wvla-larger-than=n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Warray-bounds <br>
-Warray-bounds=n <br>
This option is only active when -ftree-vrp is active
(default for -O2 and above). It warns about subscripts to
arrays that are always out of bounds. This warning is
enabled <br>
by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Warray-bounds=1 <br>
This is the warning level of -Warray-bounds and is enabled
by -Wall; higher levels are not, and must be explicitly
requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Warray-bounds=2 <br>
This warning level also warns about out of bounds access for
arrays at the end of a struct and for arrays accessed
through pointers. This warning level may give a larger <br>
number of false positives and is deactivated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wbool-compare <br>
Warn about boolean expression compared with an integer value
different from &quot;true&quot;/&quot;false&quot;. For
instance, the following comparison is always false:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int n = 5; <br>
... <br>
if ((n &gt; 1) == 2) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wbool-operation <br>
Warn about suspicious operations on expressions of a boolean
type. For instance, bitwise negation of a boolean is very
likely a bug in the program. For C, this warning also <br>
warns about incrementing or decrementing a boolean, which
rarely makes sense. (In C++, decrementing a boolean is
always invalid. Incrementing a boolean is invalid in C++1z,
<br>
and deprecated otherwise.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wduplicated-branches <br>
Warn when an if-else has identical branches. This warning
detects cases like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (p != NULL) <br>
return 0; <br>
else <br>
return 0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It doesn&rsquo;t warn when both
branches contain just a null statement. This warning also
warn for conditional operators:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int i = x ? *p : *p;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wduplicated-cond <br>
Warn about duplicated conditions in an if-else-if chain. For
instance, warn for the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }
<br>
else if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wframe-address <br>
Warn when the __builtin_frame_address or
__builtin_return_address is called with an argument greater
than 0. Such calls may return indeterminate values or crash
the program. <br>
The warning is included in -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-discarded-qualifiers (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Do not warn if type qualifiers on pointers are being
discarded. Typically, the compiler warns if a &quot;const
char *&quot; variable is passed to a function that takes a
&quot;char *&quot; <br>
parameter. This option can be used to suppress such a
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-discarded-array-qualifiers
(C and Objective-C only) <br>
Do not warn if type qualifiers on arrays which are pointer
targets are being discarded. Typically, the compiler warns
if a &quot;const int (*)[]&quot; variable is passed to a
function <br>
that takes a &quot;int (*)[]&quot; parameter. This option
can be used to suppress such a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-incompatible-pointer-types
(C and Objective-C only) <br>
Do not warn when there is a conversion between pointers that
have incompatible types. This warning is for cases not
covered by -Wno-pointer-sign, which warns for pointer <br>
argument passing or assignment with different
signedness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-int-conversion (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Do not warn about incompatible integer to pointer and
pointer to integer conversions. This warning is about
implicit conversions; for explicit conversions the warnings
<br>
-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast and -Wno-pointer-to-int-cast may be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-div-by-zero <br>
Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.
Floating-point division by zero is not warned about, as it
can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and
NaNs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsystem-headers <br>
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header
files. Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed,
on the assumption that they usually do not indicate <br>
real problems and would only make the compiler output harder
to read. Using this command-line option tells GCC to emit
warnings from system headers as if they occurred in <br>
user code. However, note that using -Wall in conjunction
with this option does not warn about unknown pragmas in
system headers---for that, -Wunknown-pragmas must also be
<br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtautological-compare <br>
Warn if a self-comparison always evaluates to true or false.
This warning detects various mistakes such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int i = 1; <br>
... <br>
if (i &gt; i) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtrampolines <br>
Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested
functions. A trampoline is a small piece of data or code
that is created at run time on the stack when the address of
<br>
a nested function is taken, and is used to call the nested
function indirectly. For some targets, it is made up of data
only and thus requires no special treatment. But, <br>
for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires
the stack to be made executable in order for the program to
work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wfloat-equal <br>
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality
comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea behind this is that
sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider
floating-point values as approximations to infinitely
precise real numbers. If you <br>
are doing this, then you need to compute (by analyzing the
code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely maximum
error that the computation introduces, and allow for it <br>
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but
that&rsquo;s a different problem). In particular, instead of
testing for equality, you should check to see whether the
<br>
two values have ranges that overlap; and this is done with
the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C
only) <br>
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
traditional and ISO C. Also warn about ISO C constructs that
have no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic <br>
constructs that should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Macro parameters that appear
within string literals in the macro body. In traditional C
macro replacement takes place within string literals, but in
ISO C it does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* In traditional C, some
preprocessor directives did not exist. Traditional
preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive if
the # appeared in column 1 on the <br>
line. Therefore -Wtraditional warns about directives that
traditional C understands but ignores because the # does not
appear as the first character on the line. It <br>
also suggests you hide directives like &quot;#pragma&quot;
not understood by traditional C by indenting them. Some
traditional implementations do not recognize
&quot;#elif&quot;, so this <br>
option suggests avoiding it altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A function-like macro that
appears without arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The unary plus operator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The U integer constant suffix,
or the F or L floating-point constant suffixes. (Traditional
C does support the L suffix on integer constants.) Note,
these suffixes <br>
appear in macros defined in the system headers of most
modern systems, e.g. the _MIN/_MAX macros in
&quot;&lt;limits.h&gt;&quot;. Use of these macros in user
code might normally lead to <br>
spurious warnings, however GCC&rsquo;s integrated
preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A function declared external
in one block and then used after the end of the block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A &quot;switch&quot; statement
has an operand of type &quot;long&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A non-&quot;static&quot;
function declaration follows a &quot;static&quot; one. This
construct is not accepted by some traditional C
compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The ISO type of an integer
constant has a different width or signedness from its
traditional type. This warning is only issued if the base of
the constant is ten. I.e. <br>
hexadecimal or octal values, which typically represent bit
patterns, are not warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Usage of ISO string
concatenation is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Initialization of automatic
aggregates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Identifier conflicts with
labels. Traditional C lacks a separate namespace for
labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Initialization of unions. If
the initializer is zero, the warning is omitted. This is
done under the assumption that the zero initializer in user
code appears <br>
conditioned on e.g. &quot;__STDC__&quot; to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to
zero in the traditional C case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Conversions by prototypes
between fixed/floating-point values and vice versa. The
absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems. <br>
This is a subset of the possible conversion warnings; for
the full set use -Wtraditional-conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Use of ISO C style function
definitions. This warning intentionally is not issued for
prototype declarations or variadic functions because these
ISO C features appear in <br>
your code when using libiberty&rsquo;s traditional C
compatibility macros, &quot;PARAMS&quot; and
&quot;VPARAMS&quot;. This warning is also bypassed for
nested functions because that feature is <br>
already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to traditional
C compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtraditional-conversion (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is
different from what would happen to the same argument in the
absence of a prototype. This includes conversions of fixed
<br>
point to floating and vice versa, and conversions changing
the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument except
when the same as the default promotion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a
block. This construct, known from C++, was introduced with
ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC. It is not <br>
supported by ISO C90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshadow <br>
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows
another variable, parameter, type, class member (in C++), or
instance variable (in Objective-C) or whenever a <br>
built-in function is shadowed. Note that in C++, the
compiler warns if a local variable shadows an explicit
typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum. Same as
<br>
-Wshadow=global.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-shadow-ivar (Objective-C
only) <br>
Do not warn whenever a local variable shadows an instance
variable in an Objective-C method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshadow=global <br>
The default for -Wshadow. Warns for any (global)
shadowing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshadow=local <br>
Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or
parameter. This warning is enabled by -Wshadow=global.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wshadow=compatible-local <br>
Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or
parameter whose type is compatible with that of the
shadowing variable. In C++, type compatibility here means
the <br>
type of the shadowing variable can be converted to that of
the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag (in
addition to -Wshadow=local) is based on the idea that when a
<br>
local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it
is most likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in
the following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for (SomeIterator i =
SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i) <br>
{ <br>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) <br>
{ <br>
... <br>
} <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the two variable
&quot;i&quot; in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only -Wshadow=compatible-local will not emit a
warning. Because their types are <br>
incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one in place
of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an
error or warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in <br>
this case will not lead to undetected bugs. Use of this flag
instead of -Wshadow=local can possibly reduce the number of
warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wshadow=local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlarger-than=len <br>
Warn whenever an object of larger than len bytes is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wframe-larger-than=len <br>
Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than len
bytes. The computation done to determine the stack frame
size is approximate and not conservative. The actual <br>
requirements may be somewhat greater than len even if you do
not get a warning. In addition, any space allocated via
&quot;alloca&quot;, variable-length arrays, or related
constructs <br>
is not included by the compiler when determining whether or
not to issue a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-free-nonheap-object <br>
Do not warn when attempting to free an object that was not
allocated on the heap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstack-usage=len <br>
Warn if the stack usage of a function might be larger than
len bytes. The computation done to determine the stack usage
is conservative. Any space allocated via &quot;alloca&quot;,
<br>
variable-length arrays, or related constructs is included by
the compiler when determining whether or not to issue a
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message is in keeping with
the output of -fstack-usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the stack usage is fully
static but exceeds the specified amount, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: stack usage is 1120
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the stack usage is (partly)
dynamic but bounded, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: stack usage might be
1648 bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the stack usage is (partly)
dynamic and not bounded, it&rsquo;s:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning: stack usage might be
unbounded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations <br>
Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler
cannot assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.
With -funsafe-loop-optimizations warn if the compiler <br>
makes such assumptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pedantic-ms-format (MinGW
targets only) <br>
When used in combination with -Wformat and -pedantic without
GNU extensions, this option disables the warnings about
non-ISO &quot;printf&quot; / &quot;scanf&quot; format width
specifiers &quot;I32&quot;, <br>
&quot;I64&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; used on Windows targets,
which depend on the MS runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waligned-new <br>
Warn about a new-expression of a type that requires greater
alignment than the &quot;alignof(std::max_align_t)&quot; but
uses an allocation function without an explicit alignment
<br>
parameter. This option is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally this only warns about
global allocation functions, but -Waligned-new=all also
warns about class member allocation functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wplacement-new <br>
-Wplacement-new=n <br>
Warn about placement new expressions with undefined
behavior, such as constructing an object in a buffer that is
smaller than the type of the object. For example, the <br>
placement new expression below is diagnosed because it
attempts to construct an array of 64 integers in a buffer
only 64 bytes large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char buf [64]; <br>
new (buf) int[64];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wplacement-new=1 <br>
This is the default warning level of -Wplacement-new. At
this level the warning is not issued for some strictly
undefined constructs that GCC allows as extensions for <br>
compatibility with legacy code. For example, the following
&quot;new&quot; expression is not diagnosed at this level
even though it has undefined behavior according to the C++
<br>
standard because it writes past the end of the one-element
array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct S { int n, a[1]; }; <br>
S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 31 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);
<br>
new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wplacement-new=2 <br>
At this level, in addition to diagnosing all the same
constructs as at level 1, a diagnostic is also issued for
placement new expressions that construct an object in the
<br>
last member of structure whose type is an array of a single
element and whose size is less than the size of the object
being constructed. While the previous example <br>
would be diagnosed, the following construct makes use of the
flexible member array extension to avoid the warning at
level 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct S { int n, a[]; }; <br>
S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 32 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);
<br>
new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpointer-arith <br>
Warn about anything that depends on the &quot;size of&quot;
a function type or of &quot;void&quot;. GNU C assigns these
types a size of 1, for convenience in calculations with
&quot;void *&quot; pointers <br>
and pointers to functions. In C++, warn also when an
arithmetic operation involves &quot;NULL&quot;. This warning
is also enabled by -Wpedantic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpointer-compare <br>
Warn if a pointer is compared with a zero character
constant. This usually means that the pointer was meant to
be dereferenced. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">const char *p = foo (); <br>
if (p == &rsquo; &rsquo;) <br>
return 42;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the code above is
invalid in C++11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtype-limits <br>
Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to
the limited range of the data type, but do not warn for
constant expressions. For example, warn if an unsigned <br>
variable is compared against zero with &quot;&lt;&quot; or
&quot;&gt;=&quot;. This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcomment <br>
-Wcomments <br>
Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in a /*
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a //
comment. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wtrigraphs <br>
Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the
meaning of the program. Trigraphs within comments are not
warned about, except those that would form escaped <br>
newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is implied by -Wall.
If -Wall is not given, this option is still enabled unless
trigraphs are enabled. To get trigraph conversion without
warnings, but get the <br>
other -Wall warnings, use -trigraphs -Wall
-Wno-trigraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wundef <br>
Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an
&quot;#if&quot; directive. Such identifiers are replaced
with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wexpansion-to-defined <br>
Warn whenever defined is encountered in the expansion of a
macro (including the case where the macro is expanded by an
#if directive). Such usage is not portable. This <br>
warning is also enabled by -Wpedantic and -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused-macros <br>
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.
A macro is used if it is expanded or tested for existence at
least once. The preprocessor also warns if the <br>
macro has not been used at the time it is redefined or
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Built-in macros, macros defined
on the command line, and macros defined in include files are
not warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: If a macro is actually
used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then the
preprocessor reports it as unused. To avoid the warning in
such a case, you might <br>
improve the scope of the macro&rsquo;s definition by, for
example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something
like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if defined
the_macro_causing_the_warning <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-endif-labels <br>
Do not warn whenever an &quot;#else&quot; or an
&quot;#endif&quot; are followed by text. This sometimes
happens in older programs with code of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if FOO <br>
... <br>
#else FOO <br>
... <br>
#endif FOO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second and third
&quot;FOO&quot; should be in comments. This warning is on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wbad-function-cast (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn when a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if a call to a function returning an
integer type is cast to a pointer type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc90-c99-compat (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn about features not present in ISO C90, but present in
ISO C99. For instance, warn about use of variable length
arrays, &quot;long long&quot; type, &quot;bool&quot; type,
compound literals, <br>
designated initializers, and so on. This option is
independent of the standards mode. Warnings are disabled in
the expression that follows &quot;__extension__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc99-c11-compat (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn about features not present in ISO C99, but present in
ISO C11. For instance, warn about use of anonymous
structures and unions, &quot;_Atomic&quot; type qualifier,
<br>
&quot;_Thread_local&quot; storage-class specifier,
&quot;_Alignas&quot; specifier, &quot;Alignof&quot;
operator, &quot;_Generic&quot; keyword, and so on. This
option is independent of the standards mode. Warnings <br>
are disabled in the expression that follows
&quot;__extension__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc++-compat (C and Objective-C
only) <br>
Warn about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common
subset of ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit
conversion from &quot;void *&quot; to a pointer to
non-&quot;void&quot; type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc++11-compat (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
C++ 1998 and ISO C++ 2011, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998
that are keywords in ISO C++ 2011. This warning <br>
turns on -Wnarrowing and is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc++14-compat (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
C++ 2011 and ISO C++ 2014. This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wc++1z-compat (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
C++ 2014 and the forthoming ISO C++ 2017(?). This warning is
enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcast-qual <br>
Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type
qualifier from the target type. For example, warn if a
&quot;const char *&quot; is cast to an ordinary &quot;char
*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also warn when making a cast
that introduces a type qualifier in an unsafe way. For
example, casting &quot;char **&quot; to &quot;const char
**&quot; is unsafe, as in this example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* p is char ** value. */ <br>
const char **q = (const char **) p; <br>
/* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK. */
<br>
*q = &quot;string&quot;; <br>
/* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory. */ <br>
**p = &rsquo;b&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wcast-align <br>
Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required
alignment of the target is increased. For example, warn if a
&quot;char *&quot; is cast to an &quot;int *&quot; on
machines where integers <br>
can only be accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wwrite-strings <br>
When compiling C, give string constants the type &quot;const
char[length]&quot; so that copying the address of one into a
non-&quot;const&quot; &quot;char *&quot; pointer produces a
warning. These <br>
warnings help you find at compile time code that can try to
write into a string constant, but only if you have been very
careful about using &quot;const&quot; in declarations and
<br>
prototypes. Otherwise, it is just a nuisance. This is why we
did not make -Wall request these warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling C++, warn about
the deprecated conversion from string literals to &quot;char
*&quot;. This warning is enabled by default for C++
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wclobbered <br>
Warn for variables that might be changed by
&quot;longjmp&quot; or &quot;vfork&quot;. This warning is
also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wconditionally-supported (C++
and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn for conditionally-supported (C++11 [intro.defs])
constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wconversion <br>
Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This
includes conversions between real and integer, like
&quot;abs (x)&quot; when &quot;x&quot; is
&quot;double&quot;; conversions between signed and <br>
unsigned, like &quot;unsigned ui = -1&quot;; and conversions
to smaller types, like &quot;sqrtf (M_PI)&quot;. Do not warn
for explicit casts like &quot;abs ((int) x)&quot; and
&quot;ui = (unsigned) -1&quot;, or if <br>
the value is not changed by the conversion like in &quot;abs
(2.0)&quot;. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers can be disabled by using <br>
-Wno-sign-conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For C++, also warn for confusing
overload resolution for user-defined conversions; and
conversions that never use a type conversion operator:
conversions to &quot;void&quot;, the same <br>
type, a base class or a reference to them. Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers are
disabled by default in C++ unless -Wsign-conversion is <br>
explicitly enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-conversion-null (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Do not warn for conversions between &quot;NULL&quot; and
non-pointer types. -Wconversion-null is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant
(C++ and Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when a literal 0 is used as null pointer constant. This
can be useful to facilitate the conversion to
&quot;nullptr&quot; in C++11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsubobject-linkage (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses
the anonymous namespace or depends on a type with no
linkage. If a type A depends on a type B with no or internal
<br>
linkage, defining it in multiple translation units would be
an ODR violation because the meaning of B is different in
each translation unit. If A only appears in a single <br>
translation unit, the best way to silence the warning is to
give it internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous
namespace as well. The compiler doesn&rsquo;t give this
warning <br>
for types defined in the main .C file, as those are unlikely
to have multiple definitions. -Wsubobject-linkage is enabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdangling-else <br>
Warn about constructions where there may be confusion to
which &quot;if&quot; statement an &quot;else&quot; branch
belongs. Here is an example of such a case:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
if (a) <br>
if (b) <br>
foo (); <br>
else <br>
bar (); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C/C++, every &quot;else&quot;
branch belongs to the innermost possible &quot;if&quot;
statement, which in this example is &quot;if (b)&quot;. This
is often not what the programmer expected, as <br>
illustrated in the above example by indentation the
programmer chose. When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag is specified.
To <br>
eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the
innermost &quot;if&quot; statement so there is no way the
&quot;else&quot; can belong to the enclosing &quot;if&quot;.
The resulting code looks like <br>
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
if (a) <br>
{ <br>
if (b) <br>
foo (); <br>
else <br>
bar (); <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wparentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdate-time <br>
Warn when macros &quot;__TIME__&quot;, &quot;__DATE__&quot;
or &quot;__TIMESTAMP__&quot; are encountered as they might
prevent bit-wise-identical reproducible compilations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdelete-incomplete (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when deleting a pointer to incomplete type, which may
cause undefined behavior at runtime. This warning is enabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wuseless-cast (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wempty-body <br>
Warn if an empty body occurs in an &quot;if&quot;,
&quot;else&quot; or &quot;do while&quot; statement. This
warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wenum-compare <br>
Warn about a comparison between values of different
enumerated types. In C++ enumerated type mismatches in
conditional expressions are also diagnosed and the warning
is <br>
enabled by default. In C this warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wjump-misses-init (C,
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a &quot;goto&quot; statement or a &quot;switch&quot;
statement jumps forward across the initialization of a
variable, or jumps backward to a label after the variable
has been <br>
initialized. This only warns about variables that are
initialized when they are declared. This warning is only
supported for C and Objective-C; in C++ this sort of branch
<br>
is an error in any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wjump-misses-init is included
in -Wc++-compat. It can be disabled with the
-Wno-jump-misses-init option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsign-compare <br>
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values
could produce an incorrect result when the signed value is
converted to unsigned. In C++, this warning is also <br>
enabled by -Wall. In C, it is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsign-conversion <br>
Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an
integer value, like assigning a signed integer expression to
an unsigned integer variable. An explicit cast <br>
silences the warning. In C, this option is enabled also by
-Wconversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wfloat-conversion <br>
Warn for implicit conversions that reduce the precision of a
real value. This includes conversions from real to integer,
and from higher precision real to lower precision <br>
real values. This option is also enabled by
-Wconversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-scalar-storage-order <br>
Do not warn on suspicious constructs involving reverse
scalar storage order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsized-deallocation (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Warn about a definition of an unsized deallocation
function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void operator delete (void *)
noexcept; <br>
void operator delete[] (void *) noexcept;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">without a definition of the
corresponding sized deallocation function</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void operator delete (void *,
std::size_t) noexcept; <br>
void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or vice versa. Enabled by
-Wextra along with -fsized-deallocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess <br>
Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and
memory built-in functions if the argument uses
&quot;sizeof&quot;. This warning warns e.g. about
&quot;memset (ptr, 0, sizeof <br>
(ptr));&quot; if &quot;ptr&quot; is not an array, but a
pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about &quot;memcpy
(&amp;foo, ptr, sizeof (&amp;foo));&quot;. This warning is
enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wsizeof-array-argument <br>
Warn when the &quot;sizeof&quot; operator is applied to a
parameter that is declared as an array in a function
definition. This warning is enabled by default for C and C++
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmemset-elt-size <br>
Warn for suspicious calls to the &quot;memset&quot; built-in
function, if the first argument references an array, and the
third argument is a number equal to the number of elements,
<br>
but not equal to the size of the array in memory. This
indicates that the user has omitted a multiplication by the
element size. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmemset-transposed-args <br>
Warn for suspicious calls to the &quot;memset&quot; built-in
function, if the second argument is not zero and the third
argument is zero. This warns e.g.@ about &quot;memset (buf,
sizeof <br>
buf, 0)&quot; where most probably &quot;memset (buf, 0,
sizeof buf)&quot; was meant instead. The diagnostics is only
emitted if the third argument is literal zero. If it is some
<br>
expression that is folded to zero, a cast of zero to some
type, etc., it is far less likely that the user has
mistakenly exchanged the arguments and no warning is
emitted. <br>
This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waddress <br>
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These
include using the address of a function in a conditional
expression, such as &quot;void func(void); if (func)&quot;,
and <br>
comparisons against the memory address of a string literal,
such as &quot;if (x == &quot;abc&quot;)&quot;. Such uses
typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a
function always <br>
evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a
function call; and comparisons against string literals <br>
result in unspecified behavior and are not portable in C, so
they usually indicate that the programmer intended to use
&quot;strcmp&quot;. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlogical-op <br>
Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in
expressions. This includes using logical operators in
contexts where a bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.
Also <br>
warns when the operands of a logical operator are the
same:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extern int a; <br>
if (a &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; a &lt; 0) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlogical-not-parentheses <br>
Warn about logical not used on the left hand side operand of
a comparison. This option does not warn if the right operand
is considered to be a boolean expression. Its <br>
purpose is to detect suspicious code like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int a; <br>
... <br>
if (!a &gt; 1) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to suppress the
warning by wrapping the LHS into parentheses:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ((!a) &gt; 1) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
-Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Waggregate-return <br>
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are
defined or called. (In languages where you can return an
array, this also elicits a warning.)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations
<br>
Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the
compiler detects undefined behavior in some statement during
one or more of the iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-attributes <br>
Do not warn if an unexpected &quot;__attribute__&quot; is
used, such as unrecognized attributes, function attributes
applied to variables, etc. This does not stop errors for
incorrect <br>
use of supported attributes.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch
<br>
Warn if a built-in function is declared with the wrong
signature. This warning is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined
<br>
Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined. This
suppresses warnings for redefinition of
&quot;__TIMESTAMP__&quot;, &quot;__TIME__&quot;,
&quot;__DATE__&quot;, &quot;__FILE__&quot;, and
&quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstrict-prototypes (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying
the argument types. (An old-style function definition is
permitted without a warning if preceded by a <br>
declaration that specifies the argument types.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-style-declaration (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in
a declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers
like &quot;static&quot; are not the first things in a <br>
declaration. This warning is also enabled by -Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wold-style-definition (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an old-style function definition is used. A warning
is given even if there is a previous prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in
K&amp;R-style functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void foo(bar) { }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is also enabled by
-Wextra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-prototypes (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
prototype declaration. This warning is issued even if the
definition itself provides a prototype. Use this option to
<br>
detect global functions that do not have a matching
prototype declaration in a header file. This option is not
valid for C++ because all function declarations provide <br>
prototypes and a non-matching declaration declares an
overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.
Use -Wmissing-declarations to detect missing declarations in
<br>
C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-declarations <br>
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
declaration. Do so even if the definition itself provides a
prototype. Use this option to detect global functions <br>
that are not declared in header files. In C, no warnings are
issued for functions with previous non-prototype
declarations; use -Wmissing-prototypes to detect missing
<br>
prototypes. In C++, no warnings are issued for function
templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in
anonymous namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wmissing-field-initializers
<br>
Warn if a structure&rsquo;s initializer has some fields
missing. For example, the following code causes such a
warning, because &quot;x.h&quot; is implicitly zero:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct s { int f, g, h; }; <br>
struct s x = { 3, 4 };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not warn about
designated initializers, so the following modification does
not trigger a warning:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct s { int f, g, h; }; <br>
struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In C++ this option does not warn
either about the empty { } initializer, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct s { int f, g, h; }; <br>
s x = { };</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is included in
-Wextra. To get other -Wextra warnings without this one, use
-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-multichar <br>
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant
(&rsquo;FOOF&rsquo;) is used. Usually they indicate a typo
in the user&rsquo;s code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be <br>
used in portable code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnormalized=[none|id|nfc|nfkc]
<br>
In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they
are different sequences of characters. However, sometimes
when characters outside the basic ASCII character set <br>
are used, you can have two different character sequences
that look the same. To avoid confusion, the ISO 10646
standard sets out some normalization rules which when
applied <br>
ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence. GCC can warn you if you are using
identifiers that have not been normalized; this option <br>
controls that warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four levels of warning
supported by GCC. The default is -Wnormalized=nfc, which
warns about any identifier that is not in the ISO 10646
&quot;C&quot; normalized form, NFC. <br>
NFC is the recommended form for most uses. It is equivalent
to -Wnormalized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, there are some
characters allowed in identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that,
when turned into NFC, are not allowed in identifiers. That
is, there&rsquo;s no way to <br>
use these symbols in portable ISO C or C++ and have all your
identifiers in NFC. -Wnormalized=id suppresses the warning
for these characters. It is hoped that future <br>
versions of the standards involved will correct this, which
is why this option is not the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can switch the warning off
for all characters by writing -Wnormalized=none or
-Wno-normalized. You should only do this if you are using
some other normalization scheme <br>
(like &quot;D&quot;), because otherwise you can easily
create bugs that are literally impossible to see.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some characters in ISO 10646
have distinct meanings but look identical in some fonts or
display methodologies, especially once formatting has been
applied. For instance <br>
&quot;207F&quot;, &quot;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL LETTER
N&quot;, displays just like a regular &quot;n&quot; that has
been placed in a superscript. ISO 10646 defines the NFKC
normalization scheme to <br>
convert all these into a standard form as well, and GCC
warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
-Wnormalized=nfkc. This warning is comparable to warning
about every <br>
identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but
may be useful as a local coding convention if the <br>
programming environment cannot be fixed to display these
characters distinctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-deprecated <br>
Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-deprecated-declarations
<br>
Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types
marked as deprecated by using the &quot;deprecated&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-overflow <br>
Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-odr <br>
Warn about One Definition Rule violations during link-time
optimization. Requires -flto-odr-type-merging to be enabled.
Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wopenmp-simd <br>
Warn if the vectorizer cost model overrides the OpenMP or
the Cilk Plus simd directive set by user. The
-fsimd-cost-model=unlimited option can be used to relax the
cost <br>
model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverride-init (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an initialized field without side effects is
overridden when using designated initializers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is included in
-Wextra. To get other -Wextra warnings without this one, use
-Wextra -Wno-override-init.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverride-init-side-effects (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an initialized field with side effects is overridden
when using designated initializers. This warning is enabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpacked <br>
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the
packed attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the
structure. Such structures may be mis-aligned for <br>
little benefit. For instance, in this code, the variable
&quot;f.x&quot; in &quot;struct bar&quot; is misaligned even
though &quot;struct bar&quot; does not itself have the
packed attribute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct foo { <br>
int x; <br>
char a, b, c, d; <br>
} __attribute__((packed)); <br>
struct bar { <br>
char z; <br>
struct foo f; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpacked-bitfield-compat <br>
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the
&quot;packed&quot; attribute on bit-fields of type
&quot;char&quot;. This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but the
change can lead to differences in the <br>
structure layout. GCC informs you when the offset of such a
field has changed in GCC 4.4. For example there is no longer
a 4-bit padding between field &quot;a&quot; and
&quot;b&quot; in this <br>
structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct foo <br>
{ <br>
char a:4; <br>
char b:8; <br>
} __attribute__ ((packed));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is enabled by
default. Use -Wno-packed-bitfield-compat to disable this
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpadded <br>
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align
an element of the structure or to align the whole structure.
Sometimes when this happens it is possible to <br>
rearrange the fields of the structure to reduce the padding
and so make the structure smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wredundant-decls <br>
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same
scope, even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and
changes nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wrestrict <br>
Warn when an argument passed to a restrict-qualified
parameter aliases with another argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wnested-externs (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn if an &quot;extern&quot; declaration is encountered
within a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor
<br>
Suppress warnings about use of C++11 inheriting constructors
when the base class inherited from has a C variadic
constructor; the warning is on by default because the <br>
ellipsis is not inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winline <br>
Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be
inlined. Even with this option, the compiler does not warn
about failures to inline functions declared in system <br>
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler uses a variety of
heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function.
For example, the compiler takes into account the size of the
function being <br>
inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been
done in the current function. Therefore, seemingly
insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
<br>
warnings produced by -Winline to appear or disappear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-invalid-offsetof (C++ and
Objective-C++ only) <br>
Suppress warnings from applying the &quot;offsetof&quot;
macro to a non-POD type. According to the 2014 ISO C++
standard, applying &quot;offsetof&quot; to a
non-standard-layout type is <br>
undefined. In existing C++ implementations, however,
&quot;offsetof&quot; typically gives meaningful results.
This flag is for users who are aware that they are writing
nonportable <br>
code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the warning
about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The restrictions on
&quot;offsetof&quot; may be relaxed in a future version of
the C++ standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wint-in-bool-context <br>
Warn for suspicious use of integer values where boolean
values are expected, such as conditional expressions (?:)
using non-boolean integer constants in boolean context, like
<br>
&quot;if (a &lt;= b ? 2 : 3)&quot;. Or left shifting of
signed integers in boolean context, like &quot;for (a = 0; 1
&lt;&lt; a; a++);&quot;. Likewise for all kinds of
multiplications regardless of the <br>
data type. This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast <br>
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer
of a different size. In C++, casting to a pointer type of
smaller size is an error. Wint-to-pointer-cast is enabled
<br>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer
type of a different size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Winvalid-pch <br>
Warn if a precompiled header is found in the search path but
cannot be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlong-long <br>
Warn if &quot;long long&quot; type is used. This is enabled
by either -Wpedantic or -Wtraditional in ISO C90 and C++98
modes. To inhibit the warning messages, use
-Wno-long-long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvariadic-macros <br>
Warn if variadic macros are used in ISO C90 mode, or if the
GNU alternate syntax is used in ISO C99 mode. This is
enabled by either -Wpedantic or -Wtraditional. To inhibit
<br>
the warning messages, use -Wno-variadic-macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvarargs <br>
Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle
variable arguments like &quot;va_start&quot;. This is
default. To inhibit the warning messages, use
-Wno-varargs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvector-operation-performance
<br>
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD
capabilities of the architecture. Mainly useful for the
performance tuning. Vector operation can be implemented <br>
&quot;piecewise&quot;, which means that the scalar operation
is performed on every vector element; &quot;in
parallel&quot;, which means that the vector operation is
implemented using scalars of <br>
wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and &quot;as a single scalar&quot;, which means that vector
fits into a scalar type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-virtual-move-assign <br>
Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with
a non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator. This is
dangerous because if the virtual base is reachable along
<br>
more than one path, it is moved multiple times, which can
mean both objects end up in the moved-from state. If the
move assignment operator is written to avoid moving from a
<br>
moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvla <br>
Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.
-Wno-vla prevents the -Wpedantic warning of the
variable-length array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvla-larger-than=n <br>
If this option is used, the compiler will warn on uses of
variable-length arrays where the size is either unbounded,
or bounded by an argument that can be larger than n <br>
bytes. This is similar to how -Walloca-larger-than=n works,
but with variable-length arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that GCC may optimize small
variable-length arrays of a known value into plain arrays,
so this warning may not get triggered for such arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This warning is not enabled by
-Wall, and is only active when -ftree-vrp is active (default
for -O2 and above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
-Walloca-larger-than=n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wvolatile-register-var <br>
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile. The
volatile modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that
may eliminate reads and/or writes to register variables.
<br>
This warning is enabled by -Wall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wdisabled-optimization <br>
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled. This
warning does not generally indicate that there is anything
wrong with your code; it merely indicates that GCC&rsquo;s
<br>
optimizers are unable to handle the code effectively. Often,
the problem is that your code is too big or too complex; GCC
refuses to optimize programs when the optimization <br>
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wpointer-sign (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with
different signedness. This option is only supported for C
and Objective-C. It is implied by -Wall and by -Wpedantic,
<br>
which can be disabled with -Wno-pointer-sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wstack-protector <br>
This option is only active when -fstack-protector is active.
It warns about functions that are not protected against
stack smashing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Woverlength-strings <br>
Warn about string constants that are longer than the
&quot;minimum maximum&quot; length specified in the C
standard. Modern compilers generally allow string constants
that are much <br>
longer than the standard&rsquo;s minimum limit, but very
portable programs should avoid using longer strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The limit applies after string
constant concatenation, and does not count the trailing NUL.
In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in C99, it was raised
to 4095. C++98 does <br>
not specify a normative minimum maximum, so we do not
diagnose overlength strings in C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is implied by
-Wpedantic, and can be disabled with
-Wno-overlength-strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C
and Objective-C only) <br>
Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix. When used together with -Wsystem-headers it warns
about such constants in system header files. This <br>
can be useful when preparing code to use with the
&quot;FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64&quot; pragma from the decimal
floating-point extension to C99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-designated-init (C and
Objective-C only) <br>
Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to
initialize a structure that has been marked with the
&quot;designated_init&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Whsa <br>
Issue a warning when HSAIL cannot be emitted for the
compiled function or OpenMP construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Debugging Your
Program <br>
To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger,
in almost all cases you need only to add -g to your other
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC allows you to use -g with
-O. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist at
all; flow of control may <br>
briefly move where you did not expect it; some statements
may not be executed because they compute constant results or
their values are already at hand; some statements may <br>
execute in different places because they have been moved out
of loops. Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized
output. This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for
<br>
programs that might have bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not using some other
optimization option, consider using -Og with -g. With no -O
option at all, some compiler passes that collect information
useful for debugging do <br>
not run at all, so that -Og may result in a better debugging
experience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Produce debugging information
in the operating system&rsquo;s native format (stabs, COFF,
XCOFF, or DWARF). GDB can work with this debugging
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On most systems that use stabs
format, -g enables use of extra debugging information that
only GDB can use; this extra information makes debugging
work better in GDB but <br>
probably makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the
program. If you want to control for certain whether to
generate the extra information, use -gstabs+, -gstabs, <br>
-gxcoff+, -gxcoff, or -gvms (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ggdb <br>
Produce debugging information for use by GDB. This means to
use the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or
the native format if neither of those are supported), <br>
including GDB extensions if at all possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gdwarf <br>
-gdwarf-version <br>
Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
supported). The value of version may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5;
the default version for most targets is 4. DWARF <br>
Version 5 is only experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that with DWARF Version 2,
some ports require and always use some non-conflicting DWARF
3 extensions in the unwind tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 4 may require GDB 7.0
and -fvar-tracking-assignments for maximum benefit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC no longer supports DWARF
Version 1, which is substantially different than Version 2
and later. For historical reasons, some other DWARF-related
options (including <br>
-feliminate-dwarf2-dups and -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm) retain a
reference to DWARF Version 2 in their names, but apply to
all currently-supported versions of DWARF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstabs <br>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
supported), without GDB extensions. This is the format used
by DBX on most BSD systems. On MIPS, Alpha and System <br>
V Release 4 systems this option produces stabs debugging
output that is not understood by DBX or SDB. On System V
Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU
assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstabs+ <br>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is likely <br>
to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gcoff <br>
Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
supported). This is the format used by SDB on most System V
systems prior to System V Release 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gxcoff <br>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
supported). This is the format used by the DBX debugger on
IBM RS/6000 systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gxcoff+ <br>
Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
debugger (GDB). The use of these extensions is likely <br>
to make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program,
and may cause assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS)
to fail with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gvms <br>
Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if
that is supported). This is the format used by DEBUG on
Alpha/VMS systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glevel <br>
-ggdblevel <br>
-gstabslevel <br>
-gcofflevel <br>
-gxcofflevel <br>
-gvmslevel <br>
Request debugging information and also use level to specify
how much information. The default level is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 0 produces no debug
information at all. Thus, -g0 negates -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 1 produces minimal
information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the
program that you don&rsquo;t plan to debug. This includes
descriptions of functions and external <br>
variables, and line number tables, but no information about
local variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Level 3 includes extra
information, such as all the macro definitions present in
the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you
use -g3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gdwarf does not accept a
concatenated debug level, to avoid confusion with
-gdwarf-level. Instead use an additional -glevel option to
change the debug level for DWARF.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols
<br>
Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
supported), for only symbols that are actually used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-class-debug-always <br>
Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in
only one object file, emit it in all object files using the
class. This option should be used only with <br>
debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC normally
emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as
<br>
much as a factor of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-merge-debug-strings <br>
Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the
debugging information that are identical in different object
files. Merging is not supported by all assemblers or <br>
linkers. Merging decreases the size of the debug information
in the output file at the cost of increasing link processing
time. Merging is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdebug-prefix-map=old=new <br>
When compiling files in directory old, record debugging
information describing them as in new instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvar-tracking <br>
Run variable tracking pass. It computes where variables are
stored at each position in code. Better debugging
information is then generated (if the debugging information
<br>
format supports this information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is enabled by default when
compiling with optimization (-Os, -O, -O2, ...), debugging
information (-g) and the debug info format supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvar-tracking-assignments <br>
Annotate assignments to user variables early in the
compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over
throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an
attempt to <br>
improve debug information while optimizing. Use of -gdwarf-4
is recommended along with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It can be enabled even if
var-tracking is disabled, in which case annotations are
created and maintained, but discarded at the end. By
default, this flag is enabled together <br>
with -fvar-tracking, except when selective scheduling is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gsplit-dwarf <br>
Separate as much DWARF debugging information as possible
into a separate output file with the extension .dwo. This
option allows the build system to avoid linking files with
<br>
debug information. To be useful, this option requires a
debugger capable of reading .dwo files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gpubnames <br>
Generate DWARF &quot;.debug_pubnames&quot; and
&quot;.debug_pubtypes&quot; sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ggnu-pubnames <br>
Generate &quot;.debug_pubnames&quot; and
&quot;.debug_pubtypes&quot; sections in a format suitable
for conversion into a GDB index. This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce GDB <br>
index version 7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdebug-types-section <br>
When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put
into their own &quot;.debug_types&quot; section instead of
making them part of the &quot;.debug_info&quot; section. It
is more <br>
efficient to put them in a separate comdat sections since
the linker can then remove duplicates. But not all DWARF
consumers support &quot;.debug_types&quot; sections yet and
on some <br>
objects &quot;.debug_types&quot; produces larger instead of
smaller debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grecord-gcc-switches <br>
-gno-record-gcc-switches <br>
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke
the compiler that may affect code generation to be appended
to the DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging <br>
information. The options are concatenated with spaces
separating them from each other and from the compiler
version. It is enabled by default. See also <br>
-frecord-gcc-switches for another way of storing compiler
options into the object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstrict-dwarf <br>
Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version
than selected with -gdwarf-version. On most targets using
non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard <br>
versions is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gno-strict-dwarf <br>
Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
selected with -gdwarf-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gcolumn-info <br>
-gno-column-info <br>
Emit location column information into DWARF debugging
information, rather than just file and line. This option is
disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gz[=type] <br>
Produce compressed debug sections in DWARF format, if that
is supported. If type is not given, the default type depends
on the capabilities of the assembler and linker used. <br>
type may be one of none (don&rsquo;t compress debug
sections), zlib (use zlib compression in ELF gABI format),
or zlib-gnu (use zlib compression in traditional GNU
format). If the <br>
linker doesn&rsquo;t support writing compressed debug
sections, the option is rejected. Otherwise, if the
assembler does not support them, -gz is silently ignored
when producing <br>
object files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-feliminate-dwarf2-dups <br>
Compress DWARF debugging information by eliminating
duplicated information about each symbol. This option only
makes sense when generating DWARF debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly
<br>
Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the
base name of the compilation source file matches the base
name of file in which the struct is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option substantially
reduces the size of debugging information, but at
significant potential loss in type information to the
debugger. See -femit-struct-debug-reduced <br>
for a less aggressive option. See
-femit-struct-debug-detailed for more detailed control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option works only with
DWARF debug output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-struct-debug-reduced <br>
Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the
base name of the compilation source file matches the base
name of file in which the type is defined, unless the <br>
struct is a template or defined in a system header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option significantly
reduces the size of debugging information, with some
potential loss in type information to the debugger. See
-femit-struct-debug-baseonly for a <br>
more aggressive option. See -femit-struct-debug-detailed for
more detailed control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option works only with
DWARF debug output.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-femit-struct-debug-detailed[=spec-list]
<br>
Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler
generates debug information. The intent is to reduce
duplicate struct debug information between different object
files <br>
within the same program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is a detailed
version of -femit-struct-debug-reduced and
-femit-struct-debug-baseonly, which serves for most
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A specification has the
syntax[dir:|ind:][ord:|gen:](any|sys|base|none)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional first word limits
the specification to structs that are used directly (dir:)
or used indirectly (ind:). A struct type is used directly
when it is the type of a <br>
variable, member. Indirect uses arise through pointers to
structs. That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid,
the use is indirect. An example is struct one <br>
direct; struct two * indirect;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional second word limits
the specification to ordinary structs (ord:) or generic
structs (gen:). Generic structs are a bit complicated to
explain. For C++, these are <br>
non-explicit specializations of template classes, or
non-template classes within the above. Other programming
languages have generics, but -femit-struct-debug-detailed
does <br>
not yet implement them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third word specifies the
source files for those structs for which the compiler should
emit debug information. The values none and any have the
normal meaning. The value <br>
base means that the base of name of the file in which the
type declaration appears must match the base of the name of
the main compilation file. In practice, this means that <br>
when compiling foo.c, debug information is generated for
types declared in that file and foo.h, but not other header
files. The value sys means those types satisfying base <br>
or declared in system or compiler headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to experiment to
determine the best settings for your application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm <br>
Emit DWARF unwind info as compiler generated
&quot;.eh_frame&quot; section instead of using GAS
&quot;.cfi_*&quot; directives.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types
<br>
Normally, when producing DWARF output, GCC avoids producing
debug symbol output for types that are nowhere used in the
source file being compiled. Sometimes it is useful to <br>
have GCC emit debugging information for all types declared
in a compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are
actually used in that compilation unit, for example <br>
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that
is not actually used in your program (but is declared). More
often, however, this results in a significant <br>
amount of wasted space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options That Control
Optimization <br>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without any optimization option,
the compiler&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the cost of
compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results. Statements are independent: if you <br>
stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you
can then assign a new value to any variable or change the
program counter to any other statement in the function and
<br>
get exactly the results you expect from the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turning on optimization flags
makes the compiler attempt to improve the performance and/or
code size at the expense of compilation time and possibly
the ability to debug the <br>
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler performs
optimization based on the knowledge it has of the program.
Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file
mode allows the compiler to use <br>
information gained from all of the files when compiling each
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all optimizations are
controlled directly by a flag. Only optimizations that have
a flag are listed in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most optimizations are only
enabled if an -O level is set on the command line. Otherwise
they are disabled, even if individual optimization flags are
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Depending on the target and how
GCC was configured, a slightly different set of
optimizations may be enabled at each -O level than those
listed here. You can invoke GCC with -Q <br>
--help=optimizers to find out the exact set of optimizations
that are enabled at each level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O <br>
-O1 Optimize. Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more
time, and a lot more memory for a large function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -O, the compiler tries to
reduce code size and execution time, without performing any
optimizations that take a great deal of compilation
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O turns on the following

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O also turns on
-fomit-frame-pointer on machines where doing so does not
interfere with debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O2 Optimize even more. GCC
performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not
involve a space-speed tradeoff. As compared to -O, this
option increases both compilation <br>

-freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc <br>
-freorder-blocks-and-partition -fprefetch-loop-arrays</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ofast <br>
Disregard strict standards compliance. -Ofast enables all

on -ffast-math and the Fortran-specific -fno-protect-parens
and -fstack-arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Og Optimize debugging
experience. -Og enables optimizations that do not interfere

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use multiple -O options,
with or without level numbers, the last such option is the
one that is effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options of the form -fflag

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-defer-pop <br>
Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as

after a function call, the compiler normally lets <br>
arguments accumulate on the stack for several function calls
and pops them all at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fforward-propagate <br>
Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL. The pass tries to
combine two instructions and checks if the result can be
simplified. If loop unrolling is active, two passes <br>
are performed and the second is scheduled after loop
unrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default at optimization levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffp-contract=style <br>
-ffp-contract=off disables floating-point expression
contraction. -ffp-contract=fast enables floating-point
expression contraction such as forming of fused multiply-add
<br>
operations if the target has native support for them.
-ffp-contract=on enables floating-point expression
contraction if allowed by the language standard. This is
currently <br>
not implemented and treated equal to -ffp-contract=off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ffp-contract=fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fomit-frame-pointer <br>
Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for
functions that don&rsquo;t need one. This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers; it
also makes an extra <br>
register available in many functions. It also makes
debugging impossible on some machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some machines, such as the
VAX, this flag has no effect, because the standard calling
sequence automatically handles the frame pointer and nothing
is saved by pretending <br>
it doesn&rsquo;t exist. The machine-description macro
&quot;FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED&quot; controls whether a target
machine supports this flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default setting (when not
optimizing for size) for 32-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32-bit
Darwin x86 targets is -fomit-frame-pointer. You can
configure GCC with the <br>

Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-foptimize-strlen <br>
Optimize various standard C string functions (e.g.
&quot;strlen&quot;, &quot;strchr&quot; or
&quot;strcpy&quot;) and their &quot;_FORTIFY_SOURCE&quot;
counterparts into faster alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-inline <br>
Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked
with the &quot;always_inline&quot; attribute. This is the
default when not optimizing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single functions can be exempted
from inlining by marking them with the &quot;noinline&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-small-functions <br>
Integrate functions into their callers when their body is
smaller than expected function call code (so overall size of
program gets smaller). The compiler heuristically <br>
decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way. This inlining applies to all
functions, even those not declared inline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-findirect-inlining <br>
Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known
at compile time thanks to previous inlining. This option has
any effect only when inlining itself is turned on by <br>
the -finline-functions or -finline-small-functions
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-functions <br>
Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not
declared inline. The compiler heuristically decides which
functions are worth integrating in this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all calls to a given function
are integrated, and the function is declared
&quot;static&quot;, then the function is normally not output
as assembler code in its own right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-functions-called-once
<br>
Consider all &quot;static&quot; functions called once for
inlining into their caller even if they are not marked

function is not output as assembler code in its own
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O1, -O2, -O3
and -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fearly-inlining <br>
Inline functions marked by &quot;always_inline&quot; and
functions whose body seems smaller than the function call
overhead early before doing -fprofile-generate
instrumentation and <br>
real inlining pass. Doing so makes profiling significantly
cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs having large
chains of nested wrapper functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-sra <br>
Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates,
removal of unused parameters and replacement of parameters
passed by reference by parameters passed by value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3 and
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finline-limit=n <br>
By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be
inlined. This flag allows coarse control of this limit. n is
the size of functions that can be inlined in number of <br>
pseudo instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inlining is actually controlled
by a number of parameters, which may be specified
individually by using --param name=value. The
-finline-limit=n option sets some of these <br>
parameters as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-single <br>
is set to n/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-auto <br>
is set to n/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See below for a documentation of
the individual parameters controlling inlining and for the
defaults of these parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: there may be no value to
-finline-limit that results in default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: pseudo instruction
represents, in this particular context, an abstract
measurement of function&rsquo;s size. In no way does it
represent a count of assembly instructions and <br>
as such its exact meaning might change from one release to
an another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-keep-inline-dllexport <br>
This is a more fine-grained version of
-fkeep-inline-functions, which applies only to functions
that are declared using the &quot;dllexport&quot; attribute
or declspec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fkeep-inline-functions <br>
In C, emit &quot;static&quot; functions that are declared
&quot;inline&quot; into the object file, even if the
function has been inlined into all of its callers. This
switch does not affect <br>
functions using the &quot;extern inline&quot; extension in
GNU C90. In C++, emit any and all inline functions into the
object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fkeep-static-functions <br>
Emit &quot;static&quot; functions into the object file, even
if the function is never used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fkeep-static-consts <br>
Emit variables declared &quot;static const&quot; when
optimization isn&rsquo;t turned on, even if the variables
aren&rsquo;t referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC enables this option by
default. If you want to force the compiler to check if a
variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <br>
-fno-keep-static-consts option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmerge-constants <br>
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and
floating-point constants) across compilation units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is the default for
optimized compilation if the assembler and linker support
it. Use -fno-merge-constants to inhibit this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmerge-all-constants <br>
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies
-fmerge-constants. In addition to -fmerge-constants this
considers e.g. even constant initialized arrays or
initialized constant variables with integral <br>
or floating-point types. Languages like C or C++ require
each variable, including multiple instances of the same
variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations, so
<br>
using this option results in non-conforming behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmodulo-sched <br>
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first
scheduling pass. This pass looks at innermost loops and
reorders their instructions by overlapping different <br>
iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves
<br>
Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with
register moves allowed. By setting this flag certain
anti-dependences edges are deleted, which triggers the <br>
generation of reg-moves based on the life-range analysis.
This option is effective only with -fmodulo-sched
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-branch-count-reg <br>
Avoid running a pass scanning for opportunities to use
&quot;decrement and branch&quot; instructions on a count
register instead of generating sequences of instructions
that decrement <br>
a register, compare it against zero, and then branch based
upon the result. This option is only meaningful on
architectures that support such instructions, which include
<br>
x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390. Note that the
-fno-branch-count-reg option doesn&rsquo;t remove the
decrement and branch instructions from the generated
instruction stream <br>
introduced by other optimization passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default at -O1 and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fbranch-count-reg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-function-cse <br>
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each
instruction that calls a constant function contain the
function&rsquo;s address explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option results in less
efficient code, but some strange hacks that alter the
assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ffunction-cse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss
<br>
If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts
variables that are initialized to zero into BSS. This can
save space in the resulting code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option turns off this
behavior because some programs explicitly rely on variables
going to the data section---e.g., so that the resulting
executable can find the <br>
beginning of that section and/or make assumptions based on
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fzero-initialized-in-bss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fthread-jumps <br>
Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches
to a location where another comparison subsumed by the first
is found. If so, the first branch is redirected to <br>
either the destination of the second branch or a point
immediately following it, depending on whether the condition
is known to be true or false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-wide-types <br>
When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as
&quot;long long&quot; on a 32-bit system, split the
registers apart and allocate them independently. This
normally <br>
generates better code for those types, but may make
debugging more difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcse-follow-jumps <br>
In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump
instructions when the target of the jump is not reached by
any other path. For example, when CSE encounters an <br>
&quot;if&quot; statement with an &quot;else&quot; clause,
CSE follows the jump when the condition tested is false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcse-skip-blocks <br>
This is similar to -fcse-follow-jumps, but causes CSE to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks. When CSE
encounters a simple &quot;if&quot; statement with no else
clause, <br>
-fcse-skip-blocks causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the &quot;if&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frerun-cse-after-loop <br>
Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop
optimizations are performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse <br>
Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass. This
pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When compiling a program
using computed gotos, a GCC extension, you may get better
run-time performance if you disable the global common
subexpression elimination pass <br>
by adding -fno-gcse to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-lm <br>
When -fgcse-lm is enabled, global common subexpression
elimination attempts to move loads that are only killed by
stores into themselves. This allows a loop containing a <br>
load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside the
loop, and a copy/store within the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default when -fgcse
is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-sm <br>
When -fgcse-sm is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination. This pass attempts
to move stores out of loops. When used in <br>
conjunction with -fgcse-lm, loops containing a load/store
sequence can be changed to a load before the loop and a
store after the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enabled at any optimization
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-las <br>
When -fgcse-las is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after
stores to the same memory location (both partial and <br>
full redundancies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not enabled at any optimization
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgcse-after-reload <br>
When -fgcse-after-reload is enabled, a redundant load
elimination pass is performed after reload. The purpose of
this pass is to clean up redundant spilling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-faggressive-loop-optimizations
<br>
This option tells the loop optimizer to use language
constraints to derive bounds for the number of iterations of
a loop. This assumes that loop code does not invoke <br>
undefined behavior by for example causing signed integer
overflows or out-of-bound array accesses. The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop <br>
unrolling and peeling and loop exit test optimizations. This
option is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funconstrained-commons <br>
This option tells the compiler that variables declared in
common blocks (e.g. Fortran) may later be overridden with
longer trailing arrays. This prevents certain <br>
optimizations that depend on knowing the array bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcrossjumping <br>
Perform cross-jumping transformation. This transformation
unifies equivalent code and saves code size. The resulting
code may or may not perform better than without cross- <br>
jumping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fauto-inc-dec <br>
Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory
accesses. This pass is always skipped on architectures that
do not have instructions to support this. Enabled by <br>
default at -O and higher on architectures that support
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdce <br>
Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdse <br>
Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fif-conversion <br>
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
equivalents. This includes use of conditional moves, min,
max, set flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable
<br>
by standard arithmetics. The use of conditional execution on
chips where it is available is controlled by
-fif-conversion2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fif-conversion2 <br>
Use conditional execution (where available) to transform
conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdeclone-ctor-dtor <br>
The C++ ABI requires multiple entry points for constructors
and destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a
complete object, and one for a virtual destructor that calls
<br>
operator delete afterwards. For a hierarchy with virtual
bases, the base and complete variants are clones, which
means two copies of the function. With this option, the <br>
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that
call a common implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdelete-null-pointer-checks
<br>
Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null
pointers, and that no code or data element resides at
address zero. This option enables simple constant folding
<br>
optimizations at all optimization levels. In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global
dataflow analyses that eliminate useless checks for <br>
null pointers; these assume that a memory access to address
zero always results in a trap, so that if a pointer is
checked after it has already been dereferenced, it cannot
<br>
be null.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note however that in some
environments this assumption is not true. Use
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that <br>
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default on most targets. On Nios II ELF, it defaults to off.
On AVR and CR16, this option is completely disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passes that use the dataflow
information are enabled independently at different
optimization levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdevirtualize <br>
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct
calls. This is done both within a procedure and
interprocedurally as part of indirect inlining
(-findirect-inlining) <br>
and interprocedural constant propagation (-fipa-cp). Enabled
at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdevirtualize-speculatively
<br>
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative
direct calls. Based on the analysis of the type inheritance
graph, determine for a given call the set of likely <br>
targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and
indirect calls. The speculative calls enable more <br>
optimizations, such as inlining. When they seem useless
after further optimization, they are converted back into
original form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans <br>
Stream extra information needed for aggressive
devirtualization when running the link-time optimizer in
local transformation mode. This option enables more
devirtualization <br>
but significantly increases the size of streamed data. For
this reason it is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexpensive-optimizations <br>
Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
expensive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-free <br>
Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions. This is
especially helpful for the x86-64 architecture, which
implicitly zero-extends in 64-bit registers after writing
<br>
to their lower 32-bit half.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and
x86 at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-lifetime-dse <br>
In C++ the value of an object is only affected by changes
within its lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object
has an indeterminate value, and any changes during the <br>
lifetime of the object are dead when the object is
destroyed. Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the
object <br>
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you
can use this flag to disable this optimization. To preserve
stores before the constructor starts (e.g. because your <br>
operator new clears the object storage) but still treat the
object as dead after the destructor you, can use
-flifetime-dse=1. The default behavior can be explicitly
<br>
selected with -flifetime-dse=2. -flifetime-dse=0 is
equivalent to -fno-lifetime-dse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flive-range-shrinkage <br>
Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live
range shrinkage. This is helpful for fast processors with
small or moderate size register sets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-algorithm=algorithm <br>
Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated
register allocator. The algorithm argument can be priority,
which specifies Chow&rsquo;s priority coloring, or CB, which
<br>
specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring. Chaitin-Briggs coloring
is not implemented for all architectures, but for those
targets that do support it, it is the default because it
<br>
generates better code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-region=region <br>
Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.
The region argument should be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Use all loops as register
allocation regions. This can give the best results for
machines with a small and/or irregular register set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed <br>
Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure
as the regions. This value usually gives the best results in
most cases and for most architectures, and is <br>
enabled by default when compiling with optimization for
speed (-O, -O2, ...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one Use all functions as a
single region. This typically results in the smallest code
size, and is enabled by default for -Os or -O0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-hoist-pressure <br>
Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting
pass for decisions to hoist expressions. This option usually
results in smaller code, but it can slow the compiler <br>
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled at level
-Os for all targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-loop-pressure <br>
Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions
to move loop invariants. This option usually results in
generation of faster and smaller code on machines with <br>
large register files (&gt;= 32 registers), but it can slow
the compiler down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled at level
-O3 for some targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-ira-share-save-slots <br>
Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used
hard registers living through a call. Each hard register
gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function stack
<br>
frames are larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-ira-share-spill-slots <br>
Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for
pseudo-registers. Each pseudo-register that does not get a
hard register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result
function <br>
stack frames are larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flra-remat <br>
Enable CFG-sensitive rematerialization in LRA. Instead of
loading values of spilled pseudos, LRA tries to
rematerialize (recalculate) values if it is profitable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdelayed-branch <br>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
instructions to exploit instruction slots available after
delayed branch instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fschedule-insns <br>
If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required
data being unavailable. This helps machines that have slow
<br>
floating point or memory load instructions by allowing other
instructions to be issued until the result of the load or
floating-point instruction is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fschedule-insns2 <br>
Similar to -fschedule-insns, but requests an additional pass
of instruction scheduling after register allocation has been
done. This is especially useful on machines with a <br>
relatively small number of registers and where memory load
instructions take more than one cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-sched-interblock <br>
Don&rsquo;t schedule instructions across basic blocks. This
is normally enabled by default when scheduling before
register allocation, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or
<br>
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-sched-spec <br>
Don&rsquo;t allow speculative motion of non-load
instructions. This is normally enabled by default when
scheduling before register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or at <br>
-O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-pressure <br>
Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before
register allocation. This only makes sense when scheduling
before register allocation is enabled, i.e. with <br>
-fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher. Usage of this option
can improve the generated code and decrease its size by
preventing register pressure increase above the number of
<br>
available hard registers and subsequent spills in register
allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-spec-load <br>
Allow speculative motion of some load instructions. This
only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation,
i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-spec-load-dangerous <br>
Allow speculative motion of more load instructions. This
only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation,
i.e. with -fschedule-insns or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-stalled-insns <br>
-fsched-stalled-insns=n <br>
Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from
the queue of stalled insns into the ready list during the
second scheduling pass. -fno-sched-stalled-insns means <br>
that no insns are moved prematurely, -fsched-stalled-insns=0
means there is no limit on how many queued insns can be
moved prematurely. -fsched-stalled-insns without a value
<br>
is equivalent to -fsched-stalled-insns=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-stalled-insns-dep <br>
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=n <br>
Define how many insn groups (cycles) are examined for a
dependency on a stalled insn that is a candidate for
premature removal from the queue of stalled insns. This has
an <br>
effect only during the second scheduling pass, and only if
-fsched-stalled-insns is used. -fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep
is equivalent to -fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0. <br>
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep without a value is equivalent to
-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched2-use-superblocks <br>
When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock
scheduling. This allows motion across basic block
boundaries, resulting in faster schedules. This option is
<br>
experimental, as not all machine descriptions used by GCC
model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable results
from the algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This only makes sense when
scheduling after register allocation, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-group-heuristic <br>
Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler. This heuristic
favors the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.
This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, <br>
i.e. with -fschedule-insns or -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-critical-path-heuristic
<br>
Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler. This
heuristic favors instructions on the critical path. This is
enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. <br>
with -fschedule-insns or -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic <br>
Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the
scheduler. This heuristic favors speculative instructions
with greater dependency weakness. This is enabled by default
<br>
when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-rank-heuristic <br>
Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler. This heuristic
favors the instruction belonging to a basic block with
greater size or frequency. This is enabled by default when
<br>
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-last-insn-heuristic <br>
Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler. This
heuristic favors the instruction that is less dependent on
the last instruction scheduled. This is enabled by <br>
default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with
-fschedule-insns or -fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-dep-count-heuristic <br>
Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler. This
heuristic favors the instruction that has more instructions
depending on it. This is enabled by default when <br>
scheduling is enabled, i.e. with -fschedule-insns or
-fschedule-insns2 or at -O2 or higher.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops
<br>
Modulo scheduling is performed before traditional
scheduling. If a loop is modulo scheduled, later scheduling
passes may change its schedule. Use this option to control
<br>
that behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fselective-scheduling <br>
Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
Selective scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fselective-scheduling2 <br>
Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
Selective scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsel-sched-pipelining <br>
Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during
selective scheduling. This option has no effect unless one
of -fselective-scheduling or -fselective-scheduling2 is <br>
turned on.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops
<br>
When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also
pipeline outer loops. This option has no effect unless
-fsel-sched-pipelining is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsemantic-interposition <br>
Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols
by the dynamic linker. This means that for symbols exported
from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform <br>
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other
optimizations in anticipation that the function or variable
in question may change. While this feature is useful, for
example, <br>
to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code
quality. With -fno-semantic-interposition the compiler
assumes <br>
that if interposition happens for functions the overwriting
function will have precisely the same semantics (and side
effects). Similarly if interposition happens for <br>
variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same.
The flag has no effect for functions explicitly declared
inline (where it is never allowed for interposition to <br>
change semantics) and for symbols explicitly declared
weak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshrink-wrap <br>
Emit function prologues only before parts of the function
that need it, rather than at the top of the function. This
flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshrink-wrap-separate <br>
Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue
separately, so that those parts are only executed when
needed. This option is on by default, but has no effect
unless <br>
-fshrink-wrap is also turned on and the target supports
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcaller-saves <br>
Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered
by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save
and restore the registers around such calls. Such <br>
allocation is done only when it seems to result in better
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is always enabled by
default on certain machines, usually those which have no
call-preserved registers to use instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcombine-stack-adjustments <br>
Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory
references and then tries to find ways to combine them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default at -O1 and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-ra <br>
Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers
are not used by any called function. In that case it is not
necessary to save and restore them around calls. <br>
This is only possible if called functions are part of same
compilation unit as current function and they are compiled
before it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os,
however the option is disabled if generated code will be
instrumented for profiling (-p, or -pg) or if callee&rsquo;s
register usage cannot be <br>
known exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose
prologues and epilogues in RTL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fconserve-stack <br>
Attempt to minimize stack usage. The compiler attempts to
use less stack space, even if that makes the program slower.
This option implies setting the large-stack-frame <br>
parameter to 100 and the large-stack-frame-growth parameter
to 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-reassoc <br>
Perform reassociation on trees. This flag is enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcode-hoisting <br>
Perform code hoisting. Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the
function exit as early as possible. This is especially
useful <br>
as a code size optimization, but it often helps for code
speed as well. This flag is enabled by default at -O2 and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-pre <br>
Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at -O2 and -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-partial-pre <br>
Make partial redundancy elimination (PRE) more aggressive.
This flag is enabled by default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-forwprop <br>
Perform forward propagation on trees. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-fre <br>
Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees. The
difference between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers
expressions that are computed on all paths leading to the
<br>
redundant computation. This analysis is faster than PRE,
though it exposes fewer redundancies. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-phiprop <br>
Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on
trees. This pass is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fhoist-adjacent-loads <br>
Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an
if-then-else if the loads are from adjacent locations in the
same structure and the target architecture has a conditional
<br>
move instruction. This flag is enabled by default at -O2 and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-copy-prop <br>
Perform copy propagation on trees. This pass eliminates
unnecessary copy operations. This flag is enabled by default
at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-pure-const <br>
Discover which functions are pure or constant. Enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-reference <br>
Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit. Enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-pta <br>
Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural
modification and reference analysis. This option can cause
excessive memory and compile-time usage on large <br>
compilation units. It is not enabled by default at any
optimization level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-profile <br>
Perform interprocedural profile propagation. The functions
called only from cold functions are marked as cold. Also
functions executed once (such as &quot;cold&quot;,
&quot;noreturn&quot;, <br>
static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are
then optimized for size. Enabled by default at -O and <br>
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-cp <br>
Perform interprocedural constant propagation. This
optimization analyzes the program to determine when values
passed to functions are constants and then optimizes <br>
accordingly. This optimization can substantially increase
performance if the application has constants passed to
functions. This flag is enabled by default at -O2, -Os and
<br>
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-cp-clone <br>
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant
propagation stronger. When enabled, interprocedural constant
propagation performs function cloning when externally <br>
visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of
functions, it may significantly increase code size (see <br>
--param ipcp-unit-growth=value). This flag is enabled by
default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-bit-cp <br>
When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at -O2. It
requires that -fipa-cp is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-vrp <br>
When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at -O2. It requires
that -fipa-cp is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fipa-icf <br>
Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only
variables. The optimization reduces code size and may
disturb unwind stacks by replacing a function by equivalent
<br>
one with a different name. The optimization works more
effectively with link-time optimization enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nevertheless the behavior is
similar to Gold Linker ICF optimization, GCC ICF works on
different levels and thus the optimizations are not same -
there are equivalences that <br>
are found only by GCC and equivalences found only by
Gold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is enabled by default
at -O2 and -Os.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference
<br>
Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior
due to dereferencing a null pointer. Isolate those paths
from the main control flow and turn the statement with <br>
erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap. This flag is
enabled by default at -O2 and higher and depends on
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks also being enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute
<br>
Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior
due a null value being used in a way forbidden by a
&quot;returns_nonnull&quot; or &quot;nonnull&quot;
attribute. Isolate those paths <br>
from the main control flow and turn the statement with
erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap. This is not
currently enabled, but may be enabled by -O2 in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-sink <br>
Perform forward store motion on trees. This flag is enabled
by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-bit-ccp <br>
Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees
and propagate pointer alignment information. This pass only
operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by <br>
default at -O and higher. It requires that -ftree-ccp is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-ccp <br>
Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on
trees. This pass only operates on local scalar variables and
is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fssa-backprop <br>
Propagate information about uses of a value up the
definition chain in order to simplify the definitions. For
example, this pass strips sign operations if the sign of a
<br>
value never matters. The flag is enabled by default at -O
and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fssa-phiopt <br>
Perform pattern matching on SSA PHI nodes to optimize
conditional code. This pass is enabled by default at -O and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-switch-conversion <br>
Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array. This flag is enabled by
default at -O2 and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-tail-merge <br>
Look for identical code sequences. When found, replace one
with a jump to the other. This optimization is known as tail
merging or cross jumping. This flag is enabled by <br>
default at -O2 and higher. The compilation time in this pass
can be limited using max-tail-merge-comparisons parameter
and max-tail-merge-iterations parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-dce <br>
Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-builtin-call-dce <br>
Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to
built-in functions that may set &quot;errno&quot; but are
otherwise side-effect free. This flag is enabled by default
at <br>
-O2 and higher if -Os is not also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-dominator-opts <br>
Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and
expression simplification) based on a dominator tree <br>
traversal. This also performs jump threading (to reduce
jumps to jumps). This flag is enabled by default at -O and
higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-dse <br>
Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees. A dead store
is a store into a memory location that is later overwritten
by another store without any intervening loads. In <br>
this case the earlier store can be deleted. This flag is
enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-ch <br>
Perform loop header copying on trees. This is beneficial
since it increases effectiveness of code motion
optimizations. It also saves one jump. This flag is enabled
by <br>
default at -O and higher. It is not enabled for -Os, since
it usually increases code size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-optimize <br>
Perform loop optimizations on trees. This flag is enabled by
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-linear <br>
-floop-interchange <br>
-floop-strip-mine <br>
-floop-block <br>
-floop-unroll-and-jam <br>
Perform loop nest optimizations. Same as
-floop-nest-optimize. To use this code transformation, GCC
has to be configured with --with-isl to enable the Graphite
loop <br>
transformation infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fgraphite-identity <br>
Enable the identity transformation for graphite. For every
SCoP we generate the polyhedral representation and transform
it back to gimple. Using -fgraphite-identity we can <br>
check the costs or benefits of the GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE
-&gt; GIMPLE transformation. Some minimal optimizations are
also performed by the code generator isl, like index
splitting <br>
and dead code elimination in loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-nest-optimize <br>
Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer. This is a generic
loop nest optimizer based on the Pluto optimization
algorithms. It calculates a loop structure optimized for
<br>
data-locality and parallelism. This option is
experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-floop-parallelize-all <br>
Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops
that can be parallelized. Parallelize all the loops that can
be analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences <br>
without checking that it is profitable to parallelize the
loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-coalesce-vars <br>
While transforming the program out of the SSA
representation, attempt to reduce copying by coalescing
versions of different user-defined variables, instead of
just compiler <br>
temporaries. This may severely limit the ability to debug an
optimized program compiled with
-fno-var-tracking-assignments. In the negated form, this
flag prevents SSA <br>
coalescing of user variables. This option is enabled by
default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-if-convert <br>
Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost
loops to branch-less equivalents. The intent is to remove
control-flow from the innermost loops in order to improve
<br>
the ability of the vectorization pass to handle these loops.
This is enabled by default if vectorization is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-distribution <br>
Perform loop distribution. This flag can improve cache
performance on big loop bodies and allow further loop
optimizations, like parallelization or vectorization, to
take <br>
place. For example, the loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns
<br>
Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code
generated with calls to a library. This flag is enabled by
default at -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This pass distributes the
initialization loops and generates a call to memset zero.
For example, the loop</p>

ENDDO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the initialization loop is
transformed into a call to memset zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-im <br>
Perform loop invariant motion on trees. This pass moves only
invariants that are hard to handle at RTL level (function
calls, operations that expand to nontrivial sequences <br>
of insns). With -funswitch-loops it also moves operands of
conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we
can use just trivial invariantness analysis in loop <br>
unswitching. The pass also includes store motion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-ivcanon <br>
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops
for which determining number of iterations requires
complicated analysis. Later optimizations then may determine
<br>
the number easily. Useful especially in connection with
unrolling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fivopts <br>
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength
reduction, induction variable merging and induction variable
elimination) on trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-parallelize-loops=n <br>
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run
in n threads. This is only possible for loops whose
iterations are independent and can be arbitrarily reordered.
<br>
The optimization is only profitable on multiprocessor
machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive, rather than
constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth. This option implies
<br>
-pthread, and thus is only supported on targets that have
support for -pthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-pta <br>
Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees. This
flag is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-sra <br>
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates. This pass replaces
structure references with scalars to prevent committing
structures to memory too early. This flag is enabled by <br>
default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstore-merging <br>
Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive memory
addresses. This pass merges contiguous stores of immediate
values narrower than a word into fewer wider stores to <br>
reduce the number of instructions. This is enabled by
default at -O2 and higher as well as -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-ter <br>
Perform temporary expression replacement during the
SSA-&gt;normal phase. Single use/single def temporaries are
replaced at their use location with their defining
expression. <br>
This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL
generation. This is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-slsr <br>
Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees. This
recognizes related expressions involving multiplications and
replaces them by less expensive calculations when <br>
possible. This is enabled by default at -O and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-vectorize <br>
Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables
-ftree-loop-vectorize and -ftree-slp-vectorize if not
explicitly specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-loop-vectorize <br>
Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by
default at -O3 and when -ftree-vectorize is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-slp-vectorize <br>
Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is
enabled by default at -O3 and when -ftree-vectorize is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvect-cost-model=model <br>
Alter the cost model used for vectorization. The model
argument should be one of unlimited, dynamic or cheap. With
the unlimited model the vectorized code-path is assumed <br>
to be profitable while with the dynamic model a runtime
check guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for
iteration counts that will likely execute faster than when
<br>
executing the original scalar loop. The cheap model disables
vectorization of loops where doing so would be cost
prohibitive for example due to required runtime checks for
<br>
data dependence or alignment but otherwise is equal to the
dynamic model. The default cost model depends on other
optimization flags and is either dynamic or cheap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsimd-cost-model=model <br>
Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked
with the OpenMP or Cilk Plus simd directive. The model
argument should be one of unlimited, dynamic, cheap. All
<br>
values of model have the same meaning as described in
-fvect-cost-model and by default a cost model defined with
-fvect-cost-model is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftree-vrp <br>
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees. This is similar to
the constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges
of values are propagated. This allows the <br>
optimizers to remove unnecessary range checks like array
bound checks and null pointer checks. This is enabled by
default at -O2 and higher. Null pointer check elimination
<br>
is only done if -fdelete-null-pointer-checks is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-paths <br>
Split paths leading to loop backedges. This can improve dead
code elimination and common subexpression elimination. This
is enabled by default at -O2 and above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller <br>
Enables expression of values of induction variables in later
iterations of the unrolled loop using the value in the first
iteration. This breaks long dependency chains, thus <br>
improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A combination of -fweb and CSE
is often sufficient to obtain the same effect. However, that
is not reliable in cases where the loop body is more
complicated than a single <br>
basic block. It also does not work at all on some
architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is enabled by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller
<br>
With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of
some local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result
in superior code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpartial-inlining <br>
Inline parts of functions. This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the -finline-functions
or -finline-small-functions options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpredictive-commoning <br>
Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing
computations (especially memory loads and stores) performed
in previous iterations of loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled at level
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprefetch-loop-arrays <br>
If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to
prefetch memory to improve the performance of loops that
access large arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option may generate better
or worse code; results are highly dependent on the structure
of loops within the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled at level -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-printf-return-value <br>
Do not substitute constants for known return value of
formatted output functions such as &quot;sprintf&quot;,
&quot;snprintf&quot;, &quot;vsprintf&quot;, and
&quot;vsnprintf&quot; (but not &quot;printf&quot; of
&quot;fprintf&quot;). <br>
This transformation allows GCC to optimize or even eliminate
branches based on the known return value of these functions
called with arguments that are either constant, or <br>
whose values are known to be in a range that makes
determining the exact return value possible. For example,
when -fprintf-return-value is in effect, both the branch and
the <br>
body of the &quot;if&quot; statement (but not the call to
&quot;snprint&quot;) can be optimized away when
&quot;i&quot; is a 32-bit or smaller integer because the
return value is guaranteed to be at most <br>
8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char buf[9]; <br>
if (snprintf (buf, &quot;%08x&quot;, i) &gt;= sizeof buf)
<br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fprintf-return-value option
relies on other optimizations and yields best results with
-O2. It works in tandem with the -Wformat-overflow and
-Wformat-truncation <br>
options. The -fprintf-return-value option is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-peephole <br>
-fno-peephole2 <br>
Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations. The
difference between -fno-peephole and -fno-peephole2 is in
how they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use
<br>
one, some use the other, a few use both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpeephole is enabled by
default. -fpeephole2 enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-guess-branch-probability
<br>
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC uses heuristics to guess
branch probabilities if they are not provided by profiling
feedback (-fprofile-arcs). These heuristics are based on the
control flow graph. If <br>
some branch probabilities are specified by
&quot;__builtin_expect&quot;, then the heuristics are used
to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control
flow graph, taking the <br>
&quot;__builtin_expect&quot; info into account. The
interactions between the heuristics and
&quot;__builtin_expect&quot; can be complex, and in some
cases, it may be useful to disable the <br>
heuristics so that the effects of
&quot;__builtin_expect&quot; are easier to understand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fguess-branch-probability at levels -O, -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-blocks <br>
Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to
reduce number of taken branches and improve code
locality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-blocks-algorithm=algorithm
<br>
Use the specified algorithm for basic block reordering. The
algorithm argument can be simple, which does not increase
code size (except sometimes due to secondary effects <br>
like alignment), or stc, the &quot;software trace
cache&quot; algorithm, which tries to put all often executed
code together, minimizing the number of branches executed by
making extra <br>
copies of code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is simple at levels
-O, -Os, and stc at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-blocks-and-partition
<br>
In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled
function, in order to reduce number of taken branches,
partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections
of <br>
the assembly and .o files, to improve paging and cache
locality performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is
automatically turned off in the presence of exception
handling, for linkonce sections, for functions with a
user-defined section attribute and on any <br>
architecture that does not support named sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled for x86 at levels -O2,
-O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freorder-functions <br>
Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve
code locality. This is implemented by using special
subsections &quot;.text.hot&quot; for most frequently
executed functions <br>
and &quot;.text.unlikely&quot; for unlikely executed
functions. Reordering is done by the linker so object file
format must support named sections and linker must place
them in a <br>
reasonable way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also profile feedback must be
available to make this option effective. See -fprofile-arcs
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-aliasing <br>
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules
applicable to the language being compiled. For C (and C++),
this activates optimizations based on the type of <br>
expressions. In particular, an object of one type is assumed
never to reside at the same address as an object of a
different type, unless the types are almost the same. For
<br>
example, an &quot;unsigned int&quot; can alias an
&quot;int&quot;, but not a &quot;void*&quot; or a
&quot;double&quot;. A character type may alias any other
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pay special attention to code
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">union a_union { <br>
int i; <br>
double d; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() { <br>
union a_union t; <br>
t.d = 3.0; <br>
return t.i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The practice of reading from a
different union member than the one most recently written to
(called &quot;type-punning&quot;) is common. Even with
-fstrict-aliasing, type-punning is <br>
allowed, provided the memory is accessed through the union
type. So, the code above works as expected. However, this
code might not:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() { <br>
union a_union t; <br>
int* ip; <br>
t.d = 3.0; <br>
ip = &amp;t.i; <br>
return *ip; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, access by taking the
address, casting the resulting pointer and dereferencing the
result has undefined behavior, even if the cast uses a union
type, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int f() { <br>
double d = 3.0; <br>
return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fstrict-aliasing option is
enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-overflow <br>
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules,
depending on the language being compiled. For C (and C++)
this means that overflow when doing arithmetic with <br>
signed numbers is undefined, which means that the compiler
may assume that it does not happen. This permits various
optimizations. For example, the compiler assumes that an
<br>
expression like &quot;i + 10 &gt; i&quot; is always true for
signed &quot;i&quot;. This assumption is only valid if
signed overflow is undefined, as the expression is false if
&quot;i + 10&quot; overflows <br>
when using twos complement arithmetic. When this option is
in effect any attempt to determine whether an operation on
signed numbers overflows must be written carefully to <br>
not actually involve overflow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option also allows the
compiler to assume strict pointer semantics: given a pointer
to an object, if adding an offset to that pointer does not
produce a pointer to the <br>
same object, the addition is undefined. This permits the
compiler to conclude that &quot;p + u &gt; p&quot; is always
true for a pointer &quot;p&quot; and unsigned integer
&quot;u&quot;. This assumption is <br>
only valid because pointer wraparound is undefined, as the
expression is false if &quot;p + u&quot; overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the -fwrapv option.
Using -fwrapv means that integer signed overflow is fully
defined: it wraps. When -fwrapv is used, there is no
difference between <br>
-fstrict-overflow and -fno-strict-overflow for integers.
With -fwrapv certain types of overflow are permitted. For
example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing <br>
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be
used with -fwrapv, but not otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fstrict-overflow option is
enabled at levels -O2, -O3, -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-functions <br>
-falign-functions=n <br>
Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two
greater than n, skipping up to n bytes. For instance,
-falign-functions=32 aligns functions to the next 32-byte
<br>
boundary, but -falign-functions=24 aligns to the next
32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23
bytes or less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-functions and
-falign-functions=1 are equivalent and mean that functions
are not aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some assemblers only support
this flag when n is a power of two; in that case, it is
rounded up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is not specified or is
zero, use a machine-dependent default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flimit-function-alignment <br>
If this option is enabled, the compiler tries to avoid
unnecessarily overaligning functions. It attempts to
instruct the assembler to align by the amount specified by
<br>
-falign-functions, but not to skip more bytes than the size
of the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-labels <br>
-falign-labels=n <br>
Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary,
skipping up to n bytes like -falign-functions. This option
can easily make code slower, because it must insert dummy
<br>
operations for when the branch target is reached in the
usual flow of the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-labels and
-falign-labels=1 are equivalent and mean that labels are not
aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -falign-loops or
-falign-jumps are applicable and are greater than this
value, then their values are used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is not specified or is
zero, use a machine-dependent default which is very likely
to be 1, meaning no alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-loops <br>
-falign-loops=n <br>
Align loops to a power-of-two boundary, skipping up to n
bytes like -falign-functions. If the loops are executed many
times, this makes up for any execution of the dummy <br>
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-loops and
-falign-loops=1 are equivalent and mean that loops are not
aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is not specified or is
zero, use a machine-dependent default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-falign-jumps <br>
-falign-jumps=n <br>
Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch
targets where the targets can only be reached by jumping,
skipping up to n bytes like -falign-functions. In this <br>
case, no dummy operations need be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-align-jumps and
-falign-jumps=1 are equivalent and mean that loops are not
aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If n is not specified or is
zero, use a machine-dependent default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funit-at-a-time <br>
This option is left for compatibility reasons.
-funit-at-a-time has no effect, while -fno-unit-at-a-time
implies -fno-toplevel-reorder and -fno-section-anchors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-toplevel-reorder <br>
Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and
&quot;asm&quot; statements. Output them in the same order
that they appear in the input file. When this option is
used, <br>
unreferenced static variables are not removed. This option
is intended to support existing code that relies on a
particular ordering. For new code, it is better to use <br>
attributes when possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at level -O0. When
disabled explicitly, it also implies -fno-section-anchors,
which is otherwise enabled at -O0 on some targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fweb <br>
Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation
purposes and assign each web individual pseudo register.
This allows the register allocation pass to operate on <br>
pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other
optimization passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial
dead code remover. It can, however, make debugging <br>
impossible, since variables no longer stay in a &quot;home
register&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default with
-funroll-loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwhole-program <br>
Assume that the current compilation unit represents the
whole program being compiled. All public functions and
variables with the exception of &quot;main&quot; and those
merged by <br>
attribute &quot;externally_visible&quot; become static
functions and in effect are optimized more aggressively by
interprocedural optimizers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should not be used
in combination with -flto. Instead relying on a linker
plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto[=n] <br>
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer. When
invoked with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of
GCC&rsquo;s internal representations) and writes it to
special ELF <br>
sections in the object file. When the object files are
linked together, all the function bodies are read from these
ELF sections and instantiated as if they had been part of
<br>
the same translation unit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the link-time optimizer,
-flto and optimization options should be specified at
compile time and during the final link. It is recommended
that you compile all the <br>
files participating in the same link with the same options
and also specify those options at link time. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c <br>
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c <br>
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first two invocations to GCC
save a bytecode representation of GIMPLE into special ELF
sections inside foo.o and bar.o. The final invocation reads
the GIMPLE bytecode <br>
from foo.o and bar.o, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual. Since both
foo.o and bar.o are merged into a single image, this <br>
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in
GCC to work across the two files as if they were a single
one. This means, for example, that the inliner is able <br>
to inline functions in bar.o into functions in foo.o and
vice-versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another (simpler) way to enable
link-time optimization is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c
bar.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above generates bytecode for
foo.c and bar.c, merges them together into a single GIMPLE
representation and optimizes them as usual to produce
myprog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only important thing to keep
in mind is that to enable link-time optimizations you need
to use the GCC driver to perform the link step. GCC then
automatically performs <br>
link-time optimization if any of the objects involved were
compiled with the -flto command-line option. You generally
should specify the optimization options to be used for <br>
link-time optimization though GCC tries to be clever at
guessing an optimization level to use from the options used
at compile time if you fail to specify one at link time.
<br>
You can always override the automatic decision to do
link-time optimization by passing -fno-lto to the link
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make whole program
optimization effective, it is necessary to make certain
whole program assumptions. The compiler needs to know what
functions and variables can be <br>
accessed by libraries and runtime outside of the link-time
optimized unit. When supported by the linker, the linker
plugin (see -fuse-linker-plugin) passes information to <br>
the compiler about used and externally visible symbols. When
the linker plugin is not available, -fwhole-program should
be used to allow the compiler to make these <br>
assumptions, which leads to more aggressive optimization
decisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When -fuse-linker-plugin is not
enabled, when a file is compiled with -flto, the generated
object file is larger than a regular object file because it
contains GIMPLE <br>
bytecodes and the usual final code (see -ffat-lto-objects.
This means that object files with LTO information can be
linked as normal object files; if -fno-lto is passed to <br>
the linker, no interprocedural optimizations are applied.
Note that when -fno-fat-lto-objects is enabled the compile
stage is faster but you cannot perform a regular, non- <br>
LTO link on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the optimization
flags used to compile individual files are not necessarily
related to those used at link time. For instance,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects
-flto foo.c <br>
gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto bar.c <br>
gcc -o myprog -O3 foo.o bar.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This produces individual object
files with unoptimized assembler code, but the resulting
binary myprog is optimized at -O3. If, instead, the final
binary is generated with <br>
-fno-lto, then myprog is not optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When producing the final binary,
GCC only applies link-time optimizations to those files that
contain bytecode. Therefore, you can mix and match object
files and libraries <br>
with GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code. GCC
automatically selects which files to optimize in LTO mode
and which files to link without further processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some code generation
flags preserved by GCC when generating bytecodes, as they
need to be used during the final link stage. Generally
options specified at link <br>
time override those specified at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not specify an
optimization level option -O at link time, then GCC uses the
highest optimization level used when compiling the object
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the following options
and their settings are taken from the first object file that
explicitly specifies them: -fPIC, -fpic, -fpie, -fcommon,
-fexceptions, <br>
-fnon-call-exceptions, -fgnu-tm and all the -m target
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain ABI-changing flags are
required to match in all compilation units, and trying to
override this at link time with a conflicting value is
ignored. This includes <br>
options such as -freg-struct-return and
-fpcc-struct-return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options such as
-ffp-contract, -fno-strict-overflow, -fwrapv, -fno-trapv or
-fno-strict-aliasing are passed through to the link stage
and merged conservatively for <br>
conflicting translation units. Specifically
-fno-strict-overflow, -fwrapv and -fno-trapv take
precedence; and for example -ffp-contract=off takes
precedence over <br>
-ffp-contract=fast. You can override them at link time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LTO encounters objects with C
linkage declared with incompatible types in separate
translation units to be linked together (undefined behavior
according to ISO C99 6.2.7), <br>
a non-fatal diagnostic may be issued. The behavior is still
undefined at run time. Similar diagnostics may be raised for
other languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another feature of LTO is that
it is possible to apply interprocedural optimizations on
files written in different languages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c -flto foo.c <br>
g++ -c -flto bar.cc <br>
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90 <br>
g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that the final link is
done with g++ to get the C++ runtime libraries and
-lgfortran is added to get the Fortran runtime libraries. In
general, when mixing languages <br>
in LTO mode, you should use the same link command options as
when mixing languages in a regular (non-LTO)
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If object files containing
GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
libfoo.a, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO
link if you are using a linker with <br>
plugin support. To create static libraries suitable for LTO,
use gcc-ar and gcc-ranlib instead of ar and ranlib; to show
the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, <br>
use gcc-nm. Those commands require that ar, ranlib and nm
have been compiled with plugin support. At link time, use
the the flag -fuse-linker-plugin to ensure that the <br>
library participates in the LTO optimization process:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto
-fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the linker plugin enabled,
the linker extracts the needed GIMPLE files from libfoo.a
and passes them on to the running GCC to make them part of
the aggregated GIMPLE <br>
image to be optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not using a linker
with plugin support and/or do not enable the linker plugin,
then the objects inside libfoo.a are extracted and linked as
usual, but they do not <br>
participate in the LTO optimization process. In order to
make a static library suitable for both LTO optimization and
usual linkage, compile its object files with -flto <br>
-ffat-lto-objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link-time optimizations do not
require the presence of the whole program to operate. If the
program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <br>
-flto and -fwhole-program to allow the interprocedural
optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may lead
to improved optimization opportunities. Use of <br>
-fwhole-program is not needed when linker plugin is active
(see -fuse-linker-plugin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current implementation of
LTO makes no attempt to generate bytecode that is portable
between different types of hosts. The bytecode files are
versioned and there is a <br>
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one
version of GCC do not work with an older or newer version of
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link-time optimization does not
work well with generation of debugging information.
Combining -flto with -g is currently experimental and
expected to produce unexpected <br>
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify the optional n,
the optimization and code generation done at link time is
executed in parallel using n parallel jobs by utilizing an
installed make program. <br>
The environment variable MAKE may be used to override the
program used. The default value for n is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also specify
-flto=jobserver to use GNU make&rsquo;s job server mode to
determine the number of parallel jobs. This is useful when
the Makefile calling GCC is already <br>
executing in parallel. You must prepend a + to the command
recipe in the parent Makefile for this to work. This option
likely only works if MAKE is GNU make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-partition=alg <br>
Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time
optimizer. The value is either 1to1 to specify a
partitioning mirroring the original source files or balanced
to <br>
specify partitioning into equally sized chunks (whenever
possible) or max to create new partition for every symbol
where possible. Specifying none as an algorithm disables
<br>
partitioning and streaming completely. The default value is
balanced. While 1to1 can be used as an workaround for
various code ordering issues, the max partitioning is <br>
intended for internal testing only. The value one specifies
that exactly one partition should be used while the value
none bypasses partitioning and executes the link-time <br>
optimization step directly from the WPA phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-odr-type-merging <br>
Enable streaming of mangled types names of C++ types and
their unification at link time. This increases size of LTO
object files, but enables diagnostics about One <br>
Definition Rule violations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-compression-level=n <br>
This option specifies the level of compression used for
intermediate language written to LTO object files, and is
only meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode (-flto). Valid
<br>
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).
Values outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9. If
the option is not given, a default balanced compression <br>
setting is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-linker-plugin <br>
Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time
optimization. This option relies on plugin support in the
linker, which is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or
newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option enables the
extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out of
library archives. This improves the quality of optimization
by exposing more code to the link- <br>
time optimizer. This information specifies what symbols can
be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking). Resulting code quality improvements on <br>
binaries (and shared libraries that use hidden visibility)
are similar to -fwhole-program. See -flto for a description
of the effect of this flag and how to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default when LTO support in GCC is enabled and GCC was
configured for use with a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld
2.21 or newer or gold).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffat-lto-objects <br>
Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the
intermediate language and the object code. This makes them
usable for both LTO linking and normal linking. This option
<br>
is effective only when compiling with -flto and is ignored
at link time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-fat-lto-objects improves
compilation time over plain LTO, but requires the complete
toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for <br>
basic functionality. Additionally, nm, ar and ranlib need to
support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build
environment (capable of building static libraries etc). <br>
GCC provides the gcc-ar, gcc-nm, gcc-ranlib wrappers to pass
the right options to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles
need to be modified to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-fat-lto-objects on targets with linker plugin
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-elim <br>
After register allocation and post-register allocation
instruction splitting, identify arithmetic instructions that
compute processor flags similar to a comparison operation
<br>
based on that arithmetic. If possible, eliminate the
explicit comparison operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This pass only applies to
certain targets that cannot explicitly represent the
comparison operation before register allocation is
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcprop-registers <br>
After register allocation and post-register allocation
instruction splitting, perform a copy-propagation pass to
try to reduce scheduling dependencies and occasionally <br>
eliminate the copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O, -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-correction <br>
Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for
multi-threaded programs may be inconsistent due to missed
counter updates. When this option is specified, GCC uses
<br>
heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By
default, GCC emits an error message when an inconsistent
profile is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-use <br>
-fprofile-use=path <br>
Enable profile feedback-directed optimizations, and the
following optimizations which are generally profitable only
with profile feedback available: -fbranch-probabilities,
<br>
-fvpt, -funroll-loops, -fpeel-loops, -ftracer,
-ftree-vectorize, and ftree-loop-distribute-patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you can use this option,
you must first generate profiling information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, GCC emits an error
message if the feedback profiles do not match the source
code. This error can be turned into a warning by using
-Wcoverage-mismatch. Note <br>
this may result in poorly optimized code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If path is specified, GCC looks
at the path to find the profile feedback data files. See
-fprofile-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fauto-profile <br>
-fauto-profile=path <br>
Enable sampling-based feedback-directed optimizations, and
the following optimizations which are generally profitable
only with profile feedback available: <br>
-fbranch-probabilities, -fvpt, -funroll-loops, -fpeel-loops,
-ftracer, -ftree-vectorize, -finline-functions, -fipa-cp,
-fipa-cp-clone, -fpredictive-commoning, <br>
-funswitch-loops, -fgcse-after-reload, and
-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">path is the name of a file
containing AutoFDO profile information. If omitted, it
defaults to fbdata.afdo in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Producing an AutoFDO profile
data file requires running your program with the perf
utility on a supported GNU/Linux target system. For more
information, see <br>
&lt;https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perf record -e
br_inst_retired:near_taken -b -o perf.data --
your_program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then use the create_gcov tool to
convert the raw profile data to a format that can be used by
GCC. You must also supply the unstripped binary for your
program to this tool. <br>
See &lt;https://github.com/google/autofdo&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create_gcov
--binary=your_program.unstripped --profile=perf.data
--gcov=profile.afdo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options control
compiler behavior regarding floating-point arithmetic. These
options trade off between speed and correctness. All must be
specifically enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffloat-store <br>
Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and
inhibit other options that might change whether a
floating-point value is taken from a register or memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option prevents undesirable
excess precision on machines such as the 68000 where the
floating registers (of the 68881) keep more precision than a
&quot;double&quot; is supposed to <br>
have. Similarly for the x86 architecture. For most programs,
the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely
on the precise definition of IEEE floating point. <br>
Use -ffloat-store for such programs, after modifying them to
store all pertinent intermediate computations into
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexcess-precision=style <br>
This option allows further control over excess precision on
machines where floating-point operations occur in a format
with more precision or range than the IEEE standard and <br>
interchange floating-point types. By default,
-fexcess-precision=fast is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the
types <br>
specified in the source if that would result in faster code,
and it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified
in the source code takes place. When compiling C, <br>
if -fexcess-precision=standard is specified then excess
precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in
particular, both casts and assignments cause values to be
rounded <br>
to their semantic types (whereas -ffloat-store only affects
assignments). This option is enabled by default for C if a
strict conformance option such as -std=c99 is used. <br>
-ffast-math enables -fexcess-precision=fast by default
regardless of whether a strict conformance option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexcess-precision=standard is
not implemented for languages other than C. On the x86, it
has no effect if -mfpmath=sse or -mfpmath=sse+387 is
specified; in the former case, <br>
IEEE semantics apply without excess precision, and in the
latter, rounding is unpredictable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffast-math <br>
Sets the options -fno-math-errno,
-funsafe-math-optimizations, -ffinite-math-only,
-fno-rounding-math, -fno-signaling-nans, -fcx-limited-range
and -fexcess-precision=fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the
preprocessor macro &quot;__FAST_MATH__&quot; to be
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not turned on by
any -O option besides -Ofast since it can result in
incorrect output for programs that depend on an exact
implementation of IEEE or ISO <br>
rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however,
yield faster code for programs that do not require the
guarantees of these specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-math-errno <br>
Do not set &quot;errno&quot; after calling math functions
that are executed with a single instruction, e.g.,
&quot;sqrt&quot;. A program that relies on IEEE exceptions
for math error handling <br>
may want to use this flag for speed while maintaining IEEE
arithmetic compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not turned on by
any -O option since it can result in incorrect output for
programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or
ISO rules/specifications <br>
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -fmath-errno.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Darwin systems, the math
library never sets &quot;errno&quot;. There is therefore no
reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that it
might, and -fno-math-errno is the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funsafe-math-optimizations <br>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a)
assume that arguments and results are valid and (b) may
violate IEEE or ANSI standards. When used at link time, it
<br>
may include libraries or startup files that change the
default FPU control word or other similar optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not turned on by
any -O option since it can result in incorrect output for
programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or
ISO rules/specifications <br>
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications. Enables -fno-signed-zeros, <br>
-fno-trapping-math, -fassociative-math and
-freciprocal-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fassociative-math <br>
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point
operations. This violates the ISO C and C++ language
standard by possibly changing computation result. NOTE: <br>
re-ordering may change the sign of zero as well as ignore
NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and thus
cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior <br>
like &quot;(x + 2**52) - 2**52&quot;. May also reorder
floating-point comparisons and thus may not be used when
ordered comparisons are required. This option requires that
both <br>
-fno-signed-zeros and -fno-trapping-math be in effect.
Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense with
-frounding-math. For Fortran the option is automatically
enabled when both <br>
-fno-signed-zeros and -fno-trapping-math are in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-associative-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freciprocal-math <br>
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of
dividing by the value if this enables optimizations. For
example &quot;x / y&quot; can be replaced with &quot;x *
(1/y)&quot;, which is <br>
useful if &quot;(1/y)&quot; is subject to common
subexpression elimination. Note that this loses precision
and increases the number of flops operating on the
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-reciprocal-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffinite-math-only <br>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that
assume that arguments and results are not NaNs or
+-Infs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not turned on by
any -O option since it can result in incorrect output for
programs that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or
ISO rules/specifications <br>
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
programs that do not require the guarantees of these
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-finite-math-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-signed-zeros <br>
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that
ignore the signedness of zero. IEEE arithmetic specifies the
behavior of distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then <br>
prohibits simplification of expressions such as x+0.0 or
0.0*x (even with -ffinite-math-only). This option implies
that the sign of a zero result isn&rsquo;t significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fsigned-zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-trapping-math <br>
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot
generate user-visible traps. These traps include division by
zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and <br>
invalid operation. This option requires that
-fno-signaling-nans be in effect. Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on &quot;non-stop&quot; IEEE
arithmetic, for <br>
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option should never be
turned on by any -O option since it can result in incorrect
output for programs that depend on an exact implementation
of IEEE or ISO <br>
rules/specifications for math functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ftrapping-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frounding-math <br>
Disable transformations and optimizations that assume
default floating-point rounding behavior. This is
round-to-zero for all floating point to integer conversions,
and <br>
round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic truncations. This
option should be specified for programs that change the FP
rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed <br>
with a non-default rounding mode. This option disables
constant folding of floating-point expressions at compile
time (which may be affected by rounding mode) and arithmetic
<br>
transformations that are unsafe in the presence of
sign-dependent rounding modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-rounding-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is experimental and
does not currently guarantee to disable all GCC
optimizations that are affected by rounding mode. Future
versions of GCC may provide finer <br>
control of this setting using C99&rsquo;s
&quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot; pragma. This command-line option
will be used to specify the default state for
&quot;FENV_ACCESS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsignaling-nans <br>
Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate
user-visible traps during floating-point operations. Setting
this option disables optimizations that may change <br>
the number of exceptions visible with signaling NaNs. This
option implies -ftrapping-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the
preprocessor macro &quot;__SUPPORT_SNAN__&quot; to be
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-signaling-nans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is experimental and
does not currently guarantee to disable all GCC
optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact <br>
Do not allow the built-in functions &quot;ceil&quot;,
&quot;floor&quot;, &quot;round&quot; and &quot;trunc&quot;,
and their &quot;float&quot; and &quot;long double&quot;
variants, to generate code that raises the
&quot;inexact&quot; floating- <br>
point exception for noninteger arguments. ISO C99 and C11
allow these functions to raise the &quot;inexact&quot;
exception, but ISO/IEC TS 18661-1:2014, the C bindings to
IEEE <br>
754-2008, does not allow these functions to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-ffp-int-builtin-inexact, allowing the exception to be
raised. This option does nothing unless -ftrapping-math is
in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if
-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact is used, if the functions
generate a call to a library function then the
&quot;inexact&quot; exception may be raised if the library
implementation <br>
does not follow TS 18661.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsingle-precision-constant <br>
Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead
of implicitly converting them to double-precision
constants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcx-limited-range <br>
When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step
is not needed when performing complex division. Also, there
is no checking whether the result of a complex <br>
multiplication or division is &quot;NaN + I*NaN&quot;, with
an attempt to rescue the situation in that case. The default
is -fno-cx-limited-range, but is enabled by -ffast-math.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option controls the default
setting of the ISO C99 &quot;CX_LIMITED_RANGE&quot; pragma.
Nevertheless, the option applies to all languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcx-fortran-rules <br>
Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.
Range reduction is done as part of complex division, but
there is no checking whether the result of a complex <br>
multiplication or division is &quot;NaN + I*NaN&quot;, with
an attempt to rescue the situation in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-fno-cx-fortran-rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options control
optimizations that may improve performance, but are not
enabled by any -O options. This section includes
experimental options that may produce <br>
broken code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbranch-probabilities <br>
After running a program compiled with -fprofile-arcs, you
can compile it a second time using -fbranch-probabilities,
to improve optimizations based on the number of times <br>
each branch was taken. When a program compiled with
-fprofile-arcs exits, it saves arc execution counts to a
file called sourcename.gcda for each source file. The <br>
information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same
source code and the same optimization options for both <br>
compilations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fbranch-probabilities, GCC
puts a REG_BR_PROB note on each JUMP_INSN and CALL_INSN.
These can be used to improve optimization. Currently, they
are only used in one <br>
place: in reorg.c, instead of guessing which path a branch
is most likely to take, the REG_BR_PROB values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-values <br>
If combined with -fprofile-arcs, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is
gathered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fbranch-probabilities, it
reads back the data gathered from profiling values of
expressions for usage in optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-generate
and -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-reorder-functions <br>
Function reordering based on profile instrumentation
collects first time of execution of a function and orders
these functions in ascending order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvpt <br>
If combined with -fprofile-arcs, this option instructs the
compiler to add code to gather information about values of
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fbranch-probabilities, it
reads back the data gathered and actually performs the
optimizations based on them. Currently the optimizations
include specialization of <br>
division operations using the knowledge about the value of
the denominator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frename-registers <br>
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by
making use of registers left over after register allocation.
This optimization most benefits processors with lots of <br>
registers. Depending on the debug information format adopted
by the target, however, it can make debugging impossible,
since variables no longer stay in a &quot;home
register&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled by default with
-funroll-loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fschedule-fusion <br>
Performs a target dependent pass over the instruction stream
to schedule instructions of same type together because
target machine can execute them more efficiently if they
<br>
are adjacent to each other in the instruction flow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled at levels -O2, -O3,
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftracer <br>
Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size. This
transformation simplifies the control flow of the function
allowing other optimizations to do a better job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funroll-loops <br>
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
compile time or upon entry to the loop. -funroll-loops
implies -frerun-cse-after-loop, -fweb and <br>
-frename-registers. It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with a small constant number
of iterations). This option makes code larger, and <br>
may or may not make it run faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funroll-all-loops <br>
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is
uncertain when the loop is entered. This usually makes
programs run more slowly. -funroll-all-loops implies the
same <br>
options as -funroll-loops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpeel-loops <br>
Peels loops for which there is enough information that they
do not roll much (from profile feedback or static analysis).
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. <br>
complete removal of loops with small constant number of
iterations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabled with -O3 and/or
-fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmove-loop-invariants <br>
Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop
optimizer. Enabled at level -O1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-loops <br>
Split a loop into two if it contains a condition
that&rsquo;s always true for one side of the iteration space
and false for the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funswitch-loops <br>
Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the
loop, with duplicates of the loop on both branches (modified
according to result of the condition).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffunction-sections <br>
-fdata-sections <br>
Place each function or data item into its own section in the
output file if the target supports arbitrary sections. The
name of the function or the name of the data item <br>
determines the section&rsquo;s name in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use these options on systems
where the linker can perform optimizations to improve
locality of reference in the instruction space. Most systems
using the ELF object format <br>
and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have linkers with
such optimizations. AIX may have these optimizations in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only use these options when
there are significant benefits from doing so. When you
specify these options, the assembler and linker create
larger object and executable files <br>
and are also slower. You cannot use gprof on all systems if
you specify this option, and you may have problems with
debugging if you specify both this option and -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbranch-target-load-optimize
<br>
Perform branch target register load optimization before
prologue / epilogue threading. The use of target registers
can typically be exposed only during reload, thus hoisting
<br>
loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs a
separate optimization pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbranch-target-load-optimize2
<br>
Perform branch target register load optimization after
prologue / epilogue threading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbtr-bb-exclusive <br>
When performing branch target register load optimization,
don&rsquo;t reuse branch target registers within any basic
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstdarg-opt <br>
Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions with
respect to usage of those arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsection-anchors <br>
Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by
using shared &quot;anchor&quot; symbols to address nearby
objects. This transformation can help to reduce the number
of <br>
GOT entries and GOT accesses on some targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the implementation
of the following function &quot;foo&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">static int a, b, c; <br>
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usually calculates the addresses
of all three variables, but if you compile it with
-fsection-anchors, it accesses the variables from a common
anchor point instead. The <br>
effect is similar to the following pseudocode (which
isn&rsquo;t valid C):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int foo (void) <br>
{ <br>
register int *xr = &amp;x; <br>
return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c
- &amp;x]; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all targets support this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--param name=value <br>
In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the
amount of optimization that is done. For example, GCC does
not inline functions that contain more than a certain <br>
number of instructions. You can control some of these
constants on the command line using the --param option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of specific
parameters, and the meaning of the values, are tied to the
internals of the compiler, and are subject to change without
notice in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In each case, the value is an
integer. The allowable choices for name are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">predictable-branch-outcome <br>
When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower
than this threshold (in percent), then it is considered well
predictable. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-rtl-if-conversion-insns <br>
RTL if-conversion tries to remove conditional branches
around a block and replace them with conditionally executed
instructions. This parameter gives the maximum number <br>
of instructions in a block which should be considered for
if-conversion. The default is 10, though the compiler will
also use other heuristics to decide whether if- <br>
conversion is likely to be profitable.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost
<br>
max-rtl-if-conversion-unpredictable-cost <br>
RTL if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches
around a block and replace them with conditionally executed
instructions. These parameters give the maximum <br>
permissible cost for the sequence that would be generated by
if-conversion depending on whether the branch is statically
determined to be predictable or not. The units <br>
for this parameter are the same as those for the GCC
internal seq_cost metric. The compiler will try to provide a
reasonable default for this parameter using the <br>
BRANCH_COST target macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-crossjump-edges <br>
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for
cross-jumping. The algorithm used by -fcrossjumping is
O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block. <br>
Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization, making
the compilation time increase with probably small
improvement in executable size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-crossjump-insns <br>
The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at
the end of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on
them. This value is ignored in the case where all <br>
instructions in the block being cross-jumped from are
matched. The default value is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-grow-copy-bb-insns <br>
The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic
blocks instead of jumping. The expansion is relative to a
jump instruction. The default value is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-goto-duplication-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block
that jumps to a computed goto. To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a
number of passes, GCC factors computed gotos <br>
early in the compilation process, and unfactors them as late
as possible. Only computed jumps at the end of a basic
blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns <br>
are unfactored. The default value is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-delay-slot-insn-search <br>
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking
for an instruction to fill a delay slot. If more than this
arbitrary number of instructions are searched, the <br>
time savings from filling the delay slot are minimal, so
stop searching. Increasing values mean more aggressive
optimization, making the compilation time increase with <br>
probably small improvement in execution time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-delay-slot-live-search <br>
When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of
instructions to consider when searching for a block with
valid live register information. Increasing this <br>
arbitrarily chosen value means more aggressive optimization,
increasing the compilation time. This parameter should be
removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to <br>
maintain the control-flow graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-gcse-memory <br>
The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be
allocated in order to perform the global common
subexpression elimination optimization. If more memory than
<br>
specified is required, the optimization is not done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-gcse-insertion-ratio <br>
If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger
than this value for any expression, then RTL PRE inserts or
removes the expression and thus leaves partially <br>
redundant computations in the instruction stream. The
default value is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-pending-list-length <br>
The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
before flushing the current state and starting over. Large
functions with few branches or calls can create <br>
excessively large lists which needlessly consume memory and
resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-modulo-backtrack-attempts
<br>
The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler
should make when modulo scheduling a loop. Larger values can
exponentially increase compilation time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-single <br>
Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted
in GCC&rsquo;s internal representation) in a single <br>
function that the tree inliner considers for inlining. This
only affects functions declared inline and methods
implemented in a class declaration (C++). The default <br>
value is 400.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-auto <br>
When you use -finline-functions (included in -O3), a lot of
functions that would otherwise not be considered for
inlining by the compiler are investigated. To those <br>
functions, a different (more restrictive) limit compared to
functions declared inline can be applied. The default value
is 40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline-min-speedup <br>
When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee
runtime exceeds this threshold (in percent), the function
can be inlined regardless of the limit on --param max- <br>
inline-insns-single and --param max-inline-insns-auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-function-insns <br>
The limit specifying really large functions. For functions
larger than this limit after inlining, inlining is
constrained by --param large-function-growth. This <br>
parameter is useful primarily to avoid extreme compilation
time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the back end.
The default value is 2700.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-function-growth <br>
Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by
inlining in percents. The default value is 100 which limits
large function growth to 2.0 times the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-unit-insns <br>
The limit specifying large translation unit. Growth caused
by inlining of units larger than this limit is limited by
--param inline-unit-growth. For small units this <br>
might be too tight. For example, consider a unit consisting
of function A that is inline and B that just calls A three
times. If B is small relative to A, the growth of <br>
unit is 300 and yet such inlining is very sane. For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions,
however, the overall unit growth limit is needed to <br>
avoid exponential explosion of code size. Thus for smaller
units, the size is increased to --param large-unit-insns
before applying --param inline-unit-growth. The <br>
default is 10000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline-unit-growth <br>
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
caused by inlining. The default value is 20 which limits
unit growth to 1.2 times the original size. Cold <br>
functions (either marked cold via an attribute or by profile
feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipcp-unit-growth <br>
Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
caused by interprocedural constant propagation. The default
value is 10 which limits unit growth to 1.1 times <br>
the original size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-stack-frame <br>
The limit specifying large stack frames. While inlining the
algorithm is trying to not grow past this limit too much.
The default value is 256 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">large-stack-frame-growth <br>
Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by
inlining in percents. The default value is 1000 which limits
large stack frame growth to 11 times the original <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-insns-recursive <br>
max-inline-insns-recursive-auto <br>
Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line
copy of a self-recursive inline function can grow into by
performing recursive inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--param
max-inline-insns-recursive applies to functions declared
inline. For functions not declared inline, recursive
inlining happens only when -finline-functions <br>
(included in -O3) is enabled; --param
max-inline-insns-recursive-auto applies instead. The default
value is 450.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-inline-recursive-depth <br>
max-inline-recursive-depth-auto <br>
Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive
inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--param
max-inline-recursive-depth applies to functions declared
inline. For functions not declared inline, recursive
inlining happens only when -finline-functions <br>
(included in -O3) is enabled; --param
max-inline-recursive-depth-auto applies instead. The default
value is 8.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-inline-recursive-probability
<br>
Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having
deep recursion in average and can hurt for function having
little recursion depth by increasing the prologue <br>
size or complexity of function body to other optimizers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When profile feedback is
available (see -fprofile-generate) the actual recursion
depth can be guessed from the probability that function
recurses via a given call <br>
expression. This parameter limits inlining only to call
expressions whose probability exceeds the given threshold
(in percents). The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">early-inlining-insns <br>
Specify growth that the early inliner can make. In effect it
increases the amount of inlining for code having a large
abstraction penalty. The default value is 14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-early-inliner-iterations
<br>
Limit of iterations of the early inliner. This basically
bounds the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner
can resolve. Deeper chains are still handled by <br>
late inlining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comdat-sharing-probability <br>
Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with
comdat visibility are shared across multiple compilation
units. The default value is 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">profile-func-internal-id <br>
A parameter to control whether to use function internal id
in profile database lookup. If the value is 0, the compiler
uses an id that is based on function assembler name <br>
and filename, which makes old profile data more tolerant to
source changes such as function reordering etc. The default
value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-vect-loop-bound <br>
The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not
vectorized when -ftree-vectorize is used. The number of
iterations after vectorization needs to be greater <br>
than the value specified by this option to allow
vectorization. The default value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcse-cost-distance-ratio <br>
Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an
expression can be moved by GCSE optimizations. This is
currently supported only in the code hoisting pass. The <br>
bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting is with
simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than gcse-unrestricted-cost. Specifying 0 <br>
disables hoisting of simple expressions. The default value
is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcse-unrestricted-cost <br>
Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical
machine instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not
constrain the distance an expression can travel. This is
<br>
currently supported only in the code hoisting pass. The
lesser the cost, the more aggressive code hoisting is.
Specifying 0 allows all expressions to travel <br>
unrestricted distances. The default value is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-hoist-depth <br>
The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to
hoist. This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting
algorithm. The value of 0 does not limit on the <br>
search, but may slow down compilation of huge functions. The
default value is 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-tail-merge-comparisons <br>
The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with. This
is used to avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail merging.
The default value is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-tail-merge-iterations <br>
The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the
function. This is used to limit compilation time in tree
tail merging. The default value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">store-merging-allow-unaligned
<br>
Allow the store merging pass to introduce unaligned stores
if it is legal to do so. The default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-stores-to-merge <br>
The maximum number of stores to attempt to merge into wider
stores in the store merging pass. The minimum value is 2 and
the default is 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unrolled-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to
be unrolled. If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also
determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-average-unrolled-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions biased by probabilities
of their execution that a loop may have to be unrolled. If a
loop is unrolled, this parameter also determines <br>
how many times the loop code is unrolled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unroll-times <br>
The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-peeled-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have to
be peeled. If a loop is peeled, this parameter also
determines how many times the loop code is peeled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-peel-times <br>
The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-peel-branches <br>
The maximum number of branches on the hot path through the
peeled sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-completely-peeled-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-completely-peel-times <br>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable
for complete peeling.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-completely-peel-loop-nest-depth
<br>
The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete
peeling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unswitch-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-unswitch-level <br>
The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single
loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-loop-headers-insns <br>
The maximum number of insns in loop header duplicated by he
copy loop headers pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lim-expensive <br>
The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop
invariant motion.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">iv-consider-all-candidates-bound
<br>
Bound on number of candidates for induction variables, below
which all candidates are considered for each use in
induction variable optimizations. If there are more <br>
candidates than this, only the most relevant ones are
considered to avoid quadratic time complexity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iv-max-considered-uses <br>
The induction variable optimizations give up on loops that
contain more induction variable uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound
<br>
If the number of candidates in the set is smaller than this
value, always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the set
when adding a new one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">avg-loop-niter <br>
Average number of iterations of a loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dse-max-object-size <br>
Maximum size (in bytes) of objects tracked bytewise by dead
store elimination. Larger values may result in larger
compilation times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scev-max-expr-size <br>
Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar evolutions
analyzer. Large expressions slow the analyzer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scev-max-expr-complexity <br>
Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar
evolutions analyzer. Complex expressions slow the
analyzer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-tree-if-conversion-phi-args
<br>
Maximum number of arguments in a PHI supported by TREE if
conversion unless the loop is marked with simd pragma.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks
<br>
The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed
when doing loop versioning for alignment in the
vectorizer.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">vect-max-version-for-alias-checks
<br>
The maximum number of run-time checks that can be performed
when doing loop versioning for alias in the vectorizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vect-max-peeling-for-alignment
<br>
The maximum number of loop peels to enhance access alignment
for vectorizer. Value -1 means no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-iterations-to-track <br>
The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute-force
algorithm for analysis of the number of iterations of the
loop tries to evaluate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hot-bb-count-ws-permille <br>
A basic block profile count is considered hot if it
contributes to the given permillage (i.e. 0...1000) of the
entire profiled execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hot-bb-frequency-fraction <br>
Select fraction of the entry block frequency of executions
of basic block in function given basic block needs to have
to be considered hot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-predicted-iterations <br>
The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.
This is useful in cases where a function contains a single
loop with known bound and another loop with <br>
unknown bound. The known number of iterations is predicted
correctly, while the unknown number of iterations average to
roughly 10. This means that the loop without <br>
bounds appears artificially cold relative to the other
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">builtin-expect-probability <br>
Control the probability of the expression having the
specified value. This parameter takes a percentage (i.e. 0
... 100) as input. The default probability of 90 is <br>
obtained empirically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align-threshold <br>
Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of a
basic block in a function to align the basic block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">align-loop-iterations <br>
A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number of
iterations is aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-dynamic-coverage <br>
tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback <br>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the
given percentage of executed instructions is covered. This
limits unnecessary code size expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback parameter is used only when
profile feedback is available. The real profiles (as opposed
to statically estimated ones) are much less <br>
balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-max-code-growth <br>
Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given
percentage. This is a rather artificial limit, as most of
the duplicates are eliminated later in cross jumping, <br>
so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired
code growth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-min-branch-ratio <br>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best
edge is less than this threshold (in percent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracer-min-branch-probability
<br>
tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback <br>
Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability lower
than this threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly to
tracer-dynamic-coverage two parameters are provided.
tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback is used for
compilation with profile feedback and tracer-min- <br>
branch-probability compilation without. The value for
compilation with profile feedback needs to be more
conservative (higher) in order to make tracer effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cse-path-length <br>
The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE
considers. The default is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cse-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before
flushing. The default is 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ggc-min-expand <br>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory
allocation. This parameter specifies the minimum percentage
by which the garbage collector&rsquo;s heap should be
allowed <br>
to expand between collections. Tuning this may improve
compilation speed; it has no effect on code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is 30% + 70% *
(RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB. If
&quot;getrlimit&quot; is available, the notion of
&quot;RAM&quot; is the smallest of actual RAM and <br>
&quot;RLIMIT_DATA&quot; or &quot;RLIMIT_AS&quot;. If GCC is
not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the
lower bound of 30% is used. Setting this parameter and
ggc-min-heapsize <br>
to zero causes a full collection to occur at every
opportunity. This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ggc-min-heapsize <br>
Minimum size of the garbage collector&rsquo;s heap before it
begins bothering to collect garbage. The first collection
occurs after the heap expands by ggc-min-expand% beyond <br>
ggc-min-heapsize. Again, tuning this may improve compilation
speed, and has no effect on code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is the smaller of
RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that tries to ensure that
RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but with a lower
bound of 4096 (four <br>
megabytes) and an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes). If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform,
the lower bound is used. Setting this parameter <br>
very large effectively disables garbage collection. Setting
this parameter and ggc-min-expand to zero causes a full
collection to occur at every opportunity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-reload-search-insns <br>
The maximum number of instruction reload should look
backward for equivalent register. Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
<br>
increase with probably slightly better performance. The
default value is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-cselib-memory-locations <br>
The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take

500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-sched-ready-insns <br>
The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the

reducing the compiler&rsquo;s memory usage and increasing
its speed. This sets the maximum value of a shared integer
<br>
constant. The default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefetch-latency <br>
Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed
before prefetch finishes. The distance prefetched ahead is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use-canonical-types <br>
Whether the compiler should use the &quot;canonical&quot;
type system. By default, this should always be 1, which uses
a more efficient internal mechanism for comparing types in
<br>
C++ and Objective-C++. However, if bugs in the canonical
type system are causing compilation failures, set this value
to 0 to disable canonical types.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio
<br>
Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays
that are bigger than switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio
times the number of branches in the switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-partial-antic-length <br>
Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the
tree partial redundancy elimination optimization
(-ftree-pre) when optimizing at -O3 and above. For some <br>
sorts of source code the enhanced partial redundancy
elimination optimization can run away, consuming all of the
memory available on the host machine. This parameter <br>
sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior. Setting a value of 0
for this parameter allows an unlimited set length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sccvn-max-scc-size <br>

from the load to the function entry. The default maximum
<br>
number of queries is 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ira-max-loops-num <br>
IRA uses regional register allocation by default. If a
function contains more loops than the number given by this
parameter, only at most the given number of the most <br>
frequently-executed loops form regions for regional register
allocation. The default value of the parameter is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ira-max-conflict-table-size <br>
Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the
conflict table, the table can still require excessive
amounts of memory for huge functions. If the conflict <br>
table for a function could be more than the size in MB given
by this parameter, the register allocator instead uses a
faster, simpler, and lower-quality algorithm that <br>
does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.
The default value of the parameter is 2000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ira-loop-reserved-regs <br>
IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure
in loops for decisions to move loop invariants (see -O3).
The number of available registers reserved for some <br>
other purposes is given by this parameter. The default value
of the parameter is 2, which is the minimal number of
registers needed by typical instructions. This value <br>
is the best found from numerous experiments.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff
<br>
LRA tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in
subsequent insns. This optimization is called inheritance.
EBB is used as a region to do this optimization. The <br>
parameter defines a minimal fall-through edge probability in
percentage used to add BB to inheritance EBB in LRA. The
default value of the parameter is 40. The value <br>
was chosen from numerous runs of SPEC2000 on x86-64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop
<br>
Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in
compilation time and in amount of needed compile-time
memory, with very large loops. Loops with more basic blocks
<br>
than this parameter won&rsquo;t have loop invariant motion
optimization performed on them. The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for -O1 and 10000 for -O2 and above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps
<br>
Building data dependencies is expensive for very large
loops. This parameter limits the number of data references
in loops that are considered for data dependence <br>
analysis. These large loops are no handled by the
optimizations using loop data dependencies. The default
value is 1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-vartrack-size <br>
Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during
variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function. If this
limit is exceeded with variable tracking at <br>
assignments enabled, analysis for that function is retried
without it, after removing all debug insns from the
function. If the limit is exceeded even without debug <br>
insns, var tracking analysis is completely disabled for the
function. Setting the parameter to zero makes it
unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-vartrack-expr-depth <br>
Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to
map variable names or debug temporaries to value
expressions. This trades compilation time for more complete
<br>
debug information. If this is set too low, value expressions
that are available and could be represented in debug
information may end up not being used; setting this <br>
higher may enable the compiler to find more complex debug
expressions, but compile time and memory use may grow. The
default is 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-nondebug-insn-uid <br>
Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns. The
range below the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug
insns created by -fvar-tracking-assignments, but <br>
debug insns may get (non-overlapping) uids above it if the
reserved range is exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor <br>

transforms, the number of parameters in a Static Control
Part (SCoP) is bounded. The default value is 10 parameters.

To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the
size of the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded. The
default value is 100 basic blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-block-tile-size <br>
Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
-floop-block or -floop-strip-mine, strip mine each loop in
the loop nest by a given number of iterations. The <br>
strip length can be changed using the loop-block-tile-size
parameter. The default value is 51 iterations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop-unroll-jam-size <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-cp-value-list-size <br>
IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types
passed to a function&rsquo;s parameter in order to propagate
them and perform devirtualization. ipa-cp-value-list-size
<br>
is the maximum number of values and types it stores per one
formal parameter of a function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-cp-eval-threshold <br>

another function will receive when they are evaluated for
cloning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-max-agg-items <br>
IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar
values passed in an aggregate. ipa-max-agg-items controls
the maximum number of such values per one parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus <br>
When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make
the number of iterations of a loop known, it adds a bonus of
ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus to the profitability score <br>
of the candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus
<br>
When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would make
the index of an array access known, it adds a bonus of
ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus to the profitability score
<br>
of the candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa-max-aa-steps <br>
During its analysis of function bodies, IPA-CP employs alias
analysis in order to track values pointed to by function
parameters. In order not spend too much time <br>
analyzing huge functions, it gives up and consider all
memory clobbered after examining ipa-max-aa-steps statements
modifying memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lto-partitions <br>

<br>
The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions
when C++ name lookup fails for an identifier. The default is
1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sink-frequency-threshold <br>
The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of
the target block relative to a statement&rsquo;s original
block to allow statement sinking of a statement. Larger <br>
numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking. The
default value is 75. A small positive adjustment is applied
for statements with memory operands as those are <br>
even more profitable so sink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-stores-to-sink <br>
The maximum number of conditional store pairs that can be
sunk. Set to 0 if either vectorization (-ftree-vectorize) or
if-conversion (-ftree-loop-if-convert) is <br>
disabled. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow-store-data-races <br>
Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores. Set

dependent heuristics used by default if has non zero <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sched-pressure-algorithm <br>
Choose between the two available implementations of
-fsched-pressure. Algorithm 1 is the original implementation
and is the more likely to prevent instructions from <br>
being reordered. Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise
between the relatively conservative approach taken by
algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive approach taken <br>
by the default scheduler. It relies more heavily on having a
regular register file and accurate register pressure
classes. See haifa-sched.c in the GCC sources for more <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default choice depends on
the target.</p>

environment variable ASAN_OPTIONS.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program Instrumentation Options
<br>
GCC supports a number of command-line options that control
adding run-time instrumentation to the code it normally
generates. For example, one purpose of instrumentation is
<br>
collect profiling statistics for use in finding program hot
spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided
optimizations. Another class of program instrumentation is
adding <br>
run-time checking to detect programming errors like invalid
pointer dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as
well as deliberately hostile attacks such as stack smashing
<br>
or C++ vtable hijacking. There is also a general hook which
can be used to implement other forms of tracing or
function-level instrumentation for debug or program analysis
<br>
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Generate extra code to write
profile information suitable for the analysis program prof.
You must use this option when compiling the source files you
want data about, and <br>
you must also use it when linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pg Generate extra code to write
profile information suitable for the analysis program gprof.
You must use this option when compiling the source files you
want data about, and <br>
you must also use it when linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-arcs <br>
Add code so that program flow arcs are instrumented. During
execution the program records how many times each branch and
call is executed and how many times it is taken or <br>
returns. On targets that support constructors with priority
support, profiling properly handles constructors,
destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of
classes <br>
which are used as a type of a global variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the compiled program exits
it saves this data to a file called auxname.gcda for each
source file. The data may be used for profile-directed
optimizations <br>
(-fbranch-probabilities), or for test coverage analysis
(-ftest-coverage). Each object file&rsquo;s auxname is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
specified <br>
and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. In both cases any suffix is
removed (e.g. foo.gcda for input file dir/foo.c, or <br>
dir/foo.gcda for output file specified as -o dir/foo.o).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--coverage <br>
This option is used to compile and link code instrumented
for coverage analysis. The option is a synonym for
-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage (when compiling) and -lgcov
(when <br>
linking). See the documentation for those options for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Compile the source files with
-fprofile-arcs plus optimization and code generation
options. For test coverage analysis, use the additional
-ftest-coverage option. You <br>
do not need to profile every source file in a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Link your object files with
-lgcov or -fprofile-arcs (the latter implies the
former).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Run the program on a
representative workload to generate the arc profile
information. This may be repeated any number of times. You
can run concurrent instances of your <br>
program, and provided that the file system supports locking,
the data files will be correctly updated. Also
&quot;fork&quot; calls are detected and correctly handled
(double <br>
counting will not happen).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For profile-directed
optimizations, compile the source files again with the same
optimization and code generation options plus
-fbranch-probabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For test coverage analysis,
use gcov to produce human readable information from the
.gcno and .gcda files. Refer to the gcov documentation for
further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fprofile-arcs, for each
function of your program GCC creates a program flow graph,
then finds a spanning tree for the graph. Only arcs that are
not on the spanning <br>
tree have to be instrumented: the compiler adds code to
count the number of times that these arcs are executed. When
an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
<br>
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a
new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftest-coverage <br>
Produce a notes file that the gcov code-coverage utility can
use to show program coverage. Each source file&rsquo;s note
file is called auxname.gcno. Refer to the -fprofile-arcs
<br>
option above for a description of auxname and instructions
on how to generate test coverage data. Coverage data matches
the source files more closely if you do not optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-dir=path <br>
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to
path. This option affects only the profile data generated by
-fprofile-generate, -ftest-coverage, -fprofile-arcs <br>
and used by -fprofile-use and -fbranch-probabilities and its
related options. Both absolute and relative paths can be
used. By default, GCC uses the current directory as <br>
path, thus the profile data file appears in the same
directory as the object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-generate <br>
-fprofile-generate=path <br>
Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to
produce profile useful for later recompilation with profile
feedback based optimization. You must use <br>
-fprofile-generate both when compiling and when linking your
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
enabled: -fprofile-arcs, -fprofile-values, -fvpt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If path is specified, GCC looks
at the path to find the profile feedback data files. See
-fprofile-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To optimize the program based on
the collected profile information, use -fprofile-use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-update=method <br>
Alter the update method for an application instrumented for
profile feedback based optimization. The method argument
should be one of single, atomic or prefer-atomic. The <br>
first one is useful for single-threaded applications, while
the second one prevents profile corruption by emitting
thread-safe code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: When an application
does not properly join all threads (or creates an detached
thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using prefer-atomic would be
transformed either to atomic, when supported by a target, or
to single otherwise. The GCC driver automatically selects
prefer-atomic when <br>
-pthread is present in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=address <br>
Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs. The option enables
<br>
-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope. See
&lt;https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer&gt;
for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced
using the <br>
ASAN_OPTIONS environment variable. When set to
&quot;help=1&quot;, the available options are shown at
startup of the instrumented program. See <br>

&lt;https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags&gt;
for a list of supported options. The option cannot be
combined with -fsanitize=thread and/or <br>
-fcheck-pointer-bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=kernel-address <br>
Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel. See
&lt;https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki&gt; for more
details. The option cannot be combined with
-fcheck-pointer-bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=thread <br>
Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector. Memory
access instructions are instrumented to detect data race
bugs. See <br>

&lt;https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer&gt;
for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced
using the TSAN_OPTIONS environment variable; see <br>

&lt;https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags&gt;
for a list of supported options. The option cannot be
combined with -fsanitize=address, -fsanitize=leak <br>
and/or -fcheck-pointer-bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that sanitized atomic
builtins cannot throw exceptions when operating on invalid
memory addresses with non-call exceptions
(-fnon-call-exceptions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=leak <br>
Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector. This option
only matters for linking of executables and the executable
is linked against a library that overrides
&quot;malloc&quot; and <br>
other allocator functions. See
&lt;https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer&gt;
for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced
using the <br>
LSAN_OPTIONS environment variable. The option cannot be
combined with -fsanitize=thread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=undefined <br>
Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior
detector. Various computations are instrumented to detect
undefined behavior at runtime. Current suboptions <br>
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=shift <br>
This option enables checking that the result of a shift
operation is not undefined. Note that what exactly is
considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as
<br>
well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc. This option has two
suboptions, -fsanitize=shift-base and
-fsanitize=shift-exponent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=shift-exponent <br>
This option enables checking that the second argument of a
shift operation is not negative and is smaller than the
precision of the promoted first argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=shift-base <br>
If the second argument of a shift operation is within range,
check that the result of a shift operation is not undefined.
Note that what exactly is considered undefined <br>
differs slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO
C90 and C99, etc.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero
<br>
Detect integer division by zero as well as &quot;INT_MIN /
-1&quot; division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=unreachable <br>
With this option, the compiler turns the
&quot;__builtin_unreachable&quot; call into a diagnostics
message call instead. When reaching the
&quot;__builtin_unreachable&quot; call, the <br>
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=vla-bound <br>
This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of
a variable length array is positive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=null <br>
This option enables pointer checking. Particularly, the
application built with this option turned on will issue an
error message when it tries to dereference a NULL <br>
pointer, or if a reference (possibly an rvalue reference) is
bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked on an
object pointed by a NULL pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=return <br>
This option enables return statement checking. Programs
built with this option turned on will issue an error message
when the end of a non-void function is reached <br>
without actually returning a value. This option works in C++
only.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow
<br>
This option enables signed integer overflow checking. We
check that the result of &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, and
both unary and binary &quot;-&quot; does not overflow in the
signed arithmetics. <br>
Note, integer promotion rules must be taken into account.
That is, the following is not an overflow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">signed char a = SCHAR_MAX; <br>
a++;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=bounds <br>
This option enables instrumentation of array bounds. Various
out of bounds accesses are detected. Flexible array members,
flexible array member-like arrays, and <br>
initializers of variables with static storage are not
instrumented. The option cannot be combined with
-fcheck-pointer-bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=bounds-strict <br>
This option enables strict instrumentation of array bounds.
Most out of bounds accesses are detected, including flexible
array members and flexible array member-like <br>
arrays. Initializers of variables with static storage are
not instrumented. The option cannot be combined with
-fcheck-pointer-bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=alignment <br>
This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when
they are dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to
insufficiently aligned target, or when a method or <br>
constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=object-size <br>
This option enables instrumentation of memory references
using the &quot;__builtin_object_size&quot; function.
Various out of bounds pointer accesses are detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero
<br>
Detect floating-point division by zero. Unlike other similar
options, -fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero is not enabled by
-fsanitize=undefined, since floating-point <br>
division by zero can be a legitimate way of obtaining
infinities and NaNs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow
<br>
This option enables floating-point type to integer
conversion checking. We check that the result of the
conversion does not overflow. Unlike other similar options,
<br>
-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow is not enabled by
-fsanitize=undefined. This option does not work well with
&quot;FE_INVALID&quot; exceptions enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute
<br>
This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking
whether null values are not passed to arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the &quot;nonnull&quot;
function <br>
attribute.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute
<br>
This option enables instrumentation of return statements in
functions marked with &quot;returns_nonnull&quot; function
attribute, to detect returning of null values from such <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=bool <br>
This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool. If a
value other than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is
issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=enum <br>
This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum
type. If a value outside the range of values for the enum
type is loaded, a run-time error is issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize=vptr <br>
This option enables instrumentation of C++ member function
calls, member accesses and some conversions between pointers
to base and derived classes, to verify the <br>
referenced object has the correct dynamic type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While -ftrapv causes traps for
signed overflows to be emitted, -fsanitize=undefined gives a
diagnostic message. This currently works only for the C
family of languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-sanitize=all <br>
This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.
-fsanitize=all is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be
used together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fasan-shadow-offset=number <br>
This option forces GCC to use custom shadow offset in
AddressSanitizer checks. It is useful for experimenting with
different shadow memory layouts in Kernel <br>
AddressSanitizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize-sections=s1,s2,...
<br>
Sanitize global variables in selected user-defined sections.
si may contain wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize-recover[=opts] <br>
-fsanitize-recover= controls error recovery mode for
sanitizers mentioned in comma-separated list of opts.
Enabling this option for a sanitizer component causes it to
<br>
attempt to continue running the program as if no error
happened. This means multiple runtime errors can be reported
in a single program run, and the exit code of the program
<br>
may indicate success even when errors have been reported.
The -fno-sanitize-recover= option can be used to alter this
behavior: only the first detected error is reported and <br>
program then exits with a non-zero exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently this feature only
works for -fsanitize=undefined (and its suboptions except
for -fsanitize=unreachable and -fsanitize=return),
-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow, <br>
-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero, -fsanitize=bounds-strict,
-fsanitize=kernel-address and -fsanitize=address. For these
sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default, <br>
except -fsanitize=address, for which this feature is
experimental. -fsanitize-recover=all and
-fno-sanitize-recover=all is also accepted, the former
enables recovery for all <br>
sanitizers that support it, the latter disables recovery for
all sanitizers that support it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if a recovery mode is
turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also enabled on
the runtime library side, otherwise the failures are still
fatal. The runtime library <br>
defaults to &quot;halt_on_error=0&quot; for ThreadSanitizer
and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
AddressSanitizer is &quot;halt_on_error=1&quot;. This can be
overridden <br>
through setting the &quot;halt_on_error&quot; flag in the
corresponding environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax without an explicit opts
parameter is deprecated. It is equivalent to specifying an
opts list of:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero,bounds-strict</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope
<br>
Enable sanitization of local variables to detect
use-after-scope bugs. The option sets -fstack-reuse to
none.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error
<br>
The -fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error option instructs the
compiler to report undefined behavior using
&quot;__builtin_trap&quot; rather than a
&quot;libubsan&quot; library routine. The <br>
advantage of this is that the &quot;libubsan&quot; library
is not needed and is not linked in, so this is usable even
in freestanding environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc
<br>
Enable coverage-guided fuzzing code instrumentation. Inserts
a call to &quot;__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc&quot; into every
basic block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbounds-check <br>
For front ends that support it, generate additional code to
check that indices used to access arrays are within the
declared range. This is currently only supported by the <br>
Fortran front end, where this option defaults to false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcheck-pointer-bounds <br>
Enable Pointer Bounds Checker instrumentation. Each memory
reference is instrumented with checks of the pointer used
for memory access against bounds associated with that <br>
pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently there is only an
implementation for Intel MPX available, thus x86 GNU/Linux
target and -mmpx are required to enable this feature.
MPX-based instrumentation <br>
requires a runtime library to enable MPX in hardware and
handle bounds violation signals. By default when
-fcheck-pointer-bounds and -mmpx options are used to link a
<br>
program, the GCC driver links against the libmpx and
libmpxwrappers libraries. Bounds checking on calls to
dynamic libraries requires a linker with -z bndplt support;
if GCC <br>
was configured with a linker without support for this option
(including the Gold linker and older versions of ld), a
warning is given if you link with -mmpx without also <br>
specifying -static, since the overall effectiveness of the
bounds checking protection is reduced. See also
-static-libmpxwrappers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MPX-based instrumentation may be
used for debugging and also may be included in production
code to increase program security. Depending on usage, you
may have different <br>
requirements for the runtime library. The current version of
the MPX runtime library is more oriented for use as a
debugging tool. MPX runtime library usage implies <br>
-lpthread. See also -static-libmpx. The runtime library
behavior can be influenced using various CHKP_RT_*
environment variables. See <br>

&lt;https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler&gt;
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generated instrumentation may be
controlled by various -fchkp-* options and by the
&quot;bnd_variable_size&quot; structure field attribute and
&quot;bnd_legacy&quot;, and &quot;bnd_instrument&quot; <br>
function attributes. GCC also provides a number of built-in
functions for controlling the Pointer Bounds Checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-check-incomplete-type
<br>
Generate pointer bounds checks for variables with incomplete
type. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-narrow-bounds <br>
Controls bounds used by Pointer Bounds Checker for pointers
to object fields. If narrowing is enabled then field bounds
are used. Otherwise object bounds are used. See <br>
also -fchkp-narrow-to-innermost-array and
-fchkp-first-field-has-own-bounds. Enabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-first-field-has-own-bounds
<br>
Forces Pointer Bounds Checker to use narrowed bounds for the
address of the first field in the structure. By default a
pointer to the first field has the same bounds as a <br>
pointer to the whole structure.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-flexible-struct-trailing-arrays
<br>
Forces Pointer Bounds Checker to treat all trailing arrays
in structures as possibly flexible. By default only array
fields with zero length or that are marked with <br>
attribute bnd_variable_size are treated as flexible.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-narrow-to-innermost-array
<br>
Forces Pointer Bounds Checker to use bounds of the innermost
arrays in case of nested static array access. By default
this option is disabled and bounds of the outermost <br>
array are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-optimize <br>
Enables Pointer Bounds Checker optimizations. Enabled by
default at optimization levels -O, -O2, -O3.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-use-fast-string-functions
<br>
Enables use of *_nobnd versions of string functions (not
copying bounds) by Pointer Bounds Checker. Disabled by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-use-nochk-string-functions
<br>
Enables use of *_nochk versions of string functions (not
checking bounds) by Pointer Bounds Checker. Disabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-use-static-bounds <br>
Allow Pointer Bounds Checker to generate static bounds
holding bounds of static variables. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-use-static-const-bounds
<br>
Use statically-initialized bounds for constant bounds
instead of generating them each time they are required. By
default enabled when -fchkp-use-static-bounds is
enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-treat-zero-dynamic-size-as-infinite
<br>
With this option, objects with incomplete type whose
dynamically-obtained size is zero are treated as having
infinite size instead by Pointer Bounds Checker. This option
may <br>
be helpful if a program is linked with a library missing
size information for some symbols. Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-check-read <br>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to generate checks for all
read accesses to memory. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-check-write <br>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to generate checks for all
write accesses to memory. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-store-bounds <br>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to generate bounds stores
for pointer writes. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-instrument-calls <br>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to pass pointer bounds to
calls. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-instrument-marked-only
<br>
Instructs Pointer Bounds Checker to instrument only
functions marked with the &quot;bnd_instrument&quot;
attribute. Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchkp-use-wrappers <br>
Allows Pointer Bounds Checker to replace calls to built-in
functions with calls to wrapper functions. When
-fchkp-use-wrappers is used to link a program, the GCC
driver <br>
automatically links against libmpxwrappers. See also
-static-libmpxwrappers. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-protector <br>
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
smashing attacks. This is done by adding a guard variable to
functions with vulnerable objects. This includes <br>
functions that call &quot;alloca&quot;, and functions with
buffers larger than 8 bytes. The guards are initialized when
a function is entered and then checked when the function
exits. <br>
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the
program exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-protector-all <br>
Like -fstack-protector except that all functions are
protected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-protector-strong <br>
Like -fstack-protector but includes additional functions to
be protected --- those that have local array definitions, or
have references to local frame addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-protector-explicit <br>
Like -fstack-protector but only protects those functions
which have the &quot;stack_protect&quot; attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-check <br>
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the
boundary of the stack. You should specify this flag if you
are running in an environment with multiple threads, but you
<br>
only rarely need to specify it in a single-threaded
environment since stack overflow is automatically detected
on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this switch does not
actually cause checking to be done; the operating system or
the language runtime must do that. The switch causes
generation of code to ensure <br>
that they see the stack being extended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can additionally specify a
string parameter: no means no checking, generic means force
the use of old-style checking, specific means use the best
checking method and is <br>
equivalent to bare -fstack-check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old-style checking is a generic
mechanism that requires no specific target support in the
compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Modified allocation strategy
for large objects: they are always allocated dynamically if
their size exceeds a fixed threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Fixed limit on the size of
the static frame of functions: when it is topped by a
particular function, stack checking is not reliable and a
warning is issued by the <br>
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Inefficiency: because of both
the modified allocation strategy and the generic
implementation, code performance is hampered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that old-style stack
checking is also the fallback method for specific if no
target support has been added in the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-limit-register=reg <br>
-fstack-limit-symbol=sym <br>
-fno-stack-limit <br>
Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond
a certain value, either the value of a register or the
address of a symbol. If a larger stack is required, a <br>
signal is raised at run time. For most targets, the signal
is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so it is
possible to catch the signal without taking special <br>
precautions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if the stack
starts at absolute address 0x80000000 and grows downwards,
you can use the flags -fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit and
<br>
-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000 to enforce a stack
limit of 128KB. Note that this may only work with the GNU
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can locally override stack
limit checking by using the &quot;no_stack_limit&quot;
function attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsplit-stack <br>
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it
overflows. The resulting program has a discontiguous stack
which can only overflow if the program is unable to <br>
allocate any more memory. This is most useful when running
threaded programs, as it is no longer necessary to calculate
a good stack size to use for each thread. This is <br>
currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When code compiled with
-fsplit-stack calls code compiled without -fsplit-stack,
there may not be much stack space available for the latter
code to run. If compiling all <br>
code, including library code, with -fsplit-stack is not an
option, then the linker can fix up these calls so that the
code compiled without -fsplit-stack always has a large <br>
stack. Support for this is implemented in the gold linker in
GNU binutils release 2.21 and later.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvtable-verify=[std|preinit|none]
<br>
This option is only available when compiling C++ code. It
turns on (or off, if using -fvtable-verify=none) the
security feature that verifies at run time, for every
virtual <br>
call, that the vtable pointer through which the call is made
is valid for the type of the object, and has not been
corrupted or overwritten. If an invalid vtable pointer is
<br>
detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of
the program is immediately halted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes run-time data
structures to be built at program startup, which are used
for verifying the vtable pointers. The options std and
preinit control the timing <br>
of when these data structures are built. In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches
&quot;main&quot;. Using -fvtable-verify=std causes the data
structures <br>
to be built after shared libraries have been loaded and
initialized. -fvtable-verify=preinit causes them to be built
before shared libraries have been loaded and <br>
initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option appears multiple
times in the command line with different values specified,
none takes highest priority over both std and preinit;
preinit takes priority over <br>
std.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvtv-debug <br>
When used in conjunction with -fvtable-verify=std or
-fvtable-verify=preinit, causes debug versions of the
runtime functions for the vtable verification feature to be
called. <br>
This flag also causes the compiler to log information about
which vtable pointers it finds for each class. This
information is written to a file named vtv_set_ptr_data.log
<br>
in the directory named by the environment variable
VTV_LOGS_DIR if that is defined or the current working
directory otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This feature appends data
to the log file. If you want a fresh log file, be sure to
delete any existing one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvtv-counts <br>
This is a debugging flag. When used in conjunction with
-fvtable-verify=std or -fvtable-verify=preinit, this causes
the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual
<br>
calls it encounters and the number of verifications it
inserts. It also counts the number of calls to certain
run-time library functions that it inserts and logs this
<br>
information for each compilation unit. The compiler writes
this information to a file named vtv_count_data.log in the
directory named by the environment variable <br>
VTV_LOGS_DIR if that is defined or the current working
directory otherwise. It also counts the size of the vtable
pointer sets for each class, and writes this information to
<br>
vtv_class_set_sizes.log in the same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This feature appends data
to the log files. To get fresh log files, be sure to delete
any existing ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions <br>
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to
functions. Just after function entry and just before
function exit, the following profiling functions are called
with <br>
the address of the current function and its call site. (On
some platforms, &quot;__builtin_return_address&quot; does
not work beyond the current function, so the call site
information <br>
may not be available to the profiling functions
otherwise.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void __cyg_profile_func_enter
(void *this_fn, <br>
void *call_site); <br>
void __cyg_profile_func_exit (void *this_fn, <br>
void *call_site);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first argument is the
address of the start of the current function, which may be
looked up exactly in the symbol table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This instrumentation is also
done for functions expanded inline in other functions. The
profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the inline
function is entered and <br>
exited. This means that addressable versions of such
functions must be available. If all your uses of a function
are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion
<br>
of code size. If you use &quot;extern inline&quot; in your C
code, an addressable version of such functions must be
provided. (This is normally the case anyway, but if you get
lucky <br>
and the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you
might have gotten away without providing static copies.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A function may be given the
attribute &quot;no_instrument_function&quot;, in which case
this instrumentation is not done. This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions <br>
listed above, high-priority interrupt routines, and any
functions from which the profiling functions cannot safely
be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling <br>
routines generate output or allocate memory).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=file,file,...
<br>
Set the list of functions that are excluded from
instrumentation (see the description of
-finstrument-functions). If the file that contains a
function definition matches <br>
with one of file, then that function is not instrumented.
The match is done on substrings: if the file parameter is a
substring of the file name, it is considered to be a <br>
match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">excludes any inline function
defined in files whose pathnames contain /bits/stl or
include/sys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, for some reason, you want to
include letter , in one of sym, write ,. For example,
-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=&rsquo;,,tmp&rsquo;
(note the single quote surrounding the <br>
option).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,...
<br>
This is similar to -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list,
but this option sets the list of function names to be
excluded from instrumentation. The function name to be <br>
matched is its user-visible name, such as
&quot;vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt;
&amp;)&quot;, not the internal mangled name (e.g.,
&quot;_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE&quot;). The match is done on
<br>
substrings: if the sym parameter is a substring of the
function name, it is considered to be a match. For C99 and
C++ extended identifiers, the function name must be given
<br>
in UTF-8, not using universal character names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Controlling the
Preprocessor <br>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on
each C source file before actual compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use the -E option,
nothing is done except preprocessing. Some of these options
make sense only together with -E because they cause the
preprocessor output to be <br>
unsuitable for actual compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the options
listed here, there are a number of options to control search
paths for include files documented in Directory Options.
Options to control preprocessor <br>
diagnostics are listed in Warning Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name <br>
Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name=definition <br>
The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a #define
directive. In particular, the definition is truncated <br>
by embedded newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are invoking the
preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need
to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a <br>
meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to define a
function-like macro on the command line, write its argument
list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if
any). Parentheses are <br>
meaningful to most shells, so you should quote the option.
With sh and csh, -D&rsquo;name(args...)=definition&rsquo;
works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D and -U options are processed
in the order they are given on the command line. All
-imacros file and -include file options are processed after
all -D and -U options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U name <br>
Cancel any previous definition of name, either built in or
provided with a -D option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include file <br>
Process file as if &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;
appeared as the first line of the primary source file.
However, the first directory searched for file is the
preprocessor&rsquo;s working <br>
directory instead of the directory containing the main
source file. If not found there, it is searched for in the
remainder of the &quot;#include &quot;...&quot;&quot; search
chain as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple -include options are
given, the files are included in the order they appear on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imacros file <br>
Exactly like -include, except that any output produced by
scanning file is thrown away. Macros it defines remain
defined. This allows you to acquire all the macros from a
<br>
header without also processing its declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All files specified by -imacros
are processed before all files specified by -include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-undef <br>
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
The standard predefined macros remain defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pthread <br>
Define additional macros required for using the POSIX
threads library. You should use this option consistently for
both compilation and linking. This option is supported on
<br>
GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on
x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Instead of outputting the
result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make
describing the dependencies of the main source file. The
preprocessor outputs one make <br>
rule containing the object file name for that source file, a
colon, and the names of all the included files, including
those coming from -include or -imacros command-line <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless specified explicitly
(with -MT or -MQ), the object file name consists of the name
of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file
suffix and with any <br>
leading directory parts removed. If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using
&minus;newline. The rule has no commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not suppress
the preprocessor&rsquo;s debug output, such as -dM. To avoid
mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you
should explicitly specify the <br>
dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment
variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT. Debug output is still
sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing -M to the driver implies
-E, and suppresses warnings with an implicit -w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MM Like -M but do not mention
header files that are found in system header directories,
nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly,
from such a header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This implies that the choice of
angle brackets or double quotes in an #include directive
does not in itself determine whether that header appears in
-MM dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MF file <br>
When used with -M or -MM, specifies a file to write the
dependencies to. If no -MF switch is given the preprocessor
sends the rules to the same place it would send <br>
preprocessed output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used with the driver
options -MD or -MMD, -MF overrides the default dependency
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MG In conjunction with an
option such as -M requesting dependency generation, -MG
assumes missing header files are generated files and adds
them to the dependency list without <br>
raising an error. The dependency filename is taken directly
from the &quot;#include&quot; directive without prepending
any path. -MG also suppresses preprocessed output, as a
missing <br>
header file renders this useless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is used in
automatic updating of makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MP This option instructs CPP to
add a phony target for each dependency other than the main
file, causing each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules
work around errors make <br>
gives if you remove header files without updating the
Makefile to match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is typical output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.o: test.c test.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">test.h:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MT target <br>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
generation. By default CPP takes the name of the main input
file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix
<br>
such as .c, and appends the platform&rsquo;s usual object
suffix. The result is the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An -MT option sets the target to
be exactly the string you specify. If you want multiple
targets, you can specify them as a single argument to -MT,
or use multiple -MT <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -MT
&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo; might give</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MQ target <br>
Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters which are special
to Make. -MQ &rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo; gives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default target is
automatically quoted, as if it were given with -MQ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MD -MD is equivalent to -M -MF
file, except that -E is not implied. The driver determines
file based on whether an -o option is given. If it is, the
driver uses its argument <br>
but with a suffix of .d, otherwise it takes the name of the
input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a .d suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -MD is used in conjunction
with -E, any -o switch is understood to specify the
dependency output file, but if used without -E, each -o is
understood to specify a target <br>
object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since -E is not implied, -MD can
be used to generate a dependency output file as a
side-effect of the compilation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-MMD <br>
Like -MD except mention only user header files, not system
header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpreprocessed <br>
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already
been preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro
expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing,
<br>
and processing of most directives. The preprocessor still
recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file
preprocessed with -C to the compiler without problems. <br>
In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpreprocessed is implicit if
the input file has one of the extensions .i, .ii or .mi.
These are the extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed
files created by -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdirectives-only <br>
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option&rsquo;s behavior
depends on the -E and -fpreprocessed options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -E, preprocessing is
limited to the handling of directives such as
&quot;#define&quot;, &quot;#ifdef&quot;, and
&quot;#error&quot;. Other preprocessor operations, such as
macro expansion and <br>
trigraph conversion are not performed. In addition, the -dD
option is implicitly enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -fpreprocessed,
predefinition of command line and most builtin macros is
disabled. Macros such as &quot;__LINE__&quot;, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally. <br>
This enables compilation of files previously preprocessed
with &quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With both -E and -fpreprocessed,
the rules for -fpreprocessed take precedence. This enables
full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed with
&quot;-E -fdirectives-only&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdollars-in-identifiers <br>
Accept $ in identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fextended-identifiers <br>
Accept universal character names in identifiers. This option
is enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard
versions) and C++.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-canonical-system-headers
<br>
When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with
canonicalization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftabstop=width <br>
Set the distance between tab stops. This helps the
preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or
errors, even if tabs appear on the line. If the value is
less <br>
than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored. The
default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]
<br>
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This
allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current
macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a
<br>
macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor
and the compiler consume more memory. The level parameter
can be used to choose the level of precision of token <br>
location tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if
necessary. Value 0 of level de-activates this option. Value
1 tracks tokens locations in a degraded mode for the <br>
sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode all tokens
resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value 2 tracks
tokens <br>
locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter
value is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;-ftrack-macro-expansion=2&quot; is activated by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexec-charset=charset <br>
Set the execution character set, used for string and
character constants. The default is UTF-8. charset can be
any encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
&quot;iconv&quot; library <br>
routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwide-exec-charset=charset <br>
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string
and character constants. The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16,
whichever corresponds to the width of &quot;wchar_t&quot;.
As <br>
with -fexec-charset, charset can be any encoding supported
by the system&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; library routine;
however, you will have problems with encodings that do not
fit exactly in <br>
&quot;wchar_t&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finput-charset=charset <br>
Set the input character set, used for translation from the
character set of the input file to the source character set
used by GCC. If the locale does not specify, or GCC <br>
cannot get this information from the locale, the default is
UTF-8. This can be overridden by either the locale or this
command-line option. Currently the command-line <br>
option takes precedence if there&rsquo;s a conflict. charset
can be any encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
&quot;iconv&quot; library routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpch-deps <br>
When using precompiled headers, this flag causes the
dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header&rsquo;s dependencies. If not specified,
only the <br>
precompiled header are listed and not the files that were
used to create it, because those files are not consulted
when a precompiled header is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpch-preprocess <br>
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with
-E. It inserts a special &quot;#pragma&quot;, &quot;#pragma
GCC pch_preprocess &quot;filename&quot;&quot; in the output
to mark the place <br>
where the precompiled header was found, and its filename.
When -fpreprocessed is in use, GCC recognizes this
&quot;#pragma&quot; and loads the PCH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is off by default,
because the resulting preprocessed output is only really
suitable as input to GCC. It is switched on by
-save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should not write this
&quot;#pragma&quot; in your own code, but it is safe to edit
the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location. The filename may be absolute <br>
or it may be relative to GCC&rsquo;s current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fworking-directory <br>
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output
that let the compiler know the current working directory at
the time of preprocessing. When this option is <br>
enabled, the preprocessor emits, after the initial
linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working
directory followed by two slashes. GCC uses this directory,
when <br>
it&rsquo;s present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some
debugging information formats. This option is implicitly
enabled if <br>
debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited
with the negated form -fno-working-directory. If the -P flag
is present in the command line, this option has no <br>
effect, since no &quot;#line&quot; directives are emitted
whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A predicate=answer <br>
Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer. This form is preferred to the older form -A
predicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does
<br>
not use shell special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A -predicate=answer <br>
Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Do not discard comments. All
comments are passed through to the output file, except for
comments in processed directives, which are deleted along
with the directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be prepared for side
effects when using -C; it causes the preprocessor to treat
comments as tokens in their own right. For example, comments
appearing at the <br>
start of what would be a directive line have the effect of
turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the
first token on the line is no longer a #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CC Do not discard comments,
including during macro expansion. This is like -C, except
that comments contained within macros are also passed
through to the output file where the <br>
macro is expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the side-effects
of the -C option, the -CC option causes all C++-style
comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments.
This is to prevent later <br>
use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the
remainder of the source line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -CC option is generally used
to support lint comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Inhibit generation of
linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor. This might
be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent <br>
to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-traditional <br>
-traditional-cpp <br>
Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors,
as opposed to ISO C preprocessors. See the GNU CPP manual
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that GCC does not otherwise
attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler, and these
options are only supported with the -E switch, or when
invoking CPP explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trigraphs <br>
Support ISO C trigraphs. These are three-character
sequences, all starting with ??, that are defined by ISO C
to stand for single characters. For example, ??/ stands for
<br>
so &rsquo;??/n&rsquo; is a character constant for a
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nine trigraphs and their
replacements are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trigraph: ??( ??) ??&lt; ??&gt;
??= ??/ ??&rsquo; ??! ??- <br>
Replacement: [ ] { } # &nbsp; ^ | ~</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, GCC ignores
trigraphs, but in standard-conforming modes it converts
them. See the -std and -ansi options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-remap <br>
Enable special code to work around file systems which only
permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print the name of each header
file used, in addition to other normal activities. Each name
is indented to show how deep in the #include stack it is.
Precompiled header <br>
files are also printed, even if they are found to be
invalid; an invalid precompiled header file is printed with
...x and a valid one with ...! .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dletters <br>
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified
by letters. The flags documented here are those relevant to
the preprocessor. Other letters are interpreted by <br>
the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC,
and so are silently ignored. If you specify letters whose
behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dM Instead of the normal
output, generate a list of #define directives for all the
macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor,
including predefined macros. <br>
This gives you a way of finding out what is predefined in
your version of the preprocessor. Assuming you have no file
foo.h, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shows all the predefined
macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use -dM without the -E
option, -dM is interpreted as a synonym for
-fdump-rtl-mach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dD Like -dM except in two
respects: it does not include the predefined macros, and it
outputs both the #define directives and the result of
preprocessing. Both kinds of <br>
output go to the standard output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dN Like -dD, but emit only the
macro names, not their expansions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dI Output #include directives
in addition to the result of preprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dU Like -dD except that only
macros that are expanded, or whose definedness is tested in
preprocessor directives, are output; the output is delayed
until the use or test of <br>
the macro; and #undef directives are also output for macros
tested but undefined at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdebug-cpp <br>
This option is only useful for debugging GCC. When used from
CPP or with -E, it dumps debugging information about
location maps. Every token in the output is preceded by <br>
the dump of the map its location belongs to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used from GCC without -E,
this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wp,option <br>
You can use -Wp,option to bypass the compiler driver and
pass option directly through to the preprocessor. If option
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at <br>
the commas. However, many options are modified, translated
or interpreted by the compiler driver before being passed to
the preprocessor, and -Wp forcibly bypasses this <br>
phase. The preprocessor&rsquo;s direct interface is
undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible you
should avoid using -Wp and let the driver handle the options
<br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xpreprocessor option <br>
Pass option as an option to the preprocessor. You can use
this to supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC
does not recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to pass an option
that takes an argument, you must use -Xpreprocessor twice,
once for the option and once for the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-integrated-cpp <br>
Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part
of input tokenization and parsing. If this option <br>
is provided, the appropriate language front end (cc1,
cc1plus, or cc1obj for C, C++, and Objective-C,
respectively) is instead invoked twice, once for
preprocessing only and <br>
once for actual compilation of the preprocessed input. This
option may be useful in conjunction with the -B or -wrapper
options to specify an alternate preprocessor or <br>
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passing Options to the Assembler
<br>
You can pass options to the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wa,option <br>
Pass option as an option to the assembler. If option
contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xassembler option <br>
Pass option as an option to the assembler. You can use this
to supply system-specific assembler options that GCC does
not recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to pass an option
that takes an argument, you must use -Xassembler twice, once
for the option and once for the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Linking <br>
These options come into play when the compiler links object
files into an executable output file. They are meaningless
if the compiler is not doing a link step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object-file-name <br>
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix
is considered to name an object file or library. (Object
files are distinguished from libraries by the linker <br>
according to the file contents.) If linking is done, these
object files are used as input to the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
-S <br>
-E If any of these options is used, then the linker is not
run, and object file names should not be used as
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-ld=bfd <br>
Use the bfd linker instead of the default linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-ld=gold <br>
Use the gold linker instead of the default linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llibrary <br>
-l library <br>
Search the library named library when linking. (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only
for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It makes a difference where in
the command you write this option; the linker searches and
processes libraries and object files in the order they are
specified. Thus, foo.o <br>
-lz bar.o searches library z after file foo.o but before
bar.o. If bar.o refers to functions in z, those functions
may not be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The linker searches a standard
list of directories for the library, which is actually a
file named liblibrary.a. The linker then uses this file as
if it had been specified <br>
precisely by name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directories searched include
several standard system directories plus any that you
specify with -L.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally the files found this
way are library files---archive files whose members are
object files. The linker handles an archive file by scanning
through it for members <br>
which define symbols that have so far been referenced but
not defined. But if the file that is found is an ordinary
object file, it is linked in the usual fashion. The only
<br>
difference between using an -l option and specifying a file
name is that -l surrounds library with lib and .a and
searches several directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lobjc <br>
You need this special case of the -l option in order to link
an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostartfiles <br>
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless
-nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nodefaultlibs <br>
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking. Only
the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and
options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such
<br>
as -static-libgcc or -shared-libgcc, are ignored. The
standard startup files are used normally, unless
-nostartfiles is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler may generate calls
to &quot;memcmp&quot;, &quot;memset&quot;,
&quot;memcpy&quot; and &quot;memmove&quot;. These entries
are usually resolved by entries in libc. These entry points
should be supplied <br>
through some other mechanism when this option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdlib <br>
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries
when linking. No startup files and only the libraries you
specify are passed to the linker, and options specifying
<br>
linkage of the system libraries, such as -static-libgcc or
-shared-libgcc, are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler may generate calls
to &quot;memcmp&quot;, &quot;memset&quot;,
&quot;memcpy&quot; and &quot;memmove&quot;. These entries
are usually resolved by entries in libc. These entry points
should be supplied <br>
through some other mechanism when this option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the standard libraries
bypassed by -nostdlib and -nodefaultlibs is libgcc.a, a
library of internal subroutines which GCC uses to overcome
shortcomings of particular <br>
machines, or special needs for some languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In most cases, you need libgcc.a
even when you want to avoid other standard libraries. In
other words, when you specify -nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs
you should usually <br>
specify -lgcc as well. This ensures that you have no
unresolved references to internal GCC library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is
&quot;__main&quot;, used <br>
to ensure C++ constructors are called.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pie <br>
Produce a position independent executable on targets that
support it. For predictable results, you must also specify
the same set of options used for compilation (-fpie, <br>
-fPIE, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-pie <br>
Don&rsquo;t produce a position independent executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pthread <br>
Link with the POSIX threads library. This option is
supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives,
and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets. On some targets
<br>
this option also sets flags for the preprocessor, so it
should be used consistently for both compilation and
linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rdynamic <br>
Pass the flag -export-dynamic to the ELF linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all
symbols, not only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table.
<br>
This option is needed for some uses of &quot;dlopen&quot; or
to allow obtaining backtraces from within a program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Remove all symbol table and
relocation information from the executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static <br>
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents
linking with the shared libraries. On other systems, this
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared <br>
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
objects to form an executable. Not all systems support this
option. For predictable results, you must also <br>
specify the same set of options used for compilation (-fpic,
-fPIC, or model suboptions) when you specify this linker
option.[1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared-libgcc <br>
-static-libgcc <br>
On systems that provide libgcc as a shared library, these
options force the use of either the shared or static
version, respectively. If no shared version of libgcc was
<br>
built when the compiler was configured, these options have
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several situations in
which an application should use the shared libgcc instead of
the static version. The most common of these is when the
application wishes to <br>
throw and catch exceptions across different shared
libraries. In that case, each of the libraries as well as
the application itself should use the shared libgcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Therefore, the G++ and driver
automatically adds -shared-libgcc <br>
whenever you build a shared library or a main executable,
because C++ <br>
programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right
thing to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, instead, you use the GCC
driver to create shared libraries, you may find that they
are not always linked with the shared libgcc. If GCC finds,
at its configuration time, <br>
that you have a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not
support option --eh-frame-hdr, it links the shared version
of libgcc into shared libraries by default. <br>
Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of libgcc, linking
with the static version of libgcc by default. This <br>
allows exceptions to propagate through such shared
libraries, without incurring relocation costs at library
load time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if a library or main
executable is supposed to throw or catch exceptions, you
must link it using the G++ driver, as appropriate for the
languages used in the <br>
program, or using the option -shared-libgcc, such that it is
linked with the shared libgcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libasan <br>
When the -fsanitize=address option is used to link a
program, the GCC driver automatically links against libasan.
If libasan is available as a shared library, and the <br>
-static option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of libasan. The -static-libasan option
directs the GCC driver to link libasan statically, without
<br>
necessarily linking other libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libtsan <br>
When the -fsanitize=thread option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against libtsan. If
libtsan is available as a shared library, and the -static
<br>
option is not used, then this links against the shared
version of libtsan. The -static-libtsan option directs the
GCC driver to link libtsan statically, without necessarily
<br>
linking other libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-liblsan <br>
When the -fsanitize=leak option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against liblsan. If
liblsan is available as a shared library, and the -static
<br>
option is not used, then this links against the shared
version of liblsan. The -static-liblsan option directs the
GCC driver to link liblsan statically, without necessarily
<br>
linking other libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libubsan <br>
When the -fsanitize=undefined option is used to link a
program, the GCC driver automatically links against
libubsan. If libubsan is available as a shared library, and
the <br>
-static option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of libubsan. The -static-libubsan option
directs the GCC driver to link libubsan statically, without
<br>
necessarily linking other libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libmpx <br>
When the -fcheck-pointer bounds and -mmpx options are used
to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links
against libmpx. If libmpx is available as a shared library,
<br>
and the -static option is not used, then this links against
the shared version of libmpx. The -static-libmpx option
directs the GCC driver to link libmpx statically, without
<br>
necessarily linking other libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libmpxwrappers <br>
When the -fcheck-pointer bounds and -mmpx options are used
to link a program without also using -fno-chkp-use-wrappers,
the GCC driver automatically links against <br>
libmpxwrappers. If libmpxwrappers is available as a shared
library, and the -static option is not used, then this links
against the shared version of libmpxwrappers. The <br>
-static-libmpxwrappers option directs the GCC driver to link
libmpxwrappers statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libstdc++ <br>
When the g++ program is used to link a C++ program, it
normally automatically links against libstdc++. If libstdc++
is available as a shared library, and the -static option
<br>
is not used, then this links against the shared version of
libstdc++. That is normally fine. However, it is sometimes
useful to freeze the version of libstdc++ used by the <br>
program without going all the way to a fully static link.
The -static-libstdc++ option directs the g++ driver to link
libstdc++ statically, without necessarily linking other <br>
libraries statically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-symbolic <br>
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared
object. Warn about any unresolved references (unless
overridden by the link editor option -Xlinker -z -Xlinker
<br>
defs). Only a few systems support this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T script <br>
Use script as the linker script. This option is supported by
most systems using the GNU linker. On some targets, such as
bare-board targets without an operating system, the <br>
-T option may be required when linking to avoid references
to undefined symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xlinker option <br>
Pass option as an option to the linker. You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not
recognize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to pass an option
that takes a separate argument, you must use -Xlinker twice,
once for the option and once for the argument. For example,
to pass -assert <br>
definitions, you must write -Xlinker -assert -Xlinker
definitions. It does not work to write -Xlinker
&quot;-assert definitions&quot;, because this passes the
entire string as a <br>
single argument, which is not what the linker expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the GNU linker, it is
usually more convenient to pass arguments to linker options
using the option=value syntax than as separate arguments.
For example, you can <br>
specify -Xlinker -Map=output.map rather than -Xlinker -Map
-Xlinker output.map. Other linkers may not support this
syntax for command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wl,option <br>
Pass option as an option to the linker. If option contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas. You
can use this syntax to pass an argument to the <br>
option. For example, -Wl,-Map,output.map passes -Map
output.map to the linker. When using the GNU linker, you can
also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u symbol <br>
Pretend the symbol symbol is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it. You can use -u multiple times
with different symbols to force loading of additional <br>
library modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z keyword <br>
-z is passed directly on to the linker along with the
keyword keyword. See the section in the documentation of
your linker for permitted values and their meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Directory Search
<br>
These options specify directories to search for header
files, for libraries and for parts of the compiler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dir <br>
-iquote dir <br>
-isystem dir <br>
-idirafter dir <br>
Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be
searched for header files during preprocessing. If dir
begins with =, then the = is replaced by the sysroot prefix;
<br>
see --sysroot and -isysroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directories specified with
-iquote apply only to the quote form of the directive,
&quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;. Directories specified
with -I, -isystem, or -idirafter apply to lookup <br>
for both the &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot; and
&quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot; directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify any number or
combination of these options on the command line to search
for header files in several directories. The lookup order is
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. For the quote form of the
include directive, the directory of the current file is
searched first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. For the quote form of the
include directive, the directories specified by -iquote
options are searched in left-to-right order, as they appear
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Directories specified with -I
options are scanned in left-to-right order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Directories specified with
-isystem options are scanned in left-to-right order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Standard system directories
are scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Directories specified with
-idirafter options are scanned in left-to-right order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use -I to override a
system header file, substituting your own version, since
these directories are searched before the standard system
header file directories. <br>
However, you should not use this option to add directories
that contain vendor-supplied system header files; use
-isystem for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -isystem and -idirafter
options also mark the directory as a system directory, so
that it gets the same special treatment that is applied to
the standard system <br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a standard system include
directory, or a directory specified with -isystem, is also
specified with -I, the -I option is ignored. The directory
is still searched but as a <br>
system directory at its normal position in the system
include chain. This is to ensure that GCC&rsquo;s procedure
to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the <br>
&quot;#include_next&quot; directive are not inadvertently
changed. If you really need to change the search order for
system directories, use the -nostdinc and/or -isystem
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I- Split the include path. This
option has been deprecated. Please use -iquote instead for
-I directories before the -I- and remove the -I- option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any directories specified with
-I options before -I- are searched only for headers
requested with &quot;#include &quot;file&quot;&quot;; they
are not searched for &quot;#include &lt;file&gt;&quot;. If
<br>
additional directories are specified with -I options after
the -I-, those directories are searched for all #include
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, -I- inhibits the
use of the directory of the current file directory as the
first search directory for &quot;#include
&quot;file&quot;&quot;. There is no way to override this
effect <br>
of -I-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iprefix prefix <br>
Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix
options. If the prefix represents a directory, you should
include the final /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iwithprefix dir <br>
-iwithprefixbefore dir <br>
Append dir to the prefix specified previously with -iprefix,
and add the resulting directory to the include search path.
-iwithprefixbefore puts it in the same place -I <br>
would; -iwithprefix puts it where -idirafter would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isysroot dir <br>
This option is like the --sysroot option, but applies only
to header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies
to both header files and libraries). See the <br>
--sysroot option for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-imultilib dir <br>
Use dir as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc <br>
Do not search the standard system directories for header
files. Only the directories explicitly specified with -I,
-iquote, -isystem, and/or -idirafter options (and the <br>
directory of the current file, if appropriate) are
searched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostdinc++ <br>
Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
directories, but do still search the other standard
directories. (This option is used when building the C++ <br>
library.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iplugindir=dir <br>
Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed by
-fplugin=name instead of -fplugin=path/name.so. This option
is not meant to be used by the user, but only passed <br>
by the driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ldir <br>
Add directory dir to the list of directories to be searched
for -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bprefix <br>
This option specifies where to find the executables,
libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler driver program runs
one or more of the subprograms cpp, cc1, as and ld. It tries
prefix as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both
with and without <br>
machine/version/ for the corresponding target machine and
compiler version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each subprogram to be run,
the compiler driver first tries the -B prefix, if any. If
that name is not found, or if -B is not specified, the
driver tries two standard <br>
prefixes, /usr/lib/gcc/ and /usr/local/lib/gcc/. If neither
of those results in a file name that is found, the
unmodified program name is searched for using the
directories <br>
specified in your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compiler checks to see if
the path provided by -B refers to a directory, and if
necessary it adds a directory separator character at the end
of the path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B prefixes that effectively
specify directory names also apply to libraries in the
linker, because the compiler translates these options into
-L options for the linker. <br>
They also apply to include files in the preprocessor,
because the compiler translates these options into -isystem
options for the preprocessor. In this case, the compiler
<br>
appends include to the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The runtime support file
libgcc.a can also be searched for using the -B prefix, if
needed. If it is not found there, the two standard prefixes
above are tried, and that is <br>
all. The file is left out of the link if it is not found by
those means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to specify a prefix
much like the -B prefix is to use the environment variable
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special kludge, if the path
provided by -B is [dir/]stageN/, where N is a number in the
range 0 to 9, then it is replaced by [dir/]include. This is
to help with boot- <br>
strapping the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-canonical-prefixes <br>
Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to /../
or /./, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sysroot=dir <br>
Use dir as the logical root directory for headers and
libraries. For example, if the compiler normally searches
for headers in /usr/include and libraries in /usr/lib, it
<br>
instead searches dir/usr/include and dir/usr/lib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use both this option and
the -isysroot option, then the --sysroot option applies to
libraries, but the -isysroot option applies to header
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU linker (beginning with
version 2.16) has the necessary support for this option. If
your linker does not support this option, the header file
aspect of --sysroot <br>
still works, but the library aspect does not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-sysroot-suffix <br>
For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory
specified with --sysroot, depending on the other options
used, so that headers may for example be found in <br>
dir/suffix/usr/include instead of dir/usr/include. This
option disables the addition of such a suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Code Generation
Conventions <br>
These machine-independent options control the interface
conventions used in code generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of them have both positive
and negative forms; the negative form of -ffoo is -fno-foo.
In the table below, only one of the forms is listed---the
one that is not the <br>
default. You can figure out the other form by either
removing no- or adding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-reuse=reuse-level <br>
This option controls stack space reuse for user declared
local/auto variables and compiler generated temporaries.
reuse_level can be all, named_vars, or none. all enables
<br>
stack reuse for all local variables and temporaries,
named_vars enables the reuse only for user defined local
variables with names, and none disables stack reuse
completely. <br>
The default value is all. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a
compiler generated temporary beyond the end point defined
<br>
by the language. When a lifetime of a variable ends, and if
the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has
the freedom to reuse its stack space with other <br>
temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does
not overlap with it. Legacy code extending local lifetime is
likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int *p; <br>
{ <br>
int local1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p = &amp;local1; <br>
local1 = 10; <br>
.... <br>
} <br>
{ <br>
int local2; <br>
local2 = 20; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (*p == 10) // out of scope
use of local1 <br>
{</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct A <br>
{ <br>
A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { } <br>
int i; <br>
int j; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A *ap;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void foo(const A&amp; ar) <br>
{ <br>
ap = &amp;ar; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void bar() <br>
{ <br>
foo(A(10)); // temp object&rsquo;s lifetime ends when foo
returns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
A a(20); <br>
.... <br>
} <br>
ap-&gt;i+= 10; // ap references out of scope temp whose
space <br>
// is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i? <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lifetime of a compiler
generated temporary is well defined by the C++ standard.
When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary
lives in memory, the optimizing <br>
compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other
temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does
not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code <br>
relies on the behavior of older compilers in which
temporaries&rsquo; stack space is not reused, the aggressive
stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This option is used
to <br>
control the temporary stack reuse optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftrapv <br>
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition,
subtraction, multiplication operations. The options -ftrapv
and -fwrapv override each other, so using -ftrapv <br>
-fwrapv on the command-line results in -fwrapv being
effective. Note that only active options override, so using
-ftrapv -fwrapv -fno-wrapv on the command-line results in
<br>
-ftrapv being effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwrapv <br>
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed
arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and
multiplication wraps around using twos-complement
representation. <br>
This flag enables some optimizations and disables others.
The options -ftrapv and -fwrapv override each other, so
using -ftrapv -fwrapv on the command-line results in <br>
-fwrapv being effective. Note that only active options
override, so using -ftrapv -fwrapv -fno-wrapv on the
command-line results in -ftrapv being effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fexceptions <br>
Enable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to
propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC
generates frame unwind information for all functions, <br>
which can produce significant data size overhead, although
it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this
option, GCC enables it by default for languages like C++
<br>
that normally require exception handling, and disables it
for languages like C that do not normally require it.
However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C
<br>
code that needs to interoperate properly with exception
handlers written in C++. You may also wish to disable this
option if you are compiling older C++ programs that
don&rsquo;t <br>
use exception handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fnon-call-exceptions <br>
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw
exceptions. Note that this requires platform-specific
runtime support that does not exist everywhere. Moreover, it
<br>
only allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions, i.e.
memory references or floating-point instructions. It does
not allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal <br>
handlers such as &quot;SIGALRM&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdelete-dead-exceptions <br>
Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but
don&rsquo;t otherwise contribute to the execution of the
program can be optimized away. This option is enabled by
default <br>
for the Ada front end, as permitted by the Ada language
specification. Optimization passes that cause dead
exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at
different <br>
optimization levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-funwind-tables <br>
Similar to -fexceptions, except that it just generates any
needed static data, but does not affect the generated code
in any other way. You normally do not need to enable <br>
this option; instead, a language processor that needs this
handling enables it on your behalf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fasynchronous-unwind-tables
<br>
Generate unwind table in DWARF format, if supported by
target machine. The table is exact at each instruction
boundary, so it can be used for stack unwinding from <br>
asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage
collector).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-gnu-unique <br>
On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++
compiler uses the &quot;STB_GNU_UNIQUE&quot; binding to make
sure that definitions of template static data members and
<br>
static local variables in inline functions are unique even
in the presence of &quot;RTLD_LOCAL&quot;; this is necessary
to avoid problems with a library used by two different <br>
&quot;RTLD_LOCAL&quot; plugins depending on a definition in
one of them and therefore disagreeing with the other one
about the binding of the symbol. But this causes
&quot;dlclose&quot; to be <br>
ignored for affected DSOs; if your program relies on
reinitialization of a DSO via &quot;dlclose&quot; and
&quot;dlopen&quot;, you can use -fno-gnu-unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpcc-struct-return <br>
Return &quot;short&quot; &quot;struct&quot; and
&quot;union&quot; values in memory like longer ones, rather
than in registers. This convention is less efficient, but it
has the advantage of allowing <br>
intercallability between GCC-compiled files and files
compiled with other compilers, particularly the Portable C
Compiler (pcc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The precise convention for
returning structures in memory depends on the target
configuration macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short structures and unions are
those whose size and alignment match that of some integer
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: code compiled with the
-fpcc-struct-return switch is not binary compatible with
code compiled with the -freg-struct-return switch. Use it to
conform to a non- <br>
default application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freg-struct-return <br>
Return &quot;struct&quot; and &quot;union&quot; values in
registers when possible. This is more efficient for small
structures than -fpcc-struct-return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify neither
-fpcc-struct-return nor -freg-struct-return, GCC defaults to
whichever convention is standard for the target. If there is
no standard convention, GCC <br>
defaults to -fpcc-struct-return, except on targets where GCC
is the principal compiler. In those cases, we can choose the
standard, and we chose the more efficient register <br>
return alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: code compiled with the
-freg-struct-return switch is not binary compatible with
code compiled with the -fpcc-struct-return switch. Use it to
conform to a non- <br>
default application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshort-enums <br>
Allocate to an &quot;enum&quot; type only as many bytes as
it needs for the declared range of possible values.
Specifically, the &quot;enum&quot; type is equivalent to the
smallest integer type <br>
that has enough room.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fshort-enums
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch. Use it
to conform to a non-default <br>
application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fshort-wchar <br>
Override the underlying type for &quot;wchar_t&quot; to be
&quot;short unsigned int&quot; instead of the default for
the target. This option is useful for building programs to
run under WINE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fshort-wchar
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch. Use it
to conform to a non-default <br>
application binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-common <br>
In C code, this option controls the placement of global
variables defined without an initializer, known as tentative
definitions in the C standard. Tentative definitions are
<br>
distinct from declarations of a variable with the
&quot;extern&quot; keyword, which do not allocate
storage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unix C compilers have
traditionally allocated storage for uninitialized global
variables in a common block. This allows the linker to
resolve all tentative definitions of <br>
the same variable in different compilation units to the same
object, or to a non-tentative definition. This is the
behavior specified by -fcommon, and is the default for GCC
<br>
on most targets. On the other hand, this behavior is not
required by ISO C, and on some targets may carry a speed or
code size penalty on variable references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -fno-common option specifies
that the compiler should instead place uninitialized global
variables in the data section of the object file. This
inhibits the merging of <br>
tentative definitions by the linker so you get a
multiple-definition error if the same variable is defined in
more than one compilation unit. Compiling with -fno-common
is <br>
useful on targets for which it provides better performance,
or if you wish to verify that the program will work on other
systems that always treat uninitialized variable <br>
definitions this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-ident <br>
Ignore the &quot;#ident&quot; directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-finhibit-size-directive <br>
Don&rsquo;t output a &quot;.size&quot; assembler directive,
or anything else that would cause trouble if the function is
split in the middle, and the two halves are placed at
locations far <br>
apart in memory. This option is used when compiling
crtstuff.c; you should not need to use it for anything
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fverbose-asm <br>
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly
code to make it more readable. This option is generally only
of use to those who actually need to read the <br>
generated assembly code (perhaps while debugging the
compiler itself).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-verbose-asm, the default,
causes the extra information to be omitted and is useful
when comparing two assembler files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The added comments include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* information on the compiler
version and command-line options,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* the source code lines
associated with the assembly instructions, in the form
FILENAME:LINENUMBER:CONTENT OF LINE,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* hints on which high-level
expressions correspond to the various assembly instruction
operands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, given this C source

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The comments are intended for
humans rather than machines and hence the precise format of
the comments is subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frecord-gcc-switches <br>
This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being
created. This switch is only implemented on some targets
<br>
and the exact format of the recording is target and binary
file format dependent, but it usually takes the form of a
section containing ASCII text. This switch is related to
<br>
the -fverbose-asm switch, but that switch only records
information in the assembler output file as comments, so it
never reaches the object file. See also <br>
-grecord-gcc-switches for another way of storing compiler
options into the object file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpic <br>
Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in
a shared library, if supported for the target machine. Such
code accesses all constant addresses through a <br>
global offset table (GOT). The dynamic loader resolves the
GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader is
not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system). <br>
If the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a
machine-specific maximum size, you get an error message from
the linker indicating that -fpic does not work; in that
case, <br>
recompile with -fPIC instead. (These maximums are 8k on the
SPARC, 28k on AArch64 and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000. The
x86 has no such limit.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Position-independent code
requires special support, and therefore works only on
certain machines. For the x86, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i. Code <br>
generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this flag is set, the
macros &quot;__pic__&quot; and &quot;__PIC__&quot; are
defined to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fPIC <br>
If supported for the target machine, emit
position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and
avoiding any limit on the size of the global offset table.
This option <br>
makes a difference on AArch64, m68k, PowerPC and SPARC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Position-independent code

certain machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this flag is set, the
macros &quot;__pic__&quot; and &quot;__PIC__&quot; are
defined to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpie <br>
-fPIE <br>
These options are similar to -fpic and -fPIC, but generated
position independent code can be only linked into
executables. Usually these options are used when -pie GCC
<br>
option is used during linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpie and -fPIE both define the
macros &quot;__pie__&quot; and &quot;__PIE__&quot;. The
macros have the value 1 for -fpie and 2 for -fPIE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-plt <br>
Do not use the PLT for external function calls in
position-independent code. Instead, load the callee address
at call sites from the GOT and branch to it. This leads to
<br>
more efficient code by eliminating PLT stubs and exposing
GOT loads to optimizations. On architectures such as 32-bit
x86 where PLT stubs expect the GOT pointer in a <br>
specific register, this gives more register allocation
freedom to the compiler. Lazy binding requires use of the
PLT; with -fno-plt all external symbols are resolved at load
<br>
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, the function
attribute &quot;noplt&quot; can be used to avoid calls
through the PLT for specific external functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In position-dependent code, a
few targets also convert calls to functions that are marked
to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-jump-tables <br>
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it
would be more efficient than other code generation
strategies. This option is of use in conjunction with -fpic
or <br>
-fPIC for building code that forms part of a dynamic linker
and cannot reference the address of a jump table. On some
targets, jump tables do not require a GOT and this <br>
option is not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffixed-reg <br>
Treat the register named reg as a fixed register; generated
code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack
pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reg must be the name of a
register. The register names accepted are machine-specific

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcall-used-reg <br>
Treat the register named reg as an allocable register that
is clobbered by function calls. It may be allocated for
temporaries or variables that do not live across a call.
<br>
Functions compiled this way do not save and restore the
register reg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error to use this flag

variables that live across a call. Functions compiled <br>
this way save and restore the register reg if they use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an error to use this flag

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpack-struct[=n] <br>
Without a value specified, pack all structure members
together without holes. When a value is specified (which
must be a small power of two), pack structure members <br>
according to this value, representing the maximum alignment
(that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger
than this are output potentially unaligned at the <br>
next fitting location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the -fpack-struct
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary
compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code <br>
suboptimal. Use it to conform to a non-default application
binary interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fleading-underscore <br>
This option and its counterpart, -fno-leading-underscore,
forcibly change the way C symbols are represented in the
object file. One use is to help link with legacy assembly
<br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the
-fleading-underscore switch causes GCC to generate code that
is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch. Use it to conform to a non- <br>
default application binary interface. Not all targets
provide complete support for this switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftls-model=model <br>
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used. The model
argument should be one of global-dynamic, local-dynamic,
initial-exec or local-exec. Note that the choice is <br>
subject to optimization: the compiler may use a more
efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the
translation unit, or if -fpic is not given on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default without -fpic is
initial-exec; with -fpic the default is global-dynamic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftrampolines <br>
For targets that normally need trampolines for nested
functions, always generate them instead of using
descriptors. Otherwise, for targets that do not need them,
like for <br>
example HP-PA or IA-64, do nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A trampoline is a small piece of
code that is created at run time on the stack when the
address of a nested function is taken, and is used to call
the nested function <br>
indirectly. Therefore, it requires the stack to be made
executable in order for the program to work properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-trampolines is enabled by
default on a language by language basis to let the compiler
avoid generating them, if it computes that this is safe, and
replace them with <br>
descriptors. Descriptors are made up of data only, but the
generated code must be prepared to deal with them. As of
this writing, -fno-trampolines is enabled by default <br>
only for Ada.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, code compiled with
-ftrampolines and code compiled with -fno-trampolines are
not binary compatible if nested functions are present. This
option must therefore be <br>
used on a program-wide basis and be manipulated with extreme
care.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvisibility=[default|internal|hidden|protected]
<br>
Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified
option---all symbols are marked with this unless overridden
within the code. Using this feature can very <br>
substantially improve linking and load times of shared
object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide
near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes. It is
<br>
strongly recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite the nomenclature,
default always means public; i.e., available to be linked
against from outside the shared object. protected and
internal are pretty useless in <br>
real-world usage so the only other commonly used option is
hidden. The default if -fvisibility isn&rsquo;t specified is
default, i.e., make every symbol public.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A good explanation of the
benefits offered by ensuring ELF symbols have the correct
visibility is given by &quot;How To Write Shared
Libraries&quot; by Ulrich Drepper (which can be <br>
found at &lt;https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/&gt;)---however
a superior solution made possible by this option to marking
things hidden when the default is public is to make the <br>
default hidden and mark things public. This is the norm with
DLLs on Windows and with -fvisibility=hidden and
&quot;__attribute__
((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))&quot; instead of <br>
&quot;__declspec(dllexport)&quot; you get almost identical
semantics with identical syntax. This is a great boon to
those working with cross-platform projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those adding visibility
support to existing code, you may find &quot;#pragma GCC
visibility&quot; of use. This works by you enclosing the
declarations you wish to set visibility <br>
for with (for example) &quot;#pragma GCC visibility
push(hidden)&quot; and &quot;#pragma GCC visibility
pop&quot;. Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be
viewed as part of the API <br>
interface contract and thus all new code should always
specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e.,
declarations only for use within the local DSO should always
be <br>
marked explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection
overheads---making this abundantly clear also aids
readability and self-documentation of the code. Note that
due <br>
to ISO C++ specification requirements, &quot;operator
new&quot; and &quot;operator delete&quot; must always be of
default visibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be aware that headers from
outside your project, in particular system headers and
headers from any other library you use, may not be expecting
to be compiled with visibility <br>
other than the default. You may need to explicitly say
&quot;#pragma GCC visibility push(default)&quot; before
including any such headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;extern&quot; declarations
are not affected by -fvisibility, so a lot of code can be
recompiled with -fvisibility=hidden with no modifications.
However, this means that calls to <br>
&quot;extern&quot; functions with no explicit visibility use
the PLT, so it is more effective to use &quot;__attribute
((visibility))&quot; and/or &quot;#pragma GCC
visibility&quot; to tell the compiler <br>
which &quot;extern&quot; declarations should be treated as
hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that -fvisibility does
affect C++ vague linkage entities. This means that, for
instance, an exception class that is be thrown between DSOs
must be explicitly marked with <br>
default visibility so that the type_info nodes are unified
between the DSOs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An overview of these techniques,
their benefits and how to use them is at
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields <br>
This option should be used if accesses to volatile
bit-fields (or other structure fields, although the compiler
usually honors those types anyway) should use a single
access <br>
of the width of the field&rsquo;s type, aligned to a natural
alignment if possible. For example, targets with
memory-mapped peripheral registers might require all such
accesses to <br>
be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can declare all
peripheral bit-fields as &quot;unsigned short&quot;
(assuming short is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to
use 16-bit accesses <br>
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is disabled, the
compiler uses the most efficient instruction. In the
previous example, that might be a 32-bit load instruction,
even though that accesses <br>
bytes that do not contain any portion of the bit-field, or
memory-mapped registers unrelated to the one being
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, such as when the
&quot;packed&quot; attribute is applied to a structure
field, it may not be possible to access the field with a
single read or write that is correctly <br>
aligned for the target machine. In this case GCC falls back
to generating multiple accesses rather than code that will
fault or truncate the result at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Due to restrictions of the
C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are not allowed to
touch non bit-field members. It is therefore recommended to
define all bits of the <br>
field&rsquo;s type as bit-field members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of this option
is determined by the application binary interface for the
target processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsync-libcalls <br>
This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the
&quot;__sync&quot; family of functions may be used to
implement the C++11 &quot;__atomic&quot; family of
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of this option
is enabled, thus the only useful form of the option is
-fno-sync-libcalls. This option is used in the
implementation of the libatomic <br>
runtime library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC Developer Options <br>
This section describes command-line options that are
primarily of interest to GCC developers, including options
to support compiler testing and investigation of compiler
bugs and <br>
compile-time performance problems. This includes options
that produce debug dumps at various points in the
compilation; that print statistics such as memory use and
execution <br>
time; and that print information about GCC&rsquo;s
configuration, such as where it searches for libraries. You
should rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary
compilation <br>
and linking tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dletters <br>
-fdump-rtl-pass <br>
-fdump-rtl-pass=filename <br>
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times
specified by letters. This is used for debugging the
RTL-based passes of the compiler. The file names for most of
<br>
the dumps are made by appending a pass number and a word to
the dumpname, and the files are created in the directory of
the output file. In case of =filename option, the <br>
dump is output on the given file instead of the pass
numbered dump files. Note that the pass number is assigned
as passes are registered into the pass manager. Most passes
<br>
are registered in the order that they will execute and for
these passes the number corresponds to the pass execution
order. However, passes registered by plugins, passes <br>
specific to compilation targets, or passes that are
otherwise registered after all the other passes are numbered
higher than a pass named &quot;final&quot;, even if they are
executed <br>
earlier. dumpname is generated from the name of the output
file if explicitly specified and not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some -dletters switches have
different meaning when -E is used for preprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug dumps can be enabled with
a -fdump-rtl switch or some -d option letters. Here are the
possible letters for use in pass and letters, and their

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-noaddr <br>
When doing debugging dumps, suppress address output. This

Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire
translation unit to a file. The file name is made by
appending .tu to the source file name, and the file is <br>
created in the same directory as the output file. If the
-options form is used, options controls the details of the
dump as described for the -fdump-tree options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-class-hierarchy (C++
only) <br>
-fdump-class-hierarchy-options (C++ only) <br>
Dump a representation of each class&rsquo;s hierarchy and
virtual function table layout to a file. The file name is
made by appending .class to the source file name, and the
file <br>
is created in the same directory as the output file. If the
-options form is used, options controls the details of the
dump as described for the -fdump-tree options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-ipa-switch <br>
Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural
analysis language tree to a file. The file name is generated
by appending a switch specific suffix to the source <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Enables all inter-procedural
analysis dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cgraph <br>
Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused

turned on and off by the current command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-statistics-option <br>
Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate
file. The file name is generated by appending a suffix
ending in .statistics to the source file name, and the <br>
file is created in the same directory as the output file. If
the -option form is used, -stats causes counters to be
summed over the whole compilation unit while -details <br>
dumps every event as the passes generate them. The default
with no option is to sum counters for each function
compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-tree-all <br>
-fdump-tree-switch <br>
-fdump-tree-switch-options <br>
-fdump-tree-switch-options=filename <br>
Control the dumping at various stages of processing the
intermediate language tree to a file. The file name is
generated by appending a switch-specific suffix to the
source <br>
file name, and the file is created in the same directory as
the output file. In case of =filename option, the dump is
output on the given file instead of the auto named dump <br>
files. If the -options form is used, options is a list of -
separated options which control the details of the dump. Not
all options are applicable to all dumps; those that <br>
are not meaningful are ignored. The following options are
available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">address <br>
Print the address of each node. Usually this is not
meaningful as it changes according to the environment and
source file. Its primary use is for tying up a dump file
<br>
with a debug environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asmname <br>
If &quot;DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME&quot; has been set for a given
decl, use that in the dump instead of &quot;DECL_NAME&quot;.
Its primary use is ease of use working backward from mangled
names <br>
in the assembly file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slim <br>
When dumping front-end intermediate representations, inhibit
dumping of members of a scope or body of a function merely
because that scope has been reached. Only dump <br>
such items when they are directly reachable by some other
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dumping pretty-printed
trees, this option inhibits dumping the bodies of control
structures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When dumping RTL, print the RTL
in slim (condensed) form instead of the default LISP-like
representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">raw Print a raw representation
of the tree. By default, trees are pretty-printed into a
C-like representation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">details <br>
Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump
option). Also include information from the optimization
passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stats <br>
Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not
honored by every dump option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blocks <br>
Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw
dumps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">graph <br>
For each of the other indicated dump files
(-fdump-rtl-pass), dump a representation of the control flow
graph suitable for viewing with GraphViz to
file.passid.pass.dot. <br>
Each function in the file is pretty-printed as a subgraph,
so that GraphViz can render them all in a single plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option currently only works
for RTL dumps, and the RTL is always dumped in slim
form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vops <br>
Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lineno <br>
Enable showing line numbers for statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uid Enable showing the unique ID
(&quot;DECL_UID&quot;) for each variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eh Enable showing the EH region
number holding each statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scev <br>
Enable showing scalar evolution analysis details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimized <br>
Enable showing optimization information (only available in
certain passes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missed <br>
Enable showing missed optimization information (only
available in certain passes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">note <br>
Enable other detailed optimization information (only
available in certain passes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=filename <br>
Instead of an auto named dump file, output into the given
file name. The file names stdout and stderr are treated
specially and are considered already open standard <br>
streams. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize
-fdump-tree-vect-blocks=foo.dump <br>
-fdump-tree-pre=/dev/stderr file.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outputs vectorizer dump into
foo.dump, while the PRE dump is output on to stderr. If two
conflicting dump filenames are given for the same pass, then
the latter option <br>
overrides the earlier one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Turn on all options, except
raw, slim, verbose and lineno.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optall <br>
Turn on all optimization options, i.e., optimized, missed,
and note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine what tree dumps are
available or find the dump for a pass of interest follow the
steps below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Invoke GCC with -fdump-passes
and in the stderr output look for a code that corresponds to
the pass you are interested in. For example, the codes
&quot;tree-evrp&quot;, <br>
&quot;tree-vrp1&quot;, and &quot;tree-vrp2&quot; correspond
to the three Value Range Propagation passes. The number at
the end distinguishes distinct invocations of the same
pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. To enable the creation of the
dump file, append the pass code to the -fdump- option prefix
and invoke GCC with it. For example, to enable the dump from
the Early Value <br>
Range Propagation pass, invoke GCC with the -fdump-tree-evrp
option. Optionally, you may specify the name of the dump
file. If you don&rsquo;t specify one, GCC creates as <br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Find the pass dump in a file
whose name is composed of three components separated by a
period: the name of the source file GCC was invoked to
compile, a numeric suffix <br>
indicating the pass number followed by the letter t for tree
passes (and the letter r for RTL passes), and finally the
pass code. For example, the Early VRP pass dump <br>
might be in a file named myfile.c.038t.evrp in the current
working directory. Note that the numeric codes are not
stable and may change from one version of GCC to <br>
another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fopt-info <br>
-fopt-info-options <br>
-fopt-info-options=filename <br>
Controls optimization dumps from various optimization
passes. If the -options form is used, options is a list of -
separated option keywords to select the dump details and
<br>
optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options can be divided into
two groups: options describing the verbosity of the dump,
and options describing which optimizations should be
included. The options from both <br>
the groups can be freely mixed as they are non-overlapping.
However, in case of any conflicts, the later options
override the earlier options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options control
the dump verbosity:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optimized <br>
Print information when an optimization is successfully
applied. It is up to a pass to decide which information is
relevant. For example, the vectorizer passes print the <br>
source location of loops which are successfully
vectorized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missed <br>
Print information about missed optimizations. Individual
passes control which information to include in the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">note <br>
Print verbose information about optimizations, such as
certain transformations, more detailed messages about
decisions etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Print detailed optimization
information. This includes optimized, missed, and note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more of the following
option keywords can be used to describe a group of
optimizations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ipa Enable dumps from all
interprocedural optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loop <br>
Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline <br>
Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">omp Enable dumps from all OMP
(Offloading and Multi Processing) optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vec Enable dumps from all
vectorization optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">optall <br>
Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of
the optimization groups listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If options is omitted, it
defaults to optimized-optall, which means to dump all info
about successful optimizations from all the passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filename is provided,
then the dumps from all the applicable optimizations are
concatenated into the filename. Otherwise the dump is output
onto stderr. Though <br>
multiple -fopt-info options are accepted, only one of them
can include a filename. If other filenames are provided then
all but the first such option are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the output filename is
overwritten in case of multiple translation units. If a
combined output from multiple translation units is desired,
stderr should be used <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following example, the
optimization info is output to stderr:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -O3 -fopt-info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -O3
-fopt-info-missed=missed.all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outputs missed optimization
report from all the passes into missed.all, and this
one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize
-fopt-info-vec-missed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prints information about missed
optimization opportunities from vectorization passes on
stderr. Note that -fopt-info-vec-missed is equivalent to
-fopt-info-missed-vec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As another example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -O3
-fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outputs information about missed
optimizations as well as optimized locations from all the
inlining passes into inline.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, consider:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc
-fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss
-fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here the two output filenames
vec.miss and loop.opt are in conflict since only one output
file is allowed. In this case, only the first option takes
effect and the subsequent <br>
options are ignored. Thus only vec.miss is produced which
contains dumps from the vectorizer about missed
opportunities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsched-verbose=n <br>
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option
controls the amount of debugging output the scheduler prints
to the dump files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For n greater than zero,
-fsched-verbose outputs the same information as
-fdump-rtl-sched1 and -fdump-rtl-sched2. For n greater than
one, it also output basic block <br>
probabilities, detailed ready list information and unit/insn
info. For n greater than two, it includes RTL at abort
point, control-flow and regions info. And for n over <br>
four, -fsched-verbose also includes dependence info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fenable-kind-pass <br>
-fdisable-kind-pass=range-list <br>
This is a set of options that are used to explicitly
disable/enable optimization passes. These options are
intended for use for debugging GCC. Compiler users should
use <br>
regular options for enabling/disabling passes instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdisable-ipa-pass <br>
Disable IPA pass pass. pass is the pass name. If the same
pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple times,
the pass name should be appended with a sequential <br>
number starting from 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdisable-rtl-pass <br>
-fdisable-rtl-pass=range-list <br>
Disable RTL pass pass. pass is the pass name. If the same
pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple times,
the pass name should be appended with a sequential <br>
number starting from 1. range-list is a comma-separated list
of function ranges or assembler names. Each range is a
number pair separated by a colon. The range is <br>
inclusive in both ends. If the range is trivial, the number
pair can be simplified as a single number. If the
function&rsquo;s call graph node&rsquo;s uid falls within
one of the <br>
specified ranges, the pass is disabled for that function.
The uid is shown in the function header of a dump file, and
the pass names can be dumped by using option <br>
-fdump-passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdisable-tree-pass <br>
-fdisable-tree-pass=range-list <br>
Disable tree pass pass. See -fdisable-rtl for the
description of option arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fenable-ipa-pass <br>
Enable IPA pass pass. pass is the pass name. If the same
pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple times,
the pass name should be appended with a sequential <br>
number starting from 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fenable-rtl-pass <br>
-fenable-rtl-pass=range-list <br>
Enable RTL pass pass. See -fdisable-rtl for option argument
description and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fenable-tree-pass <br>
-fenable-tree-pass=range-list <br>
Enable tree pass pass. See -fdisable-rtl for the description
of option arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples showing
uses of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># disable ccp1 for all functions
<br>
-fdisable-tree-ccp1 <br>
# disable complete unroll for function whose cgraph node uid
is 1 <br>
-fenable-tree-cunroll=1 <br>
# disable gcse2 for functions at the following ranges [1,1],
<br>
# [300,400], and [400,1000] <br>
# disable gcse2 for functions foo and foo2 <br>
-fdisable-rtl-gcse2=foo,foo2 <br>
# disable early inlining <br>
-fdisable-tree-einline <br>
# disable ipa inlining <br>
-fdisable-ipa-inline <br>
# enable tree full unroll <br>
-fenable-tree-unroll</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fchecking <br>
-fchecking=n <br>
Enable internal consistency checking. The default depends on
the compiler configuration. -fchecking=2 enables further
internal consistency checking that might affect code <br>
generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frandom-seed=string <br>
This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of random
numbers in generating certain symbol names that have to be
different in every compiled file. It is also used to <br>
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object
files that produce them. You can use the -frandom-seed
option to produce reproducibly identical object files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string can either be a
number (decimal, octal or hex) or an arbitrary string (in
which case it&rsquo;s converted to a number by computing
CRC32).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string should be different
for every file you compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-save-temps <br>
-save-temps=cwd <br>
Store the usual &quot;temporary&quot; intermediate files
permanently; place them in the current directory and name
them based on the source file. Thus, compiling foo.c with -c
<br>
-save-temps produces files foo.i and foo.s, as well as
foo.o. This creates a preprocessed foo.i output file even
though the compiler now normally uses an integrated <br>
preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used in combination with
the -x command-line option, -save-temps is sensible enough
to avoid over writing an input source file with the same
extension as an intermediate <br>
file. The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by
renaming the source file before using -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you invoke GCC in parallel,
compiling several different source files that share a common
base name in different subdirectories or the same source
file compiled for <br>
multiple output destinations, it is likely that the
different parallel compilers will interfere with each other,
and overwrite the temporary files. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o
indir1/foo.c&amp; <br>
gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">may result in foo.i and foo.o
being written to simultaneously by both compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-save-temps=obj <br>
Store the usual &quot;temporary&quot; intermediate files
permanently. If the -o option is used, the temporary files
are based on the object file. If the -o option is not used,
the <br>
-save-temps=obj switch behaves like -save-temps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
<br>
gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o <br>
gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">creates foo.i, foo.s,
dir/xbar.i, dir/xbar.s, dir2/yfoobar.i, dir2/yfoobar.s, and
dir2/yfoobar.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-time[=file] <br>
Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the
compilation sequence. For C source files, this is the
compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is
done).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without the specification of an
output file, the output looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cc1 0.12 0.01 <br>
# as 0.00 0.01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first number on each line is
the &quot;user time&quot;, that is time spent executing the
program itself. The second number is &quot;system
time&quot;, time spent executing operating system <br>
routines on behalf of the program. Both numbers are in
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the specification of an
output file, the output is appended to the named file, and
it looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt;
<br>
0.00 0.01 as &lt;options&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;user time&quot; and
the &quot;system time&quot; are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed,
so that one can later tell what file was being <br>
compiled, and with which options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdump-final-insns[=file] <br>
Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to file. If the
optional argument is omitted (or if file is &quot;.&quot;),
the name of the dump file is determined by appending
&quot;.gkd&quot; to <br>
the compilation output file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-debug[=opts] <br>
If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a
second time, adding opts and -fcompare-debug-second to the
arguments passed to the second compilation. Dump the <br>
final internal representation in both compilations, and
print an error if they differ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the equal sign is omitted,
the default -gtoggle is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG, if defined, non-empty and nonzero,
implicitly enables -fcompare-debug. If GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG is
defined to a string starting with <br>
a dash, then it is used for opts, otherwise the default
-gtoggle is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-debug=, with the equal
sign but without opts, is equivalent to -fno-compare-debug,
which disables the dumping of the final representation and
the second <br>
compilation, preventing even GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG from taking
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To verify full coverage during
-fcompare-debug testing, set GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG to say
-fcompare-debug-not-overridden, which GCC rejects as an
invalid option in any actual <br>
compilation (rather than preprocessing, assembly or
linking). To get just a warning, setting GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG
to -w%n-fcompare-debug not overridden will do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcompare-debug-second <br>
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the
second compilation requested by -fcompare-debug, along with
options to silence warnings, and omitting other options <br>
that would cause side-effect compiler outputs to files or to
the standard output. Dump files and preserved temporary
files are renamed so as to contain the &quot;.gk&quot;
additional <br>
extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is passed to
the compiler driver, it causes the first compilation to be
skipped, which makes it useful for little other than
debugging the compiler proper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gtoggle <br>
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this
option generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise. The
position of this argument in the command line does not <br>
matter; it takes effect after all other options are
processed, and it does so only once, no matter how many
times it is given. This is mainly intended to be used with
<br>
-fcompare-debug.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
<br>
Toggle -fvar-tracking-assignments, in the same way that
-gtoggle toggles -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Makes the compiler print out
each function name as it is compiled, and print some
statistics about each pass when it finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftime-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time
consumed by each pass when it finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftime-report-details <br>
Record the time consumed by infrastructure parts separately
for each pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fira-verbose=n <br>
Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated
register allocator. The default value is 5. If the value n
is greater or equal to 10, the dump output is sent to <br>
stderr using the same format as n minus 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-report <br>
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the
link-time optimizer. The contents of this report vary from
version to version. It is meant to be useful to GCC <br>
developers when processing object files in LTO mode (via
-flto).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-flto-report-wpa <br>
Like -flto-report, but only print for the WPA phase of Link
Time Optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmem-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
memory allocation when it finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fmem-report-wpa <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
memory allocation for the WPA phase only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpre-ipa-mem-report <br>
-fpost-ipa-mem-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
memory allocation before or after interprocedural
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fprofile-report <br>
Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency
of the (estimated) profile and effect of individual
passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstack-usage <br>
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the
program, on a per-function basis. The filename for the dump
is made by appending .su to the auxname. auxname is <br>
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
basename of the source file. An entry is made up of <br>
three fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The name of the function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A number of bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* One or more qualifiers:
&quot;static&quot;, &quot;dynamic&quot;,
&quot;bounded&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qualifier &quot;static&quot;
means that the function manipulates the stack statically: a
fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on
function entry and released on <br>
function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made in
the function. The second field is this fixed number of
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qualifier
&quot;dynamic&quot; means that the function manipulates the
stack dynamically: in addition to the static allocation
described above, stack adjustments are made in the <br>
body of the function, for example to push/pop arguments
around function calls. If the qualifier &quot;bounded&quot;
is also present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded
at <br>
compile time and the second field is an upper bound of the
total amount of stack used by the function. If it is not
present, the amount of these adjustments is not bounded <br>
at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fstats <br>
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the
compilation. This option is supported only by the C++ front
end, and the information is generally only useful to <br>
the G++ development team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdbg-cnt-list <br>
Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug
counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fdbg-cnt=counter-value-list
<br>
Set the internal debug counter upper bound.
counter-value-list is a comma-separated list of name:value
pairs which sets the upper bound of each debug counter name
to value. <br>
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of
&quot;UINT_MAX&quot;; thus &quot;dbg_cnt&quot; returns true
always unless the upper bound is set by this option. For
example, with <br>
-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0, &quot;dbg_cnt(dce)&quot;
returns true only for first 10 invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-file-name=library <br>
Print the full absolute name of the library file library
that would be used when linking---and don&rsquo;t do
anything else. With this option, GCC does not compile or
link <br>
anything; it just prints the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multi-directory <br>
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib
selected by any other switches present in the command line.
This directory is supposed to exist in GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multi-lib <br>
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler
switches that enable them. The directory name is separated
from the switches by ;, and each switch starts with an <br>
@ instead of the -, without spaces between multiple
switches. This is supposed to ease shell processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multi-os-directory <br>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib,
relative to some lib subdirectory. If OS libraries are
present in the lib subdirectory and no multilibs are used,
<br>
this is usually just ., if OS libraries are present in
libsuffix sibling directories this prints e.g. ../lib64,
../lib or ../lib32, or if OS libraries are present in <br>
lib/subdir subdirectories it prints e.g. amd64, sparcv9 or
ev6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-multiarch <br>
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch,
relative to some lib subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-prog-name=program <br>
Like -print-file-name, but searches for a program such as
cpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-libgcc-file-name <br>
Same as -print-file-name=libgcc.a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when you use
-nostdlib or -nodefaultlibs but you do want to link with
libgcc.a. You can do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;...
&lsquo;gcc -print-libgcc-file-name&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-search-dirs <br>
Print the name of the configured installation directory and
a list of program and library directories gcc searches---and
don&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful when gcc prints
the error message installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No
such file or directory. To resolve this you either need to
put cpp0 and the other <br>
compiler components where gcc expects to find them, or you
can set the environment variable GCC_EXEC_PREFIX to the
directory where you installed them. Don&rsquo;t forget the
<br>
trailing /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-sysroot <br>
Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation. This is the target sysroot specified either at
configure time or using the --sysroot option, possibly <br>
with an extra suffix that depends on compilation options. If
no target sysroot is specified, the option prints
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-sysroot-headers-suffix
<br>
Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching
for headers, or give an error if the compiler is not
configured with such a suffix---and don&rsquo;t do anything
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpmachine <br>
Print the compiler&rsquo;s target machine (for example,
i686-pc-linux-gnu)---and don&rsquo;t do anything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpversion <br>
Print the compiler version (for example, 3.0, 6.3.0 or
7)---and don&rsquo;t do anything else. This is the compiler
version used in filesystem paths, specs, can be depending on
how <br>
the compiler has been configured just a single number (major
version), two numbers separated by dot (major and minor
version) or three numbers separated by dots (major, minor
<br>
and patchlevel version).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpfullversion <br>
Print the full compiler version, always 3 numbers separated
by dots, major, minor and patchlevel version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dumpspecs <br>
Print the compiler&rsquo;s built-in specs---and don&rsquo;t
do anything else. (This is used when GCC itself is being
built.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine-Dependent Options <br>
Each target machine supported by GCC can have its own
options---for example, to allow you to compile for a
particular processor variant or ABI, or to control
optimizations <br>
specific to that machine. By convention, the names of
machine-specific options start with -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some configurations of the
compiler also support additional target-specific options,
usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AArch64 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
AArch64 implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=name <br>
Generate code for the specified data model. Permissible
values are ilp32 for SysV-like data model where int, long
int and pointers are 32 bits, and lp64 for SysV-like data
<br>
model where int is 32 bits, but long int and pointers are 64
bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default depends on the
specific target configuration. Note that the LP64 and ILP32
ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your entire
program with the same ABI, <br>
and link with a compatible set of libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate big-endian code. This is the default when GCC is
configured for an aarch64_be-*-* target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgeneral-regs-only <br>
Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.
This will prevent the compiler from using floating-point and
Advanced SIMD registers but will not impose any <br>
restrictions on the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate little-endian code. This is the default when GCC is
configured for an aarch64-*-* but not an aarch64_be-*-*
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=tiny <br>
Generate code for the tiny code model. The program and its
statically defined symbols must be within 1MB of each other.
Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=small <br>
Generate code for the small code model. The program and its
statically defined symbols must be within 4GB of each other.
Programs can be statically or dynamically linked. <br>
This is the default code model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=large <br>
Generate code for the large code model. This makes no
assumptions about addresses and sizes of sections. Programs
can be statically linked only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstrict-align <br>
Avoid generating memory accesses that may not be aligned on
a natural object boundary as described in the architecture
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions. The former
behavior is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=desc <br>
Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism
for dynamic accesses of TLS variables. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=traditional <br>
Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism
for dynamic accesses of TLS variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-size=size <br>
Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets. Valid values are
12, 24, 32, 48. This option requires binutils 2.26 or
newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-cortex-a53-835769 <br>
-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769 <br>
Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53
erratum number 835769. This involves inserting a NOP
instruction between memory instructions and 64-bit integer
<br>
multiply-accumulate instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-cortex-a53-843419 <br>
-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419 <br>
Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53
erratum number 843419. This erratum workaround is made at
link time and this will only pass the corresponding flag to
<br>
the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt <br>
-mno-low-precision-recip-sqrt <br>
Enable or disable the reciprocal square root approximation.
This option only has an effect if -ffast-math or
-funsafe-math-optimizations is used as well. Enabling this
<br>
reduces precision of reciprocal square root results to about
16 bits for single precision and to 32 bits for double
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlow-precision-sqrt <br>
-mno-low-precision-sqrt <br>
Enable or disable the square root approximation. This option
only has an effect if -ffast-math or
-funsafe-math-optimizations is used as well. Enabling this
reduces <br>
precision of square root results to about 16 bits for single
precision and to 32 bits for double precision. If enabled,
it implies -mlow-precision-recip-sqrt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlow-precision-div <br>
-mno-low-precision-div <br>
Enable or disable the division approximation. This option
only has an effect if -ffast-math or
-funsafe-math-optimizations is used as well. Enabling this
reduces precision <br>
of division results to about 16 bits for single precision
and to 32 bits for double precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=name <br>
Specify the name of the target architecture and, optionally,
one or more feature modifiers. This option has the form
-march=arch{+[no]feature}*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permissible values for arch
are armv8-a, armv8.1-a, armv8.2-a, armv8.3-a or native.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value armv8.3-a implies
armv8.2-a and enables compiler support for the ARMv8.3-A
architecture extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value armv8.2-a implies
armv8.1-a and enables compiler support for the ARMv8.2-A
architecture extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value armv8.1-a implies
armv8-a and enables compiler support for the ARMv8.1-A
architecture extension. In particular, it enables the +crc
and +lse features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value native is available on
native AArch64 GNU/Linux and causes the compiler to pick the
architecture of the host system. This option has no effect
if the compiler is <br>
unable to recognize the architecture of the host system,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The permissible values for
feature are listed in the sub-section on
aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march and -mcpu Feature
Modifiers. Where conflicting feature modifiers are <br>
specified, the right-most feature is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC uses name to determine what
kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly
code. If -march is specified without either of -mtune or
-mcpu also being <br>
specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a range
of target processors implementing the target
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=name <br>
Specify the name of the target processor for which GCC
should tune the performance of the code. Permissible values
for this option are: generic, cortex-a35, cortex-a53, <br>
cortex-a57, cortex-a72, cortex-a73, exynos-m1, falkor,
qdf24xx, xgene1, vulcan, thunderx, thunderxt88,

cortex-a57.cortex-a53, cortex-a72.cortex-a53,
cortex-a73.cortex-a35, cortex-a73.cortex-a53 specify that
GCC should tune for a big.LITTLE system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally on native AArch64
GNU/Linux systems the value native tunes performance to the
host system. This option has no effect if the compiler is
unable to recognize the <br>
processor of the host system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where none of -mtune=, -mcpu= or
-march= are specified, the code is tuned to perform well
across a range of target processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option cannot be suffixed
by feature modifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Specify the name of the target processor, optionally
suffixed by one or more feature modifiers. This option has
the form -mcpu=cpu{+[no]feature}*, where the permissible
<br>
values for cpu are the same as those available for -mtune.
The permissible values for feature are documented in the
sub-section on aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march and <br>
-mcpu Feature Modifiers. Where conflicting feature modifiers
are specified, the right-most feature is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC uses name to determine what
kind of instructions it can emit when generating assembly
code (as if by -march) and to determine the target processor
for which to tune for <br>
performance (as if by -mtune). Where this option is used in
conjunction with -march or -mtune, those options take
precedence over the appropriate part of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-moverride=string <br>
Override tuning decisions made by the back-end in response
to a -mtune= switch. The syntax, semantics, and accepted
values for string in this option are not guaranteed to be
<br>
consistent across releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only intended to
be useful when developing GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpc-relative-literal-loads <br>
Enable PC-relative literal loads. With this option literal
pools are accessed using a single instruction and emitted
after each function. This limits the maximum size of <br>
functions to 1MB. This is enabled by default for
-mcmodel=tiny.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msign-return-address=scope <br>
Select the function scope on which return address signing
will be applied. Permissible values are none, which disables
return address signing, non-leaf, which enables <br>
pointer signing for functions which are not leaf functions,
and all, which enables pointer signing for all functions.
The default value is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march and -mcpu Feature
Modifiers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature modifiers used with
-march and -mcpu can be any of the following and their
inverses nofeature:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crc Enable CRC extension. This

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crypto <br>
Enable Crypto extension. This also enables Advanced SIMD and
floating-point instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fp Enable floating-point
instructions. This is on by default for all possible values
for options -march and -mcpu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">simd <br>
Enable Advanced SIMD instructions. This also enables
floating-point instructions. This is on by default for all
possible values for options -march and -mcpu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lse Enable Large System
Extension instructions. This is on by default for
-march=armv8.1-a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fp16 <br>
Enable FP16 extension. This also enables floating-point
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feature crypto implies simd,
which implies fp. Conversely, nofp implies nosimd, which
implies nocrypto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adapteva Epiphany Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
Adapteva Epiphany:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhalf-reg-file <br>
Don&rsquo;t allocate any register in the range
&quot;r32&quot;...&quot;r63&quot;. That allows code to run
on hardware variants that lack these registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprefer-short-insn-regs <br>
Preferentially allocate registers that allow short
instruction generation. This can result in increased
instruction count, so this may either reduce or increase
overall code <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=num <br>
Set the cost of branches to roughly num &quot;simple&quot;
instructions. This cost is only a heuristic and is not
guaranteed to produce consistent results across
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmove <br>
Enable the generation of conditional moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnops=num <br>
Emit num NOPs before every other generated instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-soft-cmpsf <br>
For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an
&quot;fsub&quot; instruction and test the flags. This is
faster than a software comparison, but can get incorrect
results in <br>
the presence of NaNs, or when two different small numbers
are compared such that their difference is calculated as
zero. The default is -msoft-cmpsf, which uses slower, but
<br>
IEEE-compliant, software comparisons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-offset=num <br>
Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack
pointer. E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in
the range &quot;sp+0...sp+7&quot; can be used by leaf
functions <br>
without stack allocation. Values other than 8 or 16 are
untested and unlikely to work. Note also that this option
changes the ABI; compiling a program with a different <br>
stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work. This option can be useful if you
want to evaluate if a different stack offset would give you
<br>
better code, but to actually use a different stack offset to
build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate --with-stack-offset=num <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-round-nearest <br>
Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been
set to truncating. The default is -mround-nearest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls
might be beyond the offset range of the &quot;b&quot; /
&quot;bl&quot; instructions, and therefore load the function
address into a <br>
register before performing a (otherwise direct) call. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshort-calls <br>
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all
direct calls are in the range of the &quot;b&quot; /
&quot;bl&quot; instructions, so use these instructions for
direct calls. The default <br>
is -mlong-calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall16 <br>
Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.
This does not apply to function addresses for which
-mlong-calls semantics are in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-mode=mode <br>
Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit. This
determines the floating-point mode that is provided and
expected at function call and return time. Making this mode
<br>
match the mode you predominantly need at function start can
make your programs smaller and faster by avoiding
unnecessary mode switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode can be set to one the
following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">caller <br>
Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or
restored when the function returns, and when it calls other
functions. This mode is useful for compiling libraries <br>
or other compilation units you might want to incorporate
into different programs with different prevailing FPU modes,
and the convenience of being able to use a single <br>
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any
extra mode switching that might be needed, compared with
what would be needed with a more specific choice of <br>
prevailing FPU mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">truncate <br>
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode. That
includes conversion from floating point to integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">round-nearest <br>
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int This is the mode used to
perform integer calculations in the FPU, e.g. integer
multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mfp-mode=caller</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnosplit-lohi <br>
-mno-postinc <br>
-mno-postmodify <br>
Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting
of 32-bit loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and
generation of post-modify addresses. The defaults <br>
are msplit-lohi, -mpost-inc, and -mpost-modify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnovect-double <br>
Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode. The default is
-mvect-double, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max-vect-align=num <br>
The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types. num may be
4 or 8. The default is 8. Note that this is an ABI change,
even though many library function interfaces are <br>
unaffected if they don&rsquo;t use SIMD vector modes in
places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msplit-vecmove-early <br>
Split vector moves into single word moves before reload. In
theory this can give better register allocation, but so far
the reverse seems to be generally the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m1reg-reg <br>
Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes
loading small negative constants and certain bitmasks
faster. Allowable values for reg are r43 and r63, which
specify <br>
use of that register as a fixed register, and none, which
means that no register is used for this purpose. The default
is -m1reg-none.</p>

Generate calls as register indirect calls, thus providing
access to the full 32-bit address range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmedium-calls <br>
Don&rsquo;t use less than 25-bit addressing range for calls,
which is the offset available for an unconditional
branch-and-link instruction. Conditional execution of
function <br>
calls is suppressed, to allow use of the 25-bit range,

Enable the use of pre/post modify with register

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbbit-peephole <br>
Enable bbit peephole2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-brcc <br>
This option disables a target-specific pass in arc_reorg to

It has no effect on generation of these instructions driven
by <br>
the combiner pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcase-vector-pcrel <br>
Use PC-relative switch case tables to enable case table
shortening. This is the default for -Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcompact-casesi <br>
Enable compact &quot;casesi&quot; pattern. This is the
default for -Os, and only available for ARCv1 cores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-cond-exec <br>
Disable the ARCompact-specific pass to generate conditional
execution instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to delay slot scheduling and
interactions between operand numbers, literal sizes,
instruction lengths, and the support for conditional
execution, the target-independent <br>
pass to generate conditional execution is often lacking, so
the ARC port has kept a special pass around that tries to
find more conditional execution generation opportunities
<br>
after register allocation, branch shortening, and delay slot
scheduling have been done. This pass generally, but not
always, improves performance and code size, at the cost <br>
of extra compilation time, which is why there is an option
to switch it off. If you have a problem with call
instructions exceeding their allowable offset range because
they <br>
are conditionalized, you should consider using
-mmedium-calls instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexpand-adddi <br>
Expand &quot;adddi3&quot; and &quot;subdi3&quot; at RTL
generation time into &quot;add.f&quot;, &quot;adc&quot;
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mindexed-loads <br>
Enable the use of indexed loads. This can be problematic
because some optimizers then assume that indexed stores
exist, which is not the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable Local Register
Allocation. This is still experimental for ARC, so by
default the compiler uses standard reload (i.e.
-mno-lra).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlra-priority-none <br>
Don&rsquo;t indicate any priority for target registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlra-priority-compact <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlra-priority-noncompact <br>
Reduce target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-millicode <br>
When optimizing for size (using -Os), prologues and
epilogues that have to save or restore a large number of
registers are often shortened by using call to a special
function <br>
in libgcc; this is referred to as a millicode call. As these
calls can pose performance issues, and/or cause linking
issues when linking in a nonstandard way, this option is
<br>
provided to turn off millicode call generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmixed-code <br>
Tweak register allocation to help 16-bit instruction
generation. This generally has the effect of decreasing the
average instruction size while increasing the instruction

count.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mq-class <br>
Enable q instruction alternatives. This is the default for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Short instructions are used

long, unless profiling indicates that the probability for
the branch to be taken is below probability. The default is
(REG_BR_PROB_BASE/2), i.e. 5000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARM Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the ARM port:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=name <br>
Generate code for the specified ABI. Permissible values are:
apcs-gnu, atpcs, aapcs, aapcs-linux and iwmmxt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapcs-frame <br>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM
Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even if this is
not strictly necessary for correct execution of the code.
<br>
Specifying -fomit-frame-pointer with this option causes the
stack frames not to be generated for leaf functions. The
default is -mno-apcs-frame. This option is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapcs <br>
This is a synonym for -mapcs-frame and is deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthumb-interwork <br>
Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and
Thumb instruction sets. Without this option, on pre-v5
architectures, the two instruction sets cannot be reliably
<br>
used inside one program. The default is
-mno-thumb-interwork, since slightly larger code is
generated when -mthumb-interwork is specified. In AAPCS
configurations this <br>
option is meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-prolog <br>
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function
prologue, or the merging of those instruction with the
instructions in the function&rsquo;s body. This means that
all <br>
functions start with a recognizable set of instructions (or
in fact one of a choice from a small set of different
function prologues), and this information can be used to
<br>
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of
code. The default is -msched-prolog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat-abi=name <br>
Specifies which floating-point ABI to use. Permissible
values are: soft, softfp and hard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying soft causes GCC to
generate output containing library calls for floating-point
operations. softfp allows the generation of code using
hardware floating-point <br>
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling
conventions. hard allows generation of floating-point
instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default depends on the
specific target configuration. Note that the hard-float and
soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile
your entire program with the <br>
same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.
This is the default for all standard configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode;
the default is to compile code for a little-endian
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=name <br>
This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture. GCC
uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can
emit when generating assembly code. This option can <br>
be used in conjunction with or instead of the -mcpu= option.
Permissible names are: armv2, armv2a, armv3, armv3m, armv4,
armv4t, armv5, armv5e, armv5t, armv5te, armv6, <br>
armv6-m, armv6j, armv6k, armv6kz, armv6s-m, armv6t2, armv6z,
armv6zk, armv7, armv7-a, armv7-m, armv7-r, armv7e-m,
armv7ve, armv8-a, armv8-a+crc, armv8.1-a, armv8.1-a+crc,
<br>
armv8-m.base, armv8-m.main, armv8-m.main+dsp, iwmmxt,
iwmmxt2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Architecture revisions older
than armv4t are deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv6s-m is the armv6-m
architecture with support for the (now mandatory) SVC
instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv6zk is an alias for
armv6kz, existing for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv7ve is the armv7-a
architecture with virtualization extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv8-a+crc enables code
generation for the ARMv8-A architecture together with the
optional CRC32 extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv8.1-a enables
compiler support for the ARMv8.1-A architecture. This also
enables the features provided by -march=armv8-a+crc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv8.2-a enables
compiler support for the ARMv8.2-A architecture. This also
enables the features provided by -march=armv8.1-a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=armv8.2-a+fp16 enables
compiler support for the ARMv8.2-A architecture with the
optional FP16 instructions extension. This also enables the
features provided by <br>
-march=armv8.1-a and implies -mfp16-format=ieee.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=native causes the
compiler to auto-detect the architecture of the build
computer. At present, this feature is only supported on
GNU/Linux, and not all architectures <br>
are recognized. If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the
option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=name <br>
This option specifies the name of the target ARM processor
for which GCC should tune the performance of the code. For
some ARM implementations better performance can be <br>
obtained by using this option. Permissible names are: arm2,
arm250, arm3, arm6, arm60, arm600, arm610, arm620, arm7,
arm7m, arm7d, arm7dm, arm7di, arm7dmi, arm70, arm700, <br>

xgene1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, this option can
specify that GCC should tune the performance of the code for
a big.LITTLE system. Permissible names are:
cortex-a15.cortex-a7, <br>
cortex-a17.cortex-a7, cortex-a57.cortex-a53,
cortex-a72.cortex-a53, cortex-a72.cortex-a35,
cortex-a73.cortex-a53.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=generic-arch specifies
that GCC should tune the performance for a blend of
processors within architecture arch. The aim is to generate
code that run well on the <br>
current most popular processors, balancing between
optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the range, and
avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs. The effects of
this <br>
option may change in future GCC versions as CPU models come
and go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=native causes the
compiler to auto-detect the CPU of the build computer. At
present, this feature is only supported on GNU/Linux, and
not all architectures are <br>
recognized. If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the option
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
This specifies the name of the target ARM processor. GCC
uses this name to derive the name of the target ARM
architecture (as if specified by -march) and the ARM
processor <br>
type for which to tune for performance (as if specified by
-mtune). Where this option is used in conjunction with
-march or -mtune, those options take precedence over the
<br>
appropriate part of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permissible names for this
option are the same as those for -mtune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=generic-arch is also
permissible, and is equivalent to -march=arch
-mtune=generic-arch. See -mtune for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=native causes the compiler
to auto-detect the CPU of the build computer. At present,
this feature is only supported on GNU/Linux, and not all
architectures are <br>
recognized. If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the option
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu=name <br>
This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware
emulation) is available on the target. Permissible names
are: vfpv2, vfpv3, vfpv3-fp16, vfpv3-d16, vfpv3-d16-fp16,
<br>
vfpv3xd, vfpv3xd-fp16, neon-vfpv3, neon-fp16, vfpv4,
vfpv4-d16, fpv4-sp-d16, neon-vfpv4, fpv5-d16, fpv5-sp-d16,
fp-armv8, neon-fp-armv8 and crypto-neon-fp-armv8. Note that
<br>
neon is an alias for neon-vfpv3 and vfp is an alias for
vfpv2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -msoft-float is specified
this specifies the format of floating-point values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the selected floating-point
hardware includes the NEON extension (e.g. -mfpu=neon), note
that floating-point operations are not generated by
GCC&rsquo;s auto-vectorization pass <br>
unless -funsafe-math-optimizations is also specified. This
is because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE
754 standard for floating-point arithmetic (in <br>
particular denormal values are treated as zero), so the use
of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also set the fpu name at
function level by using the
&quot;target(&quot;fpu=&quot;)&quot; function attributes or
pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp16-format=name <br>
Specify the format of the &quot;__fp16&quot; half-precision
floating-point type. Permissible names are none, ieee, and
alternative; the default is none, in which case the
&quot;__fp16&quot; <br>
type is not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstructure-size-boundary=n <br>
The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a
multiple of the number of bits set by this option.
Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64. The default value
varies <br>
for different toolchains. For the COFF targeted toolchain
the default value is 8. A value of 64 is only allowed if the
underlying ABI supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying a larger number can
produce faster, more efficient code, but can also increase
the size of the program. Different values are potentially
incompatible. Code <br>
compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to work
with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they
exchange information using structures or unions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabort-on-noreturn <br>
Generate a call to the function &quot;abort&quot; at the end
of a &quot;noreturn&quot; function. It is executed if the
function tries to return.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first
loading the address of the function into a register and then
performing a subroutine call on this register. This switch
<br>
is needed if the target function lies outside of the
64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based version of
subroutine call instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even if this switch is enabled,
not all function calls are turned into long calls. The
heuristic is that static functions, functions that have the
&quot;short_call&quot; attribute, <br>
functions that are inside the scope of a &quot;#pragma
no_long_calls&quot; directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current
compilation unit are <br>
not turned into long calls. The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the
&quot;long_call&quot; attribute or the &quot;section&quot;
attribute, and <br>
functions that are within the scope of a &quot;#pragma
long_calls&quot; directive are always turned into long
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is not enabled by
default. Specifying -mno-long-calls restores the default
behavior, as does placing the function calls within the
scope of a &quot;#pragma <br>
long_calls_off&quot; directive. Note these switches have no
effect on how the compiler generates code to handle function
calls via function pointers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-pic-base <br>
Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only,
rather than loading it in the prologue for each function.
The runtime system is responsible for initializing this <br>
register with an appropriate value before execution
begins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpic-register=reg <br>
Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing. For
standard PIC base case, the default is any suitable register
determined by compiler. For single PIC base case, the <br>
default is R9 if target is EABI based or stack-checking is
enabled, otherwise the default is R10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpic-data-is-text-relative <br>
Assume that the displacement between the text and data
segments is fixed at static link time. This permits using
PC-relative addressing operations to access data known to be
<br>
in the data segment. For non-VxWorks RTP targets, this
option is enabled by default. When disabled on such targets,
it will enable -msingle-pic-base by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpoke-function-name <br>
Write the name of each function into the text section,
directly preceding the function prologue. The generated code
is similar to this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t0 <br>
.ascii &quot;arm_poke_function_name&quot;, 0 <br>
.align <br>
t1 <br>
.word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0) <br>
arm_poke_function_name <br>
mov ip, sp <br>
stmfd sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc} <br>
sub fp, ip, #4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When performing a stack
backtrace, code can inspect the value of &quot;pc&quot;
stored at &quot;fp + 0&quot;. If the trace function then
looks at location &quot;pc - 12&quot; and the top 8 bits are
set, <br>
then we know that there is a function name embedded
immediately preceding this location and has length
&quot;((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthumb <br>
-marm <br>
Select between generating code that executes in ARM and
Thumb states. The default for most configurations is to
generate code that executes in ARM state, but the default
can <br>
be changed by configuring GCC with the --with-mode=state
configure option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also override the ARM
and Thumb mode for each function by using the
&quot;target(&quot;thumb&quot;)&quot; and
&quot;target(&quot;arm&quot;)&quot; function attributes or
pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtpcs-frame <br>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb
Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf functions. (A leaf
function is one that does not call any other functions.)
<br>
The default is -mno-tpcs-frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtpcs-leaf-frame <br>
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb
Procedure Call Standard for all leaf functions. (A leaf
function is one that does not call any other functions.) The
<br>
default is -mno-apcs-leaf-frame.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcallee-super-interworking <br>
Gives all externally visible functions in the file being
compiled an ARM instruction set header which switches to
Thumb mode before executing the rest of the function. This
<br>
allows these functions to be called from non-interworking
code. This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcaller-super-interworking <br>
Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual
functions) to execute correctly regardless of whether the
target code has been compiled for interworking or not. There
<br>
is a small overhead in the cost of executing a function
pointer if this option is enabled. This option is not valid
in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled <br>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtp=name <br>
Specify the access model for the thread local storage
pointer. The valid models are soft, which generates calls to
&quot;__aeabi_read_tp&quot;, cp15, which fetches the thread
pointer <br>
from &quot;cp15&quot; directly (supported in the arm6k
architecture), and auto, which uses the best available
method for the selected processor. The default setting is
auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=dialect <br>
Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local
storage. Two dialects are supported---gnu and gnu2. The gnu
dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting <br>
local and global dynamic TLS models. The gnu2 dialect
selects the GNU descriptor scheme, which provides better
performance for shared libraries. The GNU descriptor scheme
<br>
is compatible with the original scheme, but does require new
assembler, linker and library support. Initial and local
exec TLS models are unaffected by this option and <br>
always use the original scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mword-relocations <br>
Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values
(i.e. R_ARM_ABS32). This is enabled by default on targets
(uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime loader imposes this
<br>
restriction, and when -fpic or -fPIC is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd <br>
Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when
&quot;ldrd&quot; instructions with overlapping destination
and base registers are used. This option avoids generating
these <br>
instructions. This option is enabled by default when
-mcpu=cortex-m3 is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munaligned-access <br>
-mno-unaligned-access <br>
Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit
values from addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned.
By default unaligned access is disabled for all <br>
pre-ARMv6, all ARMv6-M and for ARMv8-M Baseline
architectures, and enabled for all other architectures. If
unaligned access is not enabled then words in packed data
<br>
structures are accessed a byte at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ARM attribute
&quot;Tag_CPU_unaligned_access&quot; is set in the generated
object file to either true or false, depending upon the
setting of this option. If unaligned access is <br>
enabled then the preprocessor symbol
&quot;__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED&quot; is also defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mneon-for-64bits <br>
Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations. This
is disabled by default since the cost of moving data from
core registers to Neon is high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mslow-flash-data <br>
Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching
instruction. Therefore literal load is minimized for better
performance. This option is only supported when compiling
<br>
for ARMv7 M-profile and off by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-masm-syntax-unified <br>
Assume inline assembler is using unified asm syntax. The
default is currently off which implies divided syntax. This
option has no impact on Thumb2. However, this may <br>
change in future releases of GCC. Divided syntax should be
considered deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrestrict-it <br>
Restricts generation of IT blocks to conform to the rules of
ARMv8. IT blocks can only contain a single 16-bit
instruction from a select set of instructions. This option
is <br>
on by default for ARMv8 Thumb mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprint-tune-info <br>
Print CPU tuning information as comment in assembler file.
This is an option used only for regression testing of the
compiler and not intended for ordinary use in compiling <br>
code. This option is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpure-code <br>
Do not allow constant data to be placed in code sections.
Additionally, when compiling for ELF object format give all
text sections the ELF processor-specific section <br>
attribute &quot;SHF_ARM_PURECODE&quot;. This option is only
available when generating non-pic code for ARMv7-M
targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmse <br>
Generate secure code as per the &quot;ARMv8-M Security
Extensions: Requirements on Development Tools Engineering
Specification&quot;, which can be found on <br>

attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maccumulate-args <br>
Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release
the needed stack space for outgoing function arguments once
in function prologue/epilogue. Without this option, <br>
outgoing arguments are pushed before calling a function and
popped afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popping the arguments after the
function call can be expensive on AVR so that accumulating
the stack space might lead to smaller executables because
arguments need not be <br>
removed from the stack after such a function call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can lead to reduced

to printf-like functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=cost <br>
Set the branch costs for conditional branch instructions to
cost. Reasonable values for cost are small, non-negative
integers. The default branch cost is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcall-prologues <br>
Functions prologues/epilogues are expanded as calls to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint8 <br>

and &quot;long long&quot; is 4 bytes. Please note <br>
that this option does not conform to the C standards, but it
results in smaller code size.</p>

Try to replace &quot;CALL&quot; resp. &quot;JMP&quot;
instruction by the shorter &quot;RCALL&quot; resp.
&quot;RJMP&quot; instruction if applicable. Setting -mrelax
just adds the --mlink-relax option to the <br>
assembler&rsquo;s command line and the --relax option to the
linker&rsquo;s command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jump relaxing is performed by
the linker because jump offsets are not known before code is
located. Therefore, the assembler code generated by the
compiler is the same, but <br>
the instructions in the executable may differ from
instructions in the assembler code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relaxing must be turned on if
linker stubs are needed, see the section on &quot;EIND&quot;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrmw <br>
Assume that the device supports the Read-Modify-Write
instructions &quot;XCH&quot;, &quot;LAC&quot;,
&quot;LAS&quot; and &quot;LAT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msp8 <br>
Treat the stack pointer register as an 8-bit register, i.e.
assume the high byte of the stack pointer is zero. In
general, you don&rsquo;t need to set this option by
hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is used internally
by the compiler to select and build multilibs for
architectures &quot;avr2&quot; and &quot;avr25&quot;. These
architectures mix devices with and without &quot;SPH&quot;.
<br>
For any setting other than -mmcu=avr2 or -mmcu=avr25 the
compiler driver adds or removes this option from the
compiler proper&rsquo;s command line, because the compiler
then knows <br>
if the device or architecture has an 8-bit stack pointer and
thus no &quot;SPH&quot; register or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstrict-X <br>
Use address register &quot;X&quot; in a way proposed by the
hardware. This means that &quot;X&quot; is only used in
indirect, post-increment or pre-decrement addressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, the
&quot;X&quot; register may be used in the same way as
&quot;Y&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; which then is emulated by
additional instructions. For example, loading a value with
<br>
&quot;X+const&quot; addressing with a small non-negative

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;EIND&quot; and Devices
with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pointers in the implementation
are 16@tie{}bits wide. The address of a function or label is
represented as word address so that indirect jumps and calls
can target any code <br>
address in the range of 64@tie{}Ki words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to facilitate indirect
jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki bytes of program
memory space, there is a special function register called
&quot;EIND&quot; that serves as most <br>
significant part of the target address when
&quot;EICALL&quot; or &quot;EIJMP&quot; instructions are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indirect jumps and calls on
these devices are handled as follows by the compiler and are
subject to some limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The compiler never sets
&quot;EIND&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The compiler uses
&quot;EIND&quot; implicitly in
&quot;EICALL&quot;/&quot;EIJMP&quot; instructions or might
read &quot;EIND&quot; directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a &quot;RET&quot;
instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The compiler assumes that
&quot;EIND&quot; never changes during the startup code or
during the application. In particular, &quot;EIND&quot; is
not saved/restored in function or interrupt service <br>
routine prologue/epilogue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* For indirect calls to
functions and computed goto, the linker generates stubs.
Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called trampolines. Thus,
the indirect call/jump jumps to <br>
such a stub. The stub contains a direct jump to the desired
address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Linker relaxation must be
turned on so that the linker generates the stubs correctly
in all situations. See the compiler option -mrelax and the
linker option --relax. There <br>
are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate
stubs but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful
error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The default linker script is
arranged for code with &quot;EIND = 0&quot;. If code is
supposed to work for a setup with &quot;EIND != 0&quot;, a
custom linker script has to be used in order to <br>
place the sections whose name start with
&quot;.trampolines&quot; into the segment where
&quot;EIND&quot; points to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The startup code from libgcc
never sets &quot;EIND&quot;. Notice that startup code is a
blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC. For the impact of
AVR-LibC on &quot;EIND&quot;, see the AVR- <br>
LibC user manual
(&quot;http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* It is legitimate for
user-specific startup code to set up &quot;EIND&quot; early,
for example by means of initialization code located in
section &quot;.init3&quot;. Such code runs prior to <br>
general startup code that initializes RAM and calls
constructors, but after the bit of startup code from
AVR-LibC that sets &quot;EIND&quot; to the segment where the
vector table is <br>
located.</p>

}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;__trampolines_start&quot; symbol is defined in the
linker script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Stubs are generated
automatically by the linker if the following two conditions
are met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt;The address of a label is
taken by means of the &quot;gs&quot; modifier&gt; <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LDI r24, lo8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))
<br>
LDI r25, hi8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt;The final location of that
label is in a code segment&gt; <br>
outside the segment where the stubs are located.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The compiler emits such
&quot;gs&quot; modifiers for code labels in the following
situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt;Taking address of a
function or code label.&gt; <br>
-&lt;Computed goto.&gt; <br>
-&lt;If prologue-save function is used, see
-mcall-prologues&gt; <br>
command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-&lt;Switch/case dispatch
tables. If you do not want such dispatch&gt; <br>
tables you can specify the -fno-jump-tables command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead, a stub has to be set
up, i.e. the function has to be called through a symbol

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int main (void) <br>
{ <br>
extern int func_4 (void);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* Call function at byte address

}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the application be linked

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of the
&quot;RAMPD&quot;, &quot;RAMPX&quot;, &quot;RAMPY&quot; and
&quot;RAMPZ&quot; Special Function Registers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some AVR devices support
memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range that can be
accessed with 16-bit pointers. To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the <br>
content of a &quot;RAMP&quot; register is used as high part
of the address: The &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;,
&quot;Z&quot; address register is concatenated with the
&quot;RAMPX&quot;, &quot;RAMPY&quot;, &quot;RAMPZ&quot;
special function register, <br>
respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
&quot;RAMPD&quot; is used together with direct
addressing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The startup code initializes
the &quot;RAMP&quot; special function registers with
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If a AVR Named Address
Spaces,named address space other than generic or
&quot;__flash&quot; is used, then &quot;RAMPZ&quot; is set
as needed before the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the device supports RAM
larger than 64@tie{}KiB and the compiler needs to change
&quot;RAMPZ&quot; to accomplish an operation,
&quot;RAMPZ&quot; is reset to zero after the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If the device comes with a
specific &quot;RAMP&quot; register, the ISR
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it
with zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) <br>
use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* RAM larger than 64@tie{}KiB is
not supported by GCC for AVR targets. If you use inline
assembler to read from locations outside the 16-bit address
range and change one of <br>
the &quot;RAMP&quot; registers, you must reset it to zero
after the access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVR Built-in Macros</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines several built-in
macros so that the user code can test for the presence or
absence of features. Almost any of the following built-in
macros are deduced from device <br>
capabilities and thus triggered by the -mmcu= command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For even more AVR-specific
built-in macros see AVR Named Address Spaces and AVR
Built-in Functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_ARCH__&quot; <br>
Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that
identifies the architecture and depends on the -mmcu=mcu
option. Possible values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2, 25, 3, 31, 35, 4, 5, 51,
6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for mcu=&quot;avr2&quot;,
&quot;avr25&quot;, &quot;avr3&quot;, &quot;avr31&quot;,
&quot;avr35&quot;, &quot;avr4&quot;, &quot;avr5&quot;,
&quot;avr51&quot;, &quot;avr6&quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">respectively and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 107</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for mcu=&quot;avrtiny&quot;,
&quot;avrxmega2&quot;, &quot;avrxmega4&quot;,
&quot;avrxmega5&quot;, &quot;avrxmega6&quot;,
&quot;avrxmega7&quot;, respectively. If mcu specifies a
device, this built-in macro is set accordingly. For <br>
example, with -mmcu=atmega8 the macro is defined to 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_Device__&quot; <br>
Setting -mmcu=device defines this built-in macro which
reflects the device&rsquo;s name. For example, -mmcu=atmega8
defines the built-in macro &quot;__AVR_ATmega8__&quot;,
-mmcu=attiny261a <br>
defines &quot;__AVR_ATtiny261A__&quot;, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The built-in macros&rsquo; names
follow the scheme &quot;__AVR_Device__&quot; where Device is
the device name as from the AVR user manual. The difference
between Device in the built-in macro <br>
and device in -mmcu=device is that the latter is always
lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If device is not a device but
only a core architecture like avr51, this macro is not
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_DEVICE_NAME__&quot;
<br>
Setting -mmcu=device defines this built-in macro to the
device&rsquo;s name. For example, with -mmcu=atmega8 the
macro is defined to &quot;atmega8&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If device is not a device but
only a core architecture like avr51, this macro is not
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_XMEGA__&quot; <br>
The device / architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_ELPM__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;ELPM&quot; instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_ELPMX__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;ELPM Rn,Z&quot; and &quot;ELPM
Rn,Z+&quot; instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_MOVW__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;MOVW&quot; instruction to perform
16-bit register-register moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_LPMX__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;LPM Rn,Z&quot; and &quot;LPM
Rn,Z+&quot; instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_MUL__&quot;
<br>
The device has a hardware multiplier.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__&quot;
<br>
The device has the &quot;JMP&quot; and &quot;CALL&quot;
instructions. This is the case for devices with at least
16@tie{}KiB of program memory.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_EIJMP_EICALL__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_3_BYTE_PC__&quot; <br>
The device has the &quot;EIJMP&quot; and &quot;EICALL&quot;
instructions. This is the case for devices with more than
128@tie{}KiB of program memory. This also means that the
program counter <br>
(PC) is 3@tie{}bytes wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_2_BYTE_PC__&quot;
<br>
The program counter (PC) is 2@tie{}bytes wide. This is the
case for devices with up to 128@tie{}KiB of program
memory.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_8BIT_SP__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_16BIT_SP__&quot; <br>
The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit
respectively 16-bit register by the compiler. The definition
of these macros is affected by -mtiny-stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_SPH__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_SP8__&quot; <br>
The device has the SPH (high part of stack pointer) special
function register or has an 8-bit stack pointer,
respectively. The definition of these macros is affected by
<br>
-mmcu= and in the cases of -mmcu=avr2 and -mmcu=avr25 also
by -msp8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPD__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPX__&quot; <br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPY__&quot; <br>
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_RAMPZ__&quot; <br>
The device has the &quot;RAMPD&quot;, &quot;RAMPX&quot;,
&quot;RAMPY&quot;, &quot;RAMPZ&quot; special function
register, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__NO_INTERRUPTS__&quot;
<br>
This macro reflects the -mno-interrupts command-line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP__&quot;
<br>
&quot;__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP_JMP_CALL__&quot; <br>
Some AVR devices (AT90S8515, ATmega103) must not skip 32-bit
instructions because of a hardware erratum. Skip
instructions are &quot;SBRS&quot;, &quot;SBRC&quot;,
&quot;SBIS&quot;, &quot;SBIC&quot; and &quot;CPSE&quot;.
<br>
The second macro is only defined if
&quot;__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__&quot; is also set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_ISA_RMW__&quot; <br>
The device has Read-Modify-Write instructions (XCH, LAC, LAS
and LAT).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__AVR_SFR_OFFSET__=offset&quot;
<br>
Instructions that can address I/O special function registers
directly like &quot;IN&quot;, &quot;OUT&quot;,
&quot;SBI&quot;, etc. may use a different address as if
addressed by an instruction to access <br>
RAM like &quot;LD&quot; or &quot;STS&quot;. This offset
depends on the device architecture and has to be subtracted
from the RAM address in order to get the respective
I/O@tie{}address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;__WITH_AVRLIBC__&quot;
<br>
The compiler is configured to be used together with
AVR-Libc. See the --with-avrlibc configure option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackfin Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu[-sirevision] <br>
Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.
Currently, cpu can be one of bf512, bf514, bf516, bf518,
bf522, bf523, bf524, bf525, bf526, bf527, bf531, bf532,
bf533, <br>
bf534, bf536, bf537, bf538, bf539, bf542, bf544, bf547,
bf548, bf549, bf542m, bf544m, bf547m, bf548m, bf549m, bf561,
bf592.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional sirevision
specifies the silicon revision of the target Blackfin
processor. Any workarounds available for the targeted
silicon revision are enabled. If <br>
sirevision is none, no workarounds are enabled. If
sirevision is any, all workarounds for the targeted
processor are enabled. The &quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot;
macro is defined to <br>
two hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor
numbers in the silicon revision. If sirevision is none, the
&quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; is not defined. If
sirevision is <br>
any, the &quot;__SILICON_REVISION__&quot; is defined to be
0xffff. If this optional sirevision is not used, GCC assumes
the latest known silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin
<br>
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines a preprocessor macro
for the specified cpu. For the bfin-elf toolchain, this
option causes the hardware BSP provided by libgloss to be
linked in if -msim is not <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, bf532 is
used as the processor by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that support for bf561 is
incomplete. For bf561, only the preprocessor macro is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
This causes the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be
linked in. This option has effect only for bfin-elf <br>
toolchain. Certain other options, such as
-mid-shared-library and -mfdpic, imply -msim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf
functions. This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available
<br>
in leaf functions. The option -fomit-frame-pointer removes
the frame pointer for all functions, which might make
debugging harder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspecld-anomaly <br>
When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code
does not contain speculative loads after jump instructions.
If this option is used, <br>
&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-specld-anomaly <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate extra code to prevent speculative loads
from occurring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcsync-anomaly <br>
When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code
does not contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon after
conditional branches. If this option is used, <br>
&quot;__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-csync-anomaly <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC
instructions from occurring too soon after a conditional
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlow-64k <br>
When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the
knowledge that the entire program fits into the low 64k of
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-low-64k <br>
Assume that the program is arbitrarily large. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-check-l1 <br>
Do stack checking using information placed into L1
scratchpad memory by the uClinux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mid-shared-library <br>
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
ID method. This allows for execute in place and shared
libraries in an environment without virtual memory <br>
management. This option implies -fPIC. With a bfin-elf
target, this option implies -msim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-id-shared-library <br>
Generate code that doesn&rsquo;t assume ID-based shared
libraries are being used. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mleaf-id-shared-library <br>
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
ID method, but assumes that this library or executable
won&rsquo;t link against any other ID shared libraries. That
<br>
allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps and
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-leaf-id-shared-library <br>
Do not assume that the code being compiled won&rsquo;t link
against any ID shared libraries. Slower code is generated
for jump and call insns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared-library-id=n <br>
Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared
library being compiled. Specifying a value of 0 generates
more compact code; specifying other values forces the <br>
allocation of that number to the current library but is no
more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msep-data <br>
Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in
a different area of memory from the text segment. This
allows for execute in place in an environment without <br>
virtual memory management by eliminating relocations against
the text section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sep-data <br>
Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the
text segment. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first
loading the address of the function into a register and then
performing a subroutine call on this register. This switch
<br>
is needed if the target function lies outside of the 24-bit
addressing range of the offset-based version of subroutine
call instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is not enabled by
default. Specifying -mno-long-calls restores the default
behavior. Note these switches have no effect on how the
compiler generates code to <br>
handle function calls via function pointers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfast-fp <br>
Link with the fast floating-point library. This library
relaxes some of the IEEE floating-point standard&rsquo;s
rules for checking inputs against Not-a-Number (NAN), in the
<br>
interest of performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-plt <br>
Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to
functions that are not known to bind locally. It has no
effect without -mfdpic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmulticore <br>
Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin
processors. This option causes proper start files and link
scripts supporting multicore to be used, and defines the
<br>
macro &quot;__BFIN_MULTICORE&quot;. It can only be used with
-mcpu=bf561[-sirevision].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used with
-mcorea or -mcoreb, which selects the
one-application-per-core programming model. Without -mcorea
or -mcoreb, the single-application/dual-core <br>
programming model is used. In this model, the main function
of Core B should be named as &quot;coreb_main&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not used, the
single-core application programming model is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcorea <br>
Build a standalone application for Core A of BF561 when
using the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper
start files and link scripts are used to support Core A,
<br>
and the macro &quot;__BFIN_COREA&quot; is defined. This
option can only be used in conjunction with -mmulticore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcoreb <br>
Build a standalone application for Core B of BF561 when
using the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper
start files and link scripts are used to support Core B,
<br>
and the macro &quot;__BFIN_COREB&quot; is defined. When this
option is used, &quot;coreb_main&quot; should be used
instead of &quot;main&quot;. This option can only be used in
conjunction with <br>
-mmulticore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdram <br>
Build a standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to put the application into SDRAM,
and the macro &quot;__BFIN_SDRAM&quot; is defined. The
loader <br>
should initialize SDRAM before loading the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-micplb <br>
Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time. This has an
effect on certain anomaly workarounds. For Linux targets,
the default is to assume ICPLBs are enabled; for <br>
standalone applications the default is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C6X Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=name <br>
This specifies the name of the target architecture. GCC uses
this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit
when generating assembly code. Permissible names <br>
are: c62x, c64x, c64x+, c67x, c67x+, c674x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a big-endian target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate code for a little-endian target. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=default <br>
Put small global and static data in the
&quot;.neardata&quot; section, which is pointed to by
register &quot;B14&quot;. Put small uninitialized global and
static data in the &quot;.bss&quot; section, <br>
which is adjacent to the &quot;.neardata&quot; section. Put
small read-only data into the &quot;.rodata&quot; section.
The corresponding sections used for large pieces of data are
&quot;.fardata&quot;, <br>
&quot;.far&quot; and &quot;.const&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=all <br>
Put all data, not just small objects, into the sections
reserved for small data, and use addressing relative to the
&quot;B14&quot; register to access them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=none <br>
Make no use of the sections reserved for small data, and use
absolute addresses to access all data. Put all initialized
global and static data in the &quot;.fardata&quot; section,
and <br>
all uninitialized data in the &quot;.far&quot; section. Put
all constant data into the &quot;.const&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRIS Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the CRIS ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=architecture-type <br>
-mcpu=architecture-type <br>
Generate code for the specified architecture. The choices
for architecture-type are v3, v8 and v10 for respectively
ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX. Default is v0 <br>
except for cris-axis-linux-gnu, where the default is
v10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=architecture-type <br>
Tune to architecture-type everything applicable about the
generated code, except for the ABI and the set of available
instructions. The choices for architecture-type are the <br>
same as for -march=architecture-type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmax-stack-frame=n <br>
Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds n bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-metrax4 <br>
-metrax100 <br>
The options -metrax4 and -metrax100 are synonyms for
-march=v3 and -march=v8 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmul-bug-workaround <br>
-mno-mul-bug-workaround <br>
Work around a bug in the &quot;muls&quot; and
&quot;mulu&quot; instructions for CPU models where it
applies. This option is active by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpdebug <br>
Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in
the assembly code. This option also has the effect of
turning off the #NO_APP formatted-code indicator to the <br>
assembler at the beginning of the assembly file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcc-init <br>
Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction;
always emit compare and test instructions before use of
condition codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-side-effects <br>
Do not emit instructions with side effects in addressing
modes other than post-increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-align <br>
-mno-stack-align <br>
-mdata-align <br>
-mno-data-align <br>
-mconst-align <br>
-mno-const-align <br>
These options (no- options) arrange (eliminate arrangements)
for the stack frame, individual data and constants to be
aligned for the maximum single data access size for the <br>
chosen CPU model. The default is to arrange for 32-bit
alignment. ABI details such as structure layout are not
affected by these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32-bit <br>
-m16-bit <br>
-m8-bit <br>
Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above,
these options arrange for stack frame, writable data and
constants to all be 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit aligned. The
<br>
default is 32-bit alignment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-prologue-epilogue <br>
-mprologue-epilogue <br>
With -mno-prologue-epilogue, the normal function prologue
and epilogue which set up the stack frame are omitted and no
return instructions or return sequences are generated <br>
in the code. Use this option only together with visual
inspection of the compiled code: no warnings or errors are
generated when call-saved registers must be saved, or <br>
storage for local variables needs to be allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-gotplt <br>
-mgotplt <br>
With -fpic and -fPIC, don&rsquo;t generate (do generate)
instruction sequences that load addresses for functions from
the PLT part of the GOT rather than (traditional on other
<br>
architectures) calls to the PLT. The default is
-mgotplt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-melf <br>
Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf
and cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlinux <br>
Legacy no-op option only recognized with the
cris-axis-linux-gnu target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sim <br>
This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf, arranges to
link with input-output functions from a simulator library.
Code, initialized data and zero-initialized data are <br>
allocated consecutively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sim2 <br>
Like -sim, but pass linker options to locate initialized
data at 0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at
0x80000000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CR16 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the CR16 ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmac <br>
Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcr16cplus <br>
-mcr16c <br>
Generate code for CR16C or CR16C+ architecture. CR16C+
architecture is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Links the library libsim.a which is in compatible with
simulator. Applicable to ELF compiler only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint32 <br>
Choose integer type as 32-bit wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbit-ops <br>
Generates &quot;sbit&quot;/&quot;cbit&quot; instructions for
bit manipulations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdata-model=model <br>
Choose a data model. The choices for model are near, far or
medium. medium is default. However, far is not valid with
-mcr16c, as the CR16C architecture does not support the <br>
far data model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darwin Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
all architectures running the Darwin operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FSF GCC on Darwin does not
create &quot;fat&quot; object files; it creates an object
file for the single architecture that GCC was built to
target. Apple&rsquo;s GCC on Darwin does create
&quot;fat&quot; <br>
files if multiple -arch options are used; it does so by
running the compiler or linker multiple times and joining
the results together with lipo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The subtype of the file created
(like ppc7400 or ppc970 or i686) is determined by the flags
that specify the ISA that GCC is targeting, like -mcpu or
-march. The <br>
-force_cpusubtype_ALL option can be used to override
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Darwin tools vary in their
behavior when presented with an ISA mismatch. The assembler,
as, only permits instructions to be used that are valid for
the subtype of the file <br>
it is generating, so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a
ppc750 object file. The linker for shared libraries,
/usr/bin/libtool, fails and prints an error if asked to
create <br>
a shared library with a less restrictive subtype than its
input files (for instance, trying to put a ppc970 object
file in a ppc7400 library). The linker for executables, ld,
<br>
quietly gives the executable the most restrictive subtype of
any of its input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fdir <br>
Add the framework directory dir to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files. These
directories are interleaved with those specified by -I
options <br>
and are scanned in a left-to-right order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A framework directory is a
directory with frameworks in it. A framework is a directory
with a Headers and/or PrivateHeaders directory contained
directly in it that ends in <br>
.framework. The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the .framework. Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories,
<br>
with Headers being searched first. A subframework is a
framework directory that is in a framework&rsquo;s
Frameworks directory. Includes of subframework headers can
only appear <br>
in a header of a framework that contains the subframework,
or in a sibling subframework header. Two subframeworks are
siblings if they occur in the same framework. A <br>
subframework should not have the same name as a framework; a
warning is issued if this is violated. Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the
<br>
mechanism may be extended to support this. The standard
frameworks can be found in /System/Library/Frameworks and
/Library/Frameworks. An example include looks like <br>
&quot;#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;&quot;, where
Framework denotes the name of the framework and header.h is
found in the PrivateHeaders or Headers directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iframeworkdir <br>
Like -F except the directory is a treated as a system
directory. The main difference between this -iframework and
-F is that with -iframework the compiler does not warn <br>
about constructs contained within header files found via
dir. This option is valid only for the C family of
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gused <br>
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used. For
stabs debugging format, this enables
-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols. This is by default ON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gfull <br>
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmacosx-version-min=version
<br>
The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will
run on is version. Typical values of version include 10.1,
10.2, and 10.3.9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the compiler was built to use
the system&rsquo;s headers by default, then the default for
this option is the system version on which the compiler is
running, otherwise the <br>
default is to make choices that are compatible with as many
systems and code bases as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mkernel <br>
Enable kernel development mode. The -mkernel option sets
-static, -fno-common, -fno-use-cxa-atexit, -fno-exceptions,
-fno-non-call-exceptions, -fapple-kext, -fno-weak and <br>
-fno-rtti where applicable. This mode also sets
-mno-altivec, -msoft-float, -fno-builtin and -mlong-branch
for PowerPC targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mone-byte-bool <br>
Override the defaults for &quot;bool&quot; so that
&quot;sizeof(bool)==1&quot;. By default
&quot;sizeof(bool)&quot; is 4 when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and 1 when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
<br>
option has no effect on x86.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: The -mone-byte-bool
switch causes GCC to generate code that is not binary

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEC Alpha Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the DEC Alpha implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-soft-float <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions
for floating-point operations. When -msoft-float is
specified, functions in libgcc.a are used to perform
floating- <br>
point operations. Unless they are replaced by routines that
emulate the floating-point operations, or compiled in such a
way as to call such emulations routines, these <br>
routines issue floating-point operations. If you are
compiling for an Alpha without floating-point operations,
you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
<br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Alpha implementations
without floating-point operations are required to have
floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-reg <br>
-mno-fp-regs <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
register set. -mno-fp-regs implies -msoft-float. If the
floating-point register set is not used, floating-point <br>
operands are passed in integer registers as if they were
integers and floating-point results are passed in $0 instead
of $f0. This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any <br>
function with a floating-point argument or return value
called by code compiled with -mno-fp-regs must also be
compiled with that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical use of this option is
building a kernel that does not use, and hence need not save
and restore, any floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee <br>
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware
optimized for maximum performance. It is mostly compliant
with the IEEE floating-point standard. However, for full
<br>
compliance, software assistance is required. This option
generates code fully IEEE-compliant code except that the
inexact-flag is not maintained (see below). If this option
<br>
is turned on, the preprocessor macro &quot;_IEEE_FP&quot; is
defined during compilation. The resulting code is less
efficient but is able to correctly support denormalized
numbers and <br>
exceptional IEEE values such as not-a-number and plus/minus
infinity. Other Alpha compilers call this option
-ieee_with_no_inexact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee-with-inexact <br>
This is like -mieee except the generated code also maintains
the IEEE inexact-flag. Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math. <br>
In addition to &quot;_IEEE_FP&quot;,
&quot;_IEEE_FP_EXACT&quot; is defined as a preprocessor
macro. On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may
execute significantly slower than the <br>
code generated by default. Since there is very little code
that depends on the inexact-flag, you should normally not
specify this option. Other Alpha compilers call this <br>
option -ieee_with_inexact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode <br>
This option controls what floating-point related traps are
enabled. Other Alpha compilers call this option -fptm
trap-mode. The trap mode can be set to one of four
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n This is the default (normal)
setting. The only traps that are enabled are the ones that
cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u In addition to the traps
enabled by n, underflow traps are enabled as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">su Like u, but the instructions
are marked to be safe for software completion (see Alpha
architecture manual for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sui Like su, but inexact traps
are enabled as well.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-rounding-mode=rounding-mode
<br>
Selects the IEEE rounding mode. Other Alpha compilers call
this option -fprm rounding-mode. The rounding-mode can be
one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Normal IEEE rounding mode.
Floating-point numbers are rounded towards the nearest
machine number or towards the even machine number in case of
a tie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Round towards minus
infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Chopped rounding mode.
Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Dynamic rounding mode. A field
in the floating-point control register (fpcr, see Alpha
architecture reference manual) controls the rounding mode in
effect. The C <br>
library initializes this register for rounding towards plus
infinity. Thus, unless your program modifies the fpcr, d
corresponds to round towards plus infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtrap-precision=trap-precision
<br>
In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are
imprecise. This means without software assistance it is
impossible to recover from a floating trap and program
execution <br>
normally needs to be terminated. GCC can generate code that
can assist operating system trap handlers in determining the
exact location that caused a floating-point trap. <br>
Depending on the requirements of an application, different
levels of precisions can be selected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Program precision. This option
is the default and means a trap handler can only identify
which program caused a floating-point exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Function precision. The trap
handler can determine the function that caused a
floating-point exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Instruction precision. The
trap handler can determine the exact instruction that caused
a floating-point exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other Alpha compilers provide
the equivalent options called -scope_safe and
-resumption_safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee-conformant <br>
This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant. You
must not use this option unless you also specify
-mtrap-precision=i and either -mfp-trap-mode=su or <br>
-mfp-trap-mode=sui. Its only effect is to emit the line
.eflag 48 in the function prologue of the generated assembly
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbuild-constants <br>
Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or
three instructions. If it cannot, it outputs the <br>
constant as a literal and generates code to load it from the
data segment at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option to require GCC
to construct all integer constants using code, even if it
takes more instructions (the maximum is six).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You typically use this option to
build a shared library dynamic loader. Itself a shared
library, it must relocate itself in memory before it can
find the variables and <br>
constants in its own data segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbwx <br>
-mno-bwx <br>
-mcix <br>
-mno-cix <br>
-mfix <br>
-mno-fix <br>
-mmax <br>
-mno-max <br>
Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the
optional BWX, CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets. The default
is to use the instruction sets supported by the CPU type
<br>
specified via -mcpu= option or that of the CPU on which GCC
was built if none is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat-vax <br>
-mfloat-ieee <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G
floating-point arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexplicit-relocs <br>
-mno-explicit-relocs <br>
Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol
relocations except via assembler macros. Use of these macros
does not allow optimal instruction scheduling. GNU <br>
binutils as of version 2.12 supports a new syntax that
allows the compiler to explicitly mark which relocations
should apply to which instructions. This option is mostly
<br>
useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of the
assembler when it is built and sets the default
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-data <br>
-mlarge-data <br>
When -mexplicit-relocs is in effect, static data is accessed
via gp-relative relocations. When -msmall-data is used,
objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a small <br>
data area (the &quot;.sdata&quot; and &quot;.sbss&quot;
sections) and are accessed via 16-bit relocations off of the
$gp register. This limits the size of the small data area to
64KB, but <br>
allows the variables to be directly accessed via a single
instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -mlarge-data.
With this option the data area is limited to just below 2GB.
Programs that require more than 2GB of data must use
&quot;malloc&quot; or &quot;mmap&quot; to <br>
allocate the data in the heap instead of in the
program&rsquo;s data segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When generating code for shared
libraries, -fpic implies -msmall-data and -fPIC implies
-mlarge-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-text <br>
-mlarge-text <br>
When -msmall-text is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB,
and is thus reachable with a branch instruction. When <br>
-msmall-data is used, the compiler can assume that all local
symbols share the same $gp value, and thus reduce the number
of instructions required for a function call from 4 <br>
to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -mlarge-text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type cpu_type. You can specify either
the EV style name or the corresponding chip number. GCC <br>
supports scheduling parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6
family of processors and chooses the default values for the
instruction set from the processor you specify. If you do
<br>
not specify a processor type, GCC defaults to the processor
on which the compiler was built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported values for cpu_type
are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev4 <br>
ev45 <br>
21064 <br>
Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev5 <br>
21164 <br>
Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev56 <br>
21164a <br>
Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pca56 <br>
21164pc <br>
21164PC <br>
Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev6 <br>
21264 <br>
Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX, and MAX
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ev67 <br>
21264a <br>
Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, CIX, FIX, and MAX
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native toolchains also support
the value native, which selects the best architecture option
for the host processor. -mcpu=native has no effect if GCC
does not recognize the <br>
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu_type <br>
Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine
type cpu_type. The instruction set is not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native toolchains also support
the value native, which selects the best architecture option
for the host processor. -mtune=native has no effect if GCC
does not recognize the <br>
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemory-latency=time <br>
Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical
memory references as seen by the application. This number is
highly dependent on the memory access patterns used by <br>
the application and the size of the external cache on the
machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid options for time are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number <br>
A decimal number representing clock cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L1 <br>
L2 <br>
L3 <br>
main <br>
The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock
cycles for &quot;typical&quot; EV4 &amp; EV5 hardware for
the Level 1, 2 &amp; 3 caches (also called Dcache, Scache,
and Bcache), as <br>
well as to main memory. Note that L3 is only valid for
EV5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FR30 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the FR30 port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-model <br>
Use the small address space model. This can produce smaller
code, but it does assume that all symbolic values and
addresses fit into a 20-bit range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-lsim <br>
Assume that runtime support has been provided and so there
is no need to include the simulator library (libsim.a) on
the linker command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FT32 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined
specifically for the FT32 port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
This causes an alternate runtime startup and library to be
linked. You must not use this option when generating <br>
programs that will run on real hardware; you must provide
your own runtime library for whatever I/O functions are
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlra <br>
Enable Local Register Allocation. This is still experimental
for FT32, so by default the compiler uses standard
reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnodiv <br>
Do not use div and mod instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FRV Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgpr-32 <br>
Only use the first 32 general-purpose registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgpr-64 <br>
Use all 64 general-purpose registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpr-32 <br>
Use only the first 32 floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpr-64 <br>
Use all 64 floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
Use hardware instructions for floating-point operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Use library routines for floating-point operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malloc-cc <br>
Dynamically allocate condition code registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-cc <br>
Do not try to dynamically allocate condition code registers,
only use &quot;icc0&quot; and &quot;fcc0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdword <br>
Change ABI to use double word insns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-dword <br>
Do not use double word instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdouble <br>
Use floating-point double instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-double <br>
Do not use floating-point double instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmedia <br>
Use media instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-media <br>
Do not use media instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmuladd <br>
Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-muladd <br>
Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfdpic <br>
Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses function descriptors to
represent pointers to functions. Without any PIC/PIE-related
options, it implies -fPIE. With -fpic or -fpie, it <br>
assumes GOT entries and small data are within a 12-bit range
from the GOT base address; with -fPIC or -fPIE, GOT offsets
are computed with 32 bits. With a bfin-elf target, <br>
this option implies -msim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-plt <br>
Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to
functions that are not known to bind locally. It has no
effect without -mfdpic. It&rsquo;s enabled by default if
optimizing <br>
for speed and compiling for shared libraries (i.e., -fPIC or
-fpic), or when an optimization option such as -O3 or above
is present in the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mTLS <br>
Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls <br>
Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating
thread-local code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgprel-ro <br>
Enable the use of &quot;GPREL&quot; relocations in the FDPIC
ABI for data that is known to be in read-only sections.
It&rsquo;s enabled by default, except for -fpic or -fpie:
even though it <br>
may help make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1
instruction for 4. With -fPIC or -fPIE, it trades 3
instructions for 4, one of which may be shared by multiple
<br>
symbols, and it avoids the need for a GOT entry for the
referenced symbol, so it&rsquo;s more likely to be a win. If
it is not, -mno-gprel-ro can be used to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multilib-library-pic <br>
Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries. It&rsquo;s
implied by -mlibrary-pic, as well as by -fPIC and -fpic
without -mfdpic. You should never have to use it
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlinked-fp <br>
Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame
pointer whenever a stack frame is allocated. This option is
enabled by default and can be disabled with <br>
-mno-linked-fp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the
current compilation unit. This allows the functions to be
placed anywhere within the 32-bit address space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-labels <br>
Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting NOPs
into the previous packet. This option only has an effect
when VLIW packing is enabled. It doesn&rsquo;t create new
<br>
packets; it merely adds NOPs to existing ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlibrary-pic <br>
Generate position-independent EABI code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-macc-4 <br>
Use only the first four media accumulator registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-macc-8 <br>
Use all eight media accumulator registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpack <br>
Pack VLIW instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-pack <br>
Do not pack VLIW instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-eflags <br>
Do not mark ABI switches in e_flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcond-move <br>
Enable the use of conditional-move instructions
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This switch is mainly for
debugging the compiler and will likely be removed in a
future version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-cond-move <br>

Possible values are frv, fr550, tomcat, fr500, fr450, fr405,
fr400, fr300 and simple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU/Linux Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
GNU/Linux targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mglibc <br>
Use the GNU C library. This is the default except on
*-*-linux-*uclibc*, *-*-linux-*musl* and *-*-linux-*android*
targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muclibc <br>
Use uClibc C library. This is the default on
*-*-linux-*uclibc* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmusl <br>
Use the musl C library. This is the default on
*-*-linux-*musl* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbionic <br>
Use Bionic C library. This is the default on
*-*-linux-*android* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mandroid <br>
Compile code compatible with Android platform. This is the
default on *-*-linux-*android* targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling, this option
enables -mbionic, -fPIC, -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti by
default. When linking, this option makes the GCC driver pass
Android-specific options <br>
to the linker. Finally, this option causes the preprocessor
macro &quot;__ANDROID__&quot; to be defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tno-android-cc <br>
Disable compilation effects of -mandroid, i.e., do not
enable -mbionic, -fPIC, -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tno-android-ld <br>
Disable linking effects of -mandroid, i.e., pass standard
Linux linking options to the linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H8/300 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the H8/300 implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Shorten some address references at link time, when possible;
uses the linker option -relax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mh Generate code for the
H8/300H.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ms Generate code for the
H8S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mn Generate code for the H8S
and H8/300H in the normal mode. This switch must be used
either with -mh or -ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ms2600 <br>
Generate code for the H8S/2600. This switch must be used
with -ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexr <br>
Extended registers are stored on stack before execution of
function with monitor attribute. Default option is -mexr.
This option is valid only for H8S targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-exr <br>
Extended registers are not stored on stack before execution
of function with monitor attribute. Default option is
-mno-exr. This option is valid only for H8S targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint32 <br>
Make &quot;int&quot; data 32 bits by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-300 <br>
On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for
the H8/300. The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align
longs and floats on 4-byte boundaries. -malign-300 <br>
causes them to be aligned on 2-byte boundaries. This option
has no effect on the H8/300.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HPPA Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the HPPA family of computers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=architecture-type <br>
Generate code for the specified architecture. The choices
for architecture-type are 1.0 for PA 1.0, 1.1 for PA 1.1,
and 2.0 for PA 2.0 processors. Refer to <br>
/usr/lib/sched.models on an HP-UX system to determine the
proper architecture option for your machine. Code compiled
for lower numbered architectures runs on higher numbered
<br>
architectures, but not the other way around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpa-risc-1-0 <br>
-mpa-risc-1-1 <br>
-mpa-risc-2-0 <br>
Synonyms for -march=1.0, -march=1.1, and -march=2.0
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcaller-copies <br>
The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden
reference. This option should be used with care as it is not
compatible with the default 32-bit runtime. However, only
<br>
aggregates larger than eight bytes are passed by hidden
reference and the option provides better compatibility with
OpenMP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mjump-in-delay <br>
This option is ignored and provided for compatibility
purposes only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdisable-fpregs <br>
Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any
manner. This is necessary for compiling kernels that perform
lazy context switching of floating-point registers. If <br>
you use this option and attempt to perform floating-point
operations, the compiler aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdisable-indexing <br>
Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes. This
avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG
generated code under MACH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-space-regs <br>
Generate code that assumes the target has no space
registers. This allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls
and use unscaled index address modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such code is suitable for level
0 PA systems and kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfast-indirect-calls <br>
Generate code that assumes calls never cross space
boundaries. This allows GCC to emit code that performs
faster indirect calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option does not work in the
presence of shared libraries or nested functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator cannot use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-load-store <br>
Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes
required by the HP-UX 10 linker. This is equivalent to the
+k option to the HP compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mportable-runtime <br>
Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgas <br>
Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS
understands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mschedule=cpu-type <br>
Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine
type cpu-type. The choices for cpu-type are 700 7100,
7100LC, 7200, 7300 and 8000. Refer to /usr/lib/sched.models
<br>
on an HP-UX system to determine the proper scheduling option
for your machine. The default scheduling is 8000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlinker-opt <br>
Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker. Note this
makes symbolic debugging impossible. It also triggers a bug
in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they <br>
give bogus error messages when linking some programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
Warning: the requisite libraries are not available for all
HPPA targets. Normally the facilities of the <br>
machine&rsquo;s usual C compiler are used, but this cannot
be done directly in cross-compilation. You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
<br>
cross-compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float changes the calling
convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful
if you compile all of a program with this option. In
particular, you need to <br>
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msio <br>
Generate the predefine, &quot;_SIO&quot;, for server IO. The
default is -mwsio. This generates the predefines,
&quot;__hp9000s700&quot;, &quot;__hp9000s700__&quot; and
&quot;_WSIO&quot;, for workstation IO. <br>
These options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgnu-ld <br>
Use options specific to GNU ld. This passes -shared to ld
when building a shared library. It is the default when GCC
is configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU <br>
linker. This option does not affect which ld is called; it
only changes what parameters are passed to that ld. The ld
that is called is determined by the --with-ld <br>
configure option, GCC&rsquo;s program search path, and
finally by the user&rsquo;s PATH. The linker used by GCC can
be printed using which &lsquo;gcc
-print-prog-name=ld&lsquo;. This option is <br>
only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhp-ld <br>
Use options specific to HP ld. This passes -b to ld when
building a shared library and passes +Accept TypeMismatch to
ld on all links. It is the default when GCC is <br>
configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the HP linker.
This option does not affect which ld is called; it only
changes what parameters are passed to that ld. The ld that
<br>
is called is determined by the --with-ld configure option,
GCC&rsquo;s program search path, and finally by the
user&rsquo;s PATH. The linker used by GCC can be printed
using which &lsquo;gcc <br>
-print-prog-name=ld&lsquo;. This option is only available on
the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
hppa*64*-*-hpux*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
Generate code that uses long call sequences. This ensures
that a call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.
The default is to generate long calls only when the <br>
distance from the call site to the beginning of the function
or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used. The <br>
limits for normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes,
respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.
Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Distances are measured from the
beginning of functions when using the -ffunction-sections
option, or when using the -mgas and -mno-portable-runtime
options together under HP- <br>
UX with the SOM linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is normally not desirable to
use this option as it degrades performance. However, it may
be useful in large applications, particularly when partial
linking is used to <br>
build the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The types of long calls used
depends on the capabilities of the assembler and linker, and
the type of code being generated. The impact on systems that
support long absolute <br>
calls, and long pic symbol-difference or pc-relative calls
should be relatively small. However, an indirect call is
used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code and it is quite <br>
long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munix=unix-std <br>
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the
specified UNIX standard. The choices for unix-std are 93, 95
and 98. 93 is supported on all HP-UX versions. 95 <br>
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later. 98 is available on
HP-UX 11.11 and later. The default values are 93 for HP-UX
10.00, 95 for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and 98 for <br>
HP-UX 11.11 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munix=93 provides the same
predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4. -munix=95 provides additional
predefines for &quot;XOPEN_UNIX&quot; and
&quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;, and the startfile <br>
unix95.o. -munix=98 provides additional predefines for
&quot;_XOPEN_UNIX&quot;, &quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;,
&quot;_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE&quot; and
&quot;_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500&quot;, and the startfile
<br>
unix98.o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to note that
this option changes the interfaces for various library
routines. It also affects the operational behavior of the C
library. Thus, extreme care <br>
is needed in using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Library code that is intended to
operate with more than one UNIX standard must test, set and
restore the variable &quot;__xpg4_extended_mask&quot; as
appropriate. Most GNU software <br>
doesn&rsquo;t provide this capability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolibdld <br>
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl
when the -static option is specified on HP-UX 10 and
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static <br>
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a
dependency on libdld.sl. There isn&rsquo;t an archive
version of libdld.sl. Thus, when the -static option is
specified, <br>
special link options are needed to resolve this
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC
driver adds the necessary options to link with libdld.sl
when the -static option is specified. This causes the
resulting binary to be dynamic. <br>
On the 64-bit port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by
default in any case. The -nolibdld option can be used to
prevent the GCC driver from adding these link options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-threads <br>
Add support for multithreading with the dce thread library
under HP-UX. This option sets flags for both the
preprocessor and linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IA-64 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for the Intel IA-64 architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a big-endian target. This is the default
for HP-UX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate code for a little-endian target. This is the
default for AIX5 and GNU/Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgnu-as <br>
-mno-gnu-as <br>
Generate (or don&rsquo;t) code for the GNU assembler. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgnu-ld <br>
-mno-gnu-ld <br>
Generate (or don&rsquo;t) code for the GNU linker. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-pic <br>
Generate code that does not use a global pointer register.
The result is not position independent code, and violates
the IA-64 ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvolatile-asm-stop <br>
-mno-volatile-asm-stop <br>
Generate (or don&rsquo;t) a stop bit immediately before and
after volatile asm statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mregister-names <br>
-mno-register-names <br>
Generate (or don&rsquo;t) in, loc, and out register names
for the stacked registers. This may make assembler output
more readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sdata <br>
-msdata <br>
Disable (or enable) optimizations that use the small data
section. This may be useful for working around optimizer
bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconstant-gp <br>
Generate code that uses a single constant global pointer
value. This is useful when compiling kernel code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mauto-pic <br>
Generate code that is self-relocatable. This implies
-mconstant-gp. This is useful when compiling firmware
code.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-float-divide-min-latency
<br>
Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values
using the minimum latency algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-float-divide-max-throughput

<br>
Generate code for inline square roots using the maximum
throughput algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-inline-sqrt <br>
Do not generate inline code for &quot;sqrt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Do (don&rsquo;t) generate code that uses the fused
multiply/add or multiply/subtract instructions. The default
is to use these instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-dwarf2-asm <br>
-mdwarf2-asm <br>
Don&rsquo;t (or do) generate assembler code for the DWARF
line number debugging info. This may be useful when not
using the GNU assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mearly-stop-bits <br>
-mno-early-stop-bits <br>
Allow stop bits to be placed earlier than immediately
preceding the instruction that triggered the stop bit. This
can improve instruction scheduling, but does not always do
<br>
so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator cannot use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-size=tls-size <br>
Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets. Valid values are
14, 22, and 64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu-type <br>

mckinley.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-milp32 <br>
-mlp64 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. The 32-bit
environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits. The
64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and <br>
pointer to 64 bits. These are HP-UX specific flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-br-data-spec <br>
-msched-br-data-spec <br>
(Dis/En)able data speculative scheduling before reload. This
results in generation of &quot;ld.a&quot; instructions and
the corresponding check instructions (&quot;ld.c&quot; /
&quot;chk.a&quot;). The <br>
default setting is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-ar-data-spec <br>
-mno-sched-ar-data-spec <br>
(En/Dis)able data speculative scheduling after reload. This
results in generation of &quot;ld.a&quot; instructions and
the corresponding check instructions (&quot;ld.c&quot; /
&quot;chk.a&quot;). The <br>
default setting is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-control-spec <br>
-msched-control-spec <br>
(Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling. This feature is
available only during region scheduling (i.e. before
reload). This results in generation of the &quot;ld.s&quot;
<br>
instructions and the corresponding check instructions
&quot;chk.s&quot;. The default setting is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-br-in-data-spec <br>
-mno-sched-br-in-data-spec <br>
(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-in-control-spec <br>
-mno-sched-in-control-spec <br>
(En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
are dependent on the control speculative loads. This is
effective only with -msched-control-spec enabled. The <br>
default setting is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns
<br>
-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns <br>
If enabled, data-speculative instructions are chosen for
schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.
This makes the use of the data speculation much more <br>
conservative. The default setting is disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns
<br>
-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns <br>
If enabled, control-speculative instructions are chosen for
schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.
This makes the use of the control speculation much <br>
more conservative. The default setting is disabled.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path
<br>
-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path <br>
If enabled, speculative dependencies are considered during
computation of the instructions priorities. This makes the
use of the speculation a bit more conservative. The <br>
default setting is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-spec-ldc <br>
Use a simple data speculation check. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-control-spec-ldc <br>

Place a stop bit after every cycle when scheduling. This
option is on by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-fp-mem-deps-zero-cost
<br>
Assume that floating-point stores and loads are not likely
to cause a conflict when placed into the same instruction
group. This option is disabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msel-sched-dont-check-control-spec
<br>
Generate checks for control speculation in selective
scheduling. This flag is disabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-max-memory-insns=max-insns
<br>
Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group,
giving lower priority to subsequent memory insns attempting
to schedule in the same instruction group. Frequently <br>
useful to prevent cache bank conflicts. The default value is
1.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit
<br>
Makes the limit specified by msched-max-memory-insns a hard
limit, disallowing more than that number in an instruction
group. Otherwise, the limit is &quot;soft&quot;, meaning
that <br>
non-memory operations are preferred when the limit is

Enable user-defined instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M32C Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Select the CPU for which code is generated. name may be one
of r8c for the R8C/Tiny series, m16c for the M16C (up to
/60) series, m32cm for the M16C/80 series, or m32c for <br>
the M32C/80 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
This causes an alternate runtime library to be linked in
which supports, for example, file I/O. You must not use <br>
this option when generating programs that will run on real
hardware; you must provide your own runtime library for
whatever I/O functions are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-memregs=number <br>
Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC
uses during code generation. These pseudo-registers are used
like real registers, so there is a tradeoff between <br>
GCC&rsquo;s ability to fit the code into available
registers, and the performance penalty of using memory
instead of registers. Note that all modules in a program
must be compiled <br>
with the same value for this option. Because of that, you
must not use this option with GCC&rsquo;s default runtime
libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M32R/D Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
Renesas M32R/D architectures:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32r2 <br>
Generate code for the M32R/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32rx <br>
Generate code for the M32R/X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32r <br>
Generate code for the M32R. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodel=small <br>
Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that
their addresses can be loaded with the &quot;ld24&quot;
instruction), and assume all subroutines are reachable with
the <br>
&quot;bl&quot; instruction. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The addressability of a
particular object can be set with the &quot;model&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodel=medium <br>
Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space
(the compiler generates &quot;seth/add3&quot; instructions
to load their addresses), and assume all subroutines are
reachable <br>
with the &quot;bl&quot; instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodel=large <br>
Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space
(the compiler generates &quot;seth/add3&quot; instructions
to load their addresses), and assume subroutines may not be
<br>
reachable with the &quot;bl&quot; instruction (the compiler
generates the much slower &quot;seth/add3/jl&quot;
instruction sequence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=none <br>
Disable use of the small data area. Variables are put into
one of &quot;.data&quot;, &quot;.bss&quot;, or
&quot;.rodata&quot; (unless the &quot;section&quot;
attribute has been specified). This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The small data area consists of
sections &quot;.sdata&quot; and &quot;.sbss&quot;. Objects
may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
&quot;section&quot; attribute using one of these
sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=sdata <br>
Put small global and static data in the small data area, but
do not generate special code to reference them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msdata=use <br>
Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
generate special instructions to reference them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G num <br>
Put global and static objects less than or equal to num
bytes into the small data or BSS sections instead of the
normal data or BSS sections. The default value of num is 8.
<br>
The -msdata option must be set to one of sdata or use for
this option to have any effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All modules should be compiled
with the same -G num value. Compiling with different values
of num may or may not work; if it doesn&rsquo;t the linker
gives an error <br>
message---incorrect code is not generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug <br>
Makes the M32R-specific code in the compiler display some
statistics that might help in debugging programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-loops <br>
Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-align-loops <br>
Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-missue-rate=number <br>
Issue number instructions per cycle. number can only be 1 or
2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=number <br>
number can only be 1 or 2. If it is 1 then branches are
preferred over conditional code, if it is 2, then the
opposite applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflush-trap=number <br>
Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache. The
default is 12. Valid numbers are between 0 and 15
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-flush-trap <br>
Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a
trap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflush-func=name <br>
Specifies the name of the operating system function to call
to flush the cache. The default is _flush_cache, but a
function call is only used if a trap is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-flush-func <br>
Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M680x0 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for M680x0 and ColdFire processors. The default settings
depend on which architecture was selected when the compiler
was configured; the <br>
defaults for the most common choices are given below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=arch <br>
Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction
set architecture. Permissible values of arch for M680x0
architectures are: 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, <br>
68060 and cpu32. ColdFire architectures are selected
according to Freescale&rsquo;s ISA classification and the
permissible values are: isaa, isaaplus, isab and isac.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines a macro
&quot;__mcfarch__&quot; whenever it is generating code for a
ColdFire target. The arch in this macro is one of the -march
arguments given above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used together, -march and
-mtune select code that runs on a family of similar
processors but that is optimized for a particular
microarchitecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu <br>
Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire processor.
The M680x0 cpus are: 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040,
68060, 68302, 68332 and cpu32. The ColdFire cpus are <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu overrides -march=arch
if arch is compatible with cpu. Other combinations of -mcpu
and -march are rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines the macro
&quot;__mcf_cpu_cpu&quot; when ColdFire target cpu is
selected. It also defines &quot;__mcf_family_family&quot;,
where the value of family is given by the table above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=tune <br>
Tune the code for a particular microarchitecture within the
constraints set by -march and -mcpu. The M680x0
microarchitectures are: 68000, 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040,
68060 <br>
and cpu32. The ColdFire microarchitectures are: cfv1, cfv2,
cfv3, cfv4 and cfv4e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use -mtune=68020-40
for code that needs to run relatively well on 68020, 68030
and 68040 targets. -mtune=68020-60 is similar but includes
68060 targets as well. <br>
These two options select the same tuning decisions as
-m68020-40 and -m68020-60 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines the macros
&quot;__mcarch&quot; and &quot;__mcarch__&quot; when tuning
for 680x0 architecture arch. It also defines
&quot;mcarch&quot; unless either -ansi or a non-GNU -std
option is used. <br>
If GCC is tuning for a range of architectures, as selected
by -mtune=68020-40 or -mtune=68020-60, it defines the macros
for every architecture in the range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC also defines the macro
&quot;__muarch__&quot; when tuning for ColdFire
microarchitecture uarch, where uarch is one of the arguments
given above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68000 <br>
-mc68000 <br>
Generate output for a 68000. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68000-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option for
microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core, including the
68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68010 <br>
Generate output for a 68010. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68010-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68010.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68020 <br>
-mc68020 <br>
Generate output for a 68020. This is the default when the

equivalent to -march=68020.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68030 <br>
Generate output for a 68030. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68030-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68030.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68040 <br>
Generate output for a 68040. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68040-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68040.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option inhibits the use of
68881/68882 instructions that have to be emulated by
software on the 68040. Use this option if your 68040 does
not have code to emulate those <br>
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68060 <br>
Generate output for a 68060. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for 68060-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=68060.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option inhibits the use of
68020 and 68881/68882 instructions that have to be emulated
by software on the 68060. Use this option if your 68060 does

emulate those instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu32 <br>
Generate output for a CPU32. This is the default when the
compiler is configured for CPU32-based systems. It is
equivalent to -march=cpu32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option for
microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+ core, including the
68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334, 68336, 68340, 68341,
68349 and 68360.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5200 <br>
Generate output for a 520X ColdFire CPU. This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems. It
is equivalent to -mcpu=5206, and is now deprecated <br>
in favor of that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this option for
microcontroller with a 5200 core, including the MCF5202,
MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5206.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5206e <br>
Generate output for a 5206e ColdFire CPU. The option is now
deprecated in favor of the equivalent -mcpu=5206e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m528x <br>
Generate output for a member of the ColdFire 528X family.
The option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent
-mcpu=528x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5307 <br>
Generate output for a ColdFire 5307 CPU. The option is now
deprecated in favor of the equivalent -mcpu=5307.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m5407 <br>
Generate output for a ColdFire 5407 CPU. The option is now
deprecated in favor of the equivalent -mcpu=5407.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcfv4e <br>
Generate output for a ColdFire V4e family CPU (e.g.
547x/548x). This includes use of hardware floating-point
instructions. The option is equivalent to -mcpu=547x, and is
<br>
now deprecated in favor of that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68020-40 <br>
Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
instructions. This results in code that can run relatively
efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a <br>
68040. The generated code does use the 68881 instructions
that are emulated on the 68040.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option is equivalent to
-march=68020 -mtune=68020-40.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m68020-60 <br>
Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
instructions. This results in code that can run relatively
efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a <br>
68040. The generated code does use the 68881 instructions
that are emulated on the 68060.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option is equivalent to
-march=68020 -mtune=68020-60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
-m68881 <br>
Generate floating-point instructions. This is the default
for 68020 and above, and for ColdFire devices that have an
FPU. It defines the macro &quot;__HAVE_68881__&quot; on
M680x0 <br>
targets and &quot;__mcffpu__&quot; on ColdFire targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Do not generate floating-point instructions; use library
calls instead. This is the default for 68000, 68010, and
68832 targets. It is also the default for ColdFire devices
<br>
that have no FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv <br>
-mno-div <br>
Generate (do not generate) ColdFire hardware divide and
remainder instructions. If -march is used without -mcpu, the
default is &quot;on&quot; for ColdFire architectures and
&quot;off&quot; for <br>
M680x0 architectures. Otherwise, the default is taken from
the target CPU (either the default CPU, or the one specified
by -mcpu). For example, the default is &quot;off&quot; for
<br>
-mcpu=5206 and &quot;on&quot; for -mcpu=5206e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines the macro
&quot;__mcfhwdiv__&quot; when this option is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshort <br>
Consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16 bits wide, like
&quot;short int&quot;. Additionally, parameters passed on
the stack are also aligned to a 16-bit boundary even on
targets whose API <br>
mandates promotion to 32-bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-short <br>
Do not consider type &quot;int&quot; to be 16 bits wide.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnobitfield <br>
-mno-bitfield <br>
Do not use the bit-field instructions. The -m68000, -mcpu32
and -m5200 options imply -mnobitfield.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbitfield <br>
Do use the bit-field instructions. The -m68020 option
implies -mbitfield. This is the default if you use a
configuration designed for a 68020.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrtd <br>
Use a different function-calling convention, in which
functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with
the &quot;rtd&quot; instruction, which pops their arguments
while <br>
returning. This saves one instruction in the caller since
there is no need to pop the arguments there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This calling convention is
incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you
cannot use it if you need to call libraries compiled with
the Unix compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you must provide function
prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of
arguments (including &quot;printf&quot;); otherwise
incorrect code is generated for calls to <br>
those functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, seriously incorrect
code results if you call a function with too many arguments.
(Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;rtd&quot; instruction
is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030, 68040, 68060 and
CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-rtd <br>
Do not use the calling conventions selected by -mrtd. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-int <br>
-mno-align-int <br>
Control whether GCC aligns &quot;int&quot;,
&quot;long&quot;, &quot;long long&quot;, &quot;float&quot;,
&quot;double&quot;, and &quot;long double&quot; variables on
a 32-bit boundary (-malign-int) or a 16-bit boundary <br>
(-mno-align-int). Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries
produces code that runs somewhat faster on processors with
32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use the
-malign-int switch, GCC aligns structures containing the
above types differently than most published application
binary interface specifications for <br>
the m68k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpcrel <br>
Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly,
instead of using a global offset table. At present, this
option implies -fpic, allowing at most a 16-bit offset <br>
for pc-relative addressing. -fPIC is not presently supported
with -mpcrel, though this could be supported for 68020 and
higher processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-strict-align <br>
-mstrict-align <br>
Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references are
handled by the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msep-data <br>
Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in
a different area of memory from the text segment. This
allows for execute-in-place in an environment without <br>
virtual memory management. This option implies -fPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-sep-data <br>
Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the
text segment. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mid-shared-library <br>
Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
ID method. This allows for execute-in-place and shared
libraries in an environment without virtual memory <br>
management. This option implies -fPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-id-shared-library <br>
Generate code that doesn&rsquo;t assume ID-based shared
libraries are being used. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared-library-id=n <br>
Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared
library being compiled. Specifying a value of 0 generates
more compact code; specifying other values forces the <br>
allocation of that number to the current library, but is no
more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxgot <br>
-mno-xgot <br>
When generating position-independent code for ColdFire,
generate code that works if the GOT has more than 8192
entries. This code is larger and slower than code generated
<br>
without this option. On M680x0 processors, this option is
not needed; -fPIC suffices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC normally uses a single
instruction to load values from the GOT. While this is
relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is smaller
than about 64k. Anything larger <br>
causes the linker to report an error such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relocation truncated to fit:
R_68K_GOT16O foobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this happens, you should
recompile your code with -mxgot. It should then work with
very large GOTs. However, code generated with -mxgot is less
efficient, since it takes <br>
4 instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some linkers,
including newer versions of the GNU linker, can create
multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries. If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use <br>
-mxgot when compiling a single object file that accesses
more than 8192 GOT entries. Very few do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options have no effect
unless GCC is generating position-independent code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-jump-table-offsets <br>
Use 32-bit offsets in &quot;switch&quot; tables. The default
is to use 16-bit offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MCore Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for the Motorola M*Core processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhardlit <br>
-mno-hardlit <br>
Inline constants into the code stream if it can be done in
two instructions or less.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv <br>
-mno-div <br>
Use the divide instruction. (Enabled by default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax-immediate <br>
-mno-relax-immediate <br>
Allow arbitrary-sized immediates in bit operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwide-bitfields <br>
-mno-wide-bitfields <br>
Always treat bit-fields as &quot;int&quot;-sized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4byte-functions <br>
-mno-4byte-functions <br>
Force all functions to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcallgraph-data <br>
-mno-callgraph-data <br>
Emit callgraph information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mslow-bytes <br>
-mno-slow-bytes <br>
Prefer word access when reading byte quantities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle-endian <br>
-mbig-endian <br>
Generate code for a little-endian target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m210 <br>
-m340 <br>
Generate code for the 210 processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-lsim <br>
Assume that runtime support has been provided and so omit
the simulator library (libsim.a) from the linker command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-increment=size <br>
Set the maximum amount for a single stack increment
operation. Large values can increase the speed of programs
that contain functions that need a large amount of stack
<br>
space, but they can also trigger a segmentation fault if the
stack is extended too much. The default value is 0x1000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MeP Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabsdiff <br>
Enables the &quot;abs&quot; instruction, which is the
absolute difference between two registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mall-opts <br>
Enables all the optional instructions---average, multiply,
divide, bit operations, leading zero, absolute difference,
min/max, clip, and saturation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maverage <br>
Enables the &quot;ave&quot; instruction, which computes the
average of two registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbased=n <br>
Variables of size n bytes or smaller are placed in the
&quot;.based&quot; section by default. Based variables use
the $tp register as a base register, and there is a 128-byte
limit to <br>
the &quot;.based&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbitops <br>
Enables the bit operation instructions---bit test

Enables the &quot;clip&quot; instruction. Note that -mclip
is not useful unless you also provide -mminmax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconfig=name <br>
Selects one of the built-in core configurations. Each MeP
chip has one or more modules in it; each module has a core
CPU and a variety of coprocessors, optional <br>
instructions, and peripherals. The
&quot;MeP-Integrator&quot; tool, not part of GCC, provides
these configurations through this option; using this option
is the same as using all the <br>
corresponding command-line options. The default
configuration is default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcop <br>
Enables the coprocessor instructions. By default, this is a
32-bit coprocessor. Note that the coprocessor is normally
enabled via the -mconfig= option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ms Causes all variables to
default to the &quot;.tiny&quot; section. Note that there is
a 65536-byte limit to this section. Accesses to these
variables use the %gp base register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msatur <br>
Enables the saturation instructions. Note that the compiler
does not currently generate these itself, but this option is
included for compatibility with other tools, like <br>

&quot;.near&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtiny=n <br>
Variables that are n bytes or smaller are allocated to the
&quot;.tiny&quot; section. These variables use the $gp base

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-EL Generate little-endian code.
This is the default for mips*el-*-* configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=arch <br>
Generate code that runs on arch, which can be the name of a
generic MIPS ISA, or the name of a particular processor. The
ISA names are: mips1, mips2, mips3, mips4, mips32, <br>
mips32r2, mips32r3, mips32r5, mips32r6, mips64, mips64r2,
mips64r3, mips64r5 and mips64r6. The processor names are:

vr4130, vr4300, vr5000, vr5400, vr5500, xlr and xlp. The
<br>
special value from-abi selects the most compatible
architecture for the selected ABI (that is, mips1 for 32-bit
ABIs and mips3 for 64-bit ABIs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The native Linux/GNU toolchain
also supports the value native, which selects the best
architecture option for the host processor. -march=native
has no effect if GCC does not <br>
recognize the processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In processor names, a final 000
can be abbreviated as k (for example, -march=r2k). Prefixes
are optional, and vr may be written r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Names of the form nf2_1 refer to
processors with FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core,
names of the form nf1_1 refer to processors with FPUs
clocked at the same rate as <br>
the core, and names of the form nf3_2 refer to processors
with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, nf is accepted as a synonym <br>
for nf2_1 while nx and bfx are accepted as synonyms for
nf1_1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC defines two macros based on
the value of this option. The first is
&quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot;, which gives the name of target
architecture, as a string. The second has the form <br>
&quot;_MIPS_ARCH_foo&quot;, where foo is the capitalized
value of &quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot;. For example, -march=r2000
sets &quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot; to &quot;r2000&quot; and defines
the macro &quot;_MIPS_ARCH_R2000&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the
&quot;_MIPS_ARCH&quot; macro uses the processor names given
above. In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate 000 as k. In the case of from-abi, the <br>
macro names the resolved architecture (either
&quot;mips1&quot; or &quot;mips3&quot;). It names the
default architecture when no -march option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=arch <br>
Optimize for arch. Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost
of arithmetic operations. The list of arch values is <br>
the same as for -march.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is not used,
GCC optimizes for the processor specified by -march. By
using -march and -mtune together, it is possible to generate
code that runs on a family <br>
of processors, but optimize the code for one particular
member of that family.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune defines the macros
&quot;_MIPS_TUNE&quot; and &quot;_MIPS_TUNE_foo&quot;, which
work in the same way as the -march ones described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips1 <br>
Equivalent to -march=mips1.</p>

Equivalent to -march=mips64r6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips16 <br>
-mno-mips16 <br>
Generate (do not generate) MIPS16 code. If GCC is targeting
a MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture, it makes use of the MIPS16e
ASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIPS16 code generation can also
be controlled on a per-function basis by means of
&quot;mips16&quot; and &quot;nomips16&quot; attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflip-mips16 <br>
Generate MIPS16 code on alternating functions. This option
is provided for regression testing of mixed
MIPS16/non-MIPS16 code generation, and is not intended for
ordinary <br>
use in compiling user code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minterlink-compressed <br>
-mno-interlink-compressed <br>
Require (do not require) that code using the standard
(uncompressed) MIPS ISA be link-compatible with MIPS16 and
microMIPS code, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, code using the
standard ISA encoding cannot jump directly to MIPS16 or
microMIPS code; it must either use a call or an indirect
jump. -minterlink-compressed <br>
therefore disables direct jumps unless GCC knows that the
target of the jump is not compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minterlink-mips16 <br>
-mno-interlink-mips16 <br>
Aliases of -minterlink-compressed and
-mno-interlink-compressed. These options predate the
microMIPS ASE and are retained for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=32 <br>
-mabi=o64 <br>
-mabi=n32 <br>
-mabi=64 <br>
-mabi=eabi <br>
Generate code for the given ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the EABI has a 32-bit
and a 64-bit variant. GCC normally generates 64-bit code
when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you can use
-mgp32 to get 32-bit code <br>
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information about the O64
ABI, see
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC supports a variant of the
o32 ABI in which floating-point registers are 64 rather than
32 bits wide. You can select this combination with -mabi=32
-mfp64. This ABI <br>
relies on the &quot;mthc1&quot; and &quot;mfhc1&quot;
instructions and is therefore only supported for MIPS32R2,
MIPS32R3 and MIPS32R5 processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The register assignments for
arguments and return values remain the same, but each scalar
value is passed in a single 64-bit register rather than a
pair of 32-bit registers. <br>
For example, scalar floating-point values are returned in
$f0 only, not a $f0/$f1 pair. The set of call-saved
registers also remains the same in that the even-numbered
<br>
double-precision registers are saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two additional variants of the
o32 ABI are supported to enable a transition from 32-bit to
64-bit registers. These are FPXX (-mfpxx) and FP64A (-mfp64
-mno-odd-spreg). The <br>
FPXX extension mandates that all code must execute correctly
when run using 32-bit or 64-bit registers. The code can be
interlinked with either FP32 or FP64, but not both. <br>
The FP64A extension is similar to the FP64 extension but
forbids the use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.
This can be used in conjunction with the &quot;FRE&quot;
mode of <br>
FPUs in MIPS32R5 processors and allows both FP32 and FP64A
code to interlink and run in the same process without
changing FPU modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabicalls <br>
-mno-abicalls <br>
Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for
SVR4-style dynamic objects. -mabicalls is the default for
SVR4-based systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared <br>
-mno-shared <br>
Generate (do not generate) code that is fully
position-independent, and that can therefore be linked into
shared libraries. This option only affects -mabicalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All -mabicalls code has
traditionally been position-independent, regardless of
options like -fPIC and -fpic. However, as an extension, the
GNU toolchain allows executables <br>
to use absolute accesses for locally-binding symbols. It can
also use shorter GP initialization sequences and generate
direct calls to locally-defined functions. This mode <br>
is selected by -mno-shared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-shared depends on binutils
2.16 or higher and generates objects that can only be linked
by the GNU linker. However, the option does not affect the
ABI of the final <br>
executable; it only affects the ABI of relocatable objects.
Using -mno-shared generally makes executables both smaller
and quicker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mshared is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mplt <br>
-mno-plt <br>
Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers
support PLTs and copy relocations. This option only affects
-mno-shared -mabicalls. For the n64 ABI, this option <br>
has no effect without -msym32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can make -mplt the default
by configuring GCC with --with-mips-plt. The default is
-mno-plt otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxgot <br>
-mno-xgot <br>
Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the
global offset table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC normally uses a single
instruction to load values from the GOT. While this is
relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is smaller
than about 64k. Anything larger <br>
causes the linker to report an error such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relocation truncated to fit:
R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this happens, you should
recompile your code with -mxgot. This works with very large
GOTs, although the code is also less efficient, since it
takes three instructions to <br>
fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some linkers can
create multiple GOTs. If you have such a linker, you should
only need to use -mxgot when a single object file accesses
more than 64k&rsquo;s worth of <br>
GOT entries. Very few do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options have no effect
unless GCC is generating position independent code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgp32 <br>
Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgp64 <br>
Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp32 <br>
Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp64 <br>
Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpxx <br>
Do not assume the width of floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
Do not use floating-point coprocessor instructions.
Implement floating-point calculations using library calls
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-float <br>
Equivalent to -msoft-float, but additionally asserts that
the program being compiled does not perform any
floating-point operations. This option is presently
supported only <br>
by some bare-metal MIPS configurations, where it may select
a special set of libraries that lack all floating-point
support (including, for example, the floating-point <br>
&quot;printf&quot; formats). If code compiled with
-mno-float accidentally contains floating-point operations,
it is likely to suffer a link-time or run-time failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-float <br>
Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports
single-precision operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdouble-float <br>
Assume that the floating-point coprocessor supports
double-precision operations. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-modd-spreg <br>
-mno-odd-spreg <br>
Enable the use of odd-numbered single-precision
floating-point registers for the o32 ABI. This is the
default for processors that are known to support these
registers. When <br>
using the o32 FPXX ABI, -mno-odd-spreg is set by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabs=2008 <br>
-mabs=legacy <br>
These options control the treatment of the special
not-a-number (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data with the
&quot;abs.fmt&quot; and &quot;neg.fmt&quot; machine
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default or when -mabs=legacy
is used the legacy treatment is selected. In this case these
instructions are considered arithmetic and avoided where
correct operation is <br>
required and the input operand might be a NaN. A longer
sequence of instructions that manipulate the sign bit of
floating-point datum manually is used instead unless the
<br>
-ffinite-math-only option has also been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mabs=2008 option selects
the IEEE 754-2008 treatment. In this case these instructions
are considered non-arithmetic and therefore operating
correctly in all cases, <br>
including in particular where the input operand is a NaN.
These instructions are therefore always used for the
respective operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnan=2008 <br>
-mnan=legacy <br>
These options control the encoding of the special
not-a-number (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mnan=legacy option selects
the legacy encoding. In this case quiet NaNs (qNaNs) are
denoted by the first bit of their trailing significand field
being 0, whereas <br>
signaling NaNs (sNaNs) are denoted by the first bit of their
trailing significand field being 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mnan=2008 option selects
the IEEE 754-2008 encoding. In this case qNaNs are denoted
by the first bit of their trailing significand field being
1, whereas sNaNs are <br>
denoted by the first bit of their trailing significand field
being 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -mnan=legacy
unless GCC has been configured with --with-nan=2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mllsc <br>
-mno-llsc <br>
Use (do not use) ll, sc, and sync instructions to implement
atomic memory built-in functions. When neither option is
specified, GCC uses the instructions if the target <br>
architecture supports them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mllsc is useful if the runtime
environment can emulate the instructions and -mno-llsc can
be useful when compiling for nonstandard ISAs. You can make
either option the <br>

--without-llsc respectively. --with-llsc is the default for
some configurations; see the installation documentation for
<br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdsp <br>
-mno-dsp <br>
Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS DSP ASE. <br>

defines &quot;__mips_dsp_rev&quot; to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmartmips <br>
-mno-smartmips <br>
Use (do not use) the MIPS SmartMIPS ASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpaired-single <br>
-mno-paired-single <br>
Use (do not use) paired-single floating-point instructions.
<br>
This option requires hardware floating-point support to be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdmx <br>
-mno-mdmx <br>
Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media Extension instructions.
This option can only be used when generating 64-bit code and
requires hardware floating-point support to be <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mips3d <br>

Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE. The option -mips3d implies
-mpaired-single.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmicromips <br>
-mno-micromips <br>
Generate (do not generate) microMIPS code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MicroMIPS code generation can
also be controlled on a per-function basis by means of
&quot;micromips&quot; and &quot;nomicromips&quot;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong64 <br>
Force &quot;long&quot; types to be 64 bits wide. See
-mlong32 for an explanation of the default and the way that
the pointer size is determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong32 <br>
Force &quot;long&quot;, &quot;int&quot;, and pointer types
to be 32 bits wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default size of
&quot;int&quot;s, &quot;long&quot;s and pointers depends on
the ABI. All the supported ABIs use 32-bit &quot;int&quot;s.
The n64 ABI uses 64-bit &quot;long&quot;s, as does the
64-bit EABI; the <br>
others use 32-bit &quot;long&quot;s. Pointers are the same
size as &quot;long&quot;s, or the same size as integer
registers, whichever is smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msym32 <br>
-mno-sym32 <br>
Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values,
regardless of the selected ABI. This option is useful in
combination with -mabi=64 and -mno-abicalls because it <br>
allows GCC to generate shorter and faster references to
symbolic addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G num <br>
Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data
section if that data is no bigger than num bytes. GCC can
then generate more efficient accesses to the data; see <br>
-mgpopt for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default -G option depends on
the configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlocal-sdata <br>
-mno-local-sdata <br>
Extend (do not extend) the -G behavior to local data too,
such as to static variables in C. -mlocal-sdata is the
default for all configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the linker complains that an
application is using too much small data, you might want to
try rebuilding the less performance-critical parts with
-mno-local-sdata. You <br>
might also want to build large libraries with
-mno-local-sdata, so that the libraries leave more room for
the main program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mextern-sdata <br>
-mno-extern-sdata <br>
Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data is in a
small data section if the size of that data is within the -G
limit. -mextern-sdata is the default for all <br>
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you compile a module Mod with
-mextern-sdata -G num -mgpopt, and Mod references a variable
Var that is no bigger than num bytes, you must make sure
that Var is placed in a <br>
small data section. If Var is defined by another module, you
must either compile that module with a high-enough -G
setting or attach a &quot;section&quot; attribute to
Var&rsquo;s <br>
definition. If Var is common, you must link the application
with a high-enough -G setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easiest way of satisfying
these restrictions is to compile and link every module with
the same -G option. However, you may wish to build a library
that supports several <br>
different small data limits. You can do this by compiling
the library with the highest supported -G setting and
additionally using -mno-extern-sdata to stop the library
from <br>
making assumptions about externally-defined data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgpopt <br>
-mno-gpopt <br>
Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are
known to be in a small data section; see -G, -mlocal-sdata
and -mextern-sdata. -mgpopt is the default for all <br>
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-gpopt is useful for cases
where the $gp register might not hold the value of
&quot;_gp&quot;. For example, if the code is part of a
library that might be used in a boot monitor, <br>
programs that call boot monitor routines pass an unknown
value in $gp. (In such situations, the boot monitor itself
is usually compiled with -G0.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-gpopt implies
-mno-local-sdata and -mno-extern-sdata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-membedded-data <br>
-mno-embedded-data <br>
Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if
possible, then next in the small data section if possible,
otherwise in data. This gives slightly slower code than <br>
the default, but reduces the amount of RAM required when
executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muninit-const-in-rodata <br>
-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata <br>
Put uninitialized &quot;const&quot; variables in the
read-only data section. This option is only meaningful in
conjunction with -membedded-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=setting <br>
Specify whether GCC may generate code that reads from
executable sections. There are three possible settings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=yes <br>
Instructions may freely access executable sections. This is
the default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=pcrel <br>
MIPS16 PC-relative load instructions can access executable
sections, but other instructions must not do so. This option
is useful on 4KSc and 4KSd processors when the <br>
code TLBs have the Read Inhibit bit set. It is also useful
on processors that can be configured to have a dual
instruction/data SRAM interface and that, like the M4K, <br>
automatically redirect PC-relative loads to the instruction
RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-readable=no <br>
Instructions must not access executable sections. This
option can be useful on targets that are configured to have
a dual instruction/data SRAM interface but that <br>
(unlike the M4K) do not automatically redirect PC-relative
loads to the instruction RAM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msplit-addresses <br>
-mno-split-addresses <br>
Enable (disable) use of the &quot;%hi()&quot; and
&quot;%lo()&quot; assembler relocation operators. This
option has been superseded by -mexplicit-relocs but is
retained for backwards <br>
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexplicit-relocs <br>
-mno-explicit-relocs <br>
Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing
with symbolic addresses. The alternative, selected by
-mno-explicit-relocs, is to use assembler macros
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mexplicit-relocs is the default
if GCC was configured to use an assembler that supports
relocation operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcheck-zero-division <br>
-mno-check-zero-division <br>
Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mcheck-zero-division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdivide-traps <br>
-mdivide-breaks <br>
MIPS systems check for division by zero by generating either
a conditional trap or a break instruction. Using traps
results in smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II
<br>
and later. Also, some versions of the Linux kernel have a
bug that prevents trap from generating the proper signal
(&quot;SIGFPE&quot;). Use -mdivide-traps to allow
conditional traps <br>
on architectures that support them and -mdivide-breaks to
force the use of breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is usually
-mdivide-traps, but this can be overridden at configure time
using --with-divide=breaks. Divide-by-zero checks can be
completely disabled using <br>
-mno-check-zero-division.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mload-store-pairs <br>
-mno-load-store-pairs <br>
Enable (disable) an optimization that pairs consecutive load
or store instructions to enable load/store bonding. This
option is enabled by default but only takes effect when <br>
the selected architecture is known to support bonding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemcpy <br>
-mno-memcpy <br>
Force (do not force) the use of &quot;memcpy&quot; for
non-trivial block moves. The default is -mno-memcpy, which
allows GCC to inline most constant-sized copies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Disable (do not disable) use of the &quot;jal&quot;
instruction. Calling functions using &quot;jal&quot; is more
efficient but requires the caller and callee to be in the
same 256 megabyte <br>
segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option has no effect on
abicalls code. The default is -mno-long-calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmad <br>
-mno-mad <br>
Enable (disable) use of the &quot;mad&quot;,
&quot;madu&quot; and &quot;mul&quot; instructions, as
provided by the R4650 ISA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mimadd <br>
-mno-imadd <br>
Enable (disable) use of the &quot;madd&quot; and
&quot;msub&quot; integer instructions. The default is
-mimadd on architectures that support &quot;madd&quot; and
&quot;msub&quot; except for the 74k architecture <br>
where it was found to generate slower code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Enable (disable) use of the floating-point
multiply-accumulate instructions, when they are available.
The default is -mfused-madd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the R8000 CPU when
multiply-accumulate instructions are used, the intermediate
product is calculated to infinite precision and is not
subject to the FCSR Flush to Zero <br>
bit. This may be undesirable in some circumstances. On other
processors the result is numerically identical to the
equivalent computation using separate multiply, add, <br>
subtract and negate instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nocpp <br>
Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over
user assembler files (with a .s suffix) when assembling
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-24k <br>
-mno-fix-24k <br>
Work around the 24K E48 (lost data on stores during refill)
errata. The workarounds are implemented by the assembler
rather than by GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-r4000 <br>

3.0. They may deadlock on revisions 2.6 and earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can only be used if
the target architecture supports branch-likely instructions.

default otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-rm7000 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting
<br>
Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid
the side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In common with many processors,
the R10K tries to predict the outcome of a conditional
branch and speculatively executes instructions from the
&quot;taken&quot; branch. It later <br>
aborts these instructions if the predicted outcome is wrong.
However, on the R10K, even aborted instructions can have
side effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This problem only affects kernel
stores and, depending on the system, kernel loads. As an
example, a speculatively-executed store may load the target
memory into cache and <br>
mark the cache line as dirty, even if the store itself is
later aborted. If a DMA operation writes to the same area of
memory before the &quot;dirty&quot; line is flushed, the
cached <br>
data overwrites the DMA-ed data. See the R10K processor
manual for a full description, including other potential
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One workaround is to insert
cache barrier instructions before every memory access that
might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted. <br>
-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting controls GCC&rsquo;s
implementation of this workaround. It assumes that aborted
accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side <br>
effects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the memory occupied by the
current function&rsquo;s stack frame;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. the memory occupied by an
incoming stack argument;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. the memory occupied by an
object with a link-time-constant address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is the kernel&rsquo;s
responsibility to ensure that speculative accesses to these
regions are indeed safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the input program contains a
function declaration such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void foo (void);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then the implementation of
&quot;foo&quot; must allow &quot;j foo&quot; and &quot;jal
foo&quot; to be executed speculatively. GCC honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself. It expects
<br>
non-GCC functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do
the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option has three forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store
<br>
Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=store <br>
Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mr10k-cache-barrier=none <br>
Disable the insertion of cache barriers. This is the default
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflush-func=func <br>
-mno-flush-func <br>
Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches,
or to not call any such function. If called, the function
must take the same arguments as the common <br>
&quot;_flush_func&quot;, that is, the address of the memory
range for which the cache is being flushed, the size of the
memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both caches). The
<br>
default depends on the target GCC was configured for, but
commonly is either &quot;_flush_func&quot; or
&quot;__cpu_flush&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbranch-cost=num <br>
Set the cost of branches to roughly num &quot;simple&quot;
instructions. This cost is only a heuristic and is not
guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases. A
zero <br>
cost redundantly selects the default, which is based on the
-mtune setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-likely <br>
-mno-branch-likely <br>
Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions,
regardless of the default for the selected architecture. By
default, Branch Likely instructions may be generated if they
<br>
are supported by the selected architecture. An exception is
for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures and processors that
implement those architectures; for those, Branch <br>
Likely instructions are not be generated by default because
the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate
their use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcompact-branches=never <br>
-mcompact-branches=optimal <br>
-mcompact-branches=always <br>
These options control which form of branches will be
generated. The default is -mcompact-branches=optimal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mcompact-branches=never
option ensures that compact branch instructions will never
be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mcompact-branches=always
option ensures that a compact branch instruction will be
generated if available. If a compact branch instruction is
not available, a delay slot <br>
form of the branch will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is supported from
MIPS Release 6 onwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mcompact-branches=optimal
option will cause a delay slot branch to be used if one is
available in the current ISA and the delay slot is
successfully filled. If the <br>
delay slot is not filled, a compact branch will be chosen if
one is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfp-exceptions <br>
-mno-fp-exceptions <br>
Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled. This affects
how FP instructions are scheduled for some processors. The
default is that FP exceptions are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, on the SB-1, if FP
exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting 64-bit code,
then we can use both FP pipes. Otherwise, we can only use
one FP pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvr4130-align <br>
-mno-vr4130-align <br>
The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only
issue two instructions together if the first one is 8-byte
aligned. When this option is enabled, GCC aligns pairs of
<br>
instructions that it thinks should execute in parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option only has an effect
when optimizing for the VR4130. It normally makes code
faster, but at the expense of making it bigger. It is
enabled by default at <br>
optimization level -O3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msynci <br>
-mno-synci <br>
Enable (disable) generation of &quot;synci&quot;
instructions on architectures that support it. The
&quot;synci&quot; instructions (if enabled) are generated
when &quot;__builtin___clear_cache&quot; is <br>
compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option defaults to
-mno-synci, but the default can be overridden by configuring
GCC with --with-synci.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When compiling code for single
processor systems, it is generally safe to use
&quot;synci&quot;. However, on many multi-core (SMP)
systems, it does not invalidate the instruction <br>
caches on all cores and may lead to undefined behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax-pic-calls <br>
-mno-relax-pic-calls <br>
Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via
register $25 into direct calls. This is only possible if the
linker can resolve the destination at link time and if <br>
the destination is within range for a direct call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax-pic-calls is the default
if GCC was configured to use an assembler and a linker that
support the &quot;.reloc&quot; assembly directive and
-mexplicit-relocs is in effect. With <br>
-mno-explicit-relocs, this optimization can be performed by
the assembler and the linker alone without help from the
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmcount-ra-address <br>
-mno-mcount-ra-address <br>
Emit (do not emit) code that allows &quot;_mcount&quot; to
modify the calling function&rsquo;s return address. When
enabled, this option extends the usual &quot;_mcount&quot;
interface with a new ra- <br>
address parameter, which has type &quot;intptr_t *&quot; and
is passed in register $12. &quot;_mcount&quot; can then
modify the return address by doing both of the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Returning the new address in
register $31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Storing the new address in
&quot;*ra-address&quot;, if ra-address is nonnull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mno-mcount-ra-address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mframe-header-opt <br>
-mno-frame-header-opt <br>
Enable (disable) frame header optimization in the o32 ABI.
When using the o32 ABI, calling functions will allocate 16
bytes on the stack for the called function to write out <br>
register arguments. When enabled, this optimization will
suppress the allocation of the frame header if it can be
determined that it is unused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This optimization is off by
default at all optimization levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlxc1-sxc1 <br>
-mno-lxc1-sxc1 <br>
When applicable, enable (disable) the generation of

Specify that intrinsic library functions are being compiled,
passing all values in registers, no matter the size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mepsilon <br>
-mno-epsilon <br>
Generate floating-point comparison instructions that compare
with respect to the &quot;rE&quot; epsilon register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=mmixware <br>
-mabi=gnu <br>
Generate code that passes function parameters and return
values that (in the called function) are seen as registers
$0 and up, as opposed to the GNU ABI which uses global <br>
registers $231 and up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mzero-extend <br>
-mno-zero-extend <br>
When reading data from memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits,
use (do not use) zero-extending load instructions by
default, rather than sign-extending ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mknuthdiv <br>
-mno-knuthdiv <br>
Make the result of a division yielding a remainder have the
same sign as the divisor. With the default, -mno-knuthdiv,
the sign of the remainder follows the sign of the <br>
dividend. Both methods are arithmetically valid, the latter
being almost exclusively used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtoplevel-symbols <br>
-mno-toplevel-symbols <br>
Prepend (do not prepend) a : to all global symbols, so the
assembly code can be used with the &quot;PREFIX&quot;
assembly directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-melf <br>
Generate an executable in the ELF format, rather than the
default mmo format used by the mmix simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-predict <br>
-mno-branch-predict <br>
Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when
static branch prediction indicates a probable branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbase-addresses <br>
-mno-base-addresses <br>
Generate (do not generate) code that uses base addresses.
Using a base address automatically generates a request
(handled by the assembler and the linker) for a constant to
<br>
be set up in a global register. The register is used for one
or more base address requests within the range 0 to 255 from
the value held in the register. The generally <br>
leads to short and fast code, but the number of different
data items that can be addressed is limited. This means that
a program that uses lots of static data may require <br>
-mno-base-addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-exit <br>
-mno-single-exit <br>
Force (do not force) generated code to have a single exit
point in each function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MN10300 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for

mn10300, am33, am33-2 or am34.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mreturn-pointer-on-d0 <br>
When generating a function that returns a pointer, return
the pointer in both &quot;a0&quot; and &quot;d0&quot;.
Otherwise, the pointer is returned only in &quot;a0&quot;,
and attempts to call such <br>
functions without a prototype result in errors. Note that
this option is on by default; use -mno-return-pointer-on-d0
to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-crt0 <br>
Do not link in the C run-time initialization object
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation
optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and absolute
memory addresses. This option only has an effect when <br>
used on the command line for the final link step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option makes symbolic
debugging impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mliw <br>
Allow the compiler to generate Long Instruction Word

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MSP430 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
the MSP430:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-masm-hex <br>
Force assembly output to always use hex constants. Normally
such constants are signed decimals, but this option is
available for testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmcu= <br>
Select the MCU to target. This is used to create a C
preprocessor symbol based upon the MCU name, converted to
upper case and pre- and post-fixed with __. This in turn is
<br>
used by the msp430.h header file to select an MCU-specific
supplementary header file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option also sets the ISA to
use. If the MCU name is one that is known to only support
the 430 ISA then that is selected, otherwise the 430X ISA is
selected. A generic <br>
MCU name of msp430 can also be used to select the 430 ISA.
Similarly the generic msp430x MCU name selects the 430X
ISA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition an MCU-specific
linker script is added to the linker command line. The
script&rsquo;s name is the name of the MCU with .ld
appended. Thus specifying -mmcu=xxx on the <br>
gcc command line defines the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;__XXX__&quot; and cause the linker to search for a
script called xxx.ld.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is also passed on to
the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-mcu <br>
-mno-warn-mcu <br>
This option enables or disables warnings about conflicts
between the MCU name specified by the -mmcu option and the
ISA set by the -mcpu option and/or the hardware multiply
<br>
support set by the -mhwmult option. It also toggles warnings
about unrecognized MCU names. This option is on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu= <br>
Specifies the ISA to use. Accepted values are msp430,
msp430x and msp430xv2. This option is deprecated. The -mmcu=
option should be used to select the ISA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Link to the simulator runtime libraries and linker script.
Overrides any scripts that would be selected by the -mmcu=
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlarge <br>
Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 32-bit
&quot;size_t&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall <br>
Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit
&quot;size_t&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and
allows the linker to perform certain optimizations that
cannot be done until the final link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mhwmult= <br>
Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the
target. Accepted values are none for no hardware multiply,
16bit for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by
<br>
early MCUs. 32bit for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by
later MCUs and f5series for the 16/32-bit multiply supported
by F5-series MCUs. A value of auto can also be given. <br>
This tells GCC to deduce the hardware multiply support based
upon the MCU name provided by the -mmcu option. If no -mmcu
option is specified or if the MCU name is not <br>
recognized then no hardware multiply support is assumed.
&quot;auto&quot; is the default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hardware multiplies are normally
performed by calling a library routine. This saves space in
the generated code. When compiling at -O3 or higher however
the hardware <br>
multiplier is invoked inline. This makes for bigger, but
faster code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hardware multiply routines
disable interrupts whilst running and restore the previous
interrupt state when they finish. This makes them safe to
use inside interrupt <br>
handlers as well as in normal code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minrt <br>
Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static
initializers or constructors. This is intended for
memory-constrained devices. The compiler includes special
<br>
symbols in some objects that tell the linker and runtime
which code fragments are required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcode-region= <br>
-mdata-region= <br>
These options tell the compiler where to place functions and
data that do not have one of the &quot;lower&quot;,
&quot;upper&quot;, &quot;either&quot; or &quot;section&quot;
attributes. Possible values are <br>
&quot;lower&quot;, &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;either&quot; or
&quot;any&quot;. The first three behave like the
corresponding attribute. The fourth possible value -
&quot;any&quot; - is the default. It leaves placement <br>
entirely up to the linker script and how it assigns the
standard sections (&quot;.text&quot;, &quot;.data&quot;,
etc) to the memory regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msilicon-errata= <br>
This option passes on a request to assembler to enable the
fixes for the named silicon errata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msilicon-errata-warn= <br>
This option passes on a request to the assembler to enable
warning messages when a silicon errata might need to be
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgpopt is equivalent to
-mgpopt=local, and -mno-gpopt is equivalent to
-mgpopt=none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -mgpopt except

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to specify
-mno-gpopt explicitly when building programs that include
large amounts of small data, including large GOT data

the default is not to emit them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcustom-insn=N <br>
-mno-custom-insn <br>
Each -mcustom-insn=N option enables use of a custom

low-level system calls required by the C library, e.g.
&quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot;. This option is
typically used to link <br>
with a library provided by a HAL BSP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nvidia PTX Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
Nvidia PTX:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmainkernel <br>
Link in code for a __main kernel. This is for stand-alone
instead of offloading execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-moptimize <br>
Apply partitioned execution optimizations. This is the
default when any level of optimization is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-stack <br>
Generate code that does not use &quot;.local&quot; memory
directly for stack storage. Instead, a per-warp stack
pointer is maintained explicitly. This enables
variable-length stack <br>
allocation (with variable-length arrays or
&quot;alloca&quot;), and when global memory is used for
underlying storage, makes it possible to access automatic
variables from other <br>
threads, or with atomic instructions. This code generation
variant is used for OpenMP offloading, but the option is
exposed on its own for the purpose of testing the <br>
compiler; to generate code suitable for linking into
programs using OpenMP offloading, use option -mgomp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muniform-simt <br>
Switch to code generation variant that allows to execute all
threads in each warp, while maintaining memory state and
side effects as if only one thread in each warp was <br>
active outside of OpenMP SIMD regions. All atomic operations
and calls to runtime (malloc, free, vprintf) are
conditionally executed (iff current lane index equals the
<br>
master lane index), and the register being assigned is
copied via a shuffle instruction from the master lane.
Outside of SIMD regions lane 0 is the master; inside, each
<br>
thread sees itself as the master. Shared memory array
&quot;int __nvptx_uni[]&quot; stores all-zeros or all-ones
bitmasks for each warp, indicating current mode (0 outside
of SIMD <br>
regions). Each thread can bitwise-and the bitmask at
position &quot;tid.y&quot; with current lane index to
compute the master lane index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgomp <br>
Generate code for use in OpenMP offloading: enables
-msoft-stack and -muniform-simt options, and selects
corresponding multilib variant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDP-11 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
the PDP-11:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu <br>
Use hardware FPP floating point. This is the default. (FIS
floating point on the PDP-11/40 is not supported.)</p>

Generate code for a PDP-11/45. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m10 <br>
Generate code for a PDP-11/10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbcopy-builtin <br>
Use inline &quot;movmemhi&quot; patterns for copying memory.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbcopy <br>
Do not use inline &quot;movmemhi&quot; patterns for copying
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint16 <br>
-mno-int32 <br>
Use 16-bit &quot;int&quot;. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint32 <br>
-mno-int16 <br>
Use 32-bit &quot;int&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat64 <br>
-mno-float32 <br>
Use 64-bit &quot;float&quot;. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfloat32 <br>
-mno-float64 <br>
Use 32-bit &quot;float&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabshi <br>
Use &quot;abshi2&quot; pattern. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-abshi <br>
Do not use &quot;abshi2&quot; pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-expensive <br>
Pretend that branches are expensive. This is for
experimenting with code generation only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cheap <br>
Do not pretend that branches are expensive. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munix-asm <br>
Use Unix assembler syntax. This is the default when
configured for pdp11-*-bsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdec-asm <br>
Use DEC assembler syntax. This is the default when
configured for any PDP-11 target other than pdp11-*-bsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">picoChip Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
picoChip implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=ae_type <br>
Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
scheduling parameters for array element type ae_type.
Supported values for ae_type are ANY, MUL, and MAC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=ANY selects a completely
generic AE type. Code generated with this option runs on any
of the other AE types. The code is not as efficient as it
would be if compiled <br>
for a specific AE type, and some types of operation (e.g.,
multiplication) do not work properly on all types of AE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=MUL selects a MUL AE type.
This is the most useful AE type for compiled code, and is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mae=MAC selects a DSP-style MAC
AE. Code compiled with this option may suffer from poor
performance of byte (char) manipulation, since the DSP AE
does not provide hardware <br>
support for byte load/stores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msymbol-as-address <br>
Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an
address in a load/store instruction, without first loading
it into a register. Typically, the use of this option <br>
generates larger programs, which run faster than when the
option isn&rsquo;t used. However, the results vary from
program to program, so it is left as a user option, rather
than <br>
being permanently enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-inefficient-warnings <br>
Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.
These warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling
code that performs byte-level memory operations on <br>
the MAC AE type. The MAC AE has no hardware support for
byte-level memory operations, so all byte load/stores must
be synthesized from word load/store operations. This is <br>
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate that you
should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to
target an AE type that has the necessary hardware support.
<br>
This option disables these warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PowerPC Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are listed under</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RISC-V Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These command-line options are
defined for RISC-V targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=n <br>
Set the cost of branches to roughly n instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemcpy <br>
-mno-memcpy <br>
Don&rsquo;t optimize block moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mplt <br>
-mno-plt <br>
When generating PIC code, allow the use of PLTs. Ignored for
non-PIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=ABI-string <br>
Specify integer and floating-point calling convention. This
defaults to the natural calling convention: e.g. LP64 for
RV64I, ILP32 for RV32I, LP64D for RV64G.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfdiv <br>
-mno-fdiv <br>
Use hardware floating-point divide and square root
instructions. This requires the F or D extensions for
floating-point registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv <br>
-mno-div <br>
Use hardware instructions for integer division. This
requires the M extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=ISA-string <br>
Generate code for given RISC-V ISA (e.g. rv64im). ISA
strings must be lower-case. Examples include rv64i, rv32g,
and rv32imaf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=processor-string <br>
Optimize the output for the given processor, specified by
microarchitecture name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-data-limit=n <br>
Put global and static data smaller than n bytes into a
special section (on some targets).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msave-restore <br>
-mno-save-restore <br>
Use smaller but slower prologue and epilogue code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=code-model <br>
Specify the code model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RL78 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Links in additional target libraries to support operation
within a simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmul=none <br>
-mmul=g10 <br>
-mmul=g13 <br>
-mmul=g14 <br>
-mmul=rl78 <br>
Specifies the type of hardware multiplication and division
support to be used. The simplest is &quot;none&quot;, which
uses software for both multiplication and division. This is
the <br>
default. The &quot;g13&quot; value is for the hardware
multiply/divide peripheral found on the RL78/G13 (S2 core)
targets. The &quot;g14&quot; value selects the use of the
multiplication and <br>
division instructions supported by the RL78/G14 (S3 core)
parts. The value &quot;rl78&quot; is an alias for
&quot;g14&quot; and the value &quot;mg10&quot; is an alias
for &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition a C preprocessor
macro is defined, based upon the setting of this option.
Possible values are: &quot;__RL78_MUL_NONE__&quot;,
&quot;__RL78_MUL_G13__&quot; or
&quot;__RL78_MUL_G14__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=g10 <br>
-mcpu=g13 <br>
-mcpu=g14 <br>
-mcpu=rl78 <br>
Specifies the RL78 core to target. The default is the G14
core, also known as an S3 core or just RL78. The G13 or S2
core does not have multiply or divide instructions, <br>
instead it uses a hardware peripheral for these operations.
The G10 or S1 core does not have register banks, so it uses
a different calling convention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set it also
selects the type of hardware multiply support to use, unless
this is overridden by an explicit -mmul=none option on the
command line. Thus <br>
specifying -mcpu=g13 enables the use of the G13 hardware
multiply peripheral and specifying -mcpu=g10 disables the
use of hardware multiplications altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, although the RL78/G14 core
is the default target, specifying -mcpu=g14 or -mcpu=rl78 on
the command line does change the behavior of the toolchain
since it also enables <br>
G14 hardware multiply support. If these options are not
specified on the command line then software multiplication
routines will be used even though the code targets the <br>
RL78 core. This is for backwards compatibility with older
toolchains which did not have hardware multiply and divide
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition a C preprocessor
macro is defined, based upon the setting of this option.
Possible values are: &quot;__RL78_G10__&quot;,
&quot;__RL78_G13__&quot; or &quot;__RL78_G14__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mg10 <br>
-mg13 <br>
-mg14 <br>
-mrl78 <br>
These are aliases for the corresponding -mcpu= option. They
are provided for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mallregs <br>
Allow the compiler to use all of the available registers. By
default registers &quot;r24..r31&quot; are reserved for use
in interrupt handlers. With this option enabled these <br>
registers can be used in ordinary functions as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m64bit-doubles <br>
-m32bit-doubles <br>
Make the &quot;double&quot; data type be 64 bits
(-m64bit-doubles) or 32 bits (-m32bit-doubles) in size. The
default is -m32bit-doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msave-mduc-in-interrupts <br>
-mno-save-mduc-in-interrupts <br>
Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve
the MDUC registers. This is only necessary if normal code
might use the MDUC registers, for example because it <br>
performs multiplication and division operations. The default
is to ignore the MDUC registers as this makes the interrupt
handlers faster. The target option -mg13 needs to <br>
be passed for this to work as this feature is only available
on the G13 target (S2 core). The MDUC registers will only be
saved if the interrupt handler performs a <br>
multiplication or division operation or it calls another
function.</p>

You use these options to specify which instructions are
available on the processor you are using. The default value
of these options is determined when configuring GCC. <br>
Specifying the -mcpu=cpu_type overrides the specification of
these options. We recommend you use the -mcpu=cpu_type
option rather than the options listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying -mpowerpc-gpopt
allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture
instructions in the General Purpose group, including
floating-point square root. Specifying <br>
-mpowerpc-gfxopt allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC
architecture instructions in the Graphics group, including
floating-point select.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mmfcrf option allows GCC to
generate the move from condition register field instruction
implemented on the POWER4 processor and other processors

other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture. The -mpopcntd option allows GCC to generate
the popcount instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor

generate the FP move to/from general-purpose register <br>
instructions implemented on the POWER6X processor and other
processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05
architecture. The -mhard-dfp option allows GCC to generate
the <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mpowerpc64 option allows
GCC to generate the additional 64-bit instructions that are
found in the full PowerPC64 architecture and to treat GPRs
as 64-bit, doubleword <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VSX instruction set (-mvsx,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin
and SVR4 targets (including GNU/Linux). The 32-bit
environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and
generates <br>
code that runs on any PowerPC variant. The 64-bit
environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64
bits, and generates code for PowerPC64, as for
-mpowerpc64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfull-toc <br>
-mno-fp-in-toc <br>
-mno-sum-in-toc <br>
-mminimal-toc <br>
Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is
created for every executable file. The -mfull-toc option is
selected by default. In that case, GCC allocates at <br>
least one TOC entry for each unique non-automatic variable
reference in your program. GCC also places floating-point
constants in the TOC. However, only 16,384 entries are <br>
available in the TOC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you receive a linker error
message that saying you have overflowed the available TOC
space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used with the
-mno-fp-in-toc and <br>
-mno-sum-in-toc options. -mno-fp-in-toc prevents GCC from
putting floating-point constants in the TOC and
-mno-sum-in-toc forces GCC to generate code to calculate the
sum of <br>
an address and a constant at run time instead of putting
that sum into the TOC. You may specify one or both of these
options. Each causes GCC to produce very slightly <br>
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you still run out of space in
the TOC even when you specify both of these options, specify
-mminimal-toc instead. This option causes GCC to make only
one TOC entry for <br>
every file. When you specify this option, GCC produces code
that is slower and larger but which uses extremely little
TOC space. You may wish to use this option only on <br>
files that contain less frequently-executed code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maix64 <br>
-maix32 <br>
Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit
pointers, 64-bit &quot;long&quot; type, and the
infrastructure needed to support them. Specifying -maix64
implies -mpowerpc64, <br>
while -maix32 disables the 64-bit ABI and implies
-mno-powerpc64. GCC defaults to -maix32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mxl-compat <br>
-mno-xl-compat <br>
Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler
semantics when using AIX-compatible ABI. Pass floating-point
arguments to prototyped functions beyond the register <br>
save area (RSA) on the stack in addition to argument FPRs.
Do not assume that most significant double in 128-bit long
double value is properly rounded when comparing values <br>
and converting to double. Use XL symbol names for long
double support routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AIX calling convention was
extended but not initially documented to handle an obscure
K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the address
of its arguments with fewer <br>
arguments than declared. IBM XL compilers access
floating-point arguments that do not fit in the RSA from the
stack when a subroutine is compiled without optimization.
<br>
Because always storing floating-point arguments on the stack
is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled
by default and only is necessary when calling <br>
subroutines compiled by IBM XL compilers without
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpe <br>
Support IBM RS/6000 SP Parallel Environment (PE). Link an
application written to use message passing with special
startup code to enable the application to run. The system
<br>
must have PE installed in the standard location
(/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/), or the specs file must be overridden
with the -specs= option to specify the appropriate directory
<br>
location. The Parallel Environment does not support threads,
so the -mpe option and the -pthread option are
incompatible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-natural <br>
-malign-power <br>
On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the
option -malign-natural overrides the ABI-defined alignment
of larger types, such as floating-point doubles, on their
<br>
natural size-based boundary. The option -malign-power
instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified alignment rules.
GCC defaults to the standard alignment defined in the
ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On 64-bit Darwin, natural
alignment is the default, and -malign-power is not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>

to GCC when linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-float <br>
-mdouble-float <br>
Generate code for single- or double-precision floating-point

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmultiple <br>
-mno-multiple <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple
word instructions and the store multiple word instructions.
These instructions are generated by default on POWER <br>
systems, and not generated on PowerPC systems. Do not use
-mmultiple on little-endian PowerPC systems, since those
instructions do not work when the processor is in little-
<br>
endian mode. The exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which
permit these instructions in little-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstring <br>
-mno-string <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load string
instructions and the store string word instructions to save
multiple registers and do small block moves. These <br>
instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and
not generated on PowerPC systems. Do not use -mstring on
little-endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions <br>
do not work when the processor is in little-endian mode. The
exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit these
instructions in little-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mupdate <br>
-mno-update <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store
instructions that update the base register to the address of
the calculated memory location. These instructions are <br>
generated by default. If you use -mno-update, there is a
small window between the time that the stack pointer is
updated and the address of the previous frame is stored,
<br>
which means code that walks the stack frame across
interrupts or signals may get corrupted data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mavoid-indexed-addresses <br>
-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses <br>
Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of
indexed load or store instructions. These instructions can
incur a performance penalty on Power6 processors in <br>
certain situations, such as when stepping through large
arrays that cross a 16M boundary. This option is enabled by
default when targeting Power6 and disabled otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
multiply and accumulate instructions. These instructions are
generated by default if hardware floating point is <br>
used. The machine-dependent -mfused-madd option is now
mapped to the machine-independent -ffp-contract=fast option,
and -mno-fused-madd is mapped to -ffp-contract=off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmulhw <br>
-mno-mulhw <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word
multiply and multiply-accumulate instructions on the IBM

<br>
generated by default when targeting those processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdlmzb <br>
-mno-dlmzb <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search
dlmzb instruction on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476

<br>
targeting those processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-bit-align <br>
-mbit-align <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force
structures and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned
to the base type of the bit-field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, by default a
structure containing nothing but 8 &quot;unsigned&quot;
bit-fields of length 1 is aligned to a 4-byte boundary and
has a size of 4 bytes. By using <br>
-mno-bit-align, the structure is aligned to a 1-byte

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-strict-align <br>
-mstrict-align <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do)
assume that unaligned memory references are handled by the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelocatable <br>
-mno-relocatable <br>
Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static
executable to be relocated to a different address at run
time. A simple embedded PowerPC system loader should
relocate <br>
the entire contents of &quot;.got2&quot; and 4-byte
locations listed in the &quot;.fixup&quot; section, a table
of 32-bit addresses generated by this option. For this to
work, all objects <br>
linked together must be compiled with -mrelocatable or
-mrelocatable-lib. -mrelocatable code aligns the stack to an
8-byte boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelocatable-lib <br>
-mno-relocatable-lib <br>
Like -mrelocatable, -mrelocatable-lib generates a
&quot;.fixup&quot; section to allow static executables to be
relocated at run time, but -mrelocatable-lib does not use
the smaller <br>
stack alignment of -mrelocatable. Objects compiled with
-mrelocatable-lib may be linked with objects compiled with
any combination of the -mrelocatable options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-toc <br>
-mtoc <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do)
assume that register 2 contains a pointer to a global area

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlittle <br>
-mlittle-endian <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for

-mbig-endian <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for
the processor in big-endian mode. The -mbig-endian option is
the same as -mbig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdynamic-no-pic <br>
On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is
not relocatable, but that its external references are
relocatable. The resulting code is suitable for <br>
applications, but not shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msingle-pic-base <br>
Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only,

The runtime system is responsible for initializing this <br>
register with an appropriate value before execution
begins.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprioritize-restricted-insns=priority

default, num is 8. The -G num switch is also passed to the
linker. All modules should be compiled with the same -G num
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mregnames <br>
-mno-regnames <br>
On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit
register names in the assembly language output using
symbolic forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlongcall <br>
-mno-longcall <br>
By default assume that all calls are far away so that a
longer and more expensive calling sequence is required. This
is required for calls farther than 32 megabytes <br>
(33,554,432 bytes) from the current location. A short call
is generated if the compiler knows the call cannot be that
far away. This setting can be overridden by the <br>
&quot;shortcall&quot; function attribute, or by
&quot;#pragma longcall(0)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some linkers are capable of
detecting out-of-range calls and generating glue code on the
fly. On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code. As of <br>
this writing, the AIX linker can do this, as can the GNU
linker for PowerPC/64. It is planned to add this feature to
the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Darwin/PPC systems,
&quot;#pragma longcall&quot; generates &quot;jbsr callee,
L42&quot;, plus a branch island (glue code). The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch <br>
island. The Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and
generates a &quot;bl callee&quot; if the PPC &quot;bl&quot;
instruction reaches the callee directly; otherwise, the
linker generates <br>
&quot;bl L42&quot; to call the branch island. The branch
island is appended to the body of the calling function; it
computes the full 32-bit address of the callee and jumps to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this
option directs the compiler emit to the glue for every
direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether to use or
discard it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the future, GCC may ignore
all longcall specifications when the linker is known to
generate glue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-markers <br>
-mno-tls-markers <br>
Mark (do not mark) calls to &quot;__tls_get_addr&quot; with
a relocation specifying the function argument. The
relocation allows the linker to reliably associate function
call with <br>
argument setup instructions for TLS optimization, which in
turn allows GCC to better schedule the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip <br>
-mno-recip <br>
This option enables use of the reciprocal estimate and
reciprocal square root estimate instructions with additional
Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision instead of <br>
doing a divide or square root and divide for floating-point
arguments. You should use the -ffast-math option when using
-mrecip (or at least -funsafe-math-optimizations, <br>
-ffinite-math-only, -freciprocal-math and
-fno-trapping-math). Note that while the throughput of the
sequence is generally higher than the throughput of the
non-reciprocal <br>
instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased
by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994)
for reciprocal square roots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip=opt <br>
This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions
may be used. opt is a comma-separated list of options, which
may be preceded by a &quot;!&quot; to invert the option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Enable all estimate
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
Enable the default instructions, equivalent to -mrecip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
Disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to
-mno-recip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">div Enable the reciprocal
approximation instructions for both single and double
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divf <br>
Enable the single-precision reciprocal approximation
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">divd <br>
Enable the double-precision reciprocal approximation
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsqrt <br>
Enable the reciprocal square root approximation instructions
for both single and double precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsqrtf <br>
Enable the single-precision reciprocal square root
approximation instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsqrtd <br>
Enable the double-precision reciprocal square root
approximation instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So, for example,
-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd enables all of the reciprocal estimate
instructions, except for the &quot;FRSQRTE&quot;,
&quot;XSRSQRTEDP&quot;, and &quot;XVRSQRTEDP&quot;
instructions which handle <br>
the double-precision reciprocal square root
calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip-precision <br>
-mno-recip-precision <br>
Assume (do not assume) that the reciprocal estimate
instructions provide higher-precision estimates than is
mandated by the PowerPC ABI. Selecting -mcpu=power6,
-mcpu=power7 <br>
or -mcpu=power8 automatically selects -mrecip-precision. The
double-precision square root estimate instructions are not
generated by default on low-precision machines, since <br>
they do not provide an estimate that converges after three
steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mveclibabi=type <br>
Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics
using an external library. The only type supported at
present is mass, which specifies to use IBM&rsquo;s
Mathematical <br>
Acceleration Subsystem (MASS) libraries for vectorizing
intrinsics using external libraries. GCC currently emits
calls to &quot;acosd2&quot;, &quot;acosf4&quot;,
&quot;acoshd2&quot;, &quot;acoshf4&quot;,
&quot;asind2&quot;, <br>
&quot;asinf4&quot;, &quot;asinhd2&quot;,
&quot;asinhf4&quot;, &quot;atan2d2&quot;,
&quot;atan2f4&quot;, &quot;atand2&quot;, &quot;atanf4&quot;,
&quot;atanhd2&quot;, &quot;atanhf4&quot;,
&quot;cbrtd2&quot;, &quot;cbrtf4&quot;, &quot;cosd2&quot;,
&quot;cosf4&quot;, &quot;coshd2&quot;, &quot;coshf4&quot;,
&quot;erfcd2&quot;, &quot;erfcf4&quot;, <br>
&quot;erfd2&quot;, &quot;erff4&quot;, &quot;exp2d2&quot;,
&quot;exp2f4&quot;, &quot;expd2&quot;, &quot;expf4&quot;,
&quot;expm1d2&quot;, &quot;expm1f4&quot;,
&quot;hypotd2&quot;, &quot;hypotf4&quot;,
&quot;lgammad2&quot;, &quot;lgammaf4&quot;,
&quot;log10d2&quot;, &quot;log10f4&quot;,
&quot;log1pd2&quot;, &quot;log1pf4&quot;, <br>
&quot;log2d2&quot;, &quot;log2f4&quot;, &quot;logd2&quot;,
&quot;logf4&quot;, &quot;powd2&quot;, &quot;powf4&quot;,
&quot;sind2&quot;, &quot;sinf4&quot;, &quot;sinhd2&quot;,
&quot;sinhf4&quot;, &quot;sqrtd2&quot;, &quot;sqrtf4&quot;,
&quot;tand2&quot;, &quot;tanf4&quot;, &quot;tanhd2&quot;,
and &quot;tanhf4&quot; when generating <br>
code for power7. Both -ftree-vectorize and
-funsafe-math-optimizations must also be enabled. The MASS
libraries must be specified at link time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfriz <br>
-mno-friz <br>
Generate (do not generate) the &quot;friz&quot; instruction
when the -funsafe-math-optimizations option is used to
optimize rounding of floating-point values to 64-bit integer
and back <br>
to floating point. The &quot;friz&quot; instruction does not
return the same value if the floating-point number is too
large to fit in an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpointers-to-nested-functions
<br>
-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions <br>
Generate (do not generate) code to load up the static chain
register (&quot;r11&quot;) when calling through a pointer on
AIX and 64-bit Linux systems where a function pointer points
to <br>
a 3-word descriptor giving the function address, TOC value
to be loaded in register &quot;r2&quot;, and static chain
value to be loaded in register &quot;r11&quot;. The <br>
-mpointers-to-nested-functions is on by default. You cannot
call through pointers to nested functions or pointers to
functions compiled in other languages that use the <br>
static chain if you use
-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msave-toc-indirect <br>
-mno-save-toc-indirect <br>
Generate (do not generate) code to save the TOC value in the
reserved stack location in the function prologue if the
function calls through a pointer on AIX and 64-bit Linux
<br>
systems. If the TOC value is not saved in the prologue, it
is saved just before the call through the pointer. The
-mno-save-toc-indirect option is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcompat-align-parm <br>
-mno-compat-align-parm <br>
Generate (do not generate) code to pass structure parameters
with a maximum alignment of 64 bits, for compatibility with
older versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Older versions of GCC (prior to
4.9.0) incorrectly did not align a structure parameter on a
128-bit boundary when that structure contained a member
requiring 128-bit <br>
alignment. This is corrected in more recent versions of GCC.
This option may be used to generate code that is compatible
with functions compiled with older versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mno-compat-align-parm
option is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-protector-guard=guard
<br>
-mstack-protector-guard-reg=reg <br>
-mstack-protector-guard-offset=offset <br>
Generate stack protection code using canary at guard.
Supported locations are global for global canary or tls for
per-thread canary in the TLS block (the default with GNU
<br>
libc version 2.4 or later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the latter choice the
options -mstack-protector-guard-reg=reg and
-mstack-protector-guard-offset=offset furthermore specify
which register to use as base register for <br>
reading the canary, and from what offset from that base
register. The default for those is as specified in the
relevant ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RX Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These command-line options are
defined for RX targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m64bit-doubles <br>
-m32bit-doubles <br>
Make the &quot;double&quot; data type be 64 bits
(-m64bit-doubles) or 32 bits (-m32bit-doubles) in size. The
default is -m32bit-doubles. Note RX floating-point hardware
only works on <br>
32-bit values, which is why the default is
-m32bit-doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fpu <br>
-nofpu <br>
Enables (-fpu) or disables (-nofpu) the use of RX
floating-point hardware. The default is enabled for the
RX600 series and disabled for the RX200 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floating-point instructions are
only generated for 32-bit floating-point values, however, so
the FPU hardware is not used for doubles if the
-m64bit-doubles option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note If the -fpu option is
enabled then -funsafe-math-optimizations is also enabled
automatically. This is because the RX FPU instructions are
themselves unsafe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted. Currently three
types are supported, the generic RX600 and RX200 series
hardware and the specific RX610 CPU. The default is <br>
RX600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only difference between
RX600 and RX610 is that the RX610 does not support the
&quot;MVTIPL&quot; instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The RX200 series does not have a
hardware floating-point unit and so -nofpu is enabled by
default when this type is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian-data <br>
-mlittle-endian-data <br>
Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format. The
default is -mlittle-endian-data, i.e. to store data in the
little-endian format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-data-limit=N <br>
Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static
variables which can be placed into the small data area.
Using the small data area can lead to smaller and faster
<br>
code, but the size of area is limited and it is up to the
programmer to ensure that the area does not overflow. Also
when the small data area is used one of the RX&rsquo;s <br>
registers (usually &quot;r13&quot;) is reserved for use
pointing to this area, so it is no longer available for use
by the compiler. This could result in slower and/or larger
code if <br>
variables are pushed onto the stack instead of being held in
this register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, common variables
(variables that have not been initialized) and constants are
not placed into the small data area as they are assigned to
other sections in the output <br>
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is zero, which
disables this feature. Note, this feature is not enabled by
default with higher optimization levels (-O2 etc) because of
the potentially <br>
detrimental effects of reserving a register. It is up to the
programmer to experiment and discover whether this feature
is of benefit to their program. See the description <br>
of the -mpid option for a description of how the actual
register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
-mno-sim <br>
Use the simulator runtime. The default is to use the
libgloss board-specific runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mas100-syntax <br>
-mno-as100-syntax <br>
When generating assembler output use a syntax that is
compatible with Renesas&rsquo;s AS100 assembler. This syntax
can also be handled by the GAS assembler, but it has some
<br>
restrictions so it is not generated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmax-constant-size=N <br>
Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can
be used as an operand in a RX instruction. Although the RX
instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes <br>
in length to be used in instructions, a longer value equates
to a longer instruction. Thus in some circumstances it can
be beneficial to restrict the size of constants that <br>
are used in instructions. Constants that are too big are
instead placed into a constant pool and referenced via
register indirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value N can be between 0 and
4. A value of 0 (the default) or 4 means that constants of
any size are allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Enable linker relaxation. Linker relaxation is a process
whereby the linker attempts to reduce the size of a program
by finding shorter versions of various instructions. <br>
Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mint-register=N <br>
Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast
interrupt handler functions. The value N can be between 0
and 4. A value of 1 means that register &quot;r13&quot; is
reserved for <br>
the exclusive use of fast interrupt handlers. A value of 2
reserves &quot;r13&quot; and &quot;r12&quot;. A value of 3
reserves &quot;r13&quot;, &quot;r12&quot; and
&quot;r11&quot;, and a value of 4 reserves &quot;r13&quot;
through <br>
&quot;r10&quot;. A value of 0, the default, does not reserve
any registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msave-acc-in-interrupts <br>
Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve
the accumulator register. This is only necessary if normal
code might use the accumulator register, for example <br>
because it performs 64-bit multiplications. The default is
to ignore the accumulator as this makes the interrupt
handlers faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpid <br>
-mno-pid <br>
Enables the generation of position independent data. When
enabled any access to constant data is done via an offset
from a base address held in a register. This allows the <br>
location of constant data to be determined at run time
without requiring the executable to be relocated, which is a
benefit to embedded applications with tight memory <br>
constraints. Data that can be modified is not affected by
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, using this feature
reserves a register, usually &quot;r13&quot;, for the
constant data base address. This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual register chosen to
hold the constant data base address depends upon whether the
-msmall-data-limit and/or the -mint-register command-line
options are enabled. <br>
Starting with register &quot;r13&quot; and proceeding
downwards, registers are allocated first to satisfy the
requirements of -mint-register, then -mpid and finally
-msmall-data-limit. <br>
Thus it is possible for the small data area register to be
&quot;r8&quot; if both -mint-register=4 and -mpid are
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default this feature is not
enabled. The default can be restored via the -mno-pid
command-line option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts
<br>
-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts <br>
Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more
than one fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.
The default is to issue a warning for each extra <br>
fast interrupt handler found, as the RX only supports one
such interrupt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mallow-string-insns <br>
-mno-allow-string-insns <br>
Enables or disables the use of the string manipulation
instructions &quot;SMOVF&quot;, &quot;SCMPU&quot;,
&quot;SMOVB&quot;, &quot;SMOVU&quot;, &quot;SUNTIL&quot;
&quot;SWHILE&quot; and also the &quot;RMPA&quot;
instruction. These instructions <br>
may prefetch data, which is not safe to do if accessing an
I/O register. (See section 12.2.7 of the RX62N Group
User&rsquo;s Manual for more information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to allow these
instructions, but it is not possible for GCC to reliably
detect all circumstances where a string instruction might be
used to access an I/O <br>
register, so their use cannot be disabled automatically.
Instead it is reliant upon the programmer to use the
-mno-allow-string-insns option if their program accesses I/O
<br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the instructions are
enabled GCC defines the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;__RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS__&quot;, otherwise it defines
the symbol &quot;__RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mjsr <br>
-mno-jsr <br>
Use only (or not only) &quot;JSR&quot; instructions to
access functions. This option can be used when code size
exceeds the range of &quot;BSR&quot; instructions. Note that
-mno-jsr does not <br>
mean to not use &quot;JSR&quot; but instead means that any
type of branch may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The generic GCC
command-line option -ffixed-reg has special significance to
the RX port when used with the &quot;interrupt&quot;
function attribute. This attribute indicates a <br>
function intended to process fast interrupts. GCC ensures
that it only uses the registers &quot;r10&quot;,
&quot;r11&quot;, &quot;r12&quot; and/or &quot;r13&quot; and
only provided that the normal use of the <br>
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
-ffixed-reg or -mint-register command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S/390 and zSeries Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the -m options defined
for the S/390 and zSeries architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-float <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions
and registers for floating-point operations. When
-msoft-float is specified, functions in libgcc.a are used to
<br>
perform floating-point operations. When -mhard-float is
specified, the compiler generates IEEE floating-point
instructions. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-dfp <br>
-mno-hard-dfp <br>
Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point
instructions for decimal-floating-point operations. When
-mno-hard-dfp is specified, functions in libgcc.a are used
to <br>
perform decimal-floating-point operations. When -mhard-dfp
is specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point
hardware instructions. This is the default for <br>
-march=z9-ec or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-double-64 <br>
-mlong-double-128 <br>
These switches control the size of &quot;long double&quot;
type. A size of 64 bits makes the &quot;long double&quot;
type equivalent to the &quot;double&quot; type. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbackchain <br>
-mno-backchain <br>
Store (do not store) the address of the caller&rsquo;s frame
as backchain pointer into the callee&rsquo;s stack frame. A
backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that
do <br>
not understand DWARF call frame information. When
-mno-packed-stack is in effect, the backchain pointer is
stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when -mpacked-stack
is in <br>
effect, the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the
96/160 byte register save area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, code compiled with
-mbackchain is call-compatible with code compiled with
-mmo-backchain; however, use of the backchain for debugging
purposes usually requires <br>
that the whole binary is built with -mbackchain. Note that
the combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and
-mhard-float is not supported. In order to build a linux
<br>
kernel use -msoft-float.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to not maintain
the backchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpacked-stack <br>
-mno-packed-stack <br>
Use (do not use) the packed stack layout. When
-mno-packed-stack is specified, the compiler uses the all
fields of the 96/160 byte register save area only for their
default <br>
purpose; unused fields still take up stack space. When
-mpacked-stack is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space
<br>
is reused for other purposes, allowing for more efficient
use of the available stack space. However, when -mbackchain
is also in effect, the topmost word of the save area is <br>
always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As long as the stack frame
backchain is not used, code generated with -mpacked-stack is
call-compatible with code generated with -mno-packed-stack.
Note that some non-FSF <br>
releases of GCC 2.95 for S/390 or zSeries generated code
that uses the stack frame backchain at run time, not just
for debugging purposes. Such code is not call-compatible
<br>
with code compiled with -mpacked-stack. Also, note that the
combination of -mbackchain, -mpacked-stack and -mhard-float
is not supported. In order to build a linux kernel <br>
use -msoft-float.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to not use the
packed stack layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-exec <br>
-mno-small-exec <br>
Generate (or do not generate) code using the
&quot;bras&quot; instruction to do subroutine calls. This
only works reliably if the total executable size does not
exceed 64k. The <br>
default is to use the &quot;basr&quot; instruction instead,
which does not have this limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m64 <br>
-m31 <br>
When -m31 is specified, generate code compliant to the
GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI. When -m64 is specified, generate
code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI. This <br>
allows GCC in particular to generate 64-bit instructions.
For the s390 targets, the default is -m31, while the s390x
targets default to -m64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mzarch <br>
-mesa <br>
When -mzarch is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on z/Architecture. When -mesa is
specified, generate code using the instructions available on
<br>
ESA/390. Note that -mesa is not possible with -m64. When
generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI,
the default is -mesa. When generating code compliant to <br>
the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is -mzarch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhtm <br>
-mno-htm <br>
The -mhtm option enables a set of builtins making use of
instructions available with the transactional execution
facility introduced with the IBM zEnterprise EC12 machine
<br>
generation S/390 System z Built-in Functions. -mhtm is
enabled by default when using -march=zEC12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvx <br>
-mno-vx <br>
When -mvx is specified, generate code using the instructions
available with the vector extension facility introduced with
the IBM z13 machine generation. This option changes <br>
the ABI for some vector type values with regard to alignment
and calling conventions. In case vector type values are
being used in an ABI-relevant context a GAS <br>
.gnu_attribute command will be added to mark the resulting
binary with the ABI used. -mvx is enabled by default when
using -march=z13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mzvector <br>
-mno-zvector <br>
The -mzvector option enables vector language extensions and
builtins using instructions available with the vector
extension facility introduced with the IBM z13 machine <br>
generation. This option adds support for vector to be used
as a keyword to define vector type variables and arguments.
vector is only available when GNU extensions are <br>
enabled. It will not be expanded when requesting strict
standard compliance e.g. with -std=c99. In addition to the
GCC low-level builtins -mzvector enables a set of <br>
builtins added for compatibility with AltiVec-style
implementations like Power and Cell. In order to make use of
these builtins the header file vecintrin.h needs to be <br>
included. -mzvector is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmvcle <br>
-mno-mvcle <br>
Generate (or do not generate) code using the
&quot;mvcle&quot; instruction to perform block moves. When
-mno-mvcle is specified, use a &quot;mvc&quot; loop instead.
This is the default unless <br>
optimizing for size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug <br>
-mno-debug <br>
Print (or do not print) additional debug information when
compiling. The default is to not print debug
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=cpu-type <br>
Generate code that runs on cpu-type, which is the name of a
system representing a certain processor type. Possible
values for cpu-type are z900/arch5, z990/arch6, z9-109, <br>
z9-ec/arch7, z10/arch8, z196/arch9, zEC12, z13/arch11, and
native.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is -march=z900.
g5/arch3 and g6 are deprecated and will be removed with
future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying native as cpu type
can be used to select the best architecture option for the
host processor. -march=native has no effect if GCC does not
recognize the processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu-type <br>
Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated
code, except for the ABI and the set of available
instructions. The list of cpu-type values is the same as for
<br>
-march. The default is the value used for -march.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtpf-trace <br>
-mno-tpf-trace <br>
Generate code that adds (does not add) in TPF OS specific
branches to trace routines in the operating system. This
option is off by default, even when compiling for the TPF
<br>
OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
multiply and accumulate instructions. These instructions are
generated by default if hardware floating point is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-framesize=framesize <br>
Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given
frame size. Because this is a compile-time check it
doesn&rsquo;t need to be a real problem when the program
runs. It is <br>
intended to identify functions that most probably cause a
stack overflow. It is useful to be used in an environment
with limited stack size e.g. the linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-dynamicstack <br>
Emit a warning if the function calls &quot;alloca&quot; or
uses dynamically-sized arrays. This is generally a bad idea
with a limited stack size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-guard=stack-guard <br>
-mstack-size=stack-size <br>
If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits
additional instructions in the function prologue that
trigger a trap if the stack size is stack-guard bytes above
the <br>
stack-size (remember that the stack on S/390 grows
downward). If the stack-guard option is omitted the smallest
power of 2 larger than the frame size of the compiled <br>
function is chosen. These options are intended to be used to
help debugging stack overflow problems. The additionally
emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can <br>
also be used in production-like systems without greater
performance degradation. The given values have to be exact
powers of 2 and stack-size has to be greater than stack-
<br>
guard without exceeding 64k. In order to be efficient the
extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts at an
address aligned to the value given by stack-size. The <br>
stack-guard option can only be used in conjunction with
stack-size.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhotpatch=pre-halfwords,post-halfwords
<br>
If the hotpatch option is enabled, a
&quot;hot-patching&quot; function prologue is generated for
all functions in the compilation unit. The funtion label is
prepended with the given <br>
number of two-byte NOP instructions (pre-halfwords, maximum
1000000). After the label, 2 * post-halfwords bytes are
appended, using the largest NOP like instructions the <br>
architecture allows (maximum 1000000).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both arguments are zero,
hotpatching is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be overridden
for individual functions with the &quot;hotpatch&quot;
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Score Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
Score implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-meb <br>
Compile code for big-endian mode. This is the default.</p>

Enable generation of unaligned load and store
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmac <br>
Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mscore5 <br>
Specify the SCORE5 as the target architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mscore5u <br>
Specify the SCORE5U of the target architecture.</p>

Specify the SCORE7 as the target architecture. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mscore7d <br>
Specify the SCORE7D as the target architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SH Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the SH implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m1 Generate code for the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m2a-single-only <br>
Generate code for the SH2a-FPU, in such a way that no
double-precision floating-point operations are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m2a-single <br>
Generate code for the SH2a-FPU assuming the floating-point
unit is in single-precision mode by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-300 <br>
Generate code for SH4-300.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-300-nofpu <br>
Generate code for SH4-300 without in such a way that the
floating-point unit is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-300-single <br>
Generate code for SH4-300 in such a way that no

Generate code for SH4-300 in such a way that no
double-precision floating-point operations are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-340 <br>
Generate code for SH4-340 (no MMU, no FPU).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4-500 <br>
Generate code for SH4-500 (no FPU). Passes -isa=sh4-nofpu to
the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a-nofpu <br>
Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a SH4a in such a way
that the floating-point unit is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a-single-only <br>
Generate code for the SH4a, in such a way that no
double-precision floating-point operations are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a-single <br>
Generate code for the SH4a assuming the floating-point unit
is in single-precision mode by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4a <br>
Generate code for the SH4a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m4al <br>
Same as -m4a-nofpu, except that it implicitly passes -dsp to
the assembler. GCC doesn&rsquo;t generate any DSP
instructions at the moment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mb Compile code for the
processor in big-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ml Compile code for the
processor in little-endian mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdalign <br>
Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries. Note that this changes
the calling conventions, and thus some functions from the
standard C library do not work unless you recompile it <br>
first with -mdalign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrelax <br>
Shorten some address references at link time, when possible;
uses the linker option -relax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbigtable <br>
Use 32-bit offsets in &quot;switch&quot; tables. The default
is to use 16-bit offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbitops <br>
Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on SH2A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfmovd <br>
Enable the use of the instruction &quot;fmovd&quot;. Check
-mdalign for alignment constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrenesas <br>
Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-renesas <br>
Comply with the calling conventions defined for GCC before
the Renesas conventions were available. This option is the
default for all targets of the SH toolchain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnomacsave <br>
Mark the &quot;MAC&quot; register as call-clobbered, even if
-mrenesas is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee <br>
-mno-ieee <br>
Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons,
which affects the handling of cases where the result of a
comparison is unordered. By default -mieee is implicitly
<br>
enabled. If -ffinite-math-only is enabled -mno-ieee is
implicitly set, which results in faster floating-point
greater-equal and less-equal comparisons. The implicit <br>
settings can be overridden by specifying either -mieee or
-mno-ieee.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-ic_invalidate <br>
Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after
setting up nested function trampolines. This option has no
effect if -musermode is in effect and the selected code <br>
generation option (e.g. -m4) does not allow the use of the
&quot;icbi&quot; instruction. If the selected code
generation option does not allow the use of the
&quot;icbi&quot; instruction, and <br>
-musermode is not in effect, the inlined code manipulates
the instruction cache address array directly with an
associative write. This not only requires privileged mode at
<br>
run time, but it also fails if the cache line had been
mapped via the TLB and has become unmapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-misize <br>
Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpadstruct <br>
This option is deprecated. It pads structures to multiple of
4 bytes, which is incompatible with the SH ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matomic-model=model <br>
Sets the model of atomic operations and additional
parameters as a comma separated list. For details on the
atomic built-in functions see __atomic Builtins. The
following <br>
models and parameters are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none <br>
Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library
calls for atomic operations. This is the default if the
target is not &quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft-gusa <br>
Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences
for the atomic built-in functions. The generated atomic
sequences require additional support from the <br>
interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems. This option
is enabled by default when the target is <br>
&quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot; and SH3* or SH4*. When the target
is SH4A, this option also partially utilizes the hardware
atomic instructions &quot;movli.l&quot; and
&quot;movco.l&quot; to create more <br>
efficient code, unless strict is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft-tcb <br>
Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in
the thread control block. This is a variation of the gUSA
sequences which can also be used on SH1* and SH2* <br>
targets. The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
system and are only suitable for single-core <br>
systems. When using this model, the gbr-offset= parameter
has to be specified as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">soft-imask <br>
Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable
interrupts by setting &quot;SR.IMASK = 1111&quot;. This
model works only when the program runs in privileged mode
and <br>
is only suitable for single-core systems. Additional support
from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is
not required. This model is enabled by default <br>
when the target is &quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot; and SH1* or
SH2*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hard-llcs <br>
Generate hardware atomic sequences using the
&quot;movli.l&quot; and &quot;movco.l&quot; instructions
only. This is only available on SH4A and is suitable for
multi-core systems. Since the <br>
hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic variables
access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit
accesses. Code compiled with this option is also <br>
compatible with other software atomic model
interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an SH4A
system. Additional support from the interrupt/exception
handling <br>
code of the system is not required for this model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gbr-offset= <br>
This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable
in the thread control block structure that should be used by
the generated atomic sequences when the soft-tcb <br>
model has been selected. For other models this parameter is
ignored. The specified value must be an integer multiple of
four and in the range 0-1020.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strict <br>
This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic
models, even if they are compatible, and makes the compiler
generate atomic sequences of the specified model only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtas <br>
Generate the &quot;tas.b&quot; opcode for
&quot;__atomic_test_and_set&quot;. Notice that depending on
the particular hardware and software configuration this can
degrade overall performance due <br>
to the operand cache line flushes that are implied by the
&quot;tas.b&quot; instruction. On multi-core SH4A processors
the &quot;tas.b&quot; instruction must be used with caution
since it can <br>
result in data corruption for certain cache
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprefergot <br>
When generating position-independent code, emit function
calls using the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure
Linkage Table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-musermode <br>
-mno-usermode <br>
Don&rsquo;t allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged
mode code. Specifying -musermode also implies
-mno-inline-ic_invalidate if the inlined code would not work
in user <br>
mode. -musermode is the default when the target is
&quot;sh*-*-linux*&quot;. If the target is SH1* or SH2*
-musermode has no effect, since there is no user mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multcost=number <br>
Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdiv=strategy <br>
Set the division strategy to be used for integer division
operations. strategy can be one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call-div1 <br>
Calls a library function that uses the single-step division
instruction &quot;div1&quot; to perform the operation.
Division by zero calculates an unspecified result and does
not <br>
trap. This is the default except for SH4, SH2A and
SHcompact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call-fp <br>
Calls a library function that performs the operation in
double precision floating point. Division by zero causes a
floating-point exception. This is the default for <br>
SHcompact with FPU. Specifying this for targets that do not
have a double precision FPU defaults to
&quot;call-div1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">call-table <br>
Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small
divisors and the &quot;div1&quot; instruction with case
distinction for larger divisors. Division by zero calculates
an <br>
unspecified result and does not trap. This is the default
for SH4. Specifying this for targets that do not have
dynamic shift instructions defaults to
&quot;call-div1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a division strategy has not
been specified the default strategy is selected based on the
current target. For SH2A the default strategy is to use the
&quot;divs&quot; and &quot;divu&quot; <br>
instructions instead of library function calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maccumulate-outgoing-args <br>
Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function
prologue rather than around each call. Generally beneficial
for performance and size. Also needed for unwinding to <br>
avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdivsi3_libfunc=name <br>
Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed
division to name. This only affects the name used in the
call division strategies, and the compiler still expects
<br>
the same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this
option were not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator can not use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-cost=num <br>
Assume num to be the cost for a branch instruction. Higher
numbers make the compiler try to generate more branch-free
code if possible. If not specified the value is <br>
selected depending on the processor type that is being
compiled for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mzdcbranch <br>
-mno-zdcbranch <br>
Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional
branch instructions &quot;bt&quot; and &quot;bf&quot; are
fast. If -mzdcbranch is specified, the compiler prefers zero
displacement <br>
branch code sequences. This is enabled by default when
generating code for SH4 and SH4A. It can be explicitly
disabled by specifying -mno-zdcbranch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcbranch-force-delay-slot <br>
Force the usage of delay slots for conditional branches,
which stuffs the delay slot with a &quot;nop&quot; if a
suitable instruction cannot be found. By default this option
is <br>
disabled. It can be enabled to work around hardware bugs as
found in the original SH7055.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
multiply and accumulate instructions. These instructions are
generated by default if hardware floating point is <br>
used. The machine-dependent -mfused-madd option is now
mapped to the machine-independent -ffp-contract=fast option,
and -mno-fused-madd is mapped to -ffp-contract=off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfsca <br>
-mno-fsca <br>
Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the &quot;fsca&quot;
instruction for sine and cosine approximations. The option
-mfsca must be used in combination with <br>
-funsafe-math-optimizations. It is enabled by default when
generating code for SH4A. Using -mno-fsca disables sine and
cosine approximations even if <br>
-funsafe-math-optimizations is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfsrra <br>
-mno-fsrra <br>
Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the &quot;fsrra&quot;
instruction for reciprocal square root approximations. The
option -mfsrra must be used in combination with <br>
-funsafe-math-optimizations and -ffinite-math-only. It is
enabled by default when generating code for SH4A. Using
-mno-fsrra disables reciprocal square root approximations
<br>
even if -funsafe-math-optimizations and -ffinite-math-only
are in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpretend-cmove <br>
Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for
conditional move instruction patterns. This can result in
faster code on the SH4 processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfdpic <br>
Generate code using the FDPIC ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris 2 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on Solaris 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mclear-hwcap <br>
-mclear-hwcap tells the compiler to remove the hardware
capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler. This is
only necessary when object files use ISA extensions not <br>
supported by the current machine, but check at runtime
whether or not to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mimpure-text <br>
-mimpure-text, used in addition to -shared, tells the
compiler to not pass -z text to the linker when linking a
shared object. Using this option, you can link position-
<br>
dependent code into a shared object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mimpure-text suppresses the
&quot;relocations remain against allocatable but
non-writable sections&quot; linker error message. However,
the necessary relocations trigger copy-on- <br>
write, and the shared object is not actually shared across
processes. Instead of using -mimpure-text, you should
compile all source code with -fpic or -fPIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These switches are supported in
addition to the above on Solaris 2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pthreads <br>
This is a synonym for -pthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPARC Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on the SPARC:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-app-regs <br>
-mapp-regs <br>
Specify -mapp-regs to generate output using the global
registers 2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for
applications. Like the global register 1, each global <br>
register 2 through 4 is then treated as an allocable
register that is clobbered by function calls. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant
at the cost of some performance loss, specify -mno-app-regs.
You should compile libraries and system software with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mflat <br>
-mno-flat <br>
With -mflat, the compiler does not generate save/restore
instructions and uses a &quot;flat&quot; or single register
window model. This model is compatible with the regular
register <br>
window model. The local registers and the input registers
(0--5) are still treated as &quot;call-saved&quot; registers
and are saved on the stack as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mno-flat (the default),
the compiler generates save/restore instructions (except for
leaf functions). This is the normal operating mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu <br>
-mhard-float <br>
Generate output containing floating-point instructions. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fpu <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
Warning: the requisite libraries are not available for all
SPARC targets. Normally the facilities of the <br>
machine&rsquo;s usual C compiler are used, but this cannot
be done directly in cross-compilation. You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
<br>
cross-compilation. The embedded targets sparc-*-aout and
sparclite-*-* do provide software floating-point
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float changes the calling
convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful
if you compile all of a program with this option. In
particular, you need to <br>
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhard-quad-float <br>
Generate output containing quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-quad-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
double) floating-point instructions. The functions called
are those specified in the SPARC ABI. This is the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of this writing, there are no
SPARC implementations that have hardware support for the
quad-word floating-point instructions. They all invoke a
trap handler for one of <br>
these instructions, and then the trap handler emulates the
effect of the instruction. Because of the trap handler
overhead, this is much slower than calling the ABI library
<br>
routines. Thus the -msoft-quad-float option is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-unaligned-doubles <br>
-munaligned-doubles <br>
Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -munaligned-doubles, GCC
assumes that doubles have 8-byte alignment only if they are
contained in another type, or if they have an absolute
address. Otherwise, it <br>
assumes they have 4-byte alignment. Specifying this option
avoids some rare compatibility problems with code generated
by other compilers. It is not the default because it <br>
results in a performance loss, especially for floating-point
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muser-mode <br>
-mno-user-mode <br>
Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.
This is relevant only for the &quot;casa&quot; instruction
emitted for the LEON3 processor. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfaster-structs <br>
-mno-faster-structs <br>
With -mfaster-structs, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8-byte alignment. This enables the use of pairs
of &quot;ldd&quot; and &quot;std&quot; instructions for
copies in <br>
structure assignment, in place of twice as many
&quot;ld&quot; and &quot;st&quot; pairs. However, the use of
this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC ABI.
Thus, it&rsquo;s intended only <br>
for use on targets where the developer acknowledges that
their resulting code is not directly in line with the rules
of the ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstd-struct-return <br>
-mno-std-struct-return <br>
With -mstd-struct-return, the compiler generates checking
code in functions returning structures or unions to detect
size mismatches between the two sides of function calls,
<br>
as per the 32-bit ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
-mno-std-struct-return. This option has no effect in 64-bit
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlra <br>
-mno-lra <br>
Enable Local Register Allocation. This is the default for
SPARC since GCC 7 so -mno-lra needs to be passed to get old
Reload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type. Supported
values for cpu_type are v7, cypress, v8, supersparc, <br>
hypersparc, leon, leon3, leon3v7, sparclite, f930, f934,
sparclite86x, sparclet, tsc701, v9, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3,
niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4 and niagara7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Native Solaris and GNU/Linux
toolchains also support the value native, which selects the
best architecture option for the host processor.
-mcpu=native has no effect if GCC <br>
does not recognize the processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default instruction scheduling
parameters are used for values that select an architecture
and not an implementation. These are v7, v8, sparclite,
sparclet, v9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of each supported
architecture and their supported implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v7 cypress, leon3v7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v8 supersparc, hypersparc, leon,

tsc701</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v9 ultrasparc, ultrasparc3,
niagara, niagara2, niagara3, niagara4, niagara7</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default (unless configured
otherwise), GCC generates code for the V7 variant of the
SPARC architecture. With -mcpu=cypress, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the <br>
Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the
SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series. This is also
appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=v8, GCC generates
code for the V8 variant of the SPARC architecture. The only
difference from V7 code is that the compiler emits the
integer multiply and integer <br>
divide instructions which exist in SPARC-V8 but not in
SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=supersparc, the compiler additionally
optimizes it for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the <br>
SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=sparclite, GCC
generates code for the SPARClite variant of the SPARC
architecture. This adds the integer multiply, integer divide
step and scan (&quot;ffs&quot;) <br>
instructions which exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7.
With -mcpu=f930, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
the Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the original <br>
SPARClite, with no FPU. With -mcpu=f934, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip,
which is the more recent SPARClite with FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=sparclet, GCC
generates code for the SPARClet variant of the SPARC
architecture. This adds the integer multiply,
multiply/accumulate, integer divide step and scan <br>
(&quot;ffs&quot;) instructions which exist in SPARClet but
not in SPARC-V7. With -mcpu=tsc701, the compiler
additionally optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=v9, GCC generates
code for the V9 variant of the SPARC architecture. This adds
64-bit integer and floating-point move instructions, 3
additional floating-point <br>
condition code registers and conditional move instructions.
With -mcpu=ultrasparc, the compiler additionally optimizes
it for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips. With <br>
-mcpu=ultrasparc3, the compiler additionally optimizes it
for the Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips.
With -mcpu=niagara, the compiler additionally optimizes it
<br>
for Sun UltraSPARC T1 chips. With -mcpu=niagara2, the
compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2
chips. With -mcpu=niagara3, the compiler additionally <br>
optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T3 chips. With
-mcpu=niagara4, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips. With -mcpu=niagara7, the compiler
<br>
additionally optimizes it for Oracle SPARC M7 chips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
cpu_type, but do not set the instruction set or register set
that the option -mcpu=cpu_type does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same values for
-mcpu=cpu_type can be used for -mtune=cpu_type, but the only
useful values are those that select a particular CPU
implementation. Those are cypress, <br>
supersparc, hypersparc, leon, leon3, leon3v7, f930, f934,
sparclite86x, tsc701, ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara,
niagara2, niagara3, niagara4 and niagara7. With native <br>
Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains, native can also be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mv8plus <br>
-mno-v8plus <br>
With -mv8plus, GCC generates code for the SPARC-V8+ ABI. The
difference from the V8 ABI is that the global and out
registers are considered 64 bits wide. This is enabled by
<br>
default on Solaris in 32-bit mode for all SPARC-V9
processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis <br>
-mno-vis <br>
With -mvis, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions. The default is
-mno-vis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis2 <br>
-mno-vis2 <br>
With -mvis2, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
version 2.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
extensions. The default is -mvis2 when targeting a cpu that
<br>
supports such instructions, such as UltraSPARC-III and
later. Setting -mvis2 also sets -mvis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis3 <br>
-mno-vis3 <br>
With -mvis3, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
version 3.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
extensions. The default is -mvis3 when targeting a cpu that
<br>
supports such instructions, such as niagara-3 and later.
Setting -mvis3 also sets -mvis2 and -mvis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvis4 <br>
-mno-vis4 <br>
With -mvis4, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
version 4.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
extensions. The default is -mvis4 when targeting a cpu that
<br>
supports such instructions, such as niagara-7 and later.
Setting -mvis4 also sets -mvis3, -mvis2 and -mvis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcbcond <br>
-mno-cbcond <br>
With -mcbcond, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
the UltraSPARC Compare-and-Branch-on-Condition instructions.
The default is -mcbcond when targeting a CPU that <br>
supports such instructions, such as Niagara-4 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfmaf <br>
-mno-fmaf <br>
With -mfmaf, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC Fused Multiply-Add Floating-point instructions.
The default is -mfmaf when targeting a CPU that <br>
supports such instructions, such as Niagara-3 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpopc <br>
-mno-popc <br>
With -mpopc, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC Population Count instruction. The default is
-mpopc when targeting a CPU that supports such an <br>
instruction, such as Niagara-2 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msubxc <br>
-mno-subxc <br>
With -msubxc, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
UltraSPARC Subtract-Extended-with-Carry instruction. The
default is -msubxc when targeting a CPU that supports <br>
such an instruction, such as Niagara-7 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-at697f <br>
Enable the documented workaround for the single erratum of
the Atmel AT697F processor (which corresponds to erratum #13
of the AT697E processor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfix-ut699 <br>
Enable the documented workarounds for the floating-point
errata and the data cache nullify errata of the UT699
processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
in addition to the above on SPARC-V9 processors in 64-bit
environments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. The 32-bit
environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits. The
64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and <br>
pointer to 64 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=which <br>
Set the code model to one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">medlow <br>
The Medium/Low code model: 64-bit addresses, programs must
be linked in the low 32 bits of memory. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">medmid <br>
The Medium/Middle code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
must be linked in the low 44 bits of memory, the text and
data segments must be less than 2GB in size and the <br>
data segment must be located within 2GB of the text
segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">medany <br>
The Medium/Anywhere code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
may be linked anywhere in memory, the text and data segments
must be less than 2GB in size and the data segment <br>
must be located within 2GB of the text segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">embmedany <br>
The Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems: 64-bit
addresses, the text and data segments must be less than 2GB
in size, both starting anywhere in memory <br>
(determined at link time). The global register %g4 points to
the base of the data segment. Programs are statically linked
and PIC is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemory-model=mem-model <br>
Set the memory model in force on the processor to one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tso Total Store Order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc Sequential Consistency</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These memory models are formally
defined in Appendix D of the SPARC-V9 architecture manual,
as set in the processor&rsquo;s &quot;PSTATE.MM&quot;
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-bias <br>
-mno-stack-bias <br>
With -mstack-bias, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and
frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be
added back when making stack frame references. This is <br>
the default in 64-bit mode. Otherwise, assume no such offset
is present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPU Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on the SPU:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwarn-reloc <br>
-merror-reloc <br>
The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations. By
default, GCC gives an error when it generates code that
requires a dynamic relocation. -mno-error-reloc disables
<br>
the error, -mwarn-reloc generates a warning instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msafe-dma <br>
-munsafe-dma <br>
Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must
not be reordered with respect to loads and stores of the
memory that is being accessed. With -munsafe-dma you must
<br>
use the &quot;volatile&quot; keyword to protect memory
accesses, but that can lead to inefficient code in places
where the memory is known to not change. Rather than mark
the memory <br>
as volatile, you can use -msafe-dma to tell the compiler to
treat the DMA instructions as potentially affecting all
memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbranch-hints <br>
By default, GCC generates a branch hint instruction to avoid
pipeline stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches.
A hint is not generated closer than 8 instructions <br>
away from its branch. There is little reason to disable
them, except for debugging purposes, or to make an object a
little bit smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msmall-mem <br>
-mlarge-mem <br>
By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are
never larger than 18 bits. With -mlarge-mem code is
generated that assumes a full 32-bit address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstdmain <br>
By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the
SPU-style main function interface (which has an
unconventional parameter list). With -mstdmain, GCC links
your <br>
program against startup code that assumes a C99-style
interface to &quot;main&quot;, including a local copy of
&quot;argv&quot; strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfixed-range=register-range
<br>
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
registers. A fixed register is one that the register
allocator cannot use. This is useful when compiling kernel
<br>
code. A register range is specified as two registers
separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mea32 <br>
-mea64 <br>
Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space
accessed via the &quot;__ea&quot; named address space
qualifier are either 32 or 64 bits wide. The default is 32
bits. As <br>
this is an ABI-changing option, all object code in an
executable must be compiled with the same setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maddress-space-conversion <br>
-mno-address-space-conversion <br>
Allow/disallow treating the &quot;__ea&quot; address space
as superset of the generic address space. This enables
explicit type casts between &quot;__ea&quot; and generic
pointer as well as <br>
implicit conversions of generic pointers to &quot;__ea&quot;
pointers. The default is to allow address space pointer
conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcache-size=cache-size <br>
This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler
links to an executable and selects a software-managed cache
for accessing variables in the &quot;__ea&quot; address
space <br>
with a particular cache size. Possible options for
cache-size are 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128. The default cache size
is 64KB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-matomic-updates <br>
-mno-atomic-updates <br>
This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler
links to an executable and selects whether atomic updates to
the software-managed cache of PPU-side variables are <br>
used. If you use atomic updates, changes to a PPU variable
from SPU code using the &quot;__ea&quot; named address space
qualifier do not interfere with changes to other PPU
variables <br>
residing in the same cache line from PPU code. If you do not
use atomic updates, such interference may occur; however,
writing back cache lines is more efficient. The <br>
default behavior is to use atomic updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdual-nops <br>
-mdual-nops=n <br>
By default, GCC inserts NOPs to increase dual issue when it
expects it to increase performance. n can be a value from 0
to 10. A smaller n inserts fewer NOPs. 10 is the <br>
default, 0 is the same as -mno-dual-nops. Disabled with
-Os.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhint-max-nops=n <br>
Maximum number of NOPs to insert for a branch hint. A branch
hint must be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it
is affecting. GCC inserts up to n NOPs to enforce <br>
this, otherwise it does not generate the branch hint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mhint-max-distance=n <br>
The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint
to be within 256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.
By default, GCC makes sure it is within 125.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msafe-hints <br>
Work around a hardware bug that causes the SPU to stall
indefinitely. By default, GCC inserts the &quot;hbrp&quot;
instruction to make sure this stall won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for System V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These additional options are
available on System V Release 4 for compatibility with other
compilers on those systems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Create a shared object. It is
recommended that -symbolic or -shared be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Qy Identify the versions of

Search the directories dirs, and no others, for libraries
specified with -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ym,dir <br>
Look in the directory dir to find the M4 preprocessor. The
assembler uses this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are supported
on the TILE-Gx:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=small <br>
Generate code for the small model. The distance for direct
calls is limited to 500M in either direction. PC-relative
addresses are 32 bits. Absolute addresses support the <br>
full address range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=large <br>
Generate code for the large model. There is no limitation on
call distance, pc-relative addresses, or absolute
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=name <br>
Selects the type of CPU to be targeted. Currently the only
supported type is tilegx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment. The 32-bit
environment sets int, long, and pointer to 32 bits. The
64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and <br>
pointer to 64 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-endian <br>
-mlittle-endian <br>
Generate code in big/little endian mode, respectively.</p>

Selects the type of CPU to be targeted. Currently the only
supported type is tilepro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int,
long, and pointer to 32 bits. This is the only supported
behavior so the flag is essentially ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V850 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
V850 implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-calls <br>
-mno-long-calls <br>
Treat all calls as being far away (near). If calls are
assumed to be far away, the compiler always loads the
function&rsquo;s address into a register, and calls indirect
through <br>
the pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-ep <br>
-mep <br>
Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same
index pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the
&quot;ep&quot; register, and use the shorter &quot;sld&quot;
and &quot;sst&quot; <br>
instructions. The -mep option is on by default if you
optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-prolog-function <br>
-mprolog-function <br>
Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore
registers at the prologue and epilogue of a function. The
external functions are slower, but use less code space <br>
if more than one function saves the same number of
registers. The -mprolog-function option is on by default if
you optimize.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mspace <br>
Try to make the code as small as possible. At present, this
just turns on the -mep and -mprolog-function options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtda=n <br>
Put static or global variables whose size is n bytes or less
into the tiny data area that register &quot;ep&quot; points

to the assembler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-jumps <br>
-mno-long-jumps <br>
Disable (or re-enable) the generation of PC-relative jump
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float <br>
-mhard-float <br>
Disable (or re-enable) the generation of hardware floating
point instructions. This option is only significant when the
target architecture is V850E2V3 or higher. If <br>
hardware floating point instructions are being generated
then the C preprocessor symbol &quot;__FPU_OK__&quot; is
defined, otherwise the symbol &quot;__NO_FPU__&quot; is
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mloop <br>
Enables the use of the e3v5 LOOP instruction. The use of
this instruction is not enabled by default when the e3v5
architecture is selected because its use is still <br>
experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrh850-abi <br>
-mghs <br>
Enables support for the RH850 version of the V850 ABI. This
is the default. With this version of the ABI the following
rules apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Integer sized structures and
unions are returned via a memory pointer rather than a
register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Large structures and unions
(more than 8 bytes in size) are passed by value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Functions are aligned to
16-bit boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -m8byte-align command-line
option is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -mdisable-callt
command-line option is enabled by default. The
-mno-disable-callt command-line option is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this version of the ABI is
enabled the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;__V850_RH850_ABI__&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgcc-abi <br>
Enables support for the old GCC version of the V850 ABI.
With this version of the ABI the following rules apply:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Integer sized structures and
unions are returned in register &quot;r10&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Large structures and unions
(more than 8 bytes in size) are passed by reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Functions are aligned to
32-bit boundaries, unless optimizing for size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -m8byte-align command-line
option is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The -mdisable-callt
command-line option is supported but not enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this version of the ABI is
enabled the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;__V850_GCC_ABI__&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m8byte-align <br>
-mno-8byte-align <br>
Enables support for &quot;double&quot; and &quot;long
long&quot; types to be aligned on 8-byte boundaries. The
default is to restrict the alignment of all objects to at
most 4-bytes. When <br>
-m8byte-align is in effect the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;__V850_8BYTE_ALIGN__&quot; is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mbig-switch <br>
Generate code suitable for big switch tables. Use this
option only if the assembler/linker complain about out of
range branches within a switch table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapp-regs <br>
This option causes r2 and r5 to be used in the code
generated by the compiler. This setting is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-app-regs <br>
This option causes r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed
registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VAX Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the VAX:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-munix <br>
Do not output certain jump instructions (&quot;aobleq&quot;
and so on) that the Unix assembler for the VAX cannot handle
across long ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgnu <br>
Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that
the GNU assembler is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mg Output code for G-format
floating-point numbers instead of D-format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visium Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug <br>
A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on
an MCM target should be linked with this option. It causes
the libraries libc.a and libdebug.a to be linked. The <br>
program should be run on the target under the control of the
GDB remote debugging stub.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on
the simulator should be linked with option. This causes
libraries libc.a and libsim.a to be linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpu <br>
-mhard-float <br>
Generate code containing floating-point instructions. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fpu <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Generate code containing library calls for
floating-point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msoft-float changes the calling
convention in the output file; therefore, it is only useful
if you compile all of a program with this option. In
particular, you need to <br>
compile libgcc.a, the library that comes with GCC, with
-msoft-float in order for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
scheduling parameters for machine type cpu_type. Supported
values for cpu_type are mcm, gr5 and gr6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mcm is a synonym of gr5 present
for backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default (unless configured
otherwise), GCC generates code for the GR5 variant of the
Visium architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -mcpu=gr6, GCC generates
code for the GR6 variant of the Visium architecture. The
only difference from GR5 code is that the compiler will
generate block move <br>
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu_type <br>
Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
cpu_type, but do not set the instruction set or register set
that the option -mcpu=cpu_type would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msv-mode <br>
Generate code for the supervisor mode, where there are no
restrictions on the access to general registers. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-muser-mode <br>
Generate code for the user mode, where the access to some
general registers is forbidden: on the GR5, registers r24 to
r31 cannot be accessed in this mode; on the GR6, only <br>
registers r29 to r31 are affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the VMS implementations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvms-return-codes <br>
Return VMS condition codes from &quot;main&quot;. The
default is to return POSIX-style condition (e.g. error)
codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdebug-main=prefix <br>
Flag the first routine whose name starts with prefix as the
main routine for the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmalloc64 <br>
Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpointer-size=size <br>
Set the default size of pointers. Possible options for size
are 32 or short for 32 bit pointers, 64 or long for 64 bit
pointers, and no for supporting only 32 bit pointers. <br>
The later option disables &quot;pragma
pointer_size&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VxWorks Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options in this section are
defined for all VxWorks targets. Options specific to the
target hardware are listed with the other options for that
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrtp <br>
GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time
processes (RTPs). This option switches from the former to
the latter. It also defines the preprocessor macro <br>
&quot;__RTP__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-non-static <br>
Link an RTP executable against shared libraries rather than
static libraries. The options -static and -shared can also
be used for RTPs; -static is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bstatic <br>
-Bdynamic <br>
These options are passed down to the linker. They are
defined for compatibility with Diab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbind-lazy <br>
Enable lazy binding of function calls. This option is
equivalent to -Wl,-z,now and is defined for compatibility
with Diab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbind-now <br>
Disable lazy binding of function calls. This option is the
default and is defined for compatibility with Diab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x86 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m options are defined for
the x86 family of computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-march=cpu-type <br>
Generate instructions for the machine type cpu-type. In
contrast to -mtune=cpu-type, which merely tunes the
generated code for the specified cpu-type, -march=cpu-type
allows <br>
GCC to generate code that may not run at all on processors
other than the one indicated. Specifying -march=cpu-type
implies -mtune=cpu-type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The choices for cpu-type
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">native <br>
This selects the CPU to generate code for at compilation
time by determining the processor type of the compiling
machine. Using -march=native enables all instruction <br>
subsets supported by the local machine (hence the result
might not run on different machines). Using -mtune=native
produces code optimized for the local machine under <br>
the constraints of the selected instruction set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune=cpu-type <br>
Tune to cpu-type everything applicable about the generated
code, except for the ABI and the set of available
instructions. While picking a specific cpu-type schedules
things <br>
appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler does
not generate any code that cannot run on the default machine
type unless you use a -march=cpu-type option. For <br>
example, if GCC is configured for i686-pc-linux-gnu then
-mtune=pentium4 generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4
but still runs on i686 machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The choices for cpu-type are the
same as for -march. In addition, -mtune supports 2 extra
choices for cpu-type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generic <br>
Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T
processors. If you know the CPU on which your code will run,
then you should use the corresponding -mtune or <br>
-march option instead of -mtune=generic. But, if you do not
know exactly what CPU users of your application will have,
then you should use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As new processors are deployed
in the marketplace, the behavior of this option will change.
Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code
generation <br>
controlled by this option will change to reflect the
processors that are most common at the time that version of
GCC is released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no -march=generic
option because -march indicates the instruction set the
compiler can use, and there is no generic instruction set
applicable to all processors. <br>
In contrast, -mtune indicates the processor (or, in this
case, collection of processors) for which the code is
optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intel <br>
Produce code optimized for the most current Intel
processors, which are Haswell and Silvermont for this
version of GCC. If you know the CPU on which your code will
run, <br>
then you should use the corresponding -mtune or -march
option instead of -mtune=intel. But, if you want your
application performs better on both Haswell and Silvermont,
<br>
then you should use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As new Intel processors are

current Intel processors at the time that version of GCC is
released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no -march=intel option
because -march indicates the instruction set the compiler
can use, and there is no common instruction set applicable
to all processors. <br>
In contrast, -mtune indicates the processor (or, in this
case, collection of processors) for which the code is
optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcpu=cpu-type <br>
A deprecated synonym for -mtune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfpmath=unit <br>
Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit unit.
The choices for unit are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">387 Use the standard 387
floating-point coprocessor present on the majority of chips
and emulated otherwise. Code compiled with this option runs
almost everywhere. The <br>
temporary results are computed in 80-bit precision instead
of the precision specified by the type, resulting in
slightly different results compared to most of other <br>
chips. See -ffloat-store for more detailed description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default choice for
non-Darwin x86-32 targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sse Use scalar floating-point
instructions present in the SSE instruction set. This
instruction set is supported by Pentium III and newer chips,
and in the AMD line by <br>
Athlon-4, Athlon XP and Athlon MP chips. The earlier version
of the SSE instruction set supports only single-precision
arithmetic, thus the double and extended-precision <br>
arithmetic are still done using 387. A later version,
present only in Pentium 4 and AMD x86-64 chips, supports
double-precision arithmetic too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the x86-32 compiler, you
must use -march=cpu-type, -msse or -msse2 switches to enable
SSE extensions and make this option effective. For the
x86-64 compiler, these <br>
extensions are enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting code should be
considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid the
numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break
some existing code that <br>
expects temporaries to be 80 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the default choice for
the x86-64 compiler, Darwin x86-32 targets, and the default
choice for x86-32 targets with the SSE2 instruction set when
-ffast-math is <br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sse,387 <br>
sse+387 <br>
both <br>
Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once. This
effectively doubles the amount of available registers, and
on chips with separate execution units for 387 and SSE <br>
the execution resources too. Use this option with care, as
it is still experimental, because the GCC register allocator
does not model separate functional units well, <br>
resulting in unstable performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-masm=dialect <br>
Output assembly instructions using selected dialect. Also
affects which dialect is used for basic &quot;asm&quot; and
extended &quot;asm&quot;. Supported choices (in dialect
order) are att or <br>
intel. The default is att. Darwin does not support
intel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mieee-fp <br>
-mno-ieee-fp <br>
Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating-point
comparisons. These correctly handle the case where the
result of a comparison is unordered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m80387 <br>
-mhard-float <br>
Generate output containing 80387 instructions for floating
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-80387 <br>
-msoft-float <br>
Generate output containing library calls for floating
point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: the requisite libraries
are not part of GCC. Normally the facilities of the
machine&rsquo;s usual C compiler are used, but this cannot
be done directly in cross- <br>
compilation. You must make your own arrangements to provide
suitable library functions for cross-compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On machines where a function
returns floating-point results in the 80387 register stack,
some floating-point opcodes may be emitted even if
-msoft-float is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fp-ret-in-387 <br>
Do not use the FPU registers for return values of
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual calling convention has
functions return values of types &quot;float&quot; and
&quot;double&quot; in an FPU register, even if there is no
FPU. The idea is that the operating system <br>
should emulate an FPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option -mno-fp-ret-in-387
causes such values to be returned in ordinary CPU registers
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-fancy-math-387 <br>
Some 387 emulators do not support the &quot;sin&quot;,
&quot;cos&quot; and &quot;sqrt&quot; instructions for the
387. Specify this option to avoid generating those
instructions. This option is the <br>
default on OpenBSD and NetBSD. This option is overridden
when -march indicates that the target CPU always has an FPU
and so the instruction does not need emulation. These <br>
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
-funsafe-math-optimizations switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-double <br>
-mno-align-double <br>
Control whether GCC aligns &quot;double&quot;, &quot;long
double&quot;, and &quot;long long&quot; variables on a
two-word boundary or a one-word boundary. Aligning
&quot;double&quot; variables on a two-word <br>
boundary produces code that runs somewhat faster on a
Pentium at the expense of more memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On x86-64, -malign-double is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use the
-malign-double switch, structures containing the above types
are aligned differently than the published application
binary interface specifications <br>
for the x86-32 and are not binary compatible with structures
in code compiled without that switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m96bit-long-double <br>
-m128bit-long-double <br>
These switches control the size of &quot;long double&quot;
type. The x86-32 application binary interface specifies the
size to be 96 bits, so -m96bit-long-double is the default in
<br>
32-bit mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modern architectures (Pentium
and newer) prefer &quot;long double&quot; to be aligned to
an 8- or 16-byte boundary. In arrays or structures
conforming to the ABI, this is not <br>
possible. So specifying -m128bit-long-double aligns
&quot;long double&quot; to a 16-byte boundary by padding the
&quot;long double&quot; with an additional 32-bit zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the x86-64 compiler,
-m128bit-long-double is the default choice as its ABI
specifies that &quot;long double&quot; is aligned on 16-byte
boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that neither of these
options enable any extra precision over the x87 standard of
80 bits for a &quot;long double&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you override the
default value for your target ABI, this changes the size of
structures and arrays containing &quot;long double&quot;
variables, as well as modifying the <br>
function calling convention for functions taking &quot;long
double&quot;. Hence they are not binary-compatible with code
compiled without that switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlong-double-64 <br>
-mlong-double-80 <br>
-mlong-double-128 <br>
These switches control the size of &quot;long double&quot;
type. A size of 64 bits makes the &quot;long double&quot;
type equivalent to the &quot;double&quot; type. This is the
default for 32-bit Bionic C <br>
library. A size of 128 bits makes the &quot;long
double&quot; type equivalent to the &quot;__float128&quot;
type. This is the default for 64-bit Bionic C library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you override the
default value for your target ABI, this changes the size of
structures and arrays containing &quot;long double&quot;
variables, as well as modifying the <br>
function calling convention for functions taking &quot;long
double&quot;. Hence they are not binary-compatible with code
compiled without that switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-malign-data=type <br>
Control how GCC aligns variables. Supported values for type
are compat uses increased alignment value compatible uses
GCC 4.8 and earlier, abi uses alignment value as <br>
specified by the psABI, and cacheline uses increased
alignment value to match the cache line size. compat is the
default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlarge-data-threshold=threshold
<br>
When -mcmodel=medium is specified, data objects larger than
threshold are placed in the large data section. This value
must be the same across all objects linked into the <br>
binary, and defaults to 65535.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrtd <br>
Use a different function-calling convention, in which
functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with
the &quot;ret num&quot; instruction, which pops their
arguments while <br>
returning. This saves one instruction in the caller since
there is no need to pop the arguments there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify that an
individual function is called with this calling sequence
with the function attribute &quot;stdcall&quot;. You can
also override the -mrtd option by using the <br>
function attribute &quot;cdecl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: this calling convention
is incompatible with the one normally used on Unix, so you
cannot use it if you need to call libraries compiled with
the Unix compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, you must provide function
prototypes for all functions that take variable numbers of
arguments (including &quot;printf&quot;); otherwise
incorrect code is generated for calls to <br>
those functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, seriously incorrect
code results if you call a function with too many arguments.
(Normally, extra arguments are harmlessly ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mregparm=num <br>
Control how many registers are used to pass integer
arguments. By default, no registers are used to pass
arguments, and at most 3 registers can be used. You can
control <br>
this behavior for a specific function by using the function
attribute &quot;regparm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use this switch,
and num is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the
same value, including any libraries. This includes the
system libraries and <br>
startup modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msseregparm <br>
Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double
arguments and return values. You can control this behavior
for a specific function by using the function attribute <br>
&quot;sseregparm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: if you use this switch
then you must build all modules with the same value,
including any libraries. This includes the system libraries
and startup modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvect8-ret-in-mem <br>
Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.
This is the default on Solaris@tie{}8 and 9 and VxWorks to
match the ABI of the Sun Studio compilers until version <br>
12. Later compiler versions (starting with Studio 12
Update@tie{}1) follow the ABI used by other x86 targets,
which is the default on Solaris@tie{}10 and later. Only use
<br>
this option if you need to remain compatible with existing
code produced by those previous compiler versions or older
versions of GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpc32 <br>
-mpc64 <br>
-mpc80 <br>
Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.
When -mpc32 is specified, the significands of results of
floating-point operations are rounded to 24 bits (single
<br>
precision); -mpc64 rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 53 bits (double precision) and
-mpc80 rounds the significands of results of floating- <br>
point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision),
which is the default. When this option is used,
floating-point operations in higher precisions are not
available to <br>
the programmer without setting the FPU control word
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting the rounding of
floating-point operations to less than the default 80 bits
can speed some programs by 2% or more. Note that some
mathematical libraries assume that <br>
extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations are
enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer
significant loss of accuracy, typically through so- <br>
called &quot;catastrophic cancellation&quot;, when this
option is used to set the precision to less than extended
precision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstackrealign <br>
Realign the stack at entry. On the x86, the -mstackrealign
option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue that
realigns the run-time stack if necessary. This supports <br>
mixing legacy codes that keep 4-byte stack alignment with
modern codes that keep 16-byte stack alignment for SSE
compatibility. See also the attribute <br>
&quot;force_align_arg_pointer&quot;, applicable to
individual functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=num
<br>
Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to
num byte boundary. If -mpreferred-stack-boundary is not
specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: When generating code
for the x86-64 architecture with SSE extensions disabled,
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 can be used to keep the stack
boundary aligned to 8 byte <br>
boundary. Since x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack alignment,
this is ABI incompatible and intended to be used in
controlled environment where stack space is important <br>
limitation. This option leads to wrong code when functions
compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions
from a standard library) are called with misaligned <br>
stack. In this case, SSE instructions may lead to misaligned
memory access traps. In addition, variable arguments are
handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects <br>
(including x87 long double and __int128), leading to wrong
results. You must build all modules with
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3, including any libraries. This
includes the <br>
system libraries and startup modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mincoming-stack-boundary=num
<br>
Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to num
byte boundary. If -mincoming-stack-boundary is not
specified, the one specified by -mpreferred-stack-boundary
is <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Pentium and Pentium Pro,
&quot;double&quot; and &quot;long double&quot; values should
be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see -malign-double) or
suffer significant run time performance <br>
penalties. On Pentium III, the Streaming SIMD Extension
(SSE) data type &quot;__m128&quot; may not work properly if
it is not 16-byte aligned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ensure proper alignment of
this values on the stack, the stack boundary must be as
aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must <br>
be generated such that it keeps the stack aligned. Thus
calling a function compiled with a higher preferred stack
boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred
<br>
stack boundary most likely misaligns the stack. It is
recommended that libraries that use callbacks always use the
default setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This extra alignment does
consume extra stack space, and generally increases code
size. Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such as
embedded systems and operating <br>
system kernels, may want to reduce the preferred alignment
to -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdump-tune-features <br>
This option instructs GCC to dump the names of the x86
performance tuning features and default settings. The names
can be used in -mtune-ctrl=feature-list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtune-ctrl=feature-list <br>
This option is used to do fine grain control of x86 code
generation features. feature-list is a comma separated list
of feature names. See also -mdump-tune-features. When <br>
specified, the feature is turned on if it is not preceded
with ^, otherwise, it is turned off.
-mtune-ctrl=feature-list is intended to be used by GCC
developers. Using it <br>
may lead to code paths not covered by testing and can
potentially result in compiler ICEs or runtime errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-default <br>
This option instructs GCC to turn off all tunable features.
See also -mtune-ctrl=feature-list and
-mdump-tune-features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcld <br>
This option instructs GCC to emit a &quot;cld&quot;
instruction in the prologue of functions that use string
instructions. String instructions depend on the DF flag to
select between <br>
autoincrement or autodecrement mode. While the ABI specifies
the DF flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
systems violate this specification by not clearing <br>
the DF flag in their exception dispatchers. The exception
handler can be invoked with the DF flag set, which leads to
wrong direction mode when string instructions are used. <br>
This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets
by configuring GCC with the --enable-cld configure option.
Generation of &quot;cld&quot; instructions can be suppressed
<br>
with the -mno-cld compiler option in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mvzeroupper <br>
This option instructs GCC to emit a &quot;vzeroupper&quot;
instruction before a transfer of control flow out of the
function to minimize the AVX to SSE transition penalty as
well as <br>
remove unnecessary &quot;zeroupper&quot; intrinsics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mprefer-avx128 <br>
This option instructs GCC to use 128-bit AVX instructions
instead of 256-bit AVX instructions in the
auto-vectorizer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcx16 <br>
This option enables GCC to generate &quot;CMPXCHG16B&quot;
instructions. &quot;CMPXCHG16B&quot; allows for atomic
operations on 128-bit double quadword (or oword) data types.
This is useful <br>
for high-resolution counters that can be updated by multiple
processors (or cores). This instruction is generated as part
of atomic built-in functions: see __sync Builtins <br>
or __atomic Builtins for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msahf <br>
This option enables generation of &quot;SAHF&quot;
instructions in 64-bit code. Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with
Intel 64 support, prior to the introduction of Pentium 4 G1
step in <br>
December 2005, lacked the &quot;LAHF&quot; and
&quot;SAHF&quot; instructions which are supported by AMD64.
These are load and store instructions, respectively, for
certain status flags. In <br>
64-bit mode, the &quot;SAHF&quot; instruction is used to

to implement &quot;__builtin_bswap32&quot; and
&quot;__builtin_bswap64&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcrc32 <br>

&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32qi&quot;,
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32hi&quot;,
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32si&quot; and
&quot;__builtin_ia32_crc32di&quot; to generate the
&quot;crc32&quot; <br>
machine instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecip <br>
This option enables use of &quot;RCPSS&quot; and
&quot;RSQRTSS&quot; instructions (and their vectorized
variants &quot;RCPPS&quot; and &quot;RSQRTPS&quot;) with an
additional Newton-Raphson step to increase <br>
precision instead of &quot;DIVSS&quot; and
&quot;SQRTSS&quot; (and their vectorized variants) for
single-precision floating-point arguments. These
instructions are generated only when <br>
-funsafe-math-optimizations is enabled together with
-ffinite-math-only and -fno-trapping-math. Note that while
the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
<br>
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the
sequence can be decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse
of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that GCC implements
&quot;1.0f/sqrtf(x)&quot; in terms of &quot;RSQRTSS&quot;

the corresponding function type when -mveclibabi=acml is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mabi=name <br>
Generate code for the specified calling convention.
Permissible values are sysv for the ABI used on GNU/Linux
and other systems, and ms for the Microsoft ABI. The default
<br>
is to use the Microsoft ABI when targeting Microsoft Windows
and the SysV ABI on all other systems. You can control this
behavior for specific functions by using the <br>
function attributes &quot;ms_abi&quot; and
&quot;sysv_abi&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-dialect=type <br>
Generate code to access thread-local storage using the gnu
or gnu2 conventions. gnu is the conservative default; gnu2
is more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time <br>
requirements that cannot be satisfied on all systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpush-args <br>
-mno-push-args <br>
Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters. This
method is shorter and usually equally fast as method using
SUB/MOV operations and is enabled by default. In some <br>
cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maccumulate-outgoing-args <br>
If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for
outgoing arguments is computed in the function prologue.
This is faster on most modern CPUs because of reduced <br>
dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when the preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2. The
drawback is a notable increase in code size. This switch
<br>
implies -mno-push-args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthreads <br>
Support thread-safe exception handling on MinGW. Programs
that rely on thread-safe exception handling must compile and
link all code with the -mthreads option. When <br>
compiling, -mthreads defines -D_MT; when linking, it links
in a special thread helper library -lmingwthrd which cleans
up per-thread exception-handling data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mms-bitfields <br>
-mno-ms-bitfields <br>
Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native
Microsoft Windows compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;packed&quot; is used on
a structure, or if bit-fields are used, it may be that the
Microsoft ABI lays out the structure differently than the
way GCC normally does. <br>
Particularly when moving packed data between functions
compiled with GCC and the native Microsoft compiler (either
via function call or as data in a file), it may be <br>
necessary to access either format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is enabled by
default for Microsoft Windows targets. This behavior can
also be controlled locally by use of variable or type
attributes. For more information, <br>
see x86 Variable Attributes and x86 Type Attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Microsoft structure layout
algorithm is fairly simple with the exception of the
bit-field packing. The padding and alignment of members of
structures and whether a bit- <br>
field can straddle a storage-unit boundary are determine by
these rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Structure members are stored
sequentially in the order in which they are <br>
declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and
the last member the highest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Every data object has an
alignment requirement. The alignment requirement <br>
for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either
the size of the object or the current packing size
(specified with either the &quot;aligned&quot; attribute or
the <br>
&quot;pack&quot; pragma), whichever is less. For structures,
unions, and arrays, the alignment requirement is the largest
alignment requirement of its members. Every object is <br>
allocated an offset so that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset % alignment_requirement
== 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Adjacent bit-fields are
packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte allocation <br>
unit if the integral types are the same size and if the next
bit-field fits into the current allocation unit without
crossing the boundary imposed by the common alignment <br>
requirements of the bit-fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MSVC interprets zero-length
bit-fields in the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If a zero-length bit-field is
inserted between two bit-fields that <br>
are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not
coalesced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct <br>
{ <br>
unsigned long bf_1 : 12; <br>
unsigned long : 0; <br>
unsigned long bf_2 : 12; <br>
} t1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The size of &quot;t1&quot; is 8
bytes with the zero-length bit-field. If the zero-length
bit-field were removed, &quot;t1&quot;&rsquo;s size would be
4 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If a zero-length bit-field is
inserted after a bit-field, &quot;foo&quot;, and the <br>
alignment of the zero-length bit-field is greater than the
member that follows it, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; is
aligned as the type of the zero-length bit-field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct <br>
{ <br>
char foo : 4; <br>
short : 0; <br>
char bar; <br>
} t2;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct <br>
{ <br>
char foo : 4; <br>
short : 0; <br>
double bar; <br>
} t3;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For &quot;t2&quot;,
&quot;bar&quot; is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1.
Accordingly, the size of &quot;t2&quot; is 4. For
&quot;t3&quot;, the zero-length bit-field does not affect
the alignment of <br>
&quot;bar&quot; or, as a result, the size of the
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taking this into account, it is
important to note the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If a zero-length bit-field
follows a normal bit-field, the type of the <br>
zero-length bit-field may affect the alignment of the
structure as whole. For example, &quot;t2&quot; has a size
of 4 bytes, since the zero-length bit-field follows a normal
<br>
bit-field, and is of type short.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Even if a zero-length
bit-field is not followed by a normal bit-field, it may <br>
still affect the alignment of the structure:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct <br>
{ <br>
char foo : 6; <br>
long : 0; <br>
} t4;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, &quot;t4&quot; takes up 4
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Zero-length bit-fields
following non-bit-field members are ignored: <br>
struct <br>
{ <br>
char foo; <br>
long : 0; <br>
char bar; <br>
} t5;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, &quot;t5&quot; takes up 2
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-align-stringops <br>
Do not align the destination of inlined string operations.
This switch reduces code size and improves performance in
case the destination is already aligned, but GCC
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
know about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-all-stringops <br>
By default GCC inlines string operations only when the
destination is known to be aligned to least a 4-byte
boundary. This enables more inlining and increases code
size, but <br>
may improve performance of code that depends on fast
&quot;memcpy&quot;, &quot;strlen&quot;, and
&quot;memset&quot; for short lengths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-minline-stringops-dynamically
<br>
For string operations of unknown size, use run-time checks
with inline code for small blocks and a library call for
large blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstringop-strategy=alg <br>
Override the internal decision heuristic for the particular
algorithm to use for inlining string operations. The allowed
values for alg are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rep_byte <br>
rep_4byte <br>
rep_8byte <br>
Expand using i386 &quot;rep&quot; prefix of the specified
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byte_loop <br>
loop <br>
unrolled_loop <br>
Expand into an inline loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libcall <br>
Always use a library call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemcpy-strategy=strategy <br>
Override the internal decision heuristic to decide if
&quot;__builtin_memcpy&quot; should be inlined and what
inline algorithm to use when the expected size of the copy
operation is <br>
known. strategy is a comma-separated list of
alg:max_size:dest_align triplets. alg is specified in
-mstringop-strategy, max_size specifies the max byte size
with which <br>
inline algorithm alg is allowed. For the last triplet, the
max_size must be &quot;-1&quot;. The max_size of the
triplets in the list must be specified in increasing order.
The <br>
minimal byte size for alg is 0 for the first triplet and
&quot;max_size + 1&quot; of the preceding range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmemset-strategy=strategy <br>
The option is similar to -mmemcpy-strategy= except that it
is to control &quot;__builtin_memset&quot; expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-momit-leaf-frame-pointer <br>
Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf
functions. This avoids the instructions to save, set up, and
restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available
<br>
in leaf functions. The option -fomit-leaf-frame-pointer
removes the frame pointer for leaf functions, which might
make debugging harder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtls-direct-seg-refs <br>
-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs <br>
Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets
from the TLS segment register (%gs for 32-bit, %fs for
64-bit), or whether the thread base pointer must be added.
<br>
Whether or not this is valid depends on the operating
system, and whether it maps the segment to cover the entire
TLS area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For systems that use the GNU C
Library, the default is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msse2avx <br>
-mno-sse2avx <br>
Specify that the assembler should encode SSE instructions
with VEX prefix. The option -mavx turns this on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfentry <br>
-mno-fentry <br>
If profiling is active (-pg), put the profiling counter call
before the prologue. Note: On x86 architectures the
attribute &quot;ms_hook_prologue&quot; isn&rsquo;t possible
at the moment <br>
for -mfentry and -pg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mrecord-mcount <br>
-mno-record-mcount <br>
If profiling is active (-pg), generate a __mcount_loc
section that contains pointers to each profiling call. This
is useful for automatically patching and out calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnop-mcount <br>
-mno-nop-mcount <br>
If profiling is active (-pg), generate the calls to the
profiling functions as NOPs. This is useful when they should
be patched in later dynamically. This is likely only <br>
useful together with -mrecord-mcount.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mskip-rax-setup <br>
-mno-skip-rax-setup <br>
When generating code for the x86-64 architecture with SSE
extensions disabled, -mskip-rax-setup can be used to skip
setting up RAX register when there are no variable <br>
arguments passed in vector registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Since RAX register is
used to avoid unnecessarily saving vector registers on stack
when passing variable arguments, the impacts of this option
are callees may waste <br>
some stack space, misbehave or jump to a random location.
GCC 4.4 or newer don&rsquo;t have those issues, regardless
the RAX register value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m8bit-idiv <br>
-mno-8bit-idiv <br>
On some processors, like Intel Atom, 8-bit unsigned integer
divide is much faster than 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.
This option generates a run-time check. If both <br>
dividend and divisor are within range of 0 to 255, 8-bit
unsigned integer divide is used instead of 32-bit/64-bit
integer divide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mavx256-split-unaligned-load
<br>
-mavx256-split-unaligned-store <br>
Split 32-byte AVX unaligned load and store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mstack-protector-guard=guard
<br>
Generate stack protection code using canary at guard.
Supported locations are global for global canary or tls for
per-thread canary in the TLS block (the default). This <br>
option has effect only when -fstack-protector or
-fstack-protector-all is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmitigate-rop <br>
Try to avoid generating code sequences that contain
unintended return opcodes, to mitigate against certain forms
of attack. At the moment, this option is limited in what it
<br>
can do and should not be relied on to provide serious
protection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mgeneral-regs-only <br>
Generate code that uses only the general-purpose registers.
This prevents the compiler from using floating-point,
vector, mask and bound registers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These -m switches are supported
in addition to the above on x86-64 processors in 64-bit
environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m32 <br>
-m64 <br>
-mx32 <br>
-m16 <br>
-miamcu <br>
Generate code for a 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit environment.
The -m32 option sets &quot;int&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, and
pointer types to 32 bits, and generates code that runs on
any i386 system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m64 option sets
&quot;int&quot; to 32 bits and &quot;long&quot; and pointer
types to 64 bits, and generates code for the x86-64
architecture. For Darwin only the -m64 option also turns off
<br>
the -fno-pic and -mdynamic-no-pic options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -mx32 option sets
&quot;int&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, and pointer types to 32
bits, and generates code for the x86-64 architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m16 option is the same as
-m32, except for that it outputs the &quot;.code16gcc&quot;
assembly directive at the beginning of the assembly output
so that the binary can run in <br>
16-bit mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -miamcu option generates
code which conforms to Intel MCU psABI. It requires the -m32
option to be turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mno-red-zone <br>
Do not use a so-called &quot;red zone&quot; for x86-64 code.
The red zone is mandated by the x86-64 ABI; it is a 128-byte
area beyond the location of the stack pointer that is not
<br>
modified by signal or interrupt handlers and therefore can
be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer. The flag -mno-red-zone disables this red zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=small <br>
Generate code for the small code model: the program and its
symbols must be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address
space. Pointers are 64 bits. Programs can be statically <br>
or dynamically linked. This is the default code model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=kernel <br>
Generate code for the kernel code model. The kernel runs in
the negative 2 GB of the address space. This model has to be
used for Linux kernel code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=medium <br>
Generate code for the medium model: the program is linked in
the lower 2 GB of the address space. Small symbols are also
placed there. Symbols with sizes larger than <br>
-mlarge-data-threshold are put into large data or BSS
sections and can be located above 2GB. Programs can be
statically or dynamically linked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mcmodel=large <br>
Generate code for the large model. This model makes no
assumptions about addresses and sizes of sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maddress-mode=long <br>
Generate code for long address mode. This is only supported
for 64-bit and x32 environments. It is the default address
mode for 64-bit environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maddress-mode=short <br>
Generate code for short address mode. This is only supported
for 32-bit and x32 environments. It is the default address
mode for 32-bit and x32 environments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x86 Windows Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These additional options are
available for Microsoft Windows targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconsole <br>
This option specifies that a console application is to be
generated, by instructing the linker to set the PE header
subsystem type required for console applications. This <br>
option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets and is
enabled by default on those targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mdll <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that a DLL---a dynamic link library---is to be
generated, enabling the selection of the required runtime
<br>
startup object and entry point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mnop-fun-dllimport <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that the &quot;dllimport&quot; attribute should be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mthread <br>
This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies
that MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-municode <br>
This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets. It causes
the &quot;UNICODE&quot; preprocessor macro to be predefined,
and chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwin32 <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that the typical Microsoft Windows predefined
macros are to be set in the pre-processor, but does not <br>
influence the choice of runtime library/startup code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mwindows <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that a GUI application is to be generated by
instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type
<br>
appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-set-stack-executable <br>
This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies
that the executable flag for the stack used by nested
functions isn&rsquo;t set. This is necessary for binaries
running in <br>
kernel mode of Microsoft Windows, as there the User32 API,
which is used to set executable privileges, isn&rsquo;t
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fwritable-relocated-rdata <br>
This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets. It
specifies that relocated-data in read-only section is put
into the &quot;.data&quot; section. This is a necessary for
older <br>
runtimes not supporting modification of &quot;.rdata&quot;
sections for pseudo-relocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mpe-aligned-commons <br>
This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It
specifies that the GNU extension to the PE file format that
permits the correct alignment of COMMON variables <br>
should be used when generating code. It is enabled by
default if GCC detects that the target assembler found
during configuration supports the feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also under x86 Options for
standard options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xstormy16 Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are defined for
Xstormy16:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msim <br>
Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the
simulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xtensa Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are supported for
Xtensa targets:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mconst16 <br>
-mno-const16 <br>
Enable or disable use of &quot;CONST16&quot; instructions
for loading constant values. The &quot;CONST16&quot;
instruction is currently not a standard option from
Tensilica. When enabled, <br>
&quot;CONST16&quot; instructions are always used in place of
the standard &quot;L32R&quot; instructions. The use of
&quot;CONST16&quot; is enabled by default only if the
&quot;L32R&quot; instruction is not <br>
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mfused-madd <br>
-mno-fused-madd <br>
Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and
multiply/subtract instructions in the floating-point option.
This has no effect if the floating-point option is not also
<br>
enabled. Disabling fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.
This <br>
may be desirable in some cases where strict IEEE
754-compliant results are required: the fused multiply
add/subtract instructions do not round the intermediate
result, <br>
thereby producing results with more bits of precision than
specified by the IEEE standard. Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program <br>
output is not sensitive to the compiler&rsquo;s ability to
combine multiply and add/subtract operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mserialize-volatile <br>
-mno-serialize-volatile <br>
When this option is enabled, GCC inserts &quot;MEMW&quot;
instructions before &quot;volatile&quot; memory references
to guarantee sequential consistency. The default is
-mserialize-volatile. <br>
Use -mno-serialize-volatile to omit the &quot;MEMW&quot;
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mforce-no-pic <br>
For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code
must be position-independent code (PIC), this option
disables PIC for compiling kernel code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtext-section-literals <br>
-mno-text-section-literals <br>
These options control the treatment of literal pools. The
default is -mno-text-section-literals, which places literals
in a separate section in the output file. This allows <br>
the literal pool to be placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it also
allows the linker to combine literal pools from separate
object files to remove redundant literals and improve <br>
code size. With -mtext-section-literals, the literals are
interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as
close as possible to their references. This may be <br>
necessary for large assembly files. Literals for each
function are placed right before that function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mauto-litpools <br>
-mno-auto-litpools <br>
These options control the treatment of literal pools. The
default is -mno-auto-litpools, which places literals in a
separate section in the output file unless <br>
-mtext-section-literals is used. With -mauto-litpools the
literals are interspersed in the text section by the
assembler. Compiler does not produce explicit
&quot;.literal&quot; <br>
directives and loads literals into registers with
&quot;MOVI&quot; instructions instead of &quot;L32R&quot; to
let the assembler do relaxation and place literals as
necessary. This option <br>
allows assembler to create several literal pools per
function and assemble very big functions, which may not be
possible with -mtext-section-literals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtarget-align <br>
-mno-target-align <br>
When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties
at the expense of some code density. The assembler <br>
attempts to widen density instructions to align branch
targets and the instructions following call instructions. If
there are not enough preceding safe density instructions
<br>
to align a target, no widening is performed. The default is
-mtarget-align. These options do not affect the treatment of
auto-aligned instructions like &quot;LOOP&quot;, which the
<br>
assembler always aligns, either by widening density
instructions or by inserting NOP instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mlongcalls <br>
-mno-longcalls <br>
When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
translate direct calls to indirect calls unless it can
determine that the target of a direct call is in the range
<br>
allowed by the call instruction. This translation typically
occurs for calls to functions in other source files.
Specifically, the assembler translates a direct
&quot;CALL&quot; <br>
instruction into an &quot;L32R&quot; followed by a
&quot;CALLX&quot; instruction. The default is
-mno-longcalls. This option should be used in programs where
the call target can potentially be <br>
out of range. This option is implemented in the assembler,
not the compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC
still shows direct call instructions---look at the <br>
disassembled object code to see the actual instructions.
Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for every
cross-file call, not just those that really are out of <br>
range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zSeries Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are listed under</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
This section describes several environment variables that

kinds of files. Some are used to specify other aspects of
the compilation environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you can also specify

precedence over those specified by the configuration of
GCC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG <br>
LC_CTYPE <br>
LC_MESSAGES <br>
LC_ALL <br>
These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information which allows GCC to work with
different national conventions. GCC inspects the locale <br>
categories LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES if it has been
configured to do so. These locale categories can be set to
any value supported by your installation. A typical value is
<br>
en_GB.UTF-8 for English in the United Kingdom encoded in
UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LC_CTYPE environment
variable specifies character classification. GCC uses it to
determine the character boundaries in a string; this is
needed for some multibyte <br>
encodings that contain quote and escape characters that are
otherwise interpreted as a string end or escape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LC_MESSAGES environment
variable specifies the language to use in diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the LC_ALL environment
variable is set, it overrides the value of LC_CTYPE and
LC_MESSAGES; otherwise, LC_CTYPE and LC_MESSAGES default to
the value of the LANG <br>
environment variable. If none of these variables are set,
GCC defaults to traditional C English behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR <br>
If TMPDIR is set, it specifies the directory to use for
temporary files. GCC uses temporary files to hold the output
of one stage of compilation which is to be used as input
<br>
to the next stage: for example, the output of the
preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler proper.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG <br>
Setting GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG is nearly equivalent to passing
-fcompare-debug to the compiler driver. See the
documentation of this option for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX <br>
If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is set, it specifies a prefix to use in
the names of the subprograms executed by the compiler. No
slash is added when this prefix is combined with the <br>
name of a subprogram, but you can specify a prefix that ends
with a slash if you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is not set,
GCC attempts to figure out an appropriate prefix to use
based on the pathname it is invoked with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If GCC cannot find the
subprogram using the specified prefix, it tries looking in
the usual places for the subprogram.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of
GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is prefix/lib/gcc/ where prefix is the
prefix to the installed compiler. In many cases prefix is
the value of &quot;prefix&quot; when you ran the <br>
configure script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other prefixes specified with -B
take precedence over this prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This prefix is also used for
finding files such as crt0.o that are used for linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the prefix is used
in an unusual way in finding the directories to search for
header files. For each of the standard directories whose
name normally begins with <br>
/usr/local/lib/gcc (more precisely, with the value of
GCC_INCLUDE_DIR), GCC tries replacing that beginning with
the specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.
<br>
Thus, with -Bfoo/, GCC searches foo/bar just before it
searches the standard directory /usr/local/lib/bar. If a
standard directory begins with the configured prefix then
the <br>
value of prefix is replaced by GCC_EXEC_PREFIX when looking
for header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPILER_PATH <br>
The value of COMPILER_PATH is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like PATH. GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot <br>
find the subprograms using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIBRARY_PATH <br>
The value of LIBRARY_PATH is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like PATH. When configured as a native
compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when <br>
searching for special linker files, if it cannot find them
using GCC_EXEC_PREFIX. Linking using GCC also uses these
directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the
<br>
-l option (but directories specified with -L come
first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG <br>
This variable is used to pass locale information to the
compiler. One way in which this information is used is to
determine the character set to be used when character <br>
literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and
C++. When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte
characters, the following values for LANG are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-JIS <br>
Recognize JIS characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-SJIS <br>
Recognize SJIS characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-EUCJP <br>
Recognize EUCJP characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If LANG is not defined, or if it
has some other value, then the compiler uses
&quot;mblen&quot; and &quot;mbtowc&quot; as defined by the
default locale to recognize and translate multibyte <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some additional environment
variables affect the behavior of the preprocessor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPATH <br>
C_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
Each variable&rsquo;s value is a list of directories
separated by a special character, much like PATH, in which
to look for header files. The special character,
&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;, <br>
is target-dependent and determined at GCC build time. For
Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for
almost all other targets it is a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPATH specifies a list of
directories to be searched as if specified with -I, but
after any paths given with -I options on the command line.
This environment variable is <br>
used regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining environment
variables apply only when preprocessing the particular
language indicated. Each specifies a list of directories to
be searched as if specified with <br>
-isystem, but after any paths given with -isystem options on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all these variables, an empty
element instructs the compiler to search its current working
directory. Empty elements can appear at the beginning or end
of a path. For <br>
instance, if the value of CPATH is
&quot;:/special/include&quot;, that has the same effect as
-I. -I/special/include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT <br>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files
processed by the compiler. System header files are <br>
ignored in the dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
can be just a file name, in which case the Make rules are
written to that file, guessing the target name from the
source file name. Or the <br>
value can have the form file target, in which case the rules
are written to file file using target as the target
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, this environment
variable is equivalent to combining the options -MM and -MF,
with an optional -MT switch too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES <br>
This variable is the same as DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see
above), except that system header files are not ignored, so
it implies -M rather than -MM. However, the dependence on
<br>
the main input file is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH <br>
If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX
timestamp to be used in replacement of the current date and
time in the &quot;__DATE__&quot; and &quot;__TIME__&quot;
macros, so that the <br>
embedded timestamps become reproducible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
must be a UNIX timestamp, defined as the number of seconds
(excluding leap seconds) since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00
represented in ASCII; identical <br>
to the output of @command{date +%s} on GNU/Linux and other
systems that support the %s extension in the
&quot;date&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value should be a known
timestamp such as the last modification time of the source
or package and it should be set by the build process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FOOTNOTES <br>
1. On some systems, gcc -shared needs to build supplementary
stub code for constructors to work. On multi-libbed systems,
gcc -shared must select the correct support libraries <br>
to link against. Failing to supply the correct flags may
lead to subtle defects. Supplying them in cases where they
are not necessary is innocuous.</p>
