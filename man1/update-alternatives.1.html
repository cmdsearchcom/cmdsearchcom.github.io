<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
update-alternatives - maintain symbolic links determining
default commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
update-alternatives [option...] command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
update-alternatives creates, removes, maintains and displays
information about the symbolic links comprising the Debian
alternatives system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible for several
programs fulfilling the same or similar functions to be
installed on a single system at the same time. For example,
many systems have several text <br>
editors installed at once. This gives choice to the users of
a system, allowing each to use a different editor, if
desired, but makes it difficult for a program to make a good
<br>
choice for an editor to invoke if the user has not specified
a particular preference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debian&rsquo;s alternatives
system aims to solve this problem. A generic name in the
filesystem is shared by all files providing interchangeable
functionality. The alternatives sys&acirc; <br>
tem and the system administrator together determine which
actual file is referenced by this generic name. For example,
if the text editors ed(1) and nvi(1) are both installed on
<br>
the system, the alternatives system will cause the generic
name /usr/bin/editor to refer to /usr/bin/nvi by default.
The system administrator can override this and cause it to
<br>
refer to /usr/bin/ed instead, and the alternatives system
will not alter this setting until explicitly requested to do
so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generic name is not a direct
symbolic link to the selected alternative. Instead, it is a
symbolic link to a name in the alternatives directory, which
in turn is a symbolic <br>
link to the actual file referenced. This is done so that the
system administrator&rsquo;s changes can be confined within
the /etc directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why this is
a <br>
Good Thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When each package providing a
file with a particular functionality is installed, changed
or removed, update-alternatives is called to update
information about that file in the <br>
alternatives system. update-alternatives is usually called
from the postinst (configure) or prerm (remove and
deconfigure) scripts in Debian packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is often useful for a number
of alternatives to be synchronized, so that they are changed
as a group; for example, when several versions of the vi(1)
editor are installed, the <br>
man page referenced by /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1 should
correspond to the executable referenced by /usr/bin/vi.
update-alternatives handles this by means of master and
slave <br>
links; when the master is changed, any associated slaves are
changed too. A master link and its associated slaves make up
a link group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each link group is, at any given
time, in one of two modes: automatic or manual. When a group
is in automatic mode, the alternatives system will
automatically decide, as pack&acirc; <br>
ages are installed and removed, whether and how to update
the links. In manual mode, the alternatives system will
retain the choice of the administrator and avoid changing
the <br>
links (except when something is broken).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link groups are in automatic
mode when they are first introduced to the system. If the
system administrator makes changes to the system&rsquo;s
automatic settings, this will be <br>
noticed the next time update-alternatives is run on the
changed link&rsquo;s group, and the group will automatically
be switched to manual mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each alternative has a priority
associated with it. When a link group is in automatic mode,
the alternatives pointed to by members of the group will be
those which have the <br>
highest priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the --config option,
update-alternatives will list all of the choices for the
link group of which given name is the master alternative
name. The current choice is <br>
marked with a &acirc;*&acirc;. You will then be prompted for
your choice regarding this link group. Depending on the
choice made, the link group might no longer be in auto mode.
You will <br>
need to use the --auto option in order to return to the
automatic mode (or you can rerun --config and select the
entry marked as automatic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to configure
non-interactively you can use the --set option instead (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different packages providing the
same file need to do so cooperatively. In other words, the
usage of update-alternatives is mandatory for all involved
packages in such case. It <br>
is not possible to override some file in a package that does
not employ the update-alternatives mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINOLOGY <br>
Since the activities of update-alternatives are quite
involved, some specific terms will help to explain its
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generic name (or alternative
link) <br>
A name, like /usr/bin/editor, which refers, via the
alternatives system, to one of a number of files of similar
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternative name <br>
The name of a symbolic link in the alternatives
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternative (or alternative
path) <br>
The name of a specific file in the filesystem, which may be
made accessible via a generic name using the alternatives
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alternatives directory <br>
A directory, by default /etc/alternatives, containing the
symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">administrative directory <br>
A directory, by default /var/lib/dpkg/alternatives,
containing update-alternatives&rsquo; state information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">link group <br>
A set of related symlinks, intended to be updated as a
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">master link <br>
The alternative link in a link group which determines how
the other links in the group are configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slave link <br>
An alternative link in a link group which is controlled by
the setting of the master link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">automatic mode <br>
When a link group is in automatic mode, the alternatives
system ensures that the links in the group point to the
highest priority alternative appropriate for the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">manual mode <br>
When a link group is in manual mode, the alternatives system
will not make any changes to the system
administrator&rsquo;s settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
--install link name path priority [--slave link name
path]... <br>
Add a group of alternatives to the system. link is the
generic name for the master link, name is the name of its
symlink in the alternatives directory, and path is the <br>
alternative being introduced for the master link. The
arguments after --slave are the generic name, symlink name
in the alternatives directory and the alternative path <br>
for a slave link. Zero or more --slave options, each
followed by three arguments, may be specified. Note that the
master alternative must exist or the call will fail. <br>
However if a slave alternative doesn&rsquo;t exist, the
corresponding slave alternative link will simply not be
installed (a warning will still be displayed). If some real
file <br>
is installed where an alternative link has to be installed,
it is kept unless --force is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the alternative name
specified exists already in the alternatives system&rsquo;s
records, the information supplied will be added as a new set
of alternatives for the group. <br>
Otherwise, a new group, set to automatic mode, will be added
with this information. If the group is in automatic mode,
and the newly added alternatives&rsquo; priority is <br>
higher than any other installed alternatives for this group,
the symlinks will be updated to point to the newly added
alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set name path <br>
Set the program path as alternative for name. This is
equivalent to --config but is non-interactive and thus
scriptable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove name path <br>
Remove an alternative and all of its associated slave links.
name is a name in the alternatives directory, and path is an
absolute filename to which name could be linked. <br>
If name is indeed linked to path, name will be updated to
point to another appropriate alternative (and the group is
put back in automatic mode), or removed if there is no <br>
such alternative left. Associated slave links will be
updated or removed, correspondingly. If the link is not
currently pointing to path, no links are changed; only the
<br>
information about the alternative is removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-all name <br>
Remove all alternatives and all of their associated slave
links. name is a name in the alternatives directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all Call --config on all
alternatives. It can be usefully combined with --skip-auto
to review and configure all alternatives which are not
configured in automatic mode. Broken <br>
alternatives are also displayed. Thus a simple way to fix
all broken alternatives is to call yes &rsquo;&rsquo; |
update-alternatives --force --all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--auto name <br>
Switch the link group behind the alternative for name to
automatic mode. In the process, the master symlink and its
slaves are updated to point to the highest priority <br>
installed alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display name <br>
Display information about the link group. Information
displayed includes the group&rsquo;s mode (auto or manual),
the master and slave links, which alternative the master
link <br>
currently points to, what other alternatives are available
(and their corresponding slave alternatives), and the
highest priority alternative currently installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--get-selections <br>
List all master alternative names (those controlling a link
group) and their status (since version 1.15.0). Each line
contains up to 3 fields (separated by one or more <br>
spaces). The first field is the alternative name, the second
one is the status (either auto or manual), and the last one
contains the current choice in the alternative <br>
(beware: it&rsquo;s a filename and thus might contain
spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--set-selections <br>
Read configuration of alternatives on standard input in the
format generated by --get-selections and reconfigure them
accordingly (since version 1.15.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--query name <br>
Display information about the link group like --display
does, but in a machine parseable way (since version 1.15.0,
see section QUERY FORMAT below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list name <br>
Display all targets of the link group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config name <br>
Show available alternatives for a link group and allow the
user to interactively select which one to use. The link
group is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show the usage message
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show the version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--altdir directory <br>
Specifies the alternatives directory, when this is to be
different from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--admindir directory <br>
Specifies the administrative directory, when this is to be
different from the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log file <br>
Specifies the log file (since version 1.15.0), when this is
to be different from the default
(/var/log/alternatives.log).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
Allow replacing or dropping any real file that is installed
where an alternative link has to be installed or
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--skip-auto <br>
Skip configuration prompt for alternatives which are
properly configured in automatic mode. This option is only
relevant with --config or --all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Generate more comments about what is being done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate any comments unless errors occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 The requested action was successfully performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Problems were encountered
whilst parsing the command line or performing the
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DPKG_ADMINDIR <br>
If set and the --admindir option has not been specified, it
will be used as the base administrative directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/alternatives/ <br>
The default alternatives directory. Can be overridden by the
--altdir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/ <br>
The default administration directory. Can be overridden by
the --admindir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUERY FORMAT <br>
The --query format is using an RFC822-like flat format.
It&rsquo;s made of n + 1 blocks where n is the number of
alternatives available in the queried link group. The first
block con&acirc; <br>
tains the following fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name: name <br>
The alternative name in the alternative directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link: link <br>
The generic name of the alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slaves: list-of-slaves <br>
When this field is present, the next lines hold all slave
links associated to the master link of the alternative.
There is one slave per line. Each line contains one <br>
space, the generic name of the slave alternative, another
space, and the path to the slave link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status: status <br>
The status of the alternative (auto or manual).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Best: best-choice <br>
The path of the best alternative for this link group. Not
present if there is no alternatives available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Value:
currently-selected-alternative <br>
The path of the currently selected alternative. It can also
take the magic value none. It is used if the link
doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other blocks describe the
available alternatives in the queried link group:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternative:
path-of-this-alternative <br>
Path to this block&rsquo;s alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Priority: priority-value <br>
Value of the priority of this alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slaves: list-of-slaves <br>
When this field is present, the next lines hold all slave
alternatives associated to the master link of the
alternative. There is one slave per line. Each line contains
<br>
one space, the generic name of the slave alternative,
another space, and the path to the slave alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
With --verbose update-alternatives chatters incessantly
about its activities on its standard output channel. If
problems occur, update-alternatives outputs error messages
on its <br>
standard error channel and returns an exit status of 2.
These diagnostics should be self-explanatory; if you do not
find them so, please report this as a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
There are several packages which provide a text editor
compatible with vi, for example nvi and vim. Which one is
used is controlled by the link group vi, which includes
links for <br>
the program itself and the associated manpage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display the available
packages which provide vi and the current setting for it,
use the --display action:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-alternatives --display
vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To choose a particular vi
implementation, use this command as root and then select a
number from the list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-alternatives --config
vi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To go back to having the vi
implementation chosen automatically, do this as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update-alternatives --auto
vi</p>
