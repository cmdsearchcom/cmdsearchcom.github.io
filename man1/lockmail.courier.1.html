<b>lockmail</b> is a helper utility for working with mailbox files. Mailbox
  files must be locked to prevent other applications from modifying the mailbox
  at the same time. Different system use different locking conventions.
  <b>lockmail</b> uses two of the most common locking mechanisms in use, which
  should work reliably on most systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>lockfile</i> is the pathname to an existing mailbox file. By default,
  <b>lockmail</b> tries to lock the mailbox every five seconds (if the mailbox
  is already locked), and will give up after three minutes. After the mailbox is
  successfully locked, <b>lockmail</b> runs <i>program</i> as a child process,
  with any optional <i>argument</i>s. When <i>program</i> terminates,
  <b>lockmail</b> removes the mailbox lock, and terminates itself.

-r
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If a regular lock fails, try a read-only lock.
  Use this option to lock mailbox files in a read-only directory.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
-t <i>timeout</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If the lock attempt fails, try again for up to
  <i>timeout</i> seconds. The actual timeout is rounded up to the next five
  second interval (a lock attempt is tried every five seconds).</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This section briefly describes the locking mechanism used by <b>lockmail</b>.
  <b>lockmail</b> uses three different locking conventions in order to maximize
  compatibility with other mail software: C-Client folder locks, dot-locks, and
  file locks.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="C-Client_folder_locks"><a class="selflink" href="#C-Client_folder_locks">C-Client
  folder locks</a></h2>
Mail software based on the C-Client library creates lock files named /tmp/.
  <i>dddddd</i>. <i>iiiiii</i>. Here, <i>dddddd</i> and <i>iiiiii</i> are the
  device number and the inode number of the mailbox file (the <i>st_dev</i> and
  <i>st_ino</i> fields in the inode), in hexadecimal. If the process ID saved in
  the C-Client folder lock file is not valid, <b>lockmail</b> concludes that
  it's a stale lock file, and will remove it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A race condition exists where a C-Client process is killed after it creates a
  lock file, but before saving its process ID in the lock file. The race window
  is very small, but it exists. The C-Client library does not appear to ever
  clear out the lock file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lockmail</b> attempts to resolve this race condition by deleting zero-length
  lock files that are at least five minutes old.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="dot-locks"><a class="selflink" href="#dot-locks">dot-locks</a></h2>
<b>lockmail</b> also creates, and honors dot-lock files. Dot-lock files are
  first created as temporary files, then linked to <i>lockfile</i>.lock. The
  link operation fails if the dot-lock file already exists. <b>lockmail</b> uses
  an enhanced method of dot-locking, where its process ID, and the name of the
  server where <b>lockmail</b> is running is also saved in its dot-lock file. If
  the operation fails due to an existing dot-lock file that was created by
  another <b>lockmail</b> process on the same server, and the process ID no
  longer exists, this stale dot-lock file is removed immediately. In all other
  situations a dot-lock file older than five minutes is considered stale, and
  removed.

<b>Note</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A failure to create a dot-lock file is silently ignored if the reason for the
  failure is because <b>lockmail</b> does not have the write permission in the
  dot-lock file's directory. The incoming mail spool directory (usually
  /var/mail) typically does not have global write permissions, so the attempt to
  create the dot-lock file in the spool directory will fail, and <b>lockmail</b>
  will be content with using file-locking only.
<div style="height: 0.50em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="File_locks"><a class="selflink" href="#File_locks">File
  locks</a></h2>
The final locking mechanism <b>lockmail</b> uses is the operating system's file
  locking facility. If <b>lockmail</b> fails to obtain all three locks,
  <b>lockmail</b> will sleep for five seconds and try again. The only exception
  is a failure to create a dot-lock because of no write access to the dot-lock
  file's directory, which is ignored. If <b>lockmail</b> still fails to obtain
  all required locks in the amount of time specified by the <b>-t</b> option (or
  its default value), <b>lockmail</b> will terminate with the EX_TEMPFAIL exit
  code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>lockmail</b> runs <i>program</i> after obtaining the last file lock, waits
  until <i>program</i> terminates, and releases all locks. <i>program</i> must
  terminate before any of the locks obtained by <b>lockmail</b> expire, and are
  considered stale. <b>lockmail</b> will then terminate with the same exit code
  as <i>program</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<b>lockmail</b> terminates with the same exit status as
  <i>program</i><b>lockmail</b> terminates with the EX_TEMPFAIL exit status if
  it was unable to obtain a lock, or if <i>program</i> was killed by a signal.
