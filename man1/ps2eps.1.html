This manual page documents <b>ps2eps</b> version 1.68.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ps2eps</b> is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript
  Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates
  correct Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special postscript
  command sequences that can produce erroneous results on printers. EPS files
  are often needed for including (scalable) graphics of high quality into
  TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without any argument, ps2eps reads from standard input and writes to standard
  output. If filenames are given as arguments they are processed one by one and
  output files are written to filenames with extension <i>.eps</i>. If input
  filenames have the extension <i>.ps</i> or <i>.prn</i>, this extension is
  replaced with <i>.eps</i>. In all other cases <i>.eps</i> is appended to the
  input filename. Please note that PostScript files for input should contain
  only one single page (you can possibly use the <b>psselect</b> from the
  psutils package to extract a single page from a document that contains
  multiple pages).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If BoundingBox in output seems to be wrong, please try options <b>--size</b> or
  <b>--ignoreBB</b>. See also section TROUBLESHOOTING.

Based on the given postscript source code (in most cases generated by some
  postscript printer driver) there are many potential obstacles or problems that
  may occur when trying to create proper EPS files. Please read this section
  carefully to be aware of common pitfalls.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INCOMPLETE/CLIPPED_IMAGES"><a class="selflink" href="#INCOMPLETE/CLIPPED_IMAGES">INCOMPLETE/CLIPPED
  IMAGES</a></h2>
or how to determine the right size for ghostscript.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you have documents that are larger than your ghostscript default (usually A4
  or US letter), you have to specify the page dimensions explicitly using the
  <b>-s</b> option. Otherwise your EPS might be cut off during rasterizing by
  ghostscript resulting in a wrongly calculated bounding box. You can pass all
  pre-defined page sizes to <b>-s</b> that ghostscript understands. These are
  currently: 11x17, ledger, legal, letter, lettersmall, archA, archB, archC,
  archD, archE a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, isob0, isob1, isob2,
  isob3, isob4, isob5, isob6, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5,
  c6, jisb0, jisb1, jisb2, jisb3, jisb4, jisb5, jisb6, flsa, flse, halfletter.
  Unfortunately, all sizes are currently only available in portrait orientation
  (not landscape).
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>ps2eps</b> uses an already given %%BoundingBox from the source
  file, which often corresponds to the size of the physical page format for
  which the document was printed. However, you should be aware that this already
  specified bounding box may be not correct, thus resulting in a wrongly cropped
  (or even no usable) <i>.eps</i>-file. <b>ps2eps</b> can only do as good as
  ghostscript does in rendering the original postscript file (though
  <b>ps2eps</b> even works with negative and fractional values are contained in
  the original bounding box by using automatic translation). Therefore, if the
  given bounding box is to small or incorrect anyway, you can ignore the
  existing bounding box with the <b>-B</b> option, which will cause ghostscript
  to use its internal default size (or use <b>-s</b>). However, if the
  BoundingBox has negative coordinates, which is not allowed by the
  specification, <b>ps2eps</b> will shift the output to positive values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hint: to avoid rotating the picture if you have the original drawing in
  landscape format, you may use the ``Encapsulated Postscript'' option in the
  printer driver which should generate an EPS file (but with a bounding box of
  the sheet size!). But some Windows printer drivers are drawing the image with
  an offset from the bottom of the portrait page, so that a part of it is drawn
  outside the landscape oriented page. In this case, you'll have to specify a
  square size of the page using the maximum length, e.g., 29.7cm x 29.7cm for an
  A4 page.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CLIPPING"><a class="selflink" href="#CLIPPING">CLIPPING</a></h2>
or why gets some of my text deleted above the included <i>.eps</i> file?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some postscript drivers draw a white rectangle from the top left corner of the
  page to the right lower corner of the object. This may erase some or even all
  text above your imported/included EPS file, which is very annoying. In order
  to prevent this, most programs have a clipping option for imported <i>.eps</i>
  files (within LaTeX you can use \includegraphics*{}) for this purpose. If this
  is unfortunately not the case, you can use the <b>-C</b> option of
  <b>ps2eps</b> which will (hopefully) do it for you. Unfortunately, PScript.dll
  5.2 (Windows XP) introduced new very badly behaving Postscript code (initclip)
  which will even override the outer clipping! Thus, a new filter had to be
  installed in <b>ps2eps</b> which will fix it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, because most programs clip directly on the bounding box, you still may
  loose some pixels of your image, because the bounding box is described in the
  coarse resolution of postscript points, i.e. 72 dpi. In order to prevent this,
  you can use the <b>-l</b> option or <b>-C</b> option (for the latter, clipping
  by the importing program should be disabled then) to allow for a 1 point
  larger bounding box. <b>-C</b> clips around a 1 point enlarged bounding box
  and <b>-l</b> enlarges the bounding box values by 1 point (you can also
  combine both options).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="INCLUDED_FILTERS"><a class="selflink" href="#INCLUDED_FILTERS">INCLUDED
  FILTERS</a></h2>
Some postscript sequences, e.g., for using specific printer features
  (featurebegin ...), are not working well within an <i>.eps</i> file, so
  <b>ps2eps</b> tries to filter them out. But please note that filters for
  postscript code may not work properly for your printer driver ( <b>ps2eps</b>
  was mainly tested with HP and Adobe printer drivers, although it may work for
  all printers using the PScript.dll). In this case you can try to turn of
  filtering by using option <b>-n</b>, or try to find the bad sequence in the
  postscript code and adapt the filter rule in the <b>ps2eps</b> script
  (variables $linefilter, $rangefilter_begin, $rangefilter_end; linefilter is an
  expression for filtering single lines, rangefilter_... are expressions that
  filter all lines between a pattern matching $rangefilter_begin and
  $rangefilter_end; drop me an e-mail with your modifications). However, things
  may change as the printer drivers (e.g., PScript.dll) or postscript language
  evolve.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some applications or drivers generate postscript code with leading or trailing
  binary code, which often confuses older postscript interpreters. <b>ps2eps</b>
  tries to remove such code, but it may sometimes make a wrong guess about start
  and end of the real postscript code (drop me an e-mail with a zipped
  postscript source, see section BUGS).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Comment lines or even blank lines are removed (which is the default to make .eps
  files smaller), which may corrupt your output. Please check the next section
  how to fix this. <b>ps2eps</b> removes blank lines and also &lt;CR&gt;
  (carriage ceturn ``\r'') at the end of lines. However, nicely formatted
  postscript code gives a hint by using ``%%BeginBinary'' ``%%EndBinary''
  comments. When <b>ps2eps</b> detects these comments it will refrain from any
  filtering action within the marked binary sections.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ps2eps</b> filters also %%Orientation: comments by default (you can use
  option <b>-O</b> to turn off filtering), because ghostscript may
  ``automagically'' rotate images when generating PDF images, which is not
  desired in most cases. Hint: you can turn off that feature in ghostscript
  unconditionally by specifying -dAutoRotatePages=/None.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CORRUPTED_OUTPUT"><a class="selflink" href="#CORRUPTED_OUTPUT">CORRUPTED
  OUTPUT</a></h2>
Some postscript code may get corrupted when comment lines or even blank lines
  are removed (which is the default to make .eps files smaller), because those
  files may contain encoded images which also have a % as first character in a
  line or use a special comment as end of image delimiter. If this is the case,
  use the <b>-c</b> option to prevent filtering comments.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="COLOR_AND_MEMORY"><a class="selflink" href="#COLOR_AND_MEMORY">COLOR
  AND MEMORY</a></h2>
<b>ps2eps</b> supports colored postscript, consequently letting ghostscript
  consume more resources for drawing its bitmap (roughly 6MBytes for an A4
  page). <b>bbox</b> is reading the bitmap line by line so it consumes only
  minimal memory. If you experience problems with memory consumption of
  ghostscript, you may use the <b>-m</b> option for using a monochrome image.
  But this will probably result in wrongly determined bounding boxes with
  colored images, because ghostscript has to do black/white dithering and may
  thus suppress objects drawn in light colors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another option in case of memory problems and too long run times is to use the
  much more memory efficient internal ghostscript bbox by using the <b>-g</b>
  option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
Please note that a command line option always takes precedence over the related
  environment variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The environment variable PS2EPS_SIZE can be used to specify a default page size
  and take any argument that <b>--size</b> accepts. Examples: <b>export
  PS2EPS_SIZE=a0</b> (bash-like syntax) or <b>setenv PS2EPS_SIZE letter</b> (csh
  syntax).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the environment variable PS2EPS_GSBBOX is set the internal bbox device of
  ghostscript will be used instead of the external command <b>bbox</b>.
  Examples: <b>export PS2EPS_GSBBOX=true</b> (bash-like syntax) or <b>setenv
  PS2EPS_GSBBOX 1</b> (csh syntax).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The usual call is simply: <b>ps2eps -l </b><i>file</i><b></b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A relatively failsafe call would be (if your postscript is smaller than iso b0
  [100cm x 141.4cm] and you have a fast computer with enough memory): <b>ps2eps
  -l -B -s b0 -c -n </b> <i>file</i><b></b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If output is not correct try: <b>ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -F </b><i>file</i><b></b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUTHOR"><a class="selflink" href="#AUTHOR">AUTHOR</a></h1>
<b>ps2eps</b> was written by Roland Bless.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="WHY?"><a class="selflink" href="#WHY?">WHY?</a></h2>
Other programs like <b>ps2epsi</b> do not calculate the bounding box always
  correctly (because the values are put on the postscript stack which may get
  corrupted by bad postscript code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS
  cut off some part of the image. <b>ps2eps</b> uses a double precision
  resolution of 144 dpi and appropriate rounding to get a proper bounding box.
  The internal bbox device of ghostscript generates different values (sometimes
  even incorrect), so using the provided <b>bbox</b> should be more robust.
  However, because normal clipping has only a resolution of 1/72dpi (postscript
  point), the clipping process may still erase parts of your EPS image. In this
  case please use the <b>-l</b> option to add an additional point of white space
  around the tight bounding box.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ACKNOWLEDGMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h2>
