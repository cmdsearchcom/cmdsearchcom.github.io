<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents ps2eps version 1.68.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps2eps is a tool (written in
Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF)
from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates
correct Bounding Boxes for those <br>
EPS files and filters some special postscript command
sequences that can produce erroneous results on printers.
EPS files are often needed for including (scalable) graphics
of <br>
high quality into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without any argument, ps2eps
reads from standard input and writes to standard output. If
filenames are given as arguments they are processed one by
one and output files are <br>
written to filenames with extension .eps. If input filenames
have the extension .ps or .prn, this extension is replaced
with .eps. In all other cases .eps is appended to the <br>
input filename. Please note that PostScript files for input
should contain only one single page (you can possibly use
the psselect from the psutils package to extract a single
<br>
page from a document that contains multiple pages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If BoundingBox in output seems
to be wrong, please try options --size or --ignoreBB. See
also section TROUBLESHOOTING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ps2eps follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;). A
summary of options is included below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show version of program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Force overwriting existing files. ps2eps will not overwrite
files by default to avoid deleting original EPS files
accidently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
quiet operation (no output while processing files, except
errors).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --noinsert <br>
do not insert any postscript code. Normally a few postscript
instructions are added around the original postscript code
by ps2eps which can be turned off by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --preserveorientation <br>
do not filter %%Orientation: header comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nofix <br>
do not try to fix postscript code by filtering some
instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --removepreview <br>
remove preview image (smaller file, but no preview
anymore).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --fixps <br>
fix postscript code unconditionally. Otherwise, filtering is
usually triggered by detection of certain drivers only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --comments <br>
preserve document structure comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --clip <br>
insert postscript code for clipping. Unless --nohires is
specified, the HiResBoundingBox (enlarged by 0.1 points) is
used for clipping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --mono <br>
use black/white bitmap as base for calculation (default:
off).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --size=pagedim <br>
where pagedim is a pre-defined standard page size (e.g.,
a4,a0,b0,letter,...) or explicitly specified in a format
pagedim:=XxY[cm|in], where X and Y are numbers (floating
<br>
points are accepted) followed by units centimeter (cm) or
inch (in), (default: cm). Use --size=list to list
pre-defined pagesizes. See also environment variable <br>
PS2EPS_SIZE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --translate=x,y <br>
specify an x,y offset (may be negative) in postscript points
(1/72 dpi) for drawing. This option may be required if your
drawing has negative coordinates which usually <br>
lets ghostscript cut the negative part of your picture,
because it starts to render at positive coordinates. The
resulting output will also be shifted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --resolution=dpi <br>
specify a resolution in dpi (dots per inch) for drawing
under ghostscript. Default resolution is 144 dpi which is
the double of the typical 72 dpi. This option may help <br>
if there is a hardware dependent resolution encoded in the
postscript, e.g., 600dpi. Example: ps2eps -l -r 600
test.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --rotate=direction <br>
This option rotates the resulting EPS output. The parameter
direction determines the direction of rotation: + means +90
degrees (clockwise),- means -90 degrees (counter- <br>
clockwise), and ^ means 180 degrees (up-side down).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --loose <br>
expand the original tight bounding box by one point in each
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --ignoreBB <br>
do not use existing bounding box as page size for
rendering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --ignoreEOF <br>
do not use %%EOF as hint for end of file. Otherwise, ps2eps
assumes that postscript code ends after the last %%EOF
comment, because some drivers add trailing binary <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;garbage&rsquo;&rsquo; code which gets deleted
by ps2eps by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gsbbox <br>
use internal bbox device of ghostscript instead of the
external C program bbox. The internal bbox device of
ghostscript generates different values (sometimes even
incor&acirc; <br>
rect), so using the provided bbox should be more robust. See
also environment variable PS2EPS_GSBBOX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --nohires <br>
do not generate a %%HiResBoundingBox comment for output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --accuracy <br>
increase the accuracy by turning subsample antialiasing on
(may be slower)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --license <br>
show licensing information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debuggs <br>
show ghostscript call. This may be helpful for solving
problems that occur during a ghostscript call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --warnings <br>
show warnings about sanity of generated EPS file. Certain
postscript commands should not be contained in an EPS file.
With this option set ps2eps will issue a warning if <br>
it detects at least one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Based on the given postscript source code (in most cases
generated by some postscript printer driver) there are many
potential obstacles or problems that may occur when trying
to <br>
create proper EPS files. Please read this section carefully
to be aware of common pitfalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCOMPLETE/CLIPPED IMAGES <br>
or how to determine the right size for ghostscript.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have documents that are
larger than your ghostscript default (usually A4 or US
letter), you have to specify the page dimensions explicitly
using the -s option. Otherwise <br>
your EPS might be cut off during rasterizing by ghostscript
resulting in a wrongly calculated bounding box. You can pass
all pre-defined page sizes to -s that ghostscript
under&acirc; <br>
stands. These are currently: 11x17, ledger, legal, letter,
lettersmall, archA, archB, archC, archD, archE a0, a1, a2,
a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, isob0, isob1, isob2, isob3,
<br>
isob4, isob5, isob6, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, c0, c1, c2, c3,
c4, c5, c6, jisb0, jisb1, jisb2, jisb3, jisb4, jisb5, jisb6,
flsa, flse, halfletter. Unfortunately, all sizes are <br>
currently only available in portrait orientation (not
landscape).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ps2eps uses an
already given %%BoundingBox from the source file, which
often corresponds to the size of the physical page format
for which the document was printed. <br>
However, you should be aware that this already specified
bounding box may be not correct, thus resulting in a wrongly
cropped (or even no usable) .eps-file. ps2eps can only do
<br>
as good as ghostscript does in rendering the original
postscript file (though ps2eps even works with negative and
fractional values are contained in the original bounding box
by <br>
using automatic translation). Therefore, if the given
bounding box is to small or incorrect anyway, you can ignore
the existing bounding box with the -B option, which will
cause <br>
ghostscript to use its internal default size (or use -s).
However, if the BoundingBox has negative coordinates, which
is not allowed by the specification, ps2eps will shift the
<br>
output to positive values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hint: to avoid rotating the
picture if you have the original drawing in landscape
format, you may use the &lsquo;&lsquo;Encapsulated
Postscript&rsquo;&rsquo; option in the printer driver which
should <br>
generate an EPS file (but with a bounding box of the sheet
size!). But some Windows printer drivers are drawing the
image with an offset from the bottom of the portrait page,
so <br>
that a part of it is drawn outside the landscape oriented
page. In this case, you&rsquo;ll have to specify a square
size of the page using the maximum length, e.g., 29.7cm x
29.7cm <br>
for an A4 page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIPPING <br>
or why gets some of my text deleted above the included .eps
file?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some postscript drivers draw a
white rectangle from the top left corner of the page to the
right lower corner of the object. This may erase some or
even all text above your <br>
imported/included EPS file, which is very annoying. In order
to prevent this, most programs have a clipping option for
imported .eps files (within LaTeX you can use include&acirc;
<br>
graphics*{}) for this purpose. If this is unfortunately not
the case, you can use the -C option of ps2eps which will
(hopefully) do it for you. Unfortunately, PScript.dll 5.2
<br>
(Windows XP) introduced new very badly behaving Postscript
code (initclip) which will even override the outer clipping!
Thus, a new filter had to be installed in ps2eps which <br>
will fix it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, because most programs
clip directly on the bounding box, you still may loose some
pixels of your image, because the bounding box is described
in the coarse resolution of <br>
postscript points, i.e. 72 dpi. In order to prevent this,
you can use the -l option or -C option (for the latter,
clipping by the importing program should be disabled then)
to <br>
allow for a 1 point larger bounding box. -C clips around a 1
point enlarged bounding box and -l enlarges the bounding box
values by 1 point (you can also combine both options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INCLUDED FILTERS <br>
Some postscript sequences, e.g., for using specific printer
features (featurebegin ...), are not working well within an
.eps file, so ps2eps tries to filter them out. But please
<br>
note that filters for postscript code may not work properly
for your printer driver (ps2eps was mainly tested with HP
and Adobe printer drivers, although it may work for all <br>
printers using the PScript.dll). In this case you can try to
turn of filtering by using option -n, or try to find the bad
sequence in the postscript code and adapt the filter <br>
rule in the ps2eps script (variables $linefilter,
$rangefilter_begin, $rangefilter_end; linefilter is an
expression for filtering single lines, rangefilter_... are
expressions <br>
that filter all lines between a pattern matching
$rangefilter_begin and $rangefilter_end; drop me an e-mail
with your modifications). However, things may change as the
printer <br>
drivers (e.g., PScript.dll) or postscript language
evolve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some applications or drivers
generate postscript code with leading or trailing binary
code, which often confuses older postscript interpreters.
ps2eps tries to remove such code, <br>
but it may sometimes make a wrong guess about start and end
of the real postscript code (drop me an e-mail with a zipped
postscript source, see section BUGS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comment lines or even blank
lines are removed (which is the default to make .eps files
smaller), which may corrupt your output. Please check the
next section how to fix this. <br>
ps2eps removes blank lines and also &lt;CR&gt; (carriage
ceturn&rsquo;&rsquo;) at the end of lines. However, nicely
formatted postscript &lsquo;&lsquo; code gives a hint by
using &lsquo;&lsquo;%%BeginBinary&rsquo;&rsquo;
&lsquo;&lsquo;%%End&acirc; <br>
Binary&rsquo;&rsquo; comments. When ps2eps detects these
comments it will refrain from any filtering action within
the marked binary sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps2eps filters also
%%Orientation: comments by default (you can use option -O to
turn off filtering), because ghostscript may
&lsquo;&lsquo;automagically&rsquo;&rsquo; rotate images when
generating PDF <br>
images, which is not desired in most cases. Hint: you can
turn off that feature in ghostscript unconditionally by
specifying -dAutoRotatePages=/None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORRUPTED OUTPUT <br>
Some postscript code may get corrupted when comment lines or
even blank lines are removed (which is the default to make
.eps files smaller), because those files may contain <br>
encoded images which also have a % as first character in a
line or use a special comment as end of image delimiter. If
this is the case, use the -c option to prevent filtering
<br>
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR AND MEMORY <br>
ps2eps supports colored postscript, consequently letting
ghostscript consume more resources for drawing its bitmap
(roughly 6MBytes for an A4 page). bbox is reading the bitmap
<br>
line by line so it consumes only minimal memory. If you
experience problems with memory consumption of ghostscript,
you may use the -m option for using a monochrome image. But
<br>
this will probably result in wrongly determined bounding
boxes with colored images, because ghostscript has to do
black/white dithering and may thus suppress objects drawn in
<br>
light colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another option in case of memory
problems and too long run times is to use the much more
memory efficient internal ghostscript bbox by using the -g
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
Please note that a command line option always takes
precedence over the related environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
PS2EPS_SIZE can be used to specify a default page size and
take any argument that --size accepts. Examples: export
PS2EPS_SIZE=a0 (bash-like syntax) or <br>
setenv PS2EPS_SIZE letter (csh syntax).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
PS2EPS_GSBBOX is set the internal bbox device of ghostscript
will be used instead of the external command bbox. Examples:
export PS2EPS_GSBBOX=true <br>
(bash-like syntax) or setenv PS2EPS_GSBBOX 1 (csh
syntax).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The usual call is simply: ps2eps -l file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A relatively failsafe call would
be (if your postscript is smaller than iso b0 [100cm x
141.4cm] and you have a fast computer with enough memory):
ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -c -n file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If output is not correct try:
ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -F file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
ps2eps was written by Roland Bless.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WHY? <br>
Other programs like ps2epsi do not calculate the bounding
box always correctly (because the values are put on the
postscript stack which may get corrupted by bad postscript
code) <br>
or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some part
of the image. ps2eps uses a double precision resolution of
144 dpi and appropriate rounding to get a proper bounding
<br>
box. The internal bbox device of ghostscript generates
different values (sometimes even incorrect), so using the
provided bbox should be more robust. However, because normal
<br>
clipping has only a resolution of 1/72dpi (postscript
point), the clipping process may still erase parts of your
EPS image. In this case please use the -l option to add an
addi&acirc; <br>
tional point of white space around the tight bounding
box.</p>
