<p>REPREPRO(1) REPREPRO REPREPRO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
reprepro - produce, manage and sync a local repository of
Debian packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
reprepro --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro [ options ] command [
per-command-arguments ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
reprepro is a tool to manage a repository of Debian packages
(.deb, .udeb, .dsc, ...). It stores files either being
injected manually or downloaded from some other repository
<br>
(partially) mirrored into a pool/ hierarchy. Managed
packages and checksums of files are stored in a Berkeley DB
database file, so no database server is needed. Checking
signa&acirc; <br>
tures of mirrored repositories and creating signatures of
the generated Package indices is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Former working title of this
program was mirrorer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GLOBAL OPTIONS <br>
Options can be specified before the command. Each affects a
different subset of commands and is ignored by other
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Displays a short list of options and commands with
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -V, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose. Can be applied multiple times. One
uppercase -V counts as five lowercase -v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--silent <br>
Be less verbose. Can be applied multiple times. One -v and
one -s cancel each other out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
This option is ignored, as it no longer exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --basedir basedir <br>
Sets the base-dir all other default directories are relative
to. If none is supplied and the REPREPRO_BASE_DIR
environment variable is not set either, the current
direc&acirc; <br>
tory will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--outdir outdir <br>
Sets the base-dir of the repository to manage, i.e. where
the pool/ subdirectory resides. And in which the dists/
directory is placed by default. If this starts with <br>
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default for this is
basedir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confdir confdir <br>
Sets the directory where the configuration is searched
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this starts with
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none is given, +b/conf (i.e.
basedir/conf) will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--distdir distdir <br>
Sets the directory to generate index files relatively to.
(i.e. things like Packages.gz, Sources.gz and
Release.gpg)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this starts with
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir, if starting
with &rsquo;+o/&rsquo; relative to outdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none is given, +o/dists (i.e.
outdir/dists) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: apt has dists hard-coded
in it, so this is mostly only useful for testing or when
your webserver pretends another directory structure than
your physical layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: Beware when changing
this forth and back between two values not ending in the
same directory. Reprepro only looks if files it wants are
there. If nothing of the <br>
content changed and there is a file it will not touch it,
assuming it is the one it wrote last time, assuming any
different --distdir ended in the same directory. So <br>
either clean a directory before setting --distdir to it or
do an export with the new one first to have a consistent
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logdir logdir <br>
The directory where files generated by the Log: directive
are stored if they have no absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this starts with
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir, if starting
with &rsquo;+o/&rsquo; relative to outdir, with
&rsquo;+c/&rsquo; relative to confdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none is given, +b/logs (i.e.
basedir/logs) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbdir dbdir <br>
Sets the directory where reprepro keeps its databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this starts with
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir, if starting
with &rsquo;+o/&rsquo; relative to outdir, with
&rsquo;+c/&rsquo; relative to confdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none is given, +b/db (i.e.
basedir/db) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: This is permanent data, no
cache. One has almost to regenerate the whole repository
when this is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--listdir listdir <br>
Sets the directory where downloads it downloads indices to
when importing from other repositories. This is temporary
data and can be safely deleted when not in an update <br>
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this starts with
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir, if starting
with &rsquo;+o/&rsquo; relative to outdir, with
&rsquo;+c/&rsquo; relative to confdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none is given, +b/lists (i.e.
basedir/lists) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--morguedir morguedir <br>
Files deleted from the pool are stored into morguedir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this starts with
&rsquo;+b/&rsquo;, it is relative to basedir, if starting
with &rsquo;+o/&rsquo; relative to outdir, with
&rsquo;+c/&rsquo; relative to confdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If none is given, deleted files
are just deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--methoddir methoddir <br>
Look in methoddir instead of /usr/lib/apt/methods for
methods to call when importing from other repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --component components <br>
Limit the specified command to this components only. This
will force added packages to this components, limit removing
packages from this components, only list packages <br>
in this components, and/or otherwise only look at packages
in this components, depending on the command in
question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple components are
specified by separating them with |, as in -C
&rsquo;main|contrib&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --architecture architectures
<br>
Limit the specified command to this architectures only.
(i.e. only list such packages, only remove packages from the
specified architectures, or otherwise only look <br>
at/act on this architectures depending on the specific
command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple architectures are
specified by separating them with |, as in -A
&rsquo;sparc|i386&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that architecture all
packages can be included to each architecture but are then
handled separately. Thus by using -A in a specific way one
can have different ver&acirc; <br>
sions of an architecture all package in different
architectures of the same distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --type dsc|deb|udeb <br>
Limit the specified command to this packagetypes only. (i.e.
only list such packages, only remove such packages, only
include such packages, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --section section <br>
Overrides the section of inclusions. (Also override possible
override files)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --priority priority <br>
Overrides the priority of inclusions. (Also override
possible override files)</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export=(never|changed|lookedat|force)
<br>
This option specify whether and how the high level actions
(e.g. install, update, pull, delete) should export the index
files of the distributions they work with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export=lookedat <br>
In this mode every distribution the action handled will be
exported, unless there was an error possibly corrupting it.
<br>
Note that only missing files and files whose intended
content changed between before and after the action will be
written. To get a guaranteed current export, use the <br>
export action. <br>
For backwards compatibility, lookedat is also available
under the old name normal. The name normal is deprecated and
will be removed in future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export=changed <br>
In this mode every distribution actually changed will be
exported, unless there was an error possibly corrupting it.
(i.e. if nothing changed, not even missing files will <br>
be created.) <br>
Note that only missing files and files whose intended
content changed between before and after the action will be
written. To get a guaranteed current export, use the <br>
export action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export=force <br>
Always export all distributions looked at, even if there was
some error possibly bringing it into a inconsistent
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export=never <br>
No index files are exported. You will have to call export
later. <br>
Note that you most likely additionally need the
--keepunreferencedfiles option, if you do not want some of
the files pointed to by the untouched index files to
vanish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore=what <br>
Ignore errors of type what. See the section ERROR IGNORING
for possible values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nolistsdownload <br>
When running update, checkupdate or predelete do not
download any Release or index files. This is hardly useful
except when you just run one of those command for the same
<br>
distributions. And even then reprepro is usually good in not
downloading except Release and Release.gpg files again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nothingiserror <br>
If nothing was done, return with exitcode 1 instead of the
usual 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;nothing was
done&quot; means the primary purpose of the action in
question. Auxillary actions (opening and closeing the
database, exporting missing files with <br>
--export=lookedat, ...) usually do not count. Also note that
this is not very well tested. If you find an action that
claims to have done something in some cases where <br>
you think it should not, please let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keeptemporaries <br>
Do not delete temporary .new files when exporting a
distribution fails. (reprepro first create .new files in the
dists directory and only if everything is generated, all
<br>
files are put into their final place at once. If this option
is not specified and something fails, all are deleted to
keep dists clean).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keepunreferencedfiles <br>
Do not delete files that are no longer used because the
package they are from is deleted/replaced with a newer
version from the last distribution it was in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keepunusednewfiles <br>
The include, includedsc, includedeb and processincoming by
default delete any file they added to the pool that is not
marked used at the end of the operation. While this <br>
keeps the pool clean and allows changing before trying to
add again, this needs copying and checksum calculation every
time one tries to add a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keepdirectories <br>
Do not try to rmdir parent directories after files or
directories have been removed from them. (Do this if your
directories have special permissions you want keep, do not
<br>
want to be pestered with warnings about errors to remove
them, or have a buggy rmdir call deleting non-empty
directories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ask-passphrase <br>
Ask for passphrases when signing things and one is needed.
This is a quick and dirty implementation using the obsolete
getpass(3) function with the description gpgme is <br>
supplying. So the prompt will look quite funny and support
for passphrases with more than 8 characters depend on your
libc. I suggest using gpg-agent or something like <br>
that instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noskipold <br>
When updating do not skip targets where no new index files
and no files marked as already processed are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you changed a script to
preprocess downloaded index files or changed a Listfilter,
you most likely want to call reprepro with --noskipold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--waitforlock count <br>
If there is a lockfile indicating another instance of
reprepro is currently using the database, retry count times
after waiting for 10 seconds each time. The default is 0
<br>
and means to error out instantly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spacecheck full|none <br>
The default is full: <br>
In the update commands, check for every to be downloaded
file which filesystem it is on and how much space is left.
<br>
To disable this behaviour, use none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dbsafetymargin bytes-count
<br>
If checking for free space, reserve byte-count bytes on the
filesystem containing the db/ directory. The default is
104857600 (i.e. 100MB), which is quite large. But as <br>
there is no way to know in advance how large the databases
will grow and libdb is extremely touchy in that regard,
lower only when you know what you do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--safetymargin bytes-count <br>
If checking for free space, reserve byte-count bytes on
filesystems not containing the db/ directory. The default is
1048576 (i.e. 1MB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--noguessgpgtty <br>
Don&rsquo;t set the environment variable GPG_TTY, even when
it is not set, stdin is terminal and /proc/self/fd/0 is a
readable symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gnupghome <br>
Set the GNUPGHOME evnironment variable to the given
directory as argument to this option. And your gpg will most
likely use the content of this variable instead of <br>
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;. Take a look at gpg(1) to be sure. This
option in the command line is usually not very useful, as it
is possible to set the environment variable directly. <br>
Its main reason for existance is that it can be used in
conf/options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gunzip gz-uncompressor <br>
While reprepro links against libz, it will look for the
program given with this option (or gunzip if not given) and
use that when uncompressing index files while
download&acirc; <br>
ing from remote repositories. (So that downloading and
uncompression can happen at the same time). If the program
is not found or is NONE (all-uppercase) then uncom&acirc;
<br>
pressing will always be done using the built in
uncompression method. The program has to accept the
compressed file as stdin and write the uncompressed file
into stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bunzip2 bz2-uncompressor <br>
When uncompressing downloaded index files or when not linked
against libbz2 reprepro will use this program to uncompress
.bz2 files. The default value is bunzip2. If the <br>
program is not found or is NONE (all-uppercase) then
uncompressing will always be done using the built in
uncompression method or not be possible when not linked
against <br>
libbz2. The program has to accept the compressed file as
stdin and write the uncompressed file into stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unlzma lzma-uncompressor <br>
When trying to uncompress or read lzma compressed files,
this program will be used. The default value is unlzma. If
the program is not found or is NONE (all-uppercase) <br>
then uncompressing lzma files will not be possible. The
program has to accept the compressed file as stdin and write
the uncompressed file into stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unxz xz-uncompressor <br>
When trying to uncompress or read xz compressed files, this
program will be used. The default value is unxz. If the
program is not found or is NONE (all-uppercase) then <br>
uncompressing xz files will not be possible. The program has
to accept the compressed file as stdin and write the
uncompressed file into stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lunzip lzip-uncompressor <br>
When trying to uncompress or read lzip compressed files,
this program will be used. The default value is lunzip. If
the program is not found or is NONE (all-uppercase) <br>
then uncompressing lz files will not be possible. The
program has to accept the compressed file as stdin and write
the uncompressed file into stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-max count <br>
Limits the output of list, listmatched and listfilter to the
first count results. The default is 0, which means
unlimited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-skip count <br>
Omitts the first count results from the output of list,
listmatched and listfilter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-format format <br>
Set the output format of list, listmatched and listfilter
commands. The format is similar to dpkg-query&rsquo;s
--showformat: fields are specified as ${fieldname} or
${field&acirc; <br>
name;length}. Zero length or no length means unlimited.
Positive numbers mean fill with spaces right, negative fill
with spaces left. , , are new-line, carriage-return,
tabulator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 and zero-byte. Backslash ( can
be used to escape every non-letter-or-digit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special field names
$identifier, $architecture, $component, $type, $codename
denote where the package was found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special field names $source
and $sourceversion denote the source and source version a
package belongs to. (i.e. ${$source} will either be the same
as ${source} <br>
(without a possible version in parentheses at the end) or
the same as ${package}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special field names
$basename, $filekey and $fullfilename denote the first
package file part of this entry (i.e. usually the .deb,
.udeb or .dsc file) as basename, as <br>
filekey (filename relative to the outdir) and the full
filename with outdir prepended (i.e. as relative or absolute
as your outdir (or basedir if you did not set outdir) <br>
is).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --list-format is not given
or NONE, then the default is equivalent to <br>
${$identifier} ${package} ${version}0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Escaping digits or letters not
in above list, using dollars not escaped outside specified
constructs, or any field names not listed as special and not
consisting entirely <br>
out of letters, digits and minus signs have undefined
behaviour and might change meaning without any further
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give this option on the
command line, don&rsquo;t forget that $ is also interpreted
by your shell. So you have to properly escape it. For
example by putting the whole <br>
argument to --list-format in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-percent <br>
When downloading packages, show each completed percent of
completed package downloads together with the size of
completely downloaded packages. (Repeating this option <br>
increases the frequency of this output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--onlysmalldeletes <br>
The pull and update commands will skip every distribution in
which one target loses more than 20% of its packages (and at
least 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this option (or putting it
in the options config file) can avoid removing large
quantities of data but means you might often give
--noonlysmalldeletes to override <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict src[=version|:type]
<br>
Restrict a pull or update to only act on packages belonging
to source-package src. Any other package will not be updated
(unless it matches a --restrict-bin). Only pack&acirc; <br>
ages that would otherwise be updated or are at least marked
with hold in a FilterList or FilerSrcList will be
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action can be restricted to
a source version using a equal sign or changed to another
type (see FilterList) using a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be given
multiple times to list multiple packages, but each package
may only be named once (even when there are different
versions or types).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict-binary
name[=version|:type] <br>
Like --restrict but restrict to binary packages (.deb and
.udeb). Source packages are not upgraded unless they appear
in a --restrict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict-file filename <br>
Like --restrict but read a whole file in the FilterSrcList
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict-file-bin filename
<br>
Like --restrict-bin but read a whole file in the FilterList
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--endhook hookscript</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run the specified hookscript
once reprepro exits. It will get the usual REPREPRO_*
environment variables set (or unset) and additionally a
variable REPREPRO_EXIT_CODE <br>
that is the exit code with which reprepro would have exited
(the hook is always called once the initial parsing of
global options and the command name is done, no matter <br>
if reprepro did anything or not). Reprepro will return to
the calling process with the exitcode of this script.
Reprepro has closed all its databases and removed all its
<br>
locks, so you can run reprepro again in this script (unless
someone else did so in the same repository before, of
course).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only advantage over running
that command always directly after reprepro is that you can
some environment variables set and cannot so easily forget
it if this option is <br>
in conf/options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script is supposed to be
located relative to confdir, unless its name starts with /,
./, +b/, +o/, or +c/ and the name may not start (except in
the cases given before) <br>
with a +.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example script looks like:
<br>
#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [
&quot;$REPREPRO_EXIT_CODE&quot; -ne 0 ] ; then <br>
exit &quot;$REPREPRO_EXIT_CODE&quot; <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo &quot;congratulations,
reprepro with arguments: $*&quot; <br>
echo &quot;seems to have run successfully. REPREPRO_ part of
the environment is:&quot; <br>
set | grep ^REPREPRO_</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--outhook hookscript <br>
hookscript is called with a .outlog file as argument
(located in logdir) containing a description of all changes
made to outdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script is supposed to be
located relative to confdir, unless its name starts with /,
./, +b/, +o/, or +c/ and the name may not start (except in
the cases given before) <br>
with a +.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a format of the .outlog
files generated for this script see the manual.html shiped
with reprepro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
export [ codenames ] <br>
Generate all index files for the specified
distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This regenerates all files
unconditionally. It is only useful if you want to be sure
dists is up to date, you called some other actions with
--export=never before or you <br>
want to create an initial empty but fully equipped
dists/codename directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ --delete ] createsymlinks [
codenames ] <br>
Creates suite symbolic links in the dists/-directory
pointing to the corresponding codename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will not create links, when
multiple of the given codenames would be linked from the
same suite name, or if the link already exists (though when
--delete is given it <br>
will delete already existing symlinks)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list codename [ packagename ]
<br>
List all packages (source and binary, except when -T or -A
is given) with the given name in all components (except when
-C is given) and architectures (except when -A is <br>
given) of the specified distribution. If no package name is
given, list everything. The format of the output can be
changed with --list-format. To only get parts of the <br>
result, use --list-max and --list-skip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listmatched codename glob <br>
as list, but does not list a single package, but all
packages matching the given shell-like glob. (i.e. *, ? and
[chars] are allowed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro -b . listmatched test2
&rsquo;linux-*&rsquo; lists all packages starting with
linux-.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listfilter codename condition
<br>
as list, but does not list a single package, but all
packages matching the given condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the formulas is
those of the dependency lines in Debian packages&rsquo;
control files with some extras. That means a formula
consists of names of fields with a <br>
possible condition for its content in parentheses. These
atoms can be combined with an exclamation mark
&rsquo;!&rsquo; (meaning not), a pipe symbol &rsquo;|&rsquo;
(meaning or) and a comma &rsquo;,&rsquo; <br>
(meaning and). Additionally parentheses can be used to
change binding (otherwise &rsquo;!&rsquo; binds more than
&rsquo;|&rsquo; than &rsquo;,&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values given in the search
expression are directly alphabetically compared to the
headers in the respective index file. That means that each
part Fieldname (cmp <br>
value) of the formula will be true for exactly those package
that have in the Package or Sources file a line starting
with fieldname and a value is alphabetically cmp to <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally since reprepro
3.11.0, &rsquo;%&rsquo; can be used as comparison operator,
denoting matching a name with shell like wildcard (with
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;?&rsquo; and
&rsquo;[..]&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special field names starting

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro -b . listfilter test2
&rsquo;Section (== admin)&rsquo; will list all packages in
distribution test2 with a Section field and the value of
that field being admin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro -b . -T deb listfilter
test2 &rsquo;Source (== blub) | ( !Source , Package (==
blub) )&rsquo; will find all .deb Packages with either a
Source field blub or no Source field <br>
and a Package field blub. (That means all package generated
by a source package blub, except those also specifying a
version number with its Source).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro -b . -T deb listfilter
test2 &rsquo;$Source (==blub) is the better way to do this
(but only available since 3.11.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro -b . listfilter test2
&rsquo;$PackageType (==deb), $Source (==blub) is another
(less efficient) way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprepro -b . listfilter test2
&rsquo;Package (% linux-*-2.6*)&rsquo; lists all packages
with names starting with linux- and later having an
-2.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls package-name <br>
List the versions of the the specified package in all
distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsbycomponent package-name <br>
Like ls, but group by component (and print component
names).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove codename package-names
<br>
Delete all packages in the specified distribution, that have
package name listed as argument. (i.e. remove all packages
list with the same arguments and options would <br>
list, except that an empty package list is not allowed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that like any other
operation removing or replacing a package, the old
package&rsquo;s files are unreferenced and thus may be
automatically deleted if this was their last <br>
reference and no --keepunreferencedfiles specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removematched codename glob <br>
Delete all packages listmatched with the same arguments
would list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removefilter codename condition
<br>
Delete all packages listfilter with the same arguments would
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removesrc codename source-name
[version] <br>
Remove all packages in distribution codename belonging to
source package source-name. (Limited to those with source
version version if specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If package tracking is
activated, it will use that information to find the
packages, otherwise it traverses all package indices for the
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removesrcs codename
source-name[=version] ... <br>
Like removesrc, but can be given multiple source names and
source versions must be specified by appending
&rsquo;=&rsquo; and the version to the name (without
spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">update [ codenames ] <br>
Sync the specified distributions (all if none given) as
specified in the config with their upstreams. See the
description of conf/updates below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkupdate [ codenames ] <br>
Same like update, but will show what it will change instead
of actually changing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpupdate [ codenames ] <br>
Same like checkupdate, but less suiteable for humans and
more suitable for computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">predelete [ codenames ] <br>
This will determine which packages a update would delete or
replace and remove those packages. This can be useful for
reducing space needed while upgrading, but there <br>
will be some time where packages are vanished from the lists
so clients will mark them as obsolete. Plus if you cannot
download a updated package in the (hopefully) fol&acirc;
<br>
lowing update run, you will end up with no package at all
instead of an old one. This will also blow up .diff files if
you are using the pdiff example or something simi&acirc;
<br>
lar. So be careful when using this option or better get some
more space so that update works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cleanlists <br>
Delete all files in listdir (default basedir/lists) that do
not belong to any update rule for any distribution. I.e. all
files are deleted in that directory that no <br>
update command in the current configuration can use. (The
files are usually left there, so if they are needed again
they do not need to be downloaded again. Though in <br>
many easy cases not even those files will be needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pull [ codenames ] <br>
pull in newer packages into the specified distributions (all
if none given) from other distributions in the same
repository. See the description of conf/pulls below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkpull [ codenames ] <br>
Same like pull, but will show what it will change instead of
actually changing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumppull [ codenames ] <br>
Same like checkpull, but less suiteable for humans and more
suitable for computers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">includedeb codename
.deb-filename <br>
Include the given binary Debian package (.deb) in the
specified distribution, applying override information and
guessing all values not given and guessable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">includeudeb codename
.udeb-filename <br>
Same like includedeb, but for .udeb files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">includedsc codename
.dsc-filename <br>
Include the given Debian source package (.dsc, including
other files like .orig.tar.gz, .tar.gz and/or .diff.gz) in
the specified distribution, applying override informa&acirc;
<br>
tion and guessing all values not given and guessable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that .dsc files do not
contain section or priority, but the Sources.gz file needs
them. reprepro tries to parse .diff and .tar files for it,
but is only able to <br>
resolve easy cases. If reprepro fails to extract those
automatically, you have to either specify a DscOverride or
give them via -S and -P</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include codename
.changes-filename <br>
Include in the specified distribution all packages found and
suitable in the .changes file, applying override information
guessing all values not given and guessable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">processincoming rulesetname
[.changes-file] <br>
Scan an incoming directory and process the .changes files
found there. If a filename is supplied, processing is
limited to that file. rulesetname identifies which rule-
<br>
set in conf/incoming determines which incoming directory to
use and in what distributions to allow packages into. See
the section about this file for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check [ codenames ] <br>
Check if all packages in the specified distributions have
all files needed properly registered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkpool [ fast ] <br>
Check if all files believed to be in the pool are actually
still there and have the known md5sum. When fast is
specified md5sum is not checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">collectnewchecksums <br>
Calculate all supported checksums for all files in the pool.
(Versions prior to 3.3 did only store md5sums, 3.3 added
sha1, 3.5 added sha256).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">translatelegacychecksums <br>
Remove the legacy files.db file after making sure all
information is also found in the new checksums.db file.
(Alternatively you can call collecnewchecksums and remove
<br>
the file on your own.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rereference <br>
Forget which files are needed and recollect this
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpreferences <br>
Print out which files are marked to be needed by whom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumpunreferenced <br>
Print a list of all filed believed to be in the pool, that
are not known to be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deleteunreferenced <br>
Remove all known files (and forget them) in the pool not
marked to be needed by anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deleteifunreferenced [ filekeys
] <br>
Remove the given files (and forget them) in the pool if they
are not marked to be used by anything. If no command line
arguments are given, stdin is read and every line <br>
treated as one filekey. This is mostly useful together with
--keepunreferenced in conf/options or in situations where
one does not want to run deleteunreferenced, which <br>
removes all files eligible to be deleted with this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reoverride [ codenames ] <br>
Reapply the override files to the given distributions (Or
only parts thereof given by -A,-C or -T).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: only the control
information is changed. Changing a section to a value, that
would cause another component to be guessed, will not cause
any warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redochecksums [ codenames ] <br>
Readd the information about file checksums to the package
indices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually the package&rsquo;s
control information is created at inclusion time or imported
from some remote source and not changed later. This command
modifies it to readd miss&acirc; <br>
ing checksum types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only checksums already known are
used. To update known checkums about files run
collectnewchecksums first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dumptracks [ codenames ] <br>
Print out all information about tracked source packages in
the given distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">retrack [ codenames ] <br>
Recreate a tracking database for the specified
distributions. This contains ouf of three steps. First all
files marked as part of a source package are set to unused.
<br>
Then all files actually used are marked as thus. Finally
tidytracks is called remove everything no longer needed with
the new information about used files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This behaviour, though a bit
longsome, keeps even files only kept because of tracking
mode keep and files not otherwise used but kept due to
includechanges or its rela&acirc; <br>
tives. Before version 3.0.0 such files were lost by running
retrack).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removealltracks [ codenames ]
<br>
Removes all source package tracking information for the
given distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">removetrack codename sourcename
version <br>
Remove the trackingdata of the given version of a given
sourcepackage from a given distribution. This also removes
the references for all used files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tidytracks [ codenames ] <br>
Check all source package tracking information for the given
distributions for files no longer to keep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy destination-codename
source-codename packages... <br>
Copy the given packages from one distribution to another.
The packages are copied verbatim, no override files are
consulted. Only components and architectures present in <br>
the source distribution are copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copysrc destination-codename
source-codename source-package [versions] <br>
look at each package (where package means, as usual, every
package be it dsc, deb or udeb) in the distribution
specified by source-codename and identifies the relevant
<br>
source package for each. All packages matching the specified
source-package name (and any version if specified) are
copied to the destination-codename distribution. The <br>
packages are copied verbatim, no override files are
consulted. Only components and architectures present in the
source distribution are copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copymatched destination-codename
source-codename glob <br>
Copy packages matching the given glob (see listmatched).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packages are copied
verbatim, no override files are consulted. Only components
and architectures present in the source distribution are
copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copyfilter destination-codename
source-codename formula <br>
Copy packages matching the given formula (see listfilter).
(all versions if no version is specified). The packages are
copied verbatim, no override files are consulted. <br>
Only components and architectures present in the source
distribution are copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restore codename snapshot
packages...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restoresrc codename snapshot
source-epackage [versions]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restorefilter
destination-codename snapshot formula <br>
Like the copy commands, but do not copy from another
distribution, but from a snapshot generated with
gensnapshot. Note that this blindly trusts the contents of
the files <br>
in your dists/ directory and does no checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clearvanished <br>
Remove all package databases that no longer appear in
conf/distributions. If --delete is specified, it will not
stop if there are still packages left. Even without <br>
--delete it will unreference files still marked as needed by
this target. (Use --keepunreferenced to not delete them if
that was the last reference.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not forget to remove all
exported package indices manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gensnapshot codename
directoryname <br>
Generate a snapshot of the distribution specified by
codename in the directory
dists/codename/snapshots/directoryname/ and reference all
needed files in the pool as needed <br>
by that. No Content files are generated and no export hooks
are run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there is currently no
automated way to remove that snapshot again (not even
clearvanished will unlock the referenced files after the
distribution itself van&acirc; <br>
ished). You will have to remove the directory yourself and
tell reprepro to _removereferences s=codename=directoryname
before deleteunreferenced will delete the files <br>
from the pool locked by this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To access such a snapshot with
apt, add something like the following to your sources.list
file: <br>
deb method://as/without/snapshot codename/snapshots/name
main</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rerunnotifiers [ codenames ]
<br>
Run all external scripts specified in the Log: options of
the specified distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">build-needing codename
architecture [ glob ] <br>
List source packages (matching glob) that likely need a
build on the given architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List all source package in the
given distribution without a binary package of the given
architecture built from that version of the source, without
a .changes or .log file <br>
for the given architecture, with an Architecture field
including any, os-any (with os being the part before the
hyphen in the architecture or linux if there is no hypen)
<br>
or the architecture and at least one package in the Binary
field not yet available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If instead of architecture the
term any is used, all architectures are iterated and the
architecture is printed as fourth field in every line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the architecture is all, then
only source packages with an Architecture field including
all are considered (i.e. as above with real architectures
but any does not suf&acirc; <br>
fice). Note that dpkg-dev &lt;&lt; 1.16.1 does not both set
any and all so source packages building both architecture
dependent and independent packages will never show up <br>
unless built with a new enough dpkg-source).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">translatefilelists <br>
Translate the file list cache within db/contents.cache.db
into the new format used since reprepro 3.0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure you have at least half
of the space of the current db/contents.cache.db file size
available in that partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flood distribution
[architecture] <br>
For each architecture of distribution (or for the one
specified) add architecture all packages from other
architectures (but the same component or packagetype) under
the <br>
following conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packages are only upgraded,
never downgraded. <br>
If there is a package not being architecture all, then
architecture all packages of the same source from the same
source version are preferred over those that have no <br>
such binary sibling. <br>
Otherwise the package with the highest version wins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can restrict with
architectures are looked for architecture all packages using
-A and which components/packagetypes are flooded by -C/-T as
usual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are mostly two use cases
for this command: If you added an new architecture to an
distribution and want to copy all architecture all packages
to it. Or if you <br>
included some architecture all packages only to some
architectures using -A to avoid breaking the other
architectures for which the binary packages were still
missing and <br>
now want to copy it to those architectures were they are
unlikely to break something (because a newbinary is already
available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unusedsources [distributions]
<br>
List all source packages for which no binary package build
from them is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sourcemissing [distributions]
<br>
List all binary packages for which no source package is
found (the source package must be in the same distribution,
but source packages only kept by package tracking is <br>
enough).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reportcruft [distributions] <br>
List all source package versions that either have a source
package and no longer a binary package or binary packages
left without source package in the index. (Unless <br>
sourcemissing also list packages where the source package in
only in the pool due to enabled tracking but no longer in
the index).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sizes [ codenames ] <br>
List the size of all packages in the distributions specified
or in all distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each row contains 4 numbers,
each being a number of bytes in a set of packages, which
are: The packages in this distribution (including anything
only kept because of <br>
tracking), the packages only in this distribution (anything
in this distribution and a snapshot of this distribution
counts as only in this distribution), the packages in <br>
this distribution and its snapshots, the packages only in
this distribution or its snapshots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one distribution is
selected, also list a sum of those (in which
&rsquo;Only&rsquo; means only in selected ones, and not only
only in one of the selected ones).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">repairdescriptions [ codenames ]
<br>
Look for binary packages only having a short description and
try to get the long description from the .deb file (and also
remove a possible Description-md5 in this case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal commands <br>
These are hopefully never needed, but allow manual
intervention. WARNING: Is is quite easy to get into an
inconsistent and/or unfixable state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_detect [ filekeys ] <br>
Look for the files, which filekey is given as argument or as
a line of the input (when run without arguments), and
calculate their md5sum and add them to the list of known
<br>
files. (Warning: this is a low level operation, no input
validation or normalization is done.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_forget [ filekeys ] <br>
Like _detect but remove the given filekey from the list of
known files. (Warning: this is a low level operation, no
input validation or normalization is done.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_listmd5sums <br>
Print a list of all known files and their md5sums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_listchecksums <br>
Print a list of all known files and their recorded
checksums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_addmd5sums <br>
alias for the newer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_addchecksums <br>
Add information of known files (without any check done) in
the strict format of _listchecksums output (i.e. don&rsquo;t
dare to use a single space anywhere more than needed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_dumpcontents identifier <br>
Printout all the stored information of the specified part of
the repository. (Or in other words, the content the
corresponding Packages or Sources file would get)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_addreference filekey identifier
<br>
Manually mark filekey to be needed by identifier</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_addreferences identifier [
filekeys ] <br>
Manually mark one or more filekeys to be needed by
identifier. If no command line arguments are given, stdin is
read and every line treated as one filekey.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_removereferences identifier
<br>
Remove all references what is needed by identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__extractcontrol .deb-filename
<br>
Look what reprepro believes to be the content of the control
file of the specified .deb-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__extractfilelist .deb-filename
<br>
Look what reprepro believes to be the list of files of the
specified .deb-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_fakeemptyfilelist filekey <br>
Insert an empty filelist for filekey. This is a evil hack
around broken .deb files that cannot be read by
reprepro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_addpackage codenam filename
packages... <br>
Add packages from the specified filename to part specified
by -C -A and -T of the specified distribution. Very strange
things can happen if you use it improperly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__dumpuncompressors <br>
List what compressions format can be uncompressed and
how.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__uncompress format
compressed-file uncompressed-file <br>
Use builtin or external uncompression to uncompress the
specified file of the specified format into the specified
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_listconfidentifiers identifier
[ distributions... ] <br>
Print - one per line - all identifiers of subdatabases as
derived from the configuration. If a list of distributions
is given, only identifiers of those are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_listdbidentifiers identifier [
distributions... ] <br>
Print - one per line - all identifiers of subdatabases in
the current database. This will be a subset of the ones
printed by _listconfidentifiers or most commands but <br>
clearvanished will refuse to run, and depending on the
database compatibility version, will include all those if
reprepro was run since the config was last changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILES <br>
reprepo uses three config files, which are searched in the
directory specified with --confdir or in the conf/
subdirectory of the basedir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file options exists, it is
parsed line by line. Each line can be the long name of a
command line option (without the --) plus an argument, where
possible. Those are han&acirc; <br>
dled as if they were command line options given before (and
thus lower priority than) any other command line option.
(and also lower priority than any environment variable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To allow command line options to
override options file options, most boolean options also
have a corresponding form starting with --no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(The only exception is when the
path to look for config files changes, the options file will
only opened once and of course before any options within the
options file are <br>
parsed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file distributions is always
needed and describes what distributions to manage, while
updates is only needed when syncing with external
repositories and pulls is only needed <br>
when syncing with repositories in the same reprepro
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last three are in the format
control files in Debian are in, i.e. paragraphs separated by
empty lines consisting of fields. Each field consists of a
fieldname, followed by a <br>
colon, possible whitespace and the data. A field ends with a
newline not followed by a space or tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines starting with # as first
character are ignored, while in other lines the # character
and everything after it till the newline character are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A paragraph can also consist of
only a single field &quot;!include:&quot; which causes the
named file (relative to confdir unless starting with ~/,
+b/, +c/ or / ) to be read as if it was <br>
found at this place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of the three files or a
file included as described above can also be a directory, in
which case all files it contains with a filename ending in
.conf and not starting with . <br>
are read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conf/distributions <br>
Codename <br>
This required field is the unique identifier of a
distribution and used as directory name within dists/ It is
also copied into the Release files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this name is not
supposed to change. You most likely never ever want a name
like testing or stable here (those are suite names and
supposed to point to another <br>
distribution later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suite This optional field is
simply copied into the Release files. In Debian it contains
names like stable, testing or unstable. To create symlinks
from the Suite to the Code&acirc; <br>
name, use the createsymlinks command of reprepro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FakeComponentPrefix <br>
If this field is present, its argument is added - separated
by a slash - before every Component written to the main
Release file (unless the component already starts with <br>
it), and removed from the end of the Codename and Suite
fields in that file. Also if a component starts with it, its
directory in the dists dir is shortened by this. <br>
So <br>
Codename: bla/updates <br>
Suite: foo/updates <br>
FakeComponentPrefix: updates <br>
Components: main bad <br>
will create a Release file with <br>
Codename: bla <br>
Suite: foo <br>
Components: updates/main updates/bad <br>
in it, but otherwise nothing is changed, while <br>
Codename: bla/updates <br>
Suite: foo/updates <br>
FakeComponentPrefix: updates <br>
Components: updates/main updates/bad <br>
will also create a Release file with <br>
Codename: bla <br>
Suite: foo <br>
Components: updates/main updates/bad <br>
but the packages will actually be in the components
updates/main and updates/bad, most likely causing the same
file using duplicate storage space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes the distribution look
more like Debian&rsquo;s security archive, thus work around
problems with apt&rsquo;s workarounds for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AlsoAcceptFor <br>
A list of distribution names. When a .changes file is told
to be included into this distribution with the include
command and the distribution header of that file is
nei&acirc; <br>
ther the codename, nor the suite name, nor any name from the
list, a wrongdistribution error is generated. The
process_incoming command will also use this field, see the
<br>
description of Allow and Default from the conf/incoming file
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version <br>
This optional field is simply copied into the Release
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Origin This optional field is
simply copied into the Release files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label This optional field is
simply copied into the Release files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NotAutomatic <br>
This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.
(The value is handled as an arbitrary string, though
anything but yes does not make much sense right now.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ButAutomaticUpgrades <br>
This optional field is simply copied into the Release files.
(The value is handled as an arbitrary string, though
anything but yes does not make much sense right now.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
This optional field is simply copied into the Release
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Architectures <br>
This required field lists the binary architectures within
this distribution and if it contains source (i.e. if there
is an item source in this line this Distribution has <br>
source. All other items specify things to be put after
&quot;binary-&quot; to form directory names and be checked
against &quot;Architecture:&quot; fields.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will also be copied into
the Release files. (With exception of the source item, which
will not occur in the topmost Release file whether it is
present here or not)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Components <br>
This required field lists the component of a distribution.
See GUESSING for rules which component packages are included
into by default. This will also be copied into the <br>
Release files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDebComponents <br>
Components with a debian-installer subhierarchy containing
.udebs. (E.g. simply &quot;main&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update When this field is
present, it describes which update rules are used for this
distribution. There also can be a magic rule minus
(&quot;-&quot;), see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pull When this field is present,
it describes which pull rules are used for this
distribution. Pull rules are like Update rules, but get
their stuff from other distributions <br>
and not from external sources. See the description for
conf/pulls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SignWith <br>
When this field is present, a Release.gpg file will be
generated. If the value is &quot;yes&quot; or
&quot;default&quot;, the default key of gpg is used. If the
field starts with an exlama&acirc; <br>
tion mark (&quot;!&quot;), the given script is executed to
do the signing. Otherwise the value will be given to
libgpgme to determine to key to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are problems with
signing, you can try <br>
gpg --list-secret-keys value <br>
to see how gpg could interprete the value. If that command
does not list any keys or multiple ones, try to find some
other value (like the keyid), that gpg can more eas&acirc;
<br>
ily associate with a unique key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this key has a passphrase,
you need to use gpg-agent or the insecure option
--ask-passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &rsquo;!&rsquo; hook script is
looked for in the confdir, unless it starts with ~/, ./,
+b/, +o/, +c/ or / . Is gets three command line arguments:
The filename to sign, an empty <br>
argument or the filename to create with an inline signature
(i.e. InRelease) and an empty argument or the filename to
create an detached signature (i.e. Release.gpg). The <br>
script may generate no Release.gpg file if it choses to
(then the repository will look like unsigned for older
clients), but generating empty files is not allowed.
Repre&acirc; <br>
pro waits for the script to finish and will abort the
exporting of the distribution this signing is part of unless
the scripts returns normally with exit code 0. Using a <br>
space after ! is recommended to avoid incompatibilities with
possible future extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DebOverride <br>
When this field is present, it describes the override file
used when including .deb files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDebOverride <br>
When this field is present, it describes the override file
used when including .udeb files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DscOverride <br>
When this field is present, it describes the override file
used when including .dsc files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DebIndices, UDebIndices,
DscIndices <br>
Choose what kind of Index files to export. The first part
describes what the Index file shall be called. The second
argument determines the name of a Release file to gen&acirc;
<br>
erate or not to generate if missing. Then at least one of
&quot;.&quot;, &quot;.gz&quot;, &quot;.xz&quot; or
&quot;.bz2&quot; specifying whether to generate uncompressed
output, gzipped output, bzip2ed output <br>
or any combination. (bzip2 is only available when compiled
with bzip2 support, so it might not be available when you
compiled it on your own, same for xz and liblzma). <br>
If an argument not starting with dot follows, it will be
executed after all index files are generated. (See the
examples for what argument this gets). The default is: <br>
DebIndices: Packages Release . .gz <br>
UDebIndices: Packages . .gz <br>
DscIndices: Sources Release .gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ExportOptions <br>
Options to modify how and if exporting is done: <br>
noexport Never export this distribution. That means there
will be no directory below dists/ generated and the
distribution is only useful to copy packages to other
dis&acirc; <br>
tributions. <br>
keepunknown Ignore unknown files and directories in the
exported directory. This is currently the only available
option and the default, but might change in the future, <br>
so it can already be requested explicitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contents <br>
Enable the creation of Contents files listing all the files
within the binary packages of a distribution. (Which is
quite slow, you have been warned).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In earlier versions, the first
argument was a rate at which to extract file lists. As this
did not work and was no longer easily possible after some
factorisation, this <br>
is no longer supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments of this field is a
space separated list of options. If there is a udebs
keyword, .udebs are also listed (in a file called
uContents-architecture.) If there <br>
is a nodebs keyword, .debs are not listed. (Only useful
together with udebs) If there is at least one of the
keywords ., .gz, .xz and/or .bz2, the Contents files are
<br>
written uncompressed, gzipped and/or bzip2ed instead of only
gzipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a percomponent then
one Contents-arch file per component is created. If there is
a allcomponents then one global Contents-arch file is
generated. If both are <br>
given, both are created. If none of both is specified then
percomponent is taken as default (earlier versions had other
defaults).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The switches compatsymlink or
nocompatsymlink (only possible if allcomponents was not
specified explicitly) control whether a compatibility
symlink is created so old ver&acirc; <br>
sions of apt-file looking for the component independent
filenames at least see the contents of the first
component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless allcomponents is given,
compatsymlinks currently is the default, but that will
change in some future (current estimate: after wheezy was
released)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ContentsArchitectures <br>
Limit generation of Contents files to the architectures
given. If this field is not there, all architectures are
processed. An empty field means no architectures are <br>
processed, thus not very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ContentsComponents <br>
Limit what components are processed for the Contents-arch
files to the components given. If this field is not there,
all components are processed. An empty field is <br>
equivalent to specify nodebs in the Contents field, while a
non-empty field overrides a nodebs there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ContentsUComponents <br>
Limit what components are processed for the uContents files
to the components given. If this field is not there and
there is the udebs keyword in the Contents field, all <br>
.udebs of all components are put in the uContents.arch
files. If this field is not there and there is no udebs
keyword in the Contents field, no uContents-arch files are
<br>
generated at all. A non-empty fields implies generation of
uContents-arch files (just like the udebs keyword in the
Contents field), while an empty one causes no uCon&acirc;
<br>
tents-arch files to be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uploaders <br>
Specifies a file (relative to confdir if not starting with
~/, +b/, +c/ or / ) to specify who is allowed to upload
packages. Without this there are no limits, and this <br>
file can be ignored via --ignore=uploaders. See the section
UPLOADERS FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tracking <br>
Enable the (experimental) tracking of source packages. The
argument list needs to contain exactly one of the following:
<br>
keep Keeps all files of a given source package, until that
is deleted explicitly via removetrack. This is currently the
only possibility to keep older packages around when <br>
all indices contain newer files. <br>
all Keep all files belonging to a given source package until
the last file of it is no longer used within that
distribution. <br>
minimal Remove files no longer included in the tracked
distribution. (Remove changes, logs and includebyhand files
once no file is in any part of the distribution). <br>
And any number of the following (or none): <br>
includechanges Add the .changes file to the tracked files of
a source package. Thus it is also put into the pool. <br>
includebyhand Add byhand and raw-* files to the tracked
files and thus in the pool. <br>
includelogs Add log files to the tracked files and thus in
the pool. (Not that putting log files in changes files is a
reprepro extension not found in normal changes <br>
files) <br>
embargoalls Not yet implemented. <br>
keepsources Even when using minimal mode, do not remove
source files until no file is needed any more. <br>
needsources Not yet implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log Specify a file to log
additions and removals of this distribution into and/or
external scripts to call when something is added or removed.
The rest of the Log: line is <br>
the filename, every following line (as usual, have to begin
with a single space) the name of a script to call. The name
of the script may be preceded with options of the <br>
form --type=(dsc|deb|udeb), --architecture=name or
--component=name to only call the script for some parts of
the distribution. An script with argument --changes is <br>
called when a .changes file was accepted by include or
processincoming (and with other arguments). Both type of
scripts can have a --via=command specified, in which case
<br>
it is only called when caused by reprepro command
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For information how it is called
and some examples take a look at manual.html in
reprepro&rsquo;s source or /usr/share/doc/reprepro/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the filename for the log
files does not start with a slash, it is relative to the
directory specified with --logdir, the scripts are relative
to --confdir unless start&acirc; <br>
ing with ~/, +b/, +c/ or /.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ValidFor <br>
If this field exists, an Valid-Until field is put into
generated Release files for this distribution with an date
as much in the future as the argument specifies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument has to be an number
followed by one of the units d, m or y, where d means days,
m means 31 days and y means 365 days. So ValidFor: 1m 11 d
causes the genera&acirc; <br>
tion of a Valid-Until: header in Release files that points
42 days into the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReadOnly <br>
Disallow all modifications of this distribution or its
directory in dists/codename (with the exception of snapshot
subdirectories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ByHandHooks <br>
This species hooks to call for handling byhand/raw files by
processincoming (and in future versions perhaps by
include).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line consists out of 4
arguments: A glob pattern for the section (clasically
byhand, though Ubuntu uses raw-*), a glob pattern for the
priority (not usually used), <br>
and a glob pattern for the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 4th argument is the script
to be called when all of the above match. It gets 5
arguments: the codename of the distribution, the section
(usually byhand), the priority <br>
(usually only -), the filename in the changes file and the
full filename (with processincoming in the secure
TempDir).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conf/updates <br>
Name The name of this update-upstream as it can be used in
the Update field in conf/distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method An URI as one could also
give it apt, e.g. http://ftp.debian.de/debian which is
simply given to the corresponding apt-get method. (So either
apt-get has to be installed, <br>
or you have to point with --methoddir to a place where such
methods are found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fallback <br>
(Still experimental:) A fallback URI, where all files are
tried that failed the first one. They are given to the same
method as the previous URI (e.g. both http://), and <br>
the fallback-server must have everything at the same place.
No recalculation is done, but single files are just retried
from this location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Config This can contain any
number of lines, each in the format apt-get --option would
expect. (Multiple lines &acirc; as always &acirc; marked
with leading spaces).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: Config:
Acquire::Http::Proxy=http://proxy.yours.org:8080</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From The name of another update
rule this rules derives from. The rule containing the From
may not contain Method, Fallback or Config. All other fields
are used from the rule <br>
referenced in From, unless found in this containing the
From. The rule referenced in From may itself contain a From.
Reprepro will only assume two remote index files are <br>
the same, if both get their Method information from the same
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suite The suite to update from.
If this is not present, the codename of the distribution
using this one is used. Also &quot;*/whatever&quot; is
replaced by &quot;&lt;codename&gt;/whatever&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Components <br>
The components to update. Each item can be either the name
of a component or a pair of a upstream component and a local
component separated with &quot;&gt;&quot;. (e.g.
&quot;main&gt;all con&acirc; <br>
trib&gt;all non-free&gt;notall&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this field is not there, all
components from the distribution to update are tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An empty field means no source
or .deb packages are updated by this rule, but only .udeb
packages, if there are any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rule might list components not
available in all distributions using this rule. In this case
unknown components are silently ignored. (Unless you start
reprepro with the <br>
--fast option, it will warn about components unusable in all
distributions using that rule. As exceptions, unusable
components called none are never warned about, for
com&acirc; <br>
patibility with versions prior to 3.0.0 where and empty
field had a different meaning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Architectures <br>
The architectures to update. If omitted all from the
distribution to update from. (As with components, you can
use &quot;&gt;&quot; to download from one architecture and
add into <br>
another one. (This only determine in which Package list they
land, it neither overwrites the Architecture line in its
description, nor the one in the filename determined <br>
from this one. In other words, it is no really useful
without additional filtering))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDebComponents <br>
Like Components but for the udebs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VerifyRelease <br>
Download the Release.gpg file and check if it is a signature
of the Releasefile with the key given here. (In the Format
as &quot;gpg --with-colons --list-key&quot; prints it, i.e.
<br>
the last 16 hex digits of the fingerprint) Multiple keys can
be specified by separating them with a &quot;|&quot; sign.
Then finding a signature from one of the will suffice. To
<br>
allow revoked or expired keys, add a &quot;!&quot; behind a
key. (but to accept such signatures, the appropriate
--ignore is also needed). To also allow subkeys of a
specified <br>
key, add a &quot;+&quot; behind a key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreRelease: yes <br>
If this is present, no InRelease or Release file will be
downloaded and thus the md5sums of the other index files
will not be checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GetInRelease: no <br>
IF this is present, no InRelease file is downloaded but only
Release (and Release.gpg ) are tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flat If this field is in an
update rule, it is supposed to be a flat repository, i.e. a
repository without a dists dir and no subdirectories for the
index files. (If the cor&acirc; <br>
responding sources.list line has the suite end with a slash,
then you might need this one.) The argument for the Flat:
field is the Component to put those packages into. <br>
No Components or UDebComponents fields are allowed in a flat
update rule. If the Architecture field has any &gt; items,
the part left of the &quot;&gt;&quot; is ignored. <br>
For example the sources.list line <br>
deb http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian etch-cran/
<br>
would translate to <br>
Name: R <br>
Method: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian <br>
Suite: etch-cran <br>
Flat: whatevercomponentyoudlikethepackagesin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IgnoreHashes <br>
This directive tells reprepro to not check the listed hashes
in the downloaded Release file (and only in the Release
file). Possible values are currently md5, sha1 and <br>
sha256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this does not speed
anything up in any measurable way. The only reason to
specify this if the Release file of the distribution you
want to mirror from uses a <br>
faulty algorithm implementation. Otherwise you will gain
nothing and only lose security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FilterFormula <br>
This can be a formula to specify which packages to accept
from this source. The format is misusing the parser intended
for Dependency lines. To get only architecture all <br>
packages use &quot;architecture (== all)&quot;, to get only
at least important packages use &quot;priority (==required)
| priority (==important)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the description of the
listfilter command for the semantics of formulas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FilterList, FilterSrcList <br>
These take at least two arguments: The first one is the
default action when something is not found in the list, then
a list of filenames (relative to --confdir, if not <br>
starting with ~/, +b/, +c/ or / ) in the format of dpkg
--get-selections and only packages listed in there as
install or that are already there and are listed with <br>
upgradeonly will be installed. Things listed as deinstall or
purge will be ignored. Packages having supersede will not be
installed but instead cause the removal of pack&acirc; <br>
ages with strictly smaller version (i.e. if a package would
be replaced by this package if this was install, it will be
removed instead and no new package being <br>
installed). Things listed with warning are also ignored, but
a warning message is printed to stderr. A package being hold
will not be upgraded but also not downgraded or <br>
removed by previous delete rules. To abort the whole
upgrade/pull if a package is available, use error. Instead
of a keyword you can also use &quot;= version&quot; which is
<br>
treated like install if the version matches and like no
entry if it does not match. Only one such entry per package
is currently supported and the version is currently <br>
compared as string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is both FilterList and
FilterSrcList then the first is used for .deb and .udeb and
the second for .dsc packages. If there is only FilterList
that is applied to <br>
everything. If there is only FilterSrcList that is applied
to everything, too, but the source package name (and source
version) is used to do the lookup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OmitExtraSourceOnly <br>
This field controls whether source packages with
Extra-Source-Only set are ignore when getting source
packages. Withouth this option or if it is true, those
source pack&acirc; <br>
ages are ignored, while if set to no or false, those source
packages are also condidates if no other filter excludes
them. (The default of true will likely change once <br>
reprepro supports multiple versions of a package or has
other means to keep the source packages around).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ListHook <br>
If this is given, it is executed for all downloaded index
files with the downloaded list as first and a filename that
will be used instead of this. (e.g. &quot;ListHook: <br>
/bin/cp&quot; works but does nothing.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file will be read multiple
times, it is processed multiple times, with the environment
variables REPREPRO_FILTER_CODENAME,
REPREPRO_FILTER_PACKAGETYPE, REPREPRO_FIL&acirc; <br>
TER_COMPONENT and REPREPRO_FILTER_ARCHITECTURE set to the
where this file will be added and REPREPRO_FILTER_PATTERN to
the name of the update rule causing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ListShellHook <br>
This is like ListHook, but the whole argument is given to
the shell as argument, and the input and output file are
stdin and stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i.e.: <br>
ListShellHook: cat <br>
works but does nothing but useless use of a shell and cat,
while <br>
ListShellHook: grep-dctrl -X -S apt -o -X -S dpkg || [ $?
-eq 1 ] <br>
will limit the update rule to packages from the specified
source packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DownloadListsAs <br>
The arguments of this field specify which index files
reprepro will download.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allowed values are ., .gz, .bz2,
.lzma, .xz, .lz, .diff, force.gz, force.bz2, force.lzma,
force.xz, force.lz, and force.diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reprepro will try the first
supported variant in the list given: Only compressions
compiled in or for which an uncompressor was found are used.
Unless the value starts <br>
with force., it is only tried if if is found in the Release
or InRelease file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value is .diff .xz
.lzma .bz2 .gz ., i.e. download Packages.diff if listed in
the Release file, otherwise or if not usable download .xz if
listed in the <br>
Release file and there is a way to uncompress it, then .lzma
if usable, then .bz2 if usable, then .gz and then
uncompressed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note there is no way to see if
an uncompressed variant of the file is available (as the
Release file always lists their checksums, even if not
there), so putting &rsquo;.&rsquo; any&acirc; <br>
where but as the last argument can mean trying to download a
file that does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Together with IgnoreRelease
reprepro will download the first in this list that could be
unpacked (i.e. force is always assumed) and the default
value is .gz .bzip2 . .lzma <br>
.xz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conf/pulls <br>
This file contains the rules for pulling packages from one
distribution to another. While this can also be done with
update rules using the file or copy method and using the
<br>
exported indices of that other distribution, this way is
faster. It also ensures the current files are used and no
copies are made. (This also leads to the limitation that
<br>
pulling from one component to another is not possible.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each rule consists out of the
following fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name The name of this pull rule
as it can be used in the Pull field in
conf/distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From The codename of the
distribution to pull packages from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Components <br>
The components of the distribution to get from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this field is not there, all
components from the distribution to update are tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A rule might list components not
available in all distributions using this rule. In this case
unknown components are silently ignored. (Unless you start
reprepro with the <br>
--fast option, it will warn about components unusable in all
distributions using that rule. As exception, unusable
components called none are never warned about, for
com&acirc; <br>
patibility with versions prior to 3.0.0 where and empty
field had a different meaning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Architectures <br>
The architectures to update. If omitted all from the
distribution to pull from. As in conf/updates, you can use
&quot;&gt;&quot; to download from one architecture and add
into <br>
another one. (And again, only useful with filtering to avoid
packages not architecture all to migrate).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UDebComponents <br>
Like Components but for the udebs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FilterFormula</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FilterList</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FilterSrcList <br>
The same as with update rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERRIDE FILES <br>
The format of override files used by reprepro should
resemble the extended ftp-archive format, to be specific it
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">packagename field name new
value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: <br>
kernel-image-2.4.31-yourorga Section protected/base <br>
kernel-image-2.4.31-yourorga Priority standard <br>
kernel-image-2.4.31-yourorga Maintainer That&rsquo;s me
&lt;me@localhost&gt; <br>
reprepro Priority required</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All fields of a given package
will be replaced by the new value specified in the override
file with the exception of special fields starting with a
dollar sign ($). While the <br>
field name is compared case-insensitive, it is copied in
exactly the form in the override file there. (Thus I suggest
to keep to the exact case it is normally found in index <br>
files in case some other tool confuses them.) More than
copied is the Section header (unless -S is supplied), which
is also used to guess the component (unless -C is
there).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some values like Package,
Filename, Size or MD5sum are forbidden, as their usage would
severly confuse reprepro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an extension reprepro also
supports patterns instead of packagenames. If the package
name contains &rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;[&rsquo; or
&rsquo;?&rsquo;, it is considered a pattern and applied to
each package <br>
that is not matched by any non-pattern override nor by any
previous pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fieldnames starting with a
dollar ($) are not be placed in the exported control data
but have special meaning. Unknown ones are loudly ignored.
Special fields are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Component: includedeb,
includedsc, include and processincoming will put the package
in the component given as value (unless itself overridden
with -C). Note that the proper <br>
way to specify the component is by setting the section field
and using this extension will most likely confuse people
and/or tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Delete: the value is treated a
fieldname and fields of that name are removed. (This way one
can remove fields previously added without removing and
readding the package. And <br>
fields already included in the package can be removed,
too).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conf/incoming <br>
Every chunk is a rule set for the process_incoming command.
Possible fields are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name The name of the rule-set,
used as argument to the scan command to specify to use this
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IncomingDir <br>
The Name of the directory to scan for .changes files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TempDir <br>
A directory where the files listed in the processed .changes
files are copied into before they are read. You can avoid
some copy operatations by placing this directory <br>
within the same moint point the pool hierarchy is (at least
partially) in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LogDir A directory where
.changes files, .log files and otherwise unused .byhand
files are stored upon procession.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allow Each argument is either a
pair name1&gt;name2 or simply name which is short for
name&gt;name. Each name2 must identify a distribution,
either by being Codename, a unique Suite, <br>
or a unique AlsoAcceptFor from conf/distributions. Each
upload has each item in its Distribution: header compared
first to last with each name1 in the rules and is put in
<br>
the first one accepting this package. e.g.: <br>
Allow: local unstable&gt;sid <br>
or <br>
Allow: stable&gt;security-updates stable&gt;proposed-updates
<br>
(Note that this makes only sense if Multiple is set to true
or if there are people only allowed to upload to
proposed-updates but not to security-updates).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default distribution <br>
Every upload not put into any other distribution because of
an Allow argument is put into distribution if that accepts
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple <br>
Old form of Options: multiple_distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
A list of options <br>
multiple_distributions <br>
Allow including a upload in multiple distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a .changes file lists
multiple distributions, then reprepro will start with the
first name given, check all Accept and Default options till
it finds a distribution this <br>
upload can go into.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this found no distribution or
if this option was given, reprepro will then do the same
with the second distribution name given in the .changes file
and so on. <br>
limit_arch_all <br>
If an upload contains binaries from some architecture and
architecture all packages, the architecture all packages are
only put into the architectures within this upload. <br>
Useful to combine with the flood command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permit A list of options to
allow things otherwise causing errors: <br>
unused_files <br>
Do not stop with error if there are files listed in the
.changes file if it lists files not belonging to any package
in it. <br>
older_version <br>
Ignore a package not added because there already is a
strictly newer version available instead of treating this as
an error. <br>
unlisted_binaries <br>
Do not abort with an error if a .changes file contains .deb
files that are not listed in the Binaries header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cleanup options <br>
A list of options to cause more files in the incoming
directory to be deleted: <br>
unused_files <br>
If there is unused_files in Permit then also delete those
files when the package is deleted after successful
processing. <br>
on_deny <br>
If a .changes file is denied processing because of missing
signatures or allowed distributions to be put in, delete it
and all the files it references. <br>
on_error <br>
If a .changes file causes errors while processing, delete it
and the files it references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that allowing cleanup in
publically accessible incoming queues allows a denial of
service by sending in .changes files deleting other peoples
files before they are <br>
completed. Especially when .changes files are handled
directly (e.g. by inoticoming).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MorgueDir <br>
If files are to be deleted by Cleanup, they are instead
moved to a subdirectory of the directory given as value to
this field. This directory has to be on the same
parti&acirc; <br>
tion as the incoming directory and files are moved (i.e.
owner and permission stay the same) and never copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPLOADERS FILES <br>
These files specified by the Uploaders header in the
distribution definition as explained above describe what key
a .changes file as to be signed with to be included in that
dis&acirc; <br>
tribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty lines and lines starting
with a hash are ignored, every other line must be of one of
the following nine forms or an include directive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow condition by anybody <br>
which allows everyone to upload packages matching
condition,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow condition by unsigned <br>
which allows everything matching that has no pgp/gpg
header,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow condition by any key <br>
which allows everything matching with any valid signature in
or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow condition by key key-id
<br>
which allows everything matching signed by this key-id (to
be specified without any spaces). If the key-id ends with a
+ (plus), a signature with a subkey of this primary <br>
key also suffices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key-id must be a suffix of the
id libgpgme uses to identify this key, i.e. a number of
hexdigits from the end of the fingerprint of the key, but no
more than what libgpgme <br>
uses. (The maximal number should be what gpg --list-key
--with-colons prints, as of the time of this writing that is
at most 16 hex-digits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allow condition by group
groupname <br>
which allows every member of group groupname. Groups can be
manipulated by</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group groupname add key-id <br>
to add a key-id (see above for details) to this group,
or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group groupname contains
groupname <br>
to add a whole group to a group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To avoid warnings in incomplete
config files there is also</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group groupname empty <br>
to declare a group has no members (avoids warnings that it
is used without those) and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group groupname unused <br>
to declare that a group is not yet used (avoid warnings that
it is not used).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A line starting with include
causes the rest of the line to be interpreted as filename,
which is opened and processed before the rest of the file is
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only conditions currently
supported are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* which means any package,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source &rsquo;name&rsquo; <br>
which means any package with source name. (&rsquo;*&rsquo;,
&rsquo;?&rsquo; and &rsquo;[..]&rsquo; are treated as in
shell wildcards).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sections
&rsquo;name&rsquo;(|&rsquo;name&rsquo;)* <br>
matches an upload in which each section matches one of the
names given. As upload conditions are checked very early,
this is the section listed in the .changes file, not <br>
the one from the override file. (But this might change in
the future, if you have the need for the one or the other
behavior, let me know).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sections contain
&rsquo;name&rsquo;(|&rsquo;name&rsquo;)* <br>
The same, but not all sections must be from the given set,
but at least one source or binary package needs to have one
of those given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binaries
&rsquo;name&rsquo;(|&rsquo;name&rsquo;)* <br>
matches an upload in which each binary (type deb or udeb)
matches one of the names given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binaries contain
&rsquo;name&rsquo;(|&rsquo;name&rsquo;)* <br>
again only at least one instead of all is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">architectures
&rsquo;architecture&rsquo;(|&rsquo;name&rsquo;)* <br>
matches an upload in which each package has only
architectures from the given set. source and all are treated
as unique architectures. Wildcards are not allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">architectures contain
&rsquo;architecture&rsquo;(|&rsquo;architecture&rsquo;)*
<br>
again only at least one instead of all is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byhand matches an upload with at
least one byhand file (i.e. a file with section byhand or
raw-something).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byhand
&rsquo;section&rsquo;(|&rsquo;section&rsquo;)* <br>
matches an upload with at least one byhand file and all
byhand files having a section listed in the list of given
section. (i.e. byhand
&rsquo;byhand&rsquo;|&rsquo;raw-*&rsquo; is currently is
<br>
the same as byhand).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distribution
&rsquo;codename&rsquo; <br>
which means any package when it is to be included in
codename. As the uploaders file is given by distribution,
this is only useful to reuse a complex uploaders file for
<br>
multiple distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Putting not in front of a
condition, inverses it&rsquo;s meaning. For example <br>
allow not source &rsquo;r*&rsquo; by anybody <br>
means anybody may upload packages which source name does not
start with an &rsquo;r&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple conditions can be
connected with and and or, with or binding stronger (but
both weaker than not). That means <br>
allow source &rsquo;r*&rsquo; and source &rsquo;*xxx&rsquo;
or source &rsquo;*o&rsquo; by anybody <br>
is equivalent to <br>
allow source &rsquo;r*xxx&rsquo; by anybody <br>
allow source &rsquo;r*o&rsquo; by anybody</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Other conditions will follow
once somebody tells me what restrictions are useful.
Currently planned is only something for architectures).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERROR IGNORING <br>
With --ignore on the command line or an ignore line in the
options file, the following type of errors can be
ignored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brokenold (hopefully never seen)
<br>
If there are errors parsing an installed version of package,
do not error out, but assume it is older than anything else,
has not files or no source name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brokensignatures <br>
If a .changes or .dsc file contains at least one invalid
signature and no valid signature (not even expired or from
an expired or revoked key), reprepro assumes the file <br>
got corrupted and refuses to use it unless this ignore
directive is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brokenversioncmp (hopefully
never seen) <br>
If comparing old and new version fails, assume the new one
is newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dscinbinnmu <br>
If a .changes file has an explicit Source version that is
different the to the version header of the file, than
reprepro assumes it is binary non maintainer upload (NMU).
<br>
In that case, source files are not permitted in .changes
files processed by include or processincoming. Adding
--ignore=dscinbinnmu allows it for the include command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emptyfilenamepart (insecure)
<br>
Allow strings to be empty that are used to construct
filenames. (like versions, architectures, ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extension <br>
Allow to includedeb files that do not end with .deb, to
includedsc files not ending in .dsc and to include files not
ending in .changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forbiddenchar (insecure) <br>
Do not insist on Debian policy for package and source names
and versions. Thus allowing all 7-bit characters but slashes
(as they would break the file storage) and things <br>
syntactically active (spaces, underscores in filenames in
.changes files, opening parentheses in source names of
binary packages). To allow some 8-bit chars additionally,
<br>
use 8bit additionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8bit (more insecure) <br>
Allow 8-bit characters not looking like overlong UTF-8
sequences in filenames and things used as parts of
filenames. Though it hopefully rejects overlong UTF-8
sequences, <br>
there might be other characters your filesystem confuses
with special characters, thus creating filenames possibly
equivalent to /mirror/pool/main/../../../etc/shadow <br>
(Which should be safe, as you do not run reprepro as root,
do you?) or simply overwriting your conf/distributions file
adding some commands in there. So do not use this <br>
if you are paranoid, unless you are paranoid enough to have
checked the code of your libs, kernel and filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignore (for forward
compatibility) <br>
Ignore unknown ignore types given to --ignore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flatandnonflat (only supresses a
warning) <br>
Do not warn about a flat and a non-flat distribution from
the same source with the same name when updating. (Hopefully
never ever needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">malformedchunk (I hope you know
what you do) <br>
Do not stop when finding a line not starting with a space
but no colon(:) in it. These are otherwise rejected as they
have no defined meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missingfield (safe to ignore)
<br>
Ignore missing fields in a .changes file that are only
checked but not processed. Those include: Format, Date,
Urgency, Maintainer, Description, Changes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missingfile (might be insecure)
<br>
When including a .dsc file from a .changes file, try to get
files needed but not listed in the .changes file (e.g. when
someone forgot to specify -sa to dpkg-buildpackage) <br>
from the directory the .changes file is in instead of
erroring out. (--delete will not work with those files,
though.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spaceonlyline (I hope you know
what you do) <br>
Allow lines containing only (but non-zero) spaces. As these
do not separate chunks as thus will cause reprepro to behave
unexpected, they cause error messages by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">surprisingarch <br>
Do not reject a .changes file containing files for a
architecture not listed in the Architecture-header within
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">surprisingbinary <br>
Do not reject a .changes file containing .deb files
containing packages whose name is not listed in the
&quot;Binary:&quot; header of that changes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefinedtarget (hope you are
not using the wrong db directory) <br>
Do not stop when the packages.db file contains databases for
codename/packagetype/component/architectures combinations
that are not listed in your distributions file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows you to temporarily
remove some distribution from the config files, without
having to remove the packages in it with the clearvanished
command. You might even <br>
temporarily remove single architectures or components,
though that might cause inconsistencies in some
situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefinedtracking (hope you are
not using the wrong db directory) <br>
Do not stop when the tracking file contains databases for
distributions that are not listed in your distributions
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows you to temporarily
remove some distribution from the config files, without
having to remove the packages in it with the clearvanished
command. You might even <br>
temporarily disable tracking in some distribution, but that
is likely to cause inconsistencies in there, if you do not
know, what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknownfield (for forward
compatibility) <br>
Ignore unknown fields in the config files, instead of
refusing to run then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unusedarch (safe to ignore) <br>
No longer reject a .changes file containing no files for any
of the architectures listed in the Architecture-header
within it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unusedoption <br>
Do not complain about command line options not used by the
specified action (like --architecture).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uploaders <br>
The include command will accept packages that would
otherwise been rejected by the uploaders file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrongarchitecture (safe to
ignore) <br>
Do not warn about wrong &quot;Architecture:&quot; lines in
downloaded Packages files. (Note that wrong Architectures
are always ignored when getting stuff from flat repostories
or <br>
importing stuff from one architecture to another).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrongdistribution (safe to
ignore) <br>
Do not error out if a .changes file is to be placed in a
distribution not listed in that files&rsquo; Distributions:
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrongsourceversion <br>
Do not reject a .changes file containing .deb files with a
different opinion on what the version of the source package
is. <br>
(Note: reprepro only compares literally here, not by
meaning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrongversion <br>
Do not reject a .changes file containing .dsc files with a
different version. <br>
(Note: reprepro only compares literally here, not by
meaning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expiredkey (I hope you know what
you do) <br>
Accept signatures with expired keys. (Only if the expired
key is explicitly requested).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expiredsignature (I hope you
know what you do) <br>
Accept expired signatures with expired keys. (Only if the
key is explicitly requested).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revokedkey (I hope you know what
you do) <br>
Accept signatures with revoked keys. (Only if the revoked
key is explicitly requested).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GUESSING <br>
When including a binary or source package without explicitly
declaring a component with -C it will take the first
component with the name of the section, being prefix to the
sec&acirc; <br>
tion, being suffix to the section or having the section as
prefix or any. (In this order)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus having specified the
components: &quot;main non-free contrib non-US/main
non-US/non-free non-US/contrib&quot; should map e.g.
&quot;non-US&quot; to &quot;non-US/main&quot; and
&quot;contrib/editors&quot; to &quot;con&acirc; <br>
trib&quot;, while having only &quot;main non-free and
contrib&quot; as components should map
&quot;non-US/contrib&quot; to &quot;contrib&quot; and
&quot;non-US&quot; to &quot;main&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Always specify main as the
first component, if you want things to end up there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: unlike in dak, non-US and
non-us are different things...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOMENCLATURE <br>
Codename the primary identifier of a given distribution.
This are normally things like sarge, etch or sid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basename <br>
the name of a file without any directory information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byhand Changes files can have
files with section &rsquo;byhand&rsquo; (Debian) or
&rsquo;raw-&rsquo; (Ubuntu). Those files are not packages
but other data generated (usually together with packages)
and <br>
then uploaded together with this changes files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With reprepro those can be
stored in the pool next to their packages whith tracking,
put in some log directory when using processincoming, or
given to an hook script (cur&acirc; <br>
rently only possible with processincoming).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filekey <br>
the position relative to the outdir. (as found in
&quot;Filename:&quot; in Packages.gz)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">full filename <br>
the position relative to /</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">architecture <br>
The term like sparc, i386, mips, ... . To refer to the
source packages, source is sometimes also treated as
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">component <br>
Things like main, non-free and contrib (by policy and some
other programs also called section, reprepro follows the
naming scheme of apt here.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">section <br>
Things like base, interpreters, oldlibs and non-free/math
(by policy and some other programs also called
subsections).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">md5sum The checksum of a file in
the format &quot;&lt;md5sum of file&gt; &lt;length of
file&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some note on updates <br>
A version is not overwritten with the same version. <br>
reprepro will never update a package with a version it
already has. This would be equivalent to rebuilding the
whole database with every single upgrade. To force the new
same <br>
version in, remove it and then update. (If files of the
packages changed without changing their name, make sure the
file is no longer remembered by reprepro. Without
--keepun&acirc; <br>
referencedfiled and without errors while deleting it should
already be forgotten, otherwise a deleteunreferenced or even
some __forget might help.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The magic delete rule
(&quot;-&quot;). <br>
A minus as a single word in the Update: line of a
distribution marks everything to be deleted. The mark causes
later rules to get packages even if they have (strict) lower
ver&acirc; <br>
sions. The mark will get removed if a later rule sets the
package on hold (hold is not yet implemented, in case you
might wonder) or would get a package with the same version
<br>
(Which it will not, see above). If the mark is still there
at the end of the processing, the package will get
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus the line &quot;Update: -
rules &quot; will cause all packages to be exactly the
highest Version found in rules. The line &quot;Update: near
- rules &quot; will do the same, except if it needs <br>
to download packages, it might download it from near except
when too confused. (It will get too confused e.g. when near
or rules have multiple versions of the package and the <br>
highest in near is not the first one in rules, as it never
remember more than one possible spring for a package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: This rule applies to
all type/component/architecture triplets of a distribution,
not only those some other update rule applies to. (That
means it will delete everything <br>
in those!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
Environment variables are always overwritten by command line
options, but overwrite options set in the options file.
(Even when the options file is obviously parsed after the
<br>
environment variables as the environment may determine the
place of the options file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_BASE_DIR <br>
The directory in this variable is used instead of the
current directory, if no -b or --basedir options are
supplied. <br>
It is also set in all hook scripts called by reprepro
(relative to the current directory or absolute, depending on
how reprepro got it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_CONFIG_DIR <br>
The directory in this variable is used when no --confdir is
supplied. <br>
It is also set in all hook scripts called by reprepro
(relative to the current directory or absolute, depending on
how reprepro got it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_OUT_DIR <br>
This is not used, but only set in hook scripts called by
reprepro to the directory in which the pool subdirectory
resides (relative to the current directory or absolute, <br>
depending on how reprepro got it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_DIST_DIR <br>
This is not used, but only set in hook scripts called by
reprepro to the dists directory (relative to the current
directory or absolute, depending on how reprepro got
it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_LOG_DIR <br>
This is not used, but only set in hook scripts called by
reprepro to the value setable by --logdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_CAUSING_COMMAND</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_CAUSING_FILE <br>
Those two environment variable are set (or unset) in Log:
and ByHandHooks: scripts and hint what command and what file
caused the hook to be called (if there is some).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_CAUSING_RULE <br>
This environment variable is set (or unset) in Log: scripts
and hint what update or pull rule caused this change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_FROM <br>
This environment variable is set (or unset) in Log: scripts
and denotes what other distribution a package is copied from
(with pull and copy commands).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_FILTER_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_FILTER_CODENAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_FILTER_PACKAGETYPE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPREPRO_FILTER_PATTERN <br>
Set in FilterList: and FilterSrcList: scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUPGHOME <br>
Not used by reprepro directly. But reprepro uses libgpgme,
which calls gpg for signing and verification of signatures.
And your gpg will most likely use the content of <br>
this variable instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;. Take a look
at gpg(1) to be sure. You can also tell reprepro to set this
with the --gnupghome option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPG_TTY <br>
When there is a gpg-agent running that does not have the
passphrase cached yet, gpg will most likely try to start
some pinentry program to get it. If that is pinen&acirc;
<br>
try-curses, that is likely to fail without this variable,
because it cannot find a terminal to ask on. In this cases
you might set this variable to something like the <br>
value of $(tty) or $SSH_TTY or anything else denoting a
usable terminal. (You might also want to make sure you
actually have a terminal available. With ssh you might need
<br>
the -t option to get a terminal even when telling gpg to
start a specific command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, reprepro will set
this variable to what the symbolic link /proc/self/fd/0
points to, if stdin is a terminal, unless you told with
--noguessgpgtty to not do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Increased verbosity always shows those things one does not
want to know. (Though this might be inevitable and a
corollary to Murphy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reprepro uses berkeley db, which
was a big mistake. The most annoying problem not yet worked
around is database corruption when the disk runs out of
space. (Luckily if it hap&acirc; <br>
pens while downloading packages while updating, only the
files database is affected, which is easy (though time
consuming) to rebuild, see recovery file in the
documentation). <br>
Ideally put the database on another partition to avoid
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the source part is mostly
considered as the architecture source some parts may still
not use this notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORK-AROUNDS TO COMMON PROBLEMS
<br>
gpgme returned an impossible condition <br>
With the woody version this normally meant that there was no
.gnupg directory in $HOME, but it created one and reprepro
succeeds when called again with the same command. <br>
Since sarge the problem sometimes shows up, too. But it is
no longer reproducible and it does not fix itself, neither.
Try running gpg --verify file-you-had-problems-with <br>
manually as the user reprepro is running and with the same
$HOME. This alone might fix the problem. It should not print
any messages except perhaps <br>
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found. <br>
gpg: the signature could not be verified. <br>
if it was an unsigned file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">not including .orig.tar.gz when
a .changes file&rsquo;s version does not end in -0 or -1
<br>
If dpkg-buildpackage is run without the -sa option to build
a version with a Debian revision not being -0 or -1, it does
not list the .orig.tar.gz file in the .changes <br>
file. If you want to include such a file with reprepro when
the .orig.tar.gz file does not already exist in the pool,
reprepro will report an error. This can be worked <br>
around by: <br>
call dpkg-buildpackage with -sa (recommended) <br>
copy the .orig.tar.gz file to the proper place in the pool
before <br>
call reprepro with --ignore=missingfile (discouraged)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leftover files in the pool
directory. <br>
reprepro is sometimes a bit too timid of deleting stuff.
When things go wrong and there have been errors it sometimes
just leaves everything where it is. To see what <br>
files reprepro remembers to be in your pool directory but
does not know anything needing them right know, you can use
<br>
reprepro dumpunreferenced <br>
To delete them: <br>
reprepro deleteunreferenced</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERRUPTING <br>
Interrupting reprepro has its problems. Some things (like
speaking with apt methods, database stuff) can cause
problems when interrupted at the wrong time. Then there are
<br>
design problems of the code making it hard to distinguish if
the current state is dangerous or non-dangerous to
interrupt. Thus if reprepro receives a signal normally sent
to <br>
tell a process to terminate itself softly, it continues its
operation, but does not start any new operations. (I.e. it
will not tell the apt-methods any new file to download, it
<br>
will not replace a package in a target, unless it already
had started with it, it will not delete any files gotten
dereferenced, and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It only catches the first signal
of each type. The second signal of a given type will
terminate reprepro. You will risk database corruption and
have to remove the lockfile manu&acirc; <br>
ally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that even normal
interruption leads to code-paths mostly untested and thus
expose a multitude of bugs including those leading to data
corruption. Better think a second <br>
more before issuing a command than risking the need for
interruption.</p>
