Dislocate - disconnect and reconnect processes

<b>dislocate</b> [ <i>program args...</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
<b>Dislocate</b> allows processes to be disconnected and reconnected to the
  terminal. Possible uses:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You can disconnect a process from a terminal at work and
      reconnect from home, to continue working.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">After having your line be dropped due to noise, you can get
      back to your process without having to restart it from scratch.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you have a problem that you would like to show someone,
      you can set up the scenario at your own terminal, disconnect, walk down
      the hall, and reconnect on another terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you are in the middle of a great game (or whatever) that
      does not allow you to save, and someone else kicks you off the terminal,
      you can disconnect, and reconnect later.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
When run with no arguments, <b>Dislocate</b> tells you about your disconnected
  processes and lets you reconnect to one. Otherwise, <b>Dislocate</b> runs the
  named program along with any arguments.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, ^] is an escape that lets you talk to <b>Dislocate</b> itself. At
  that point, you can disconnect (by pressing ^D) or suspend <b>Dislocate</b>
  (by pressing ^Z).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any Tcl or Expect command is also acceptable at this point. For example, to
  insert the contents of a the file /etc/motd as if you had typed it, say:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     send -i $out [exec cat /etc/motd]
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To send the numbers 1 to 100 in response to the prompt &quot;next #&quot;, say:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
     for {set i 0} {$i&lt;100} {incr i} {
         expect -i $in &quot;next #&quot;
         send -i $out &quot;$i\r&quot;
     }
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Scripts can also be prepared and sourced in so that you don't have to type them
  on the spot.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Dislocate</b> is actually just a simple <b>Expect</b> script. Feel free to
  make it do what you want it to do or just use <b>Expect</b> directly, without
  going through <b>Dislocate</b>. <b>Dislocate</b> understands a few special
  arguments. These should appear before any program name. Each should be
  separated by whitespace. If the arguments themselves takes arguments, these
  should also be separated by whitespace.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-escape</b> flag sets the escape to whatever follows. The default escape
  is ^].

This program was written by the author as an exercise to show that communicating
  with disconnected processes is easy. There are many features that could be
  added, but that is not the intent of this program.
