<p>PBMTOJBG(1) General Commands Manual PBMTOJBG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbmtojbg - portable bitmap to JBIG1 file converter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pbmtojbg [ options ] [ input-file | - [ output-file ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads in a portable bitmap (PBM) from a file or standard
input, compresses it, and outputs the image as a JBIG1
bi-level image entity (BIE) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JBIG1 is a highly effective
lossless compression algorithm for bi-level images (one bit
per pixel), which is particularly suitable for scanned
document pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A JBIG1 encoded image can be
stored in several resolutions (progressive mode). These
resolution layers can be stored all in one single BIE or
they can be stored in several sepa&acirc; <br>
rate BIE files. All resolution layers except the lowest one
are stored merely as differences to the next lower
resolution layer, because this requires less space than
encoding <br>
the full image completely every time. Each resolution layer
has twice the number of horizontal and vertical pixels than
the next lower layer. JBIG1 files can also store several
<br>
bits per pixel as separate bitmap planes, and pbmtojbg can
read a PGM file and transform it into a multi-bitplane
BIE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
- A single hyphen instead of an input file name will cause
pbmtojbg to read the data from standard input instead from a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Encode the image in one
single resolution layer (sequential mode). This is usually
the most efficient compression method. By default, the
number of resolution lay&acirc; <br>
ers is chosen automatically such that the lowest layer image
is not larger than 640 &Atilde; 480 pixels. This is a
shortcut for -d 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x number Specify the maximal
horizontal size of the lowest resolution layer. The default
is 640 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y number Specify the maximal
vertical size of the lowest resolution layer. The default is
480 pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l number Select the lowest
resolution layer that will be written to the BIE. It is
possible to store the various resolution layers of a JBIG1
image in progressive mode into <br>
different BIEs. Options -l and -h allow to select the
resolution-layer interval that will appear in the created
BIE. The lowest resolution layer has number 0 and <br>
this is also the default value. By default all layers will
be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h number Select the highest
resolution layer that will be written to the BIE. By default
all layers will be written. See also option -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Use binary values instead of
Gray code words in order to encode pixel values in multiple
bitplanes. This option has only an effect if the input is a
PGM file and if <br>
more than one bitplane is produced. Note that the decoder
has to make the same selection but cannot determine from the
BIE, whether Gray or binary code words were <br>
used by the encoder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d number Specify the total
number of differential resolution layers into which the
input image will be split in addition to the lowest layer.
Each additional layer reduces <br>
the size of layer 0 by 50 %. This option overrides options
-x and -y which are usually a more comfortable way of
selecting the number of resolution layers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s number The JBIG1 algorithm
splits each image into a number of horizontal stripes. This
option specifies that each stripe shall have number lines in
layer 0. The default <br>
value is selected so that approximately 35 stripes will be
used for the whole image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m number Select the maximum
horizontal offset of the adaptive template pixel. The JBIG1
encoder uses ten neighbour pixels to estimate the
probability of the next pixel <br>
being black or white. It can move one out of these ten
pixels. This is especially useful for dithered images, as
long as the distance of this adaptive pixel can be <br>
adjusted to the period of the dither pattern. By default,
the adaptive template pixel is allowed to move up to 8
pixels away horizontally. This encoder supports <br>
distances up to 127 pixels. Annex A of the standard suggests
that decoders should support at least a horizontal distance
of 16 pixels, so using values not higher <br>
than 16 for number might increase the chances of
interoperability with other JBIG1 implementations. On the
other hand, the T.85 fax application profile requires <br>
decoders to support horizontal offsets up to 127 pixels,
which the maximum value permitted by the standard. (The
maximal vertical offset of the adaptive template <br>
pixel is always zero for this encoder.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t number Encode only the
specified number of most significant bit planes. This option
allows to reduce the depth of an input PGM file if not all
bits per pixel are needed in <br>
the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o number JBIG1 separates an
image into several horizontal stripes, resolution layers and
planes, were each plane contains one bit per pixel. One
single stripe in one plane <br>
and layer is encoded as a data unit called stripe data
entity (SDE) inside the BIE. There are 12 different possible
orders in which the SDEs can be stored inside <br>
the BIE and number selects which one shall be used. The
order of the SDEs is only relevant for applications that
want to decode a JBIG1 file which has not yet com&acirc;
<br>
pletely arrived from e.g. a slow network connection. For
instance some applications prefer that the outermost of the
three loops (stripes, layers, planes) is over <br>
all layers so that all data of the lowest resolution layer
is transmitted first. <br>
The following values for number select these loop
arrangements for writing the SDEs (outermost loop
first):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 planes, layers, stripes <br>
2 layers, planes, stripes <br>
3 layers, stripes, planes <br>
4 stripes, planes, layers <br>
5 planes, stripes, layers <br>
6 stripes, layers, planes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All loops count starting with
zero, however by adding 8 to the above order code, the layer
loop can be reversed so that it counts down to zero and then
higher reso&acirc; <br>
lution layers will be stored before lower layers. Default
order is 3 which writes at first all planes of the first
stripe and then completes layer 0 before contin&acirc; <br>
uing with the next layer and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p number This option allows to
activate or deactivate various optional algorithms defined
in the JBIG1 standard. Just add the numbers of the following
options which you want <br>
to activate in order to get the number value:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 deterministic prediction
(DPON) <br>
8 layer 0 typical prediction (TPBON) <br>
16 diff. layer typ. pred. (TPDON) <br>
64 layer 0 two-line template (LRLTWO)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except for special applications
(like communication with JBIG1 subset implementations) and
for debugging purposes you will normally not want to change
anything <br>
here. The default is 28, which provides the best compression
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C string Add the string in a
comment marker segment to the produced data stream. (There
is no support at present for adding comments that contain
the zero byte.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Determine the adaptive
template pixel movement as suggested in annex C of the
standard. By default the template change takes place
directly in the next line, which <br>
is most effective. However, a few conformance test examples
in the standard require the adaptive template change to be
delayed until the first line of the next <br>
stripe. This option selects this special behavior, which is
normally not required except in order to pass some
conformance tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Use the SDRST marker instead
of the normal SDNORM marker. The probably only useful
application of this option is to generate test data for
checking whether a JBIG1 <br>
decoder has implemented SDRST correctly. In a normal JBIG1
data stream, each stripe data entity (SDE) is terminated by
an SDNORM marker, which preserves the state <br>
of the arithmetic encoder (and more) for the next stripe in
the same layer. The alternative SDRST marker resets this
state at the end of the stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y number A long time ago, there
were fax machines that couldn&rsquo;t even hold a single
page in memory. They had to start transmitting data before
the page was scanned in com&acirc; <br>
pletely and the length of the image was known. The authors
of the standard added a rather ugly hack to the otherwise
beautiful JBIG1 format to support this. The <br>
NEWLEN marker segment can override the image height stated
in the BIE header anywhere later in the data stream.
Normally pbmtojbg never generates NEWLEN marker seg&acirc;
<br>
ments, as it knows the correct image height when it outputs
the header. This option is solely intended for the purpose
of generating test files with NEWLEN marker <br>
segments. It can be used to specify a higher initial image
height for use in the BIE header, and pbmtojbg will then add
a NEWLEN marker segment at the latest possi&acirc; <br>
ble opportunity to the data stream to signal the correct
final height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f This option makes the output
file comply to the &quot;facsimile application profile&quot;
defined in ITU-T Recommendation T.85. It is a shortcut for
-q -o 0 -p 8 -s 128 -t 1 <br>
-m 127.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v After the BIE has been
created, a few technical details of the created file will be
listed (verbose mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Using standard input and standard output for binary data
works only on systems where there is no difference between
binary and text streams (e.g., Unix). On other systems
(e.g., <br>
MS-DOS), using standard input or standard output may cause
control characters like CR or LF to be inserted or deleted
and this will damage the binary data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
This program implements the JBIG1 image coding algorithm as
specified in ISO/IEC 11544:1993 and ITU-T T.82(1993).</p>
