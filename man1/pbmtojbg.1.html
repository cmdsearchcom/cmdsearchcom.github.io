Reads in a portable bitmap (PBM) from a file or standard input, compresses it,
  and outputs the image as a <i>JBIG1</i> bi-level image entity (BIE) file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>JBIG1</i> is a highly effective lossless compression algorithm for bi-level
  images (one bit per pixel), which is particularly suitable for scanned
  document pages.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A <i>JBIG1</i> encoded image can be stored in several resolutions (progressive
  mode). These resolution layers can be stored all in one single BIE or they can
  be stored in several separate BIE files. All resolution layers except the
  lowest one are stored merely as differences to the next lower resolution
  layer, because this requires less space than encoding the full image
  completely every time. Each resolution layer has twice the number of
  horizontal and vertical pixels than the next lower layer. <i>JBIG1</i> files
  can also store several bits per pixel as separate bitmap planes, and
  <i>pbmtojbg</i> can read a PGM file and transform it into a multi-bitplane
  BIE.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Encode the image in one single resolution layer (sequential
      mode). This is usually the most efficient compression method. By default,
      the number of resolution layers is chosen automatically such that the
      lowest layer image is not larger than 640 &#x00D7; 480 pixels. This is a
      shortcut for <b>-d 0</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the lowest resolution layer that will be written to
      the BIE. It is possible to store the various resolution layers of a
      <i>JBIG1</i> image in progressive mode into different BIEs. Options
      <b>-l</b> and <b>-h</b> allow to select the resolution-layer interval that
      will appear in the created BIE. The lowest resolution layer has number 0
      and this is also the default value. By default all layers will be
    written.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Select the highest resolution layer that will be written to
      the BIE. By default all layers will be written. See also option
    <b>-l</b>.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use binary values instead of Gray code words in order to
      encode pixel values in multiple bitplanes. This option has only an effect
      if the input is a PGM file and if more than one bitplane is produced. Note
      that the decoder has to make the same selection but cannot determine from
      the BIE, whether Gray or binary code words were used by the encoder.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the total number of differential resolution layers
      into which the input image will be split in addition to the lowest layer.
      Each additional layer reduces the size of layer 0 by 50 %. This option
      overrides options <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> which are usually a more
      comfortable way of selecting the number of resolution layers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>JBIG1</i> algorithm splits each image into a number
      of horizontal stripes. This option specifies that each stripe shall have
      <i>number</i> lines in layer 0. The default value is selected so that
      approximately 35 stripes will be used for the whole image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the maximum horizontal offset of the adaptive
      template pixel. The <i>JBIG1</i> encoder uses ten neighbour pixels to
      estimate the probability of the next pixel being black or white. It can
      move one out of these ten pixels. This is especially useful for dithered
      images, as long as the distance of this adaptive pixel can be adjusted to
      the period of the dither pattern. By default, the adaptive template pixel
      is allowed to move up to 8 pixels away horizontally. This encoder supports
      distances up to 127 pixels. Annex A of the standard suggests that decoders
      should support at least a horizontal distance of 16 pixels, so using
      values not higher than 16 for <i>number</i> might increase the chances of
      interoperability with other <i>JBIG1</i> implementations. On the other
      hand, the T.85 fax application profile requires decoders to support
      horizontal offsets up to 127 pixels, which the maximum value permitted by
      the standard. (The maximal vertical offset of the adaptive template pixel
      is always zero for this encoder.)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Encode only the specified number of most significant bit
      planes. This option allows to reduce the depth of an input PGM file if not
      all bits per pixel are needed in the output.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>JBIG1</i> separates an image into several horizontal
      stripes, resolution layers and planes, were each plane contains one bit
      per pixel. One single stripe in one plane and layer is encoded as a data
      unit called stripe data entity (SDE) inside the BIE. There are 12
      different possible orders in which the SDEs can be stored inside the BIE
      and <i>number</i> selects which one shall be used. The order of the SDEs
      is only relevant for applications that want to decode a <i>JBIG1</i> file
      which has not yet completely arrived from e.g. a slow network connection.
      For instance some applications prefer that the outermost of the three
      loops (stripes, layers, planes) is over all layers so that all data of the
      lowest resolution layer is transmitted first.
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The following values for <i>number</i> select these loop arrangements for
      writing the SDEs (outermost loop first):
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     0 	planes, layers, stripes
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     2 	layers, planes, stripes
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     3 	layers, stripes, planes
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     4 	stripes, planes, layers
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     5 	planes, stripes, layers
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     6 	stripes, layers, planes
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    All loops count starting with zero, however by adding 8 to the above order
      code, the layer loop can be reversed so that it counts down to zero and
      then higher resolution layers will be stored before lower layers. Default
      order is 3 which writes at first all planes of the first stripe and then
      completes layer 0 before continuing with the next layer and so on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p</b><i> number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option allows to activate or deactivate various
      optional algorithms defined in the <i>JBIG1</i> standard. Just add the
      numbers of the following options which you want to activate in order to
      get the <i>number</i> value:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

     4 	deterministic prediction (DPON)
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>

     64 	layer 0 two-line template (LRLTWO)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Except for special applications (like communication with <i>JBIG1</i> subset
      implementations) and for debugging purposes you will normally not want to
      change anything here. The default is 28, which provides the best
      compression result.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Determine the adaptive template pixel movement as suggested

      change to be delayed until the first line of the next stripe. This option
      selects this special behavior, which is normally not required except in
      order to pass some conformance tests.</dd>

      The probably only useful application of this option is to generate test
      data for checking whether a <i>JBIG1</i> decoder has implemented SDRST
      correctly. In a normal <i>JBIG1</i> data stream, each stripe data entity
      (SDE) is terminated by an SDNORM marker, which preserves the state of the
      arithmetic encoder (and more) for the next stripe in the same layer. The
      alternative SDRST marker resets this state at the end of the stripe.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">A long time ago, there were fax machines that couldn't even
      hold a single page in memory. They had to start transmitting data before
      the page was scanned in completely and the length of the image was known.
      The authors of the standard added a rather ugly hack to the otherwise
      beautiful JBIG1 format to support this. The NEWLEN marker segment can
      override the image height stated in the BIE header anywhere later in the
      data stream. Normally <i>pbmtojbg</i> never generates NEWLEN marker
      segments, as it knows the correct image height when it outputs the header.
      This option is solely intended for the purpose of generating test files
      with NEWLEN marker segments. It can be used to specify a higher initial
      image height for use in the BIE header, and <i>pbmtojbg</i> will then add
      a NEWLEN marker segment at the latest possible opportunity to the data
      stream to signal the correct final height.</dd>

Using standard input and standard output for binary data works only on systems
  where there is no difference between binary and text streams (e.g., Unix). On
  other systems (e.g., MS-DOS), using standard input or standard output may
  cause control characters like CR or LF to be inserted or deleted and this will
  damage the binary data.
