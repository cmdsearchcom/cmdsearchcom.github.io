<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pbs - general information on pbs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
PBS stands for Portable Batch System. It is a networked
subsystem for submitting, monitoring, and controlling a work
load of batch jobs on one or more systems. More information
<br>
about PBS is available in the PBS Users Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Batch means that the job will be
scheduled for execution at a time chosen by the subsystem
according to a defined policy and the availability of
resources. For a normal batch <br>
job, the standard output and standard error of the job will
be returned to files available to the user when the job is
complete. This differs from an interactive session where
<br>
commands are executed when entered via the terminal and
output is returned directly to the terminal. PBS also
supports an interactive batch mode where the input and
output is <br>
connected to the user&rsquo;s terminal, but the scheduling
of the job is still under control of the batch system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A job is typically a shell
script and a set of attributes which provide resource and
control information about the job. A job does not have to be
submitted on the system where <br>
it will run, tt can be submitted on any system with the PBS
commands and access to the execution system, see qsub(1B).
Output will be returned to the system from which the job
<br>
was submitted unless directed otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes offer control over
when a job is eligible to be run, what happens to the output
when it is completed and how the user is notified when it
completes. The attributes of <br>
the job may be specified on the command line or in the job
script when the job is submitted. For information about job
attributes, see qsub(1B) and pbs_job_attributes(7B).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One important attribute is the
resource list. The list specifies the amount and type of
resources needed by the job in order to execute. The list
also implies a hard upper <br>
limit on usage of those resources. When the limit is
reached, the job is terminated. The types of resources
available to a job vary with the system architecture. For a
list of <br>
resources supported on the default system, see
pbs_resources(7B). There are man pages for other systems
types as well, see pbs_resources_aix4(7B),
pbs_resources_fujitsu(7B), <br>
pbs_resources_irix5(7B), pbs_resources_solaris5(7B),
pbs_resources_sp2(7B), pbs_resources_sunos4(7B), or
pbs_resources_unicos8(7B).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a job has been submitted,
it may be monitored by use of the qstat(1B) command. Two
forms of output are available with the qstat command. The
default form is the short dis&acirc; <br>
play. Information about a job is limited to a single line.
Complete information about the job or jobs is available
through qstat with the -f option. Information will be <br>
given about all jobs in the system, all jobs in specified
queues, or only specified jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When displaying status of jobs,
you will see in which queue the job resides. In PBS a queue
is just a collection point for jobs, it does not imply any
execution ordering. That <br>
ordering is determined by a scheduling policy implemented by
the system administration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other commands of interest which
have man pages of their own are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qalter Alter a job&rsquo;s
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qdel Delete a job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qhold Place a hold on a job to
keep it from being scheduled for running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmove Move a job to a different
queue or server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qmsg Append a message to the
output of an executing job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrerun Terminate an executing
job and return it to a queue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qrls Remove a hold from a
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qselect Obtain a list of jobs
that met certain criteria.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qsig Send a signal to an
executing job.</p>
