PBS stands for <i>Portable Batch System.</i> It is a networked subsystem for
  submitting, monitoring, and controlling a work load of batch jobs on one or
  more systems. More information about PBS is available in the PBS Users Guide.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Batch</i> means that the job will be scheduled for execution at a time chosen
  by the subsystem according to a defined policy and the availability of
  resources. For a normal batch job, the standard output and standard error of
  the job will be returned to files available to the user when the job is
  complete. This differs from an interactive session where commands are executed
  when entered via the terminal and output is returned directly to the terminal.
  PBS also supports an <i>interactive batch</i> mode where the input and output
  is connected to the user's terminal, but the scheduling of the job is still
  under control of the batch system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <i>job</i> is typically a shell script and a set of attributes which provide
  resource and control information about the job. A job does not have to be
  submitted on the system where it will run, tt can be submitted on any system
  with the PBS commands and access to the execution system, see <i>qsub(1B).</i>
  Output will be returned to the system from which the job was submitted unless
  directed otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Attributes offer control over when a job is eligible to be run, what happens to
  the output when it is completed and how the user is notified when it
  completes. The attributes of the job may be specified on the command line or
  in the job script when the job is submitted. For information about job
  attributes, see qsub(1B) and <i>pbs_job_attributes(7B).</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
One important attribute is the <i>resource list.</i> The list specifies the
  amount and type of resources needed by the job in order to execute. The list
  also implies a hard upper limit on usage of those resources. When the limit is
  reached, the job is terminated. The types of resources available to a job vary
  with the system architecture. For a list of resources supported on the default
  system, see <i>pbs_resources(7B).</i> There are man pages for other systems
  types as well, see <i>pbs_resources_aix4(7B),</i>
  <i>pbs_resources_fujitsu(7B),</i> <i>pbs_resources_irix5(7B),</i>
  <i>pbs_resources_solaris5(7B),</i> <i>pbs_resources_sp2(7B),</i>
  <i>pbs_resources_sunos4(7B),</i> or <i>pbs_resources_unicos8(7B).</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a job has been submitted, it may be monitored by use of the
  <i>qstat(1B)</i> command. Two forms of output are available with the qstat
  command. The default form is the short display. Information about a job is
  limited to a single line. Complete information about the job or jobs is
  available through qstat with the -f option. Information will be given about
  all jobs in the system, all jobs in specified queues, or only specified jobs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When displaying status of jobs, you will see in which queue the job resides. In
  PBS a queue is just a collection point for jobs, it does not imply any
  execution ordering. That ordering is determined by a scheduling policy
  implemented by the system administration.
