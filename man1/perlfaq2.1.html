<p>PERLFAQ2(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLFAQ2(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to
find source and documentation for Perl, support, and related
matters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What machines support Perl?
Where do I get it? <br>
The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the Perl
development team) is distributed only in source code form.
You can find the latest releases at <br>
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl builds and runs on a
bewildering number of platforms. Virtually all known and
current Unix derivatives are supported (perl&rsquo;s native
platform), as are other systems like VMS, <br>
DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the
Amiga.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binary distributions for some
proprietary platforms can be found
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt; directory. Because these
are not part of the standard distribution, they may and in
<br>
fact do differ from the base perl port in a variety of ways.
You&rsquo;ll have to check their respective release notes to
see just what the differences are. These differences can be
<br>
either positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the
particular platform that are not supported in the source
release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be based upon a
less <br>
current source release of perl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I get a binary version
of Perl? <br>
See CPAN Ports &lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I don&rsquo;t have a C compiler.
How can I build my own Perl interpreter? <br>
For Windows, use a binary version of Perl, Strawberry Perl
&lt;http://strawberryperl.com/&gt; and ActivePerl
&lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; come with a
bundled C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise if you really do want
to build Perl, you need to get a binary version of
&quot;gcc&quot; for your system first. Use a search engine
to find out how to do this for your operating <br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I copied the Perl binary from
one machine to another, but scripts don&rsquo;t work. <br>
That&rsquo;s probably because you forgot libraries, or
library paths differ. You really should build the whole
distribution on the machine it will eventually live on, and
then type <br>
&quot;make install&quot;. Most other approaches are doomed
to failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One simple way to check that
things are in the right place is to print out the hard-coded
@INC that perl looks through for libraries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl -le &rsquo;print for
@INC&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this command lists any paths
that don&rsquo;t exist on your system, then you may need to
move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create
symbolic links, aliases, or <br>
shortcuts appropriately. @INC is also printed as part of the
output of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% perl -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might also want to check out
&quot;How do I keep my own module/library directory?&quot;
in perlfaq8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I grabbed the sources and tried
to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/...
failed. How do I make it work? <br>
Read the INSTALL file, which is part of the source
distribution. It describes in detail how to cope with most
idiosyncrasies that the &quot;Configure&quot; script
can&rsquo;t work around for <br>
any given system or architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What modules and extensions are
available for Perl? What is CPAN? <br>
CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a
multi-gigabyte archive replicated on hundreds of machines
all over the world. CPAN contains tens of thousands of
modules and <br>
extensions, source code and documentation, designed for
everything from commercial database interfaces to
keyboard/screen control and running large web sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can search CPAN on
&lt;http://metacpan.org&gt; or
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The master web site for CPAN is
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;,
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html&gt; lists all
mirrors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the CPAN FAQ at
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html&gt; for answers
to the most frequently asked questions about CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Task::Kensho module has a
list of recommended modules which you should review as a
good starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I get information on
Perl? <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complete Perl documentation
is available with the Perl distribution. If you have Perl
installed locally, you probably have the documentation
installed as well: type &quot;perldoc <br>
perl&quot; in a terminal or view online
&lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Some operating system
distributions may ship the documentation in a different
package; for instance, on Debian, you need to install the
&quot;perl-doc&quot; package.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many good books have been
written about Perl--see the section later in perlfaq2 for
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is perl.com? Perl Mongers?
pm.org? perl.org? cpan.org? <br>
Perl.com &lt;http://www.perl.com/&gt; used to be part of the
O&rsquo;Reilly Network, a subsidiary of O&rsquo;Reilly
Media. Although it retains most of the original content from
its O&rsquo;Reilly <br>
Network, it is now hosted by The Perl Foundation
&lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl Foundation is an
advocacy organization for the Perl language which maintains
the web site &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; as a general
advocacy site for the Perl language. It <br>
uses the domain to provide general support services to the
Perl community, including the hosting of mailing lists, web
sites, and other services. There are also many other sub-
<br>
domains for special topics like learning Perl and jobs in
Perl, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;http://jobs.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&lt;http://lists.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Mongers
&lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; uses the pm.org domain for
services related to local Perl user groups, including the
hosting of mailing lists and web sites. See the Perl <br>
Mongers web site &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; for more
information about joining, starting, or requesting services
for a Perl user group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPAN, or the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, is a
replicated, worldwide repository of Perl software. See What
is CPAN?.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I post questions? <br>
There are many Perl mailing lists for various topics,
specifically the beginners list
&lt;http://lists.perl.org/list/beginners.html&gt; may be of
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other places to ask questions
are on the PerlMonks site &lt;http://www.perlmonks.org/&gt;
or stackoverflow
&lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl Books <br>
There are many good books on Perl
&lt;http://www.perl.org/books/library.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which magazines have Perl
content? <br>
There&rsquo;s also $foo Magazin, a German magazine dedicated
to Perl, at ( http://www.foo-magazin.de
&lt;http://www.foo-magazin.de&gt; ). The Perl-Zeitung is
another German-speaking magazine <br>
for Perl beginners (see http://perl-zeitung.at.tf
&lt;http://perl-zeitung.at.tf&gt; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several unix/linux releated
magazines frequently includes articles on Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which Perl blogs should I read?
<br>
Perl News &lt;http://perlnews.org/&gt; covers some of the
major events in the Perl world, Perl Weekly
&lt;http://perlweekly.com/&gt; is a weekly e-mail (and RSS
feed) of hand-picked Perl <br>
articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://blogs.perl.org/&gt;
hosts many Perl blogs, there are also several blog
aggregators: Perlsphere &lt;http://perlsphere.net/&gt; and
IronMan &lt;http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/&gt; are <br>
two of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What mailing lists are there for
Perl? <br>
A comprehensive list of Perl-related mailing lists can be
found at &lt;http://lists.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where can I buy a commercial
version of Perl? <br>
Perl already is commercial software: it has a license that
you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is
distributed in releases and comes in well-defined packages.
<br>
There is a very large and supportive user community and an
extensive literature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you still need commercial
support ActiveState
&lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; offers
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where do I send bug reports?
<br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, ensure that you&rsquo;ve
found an actual bug. Second, ensure you&rsquo;ve found an
actual bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;ve found a bug with
the perl interpreter or one of the modules in the standard
library (those that come with Perl), you can use the perlbug
utility that comes with Perl <br>
(&gt;= 5.004). It collects information about your
installation to include with your message, then sends the
message to the right place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To determine if a module came
with your version of Perl, you can install and use the
Module::CoreList module. It has the information about the
modules (with their versions) <br>
included with each release of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every CPAN module has a bug
tracker set up in RT, &lt;http://rt.cpan.org&gt;. You can
submit bugs to RT either through its web interface or by
email. To email a bug report, send it to <br>
bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org . For example, if
you wanted to report a bug in Business::ISBN, you could send
a message to bug-Business-ISBN@rt.cpan.org .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some modules might have special
reporting requirements, such as a Github or Google Code
tracking system, so you should check the module
documentation too.</p>
