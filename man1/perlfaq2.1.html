This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source and
  documentation for Perl, support, and related matters.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_machines_support_Perl?_Where_do_I_get_it?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_machines_support_Perl?_Where_do_I_get_it?">What
  machines support Perl? Where do I get it?</a></h2>
The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the Perl development team)
  is distributed only in source code form. You can find the latest releases at
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms. Virtually all known
  and current Unix derivatives are supported (perl's native platform), as are
  other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows, QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the
  Amiga.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms can be found
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt; directory. Because these are not part of
  the standard distribution, they may and in fact do differ from the base perl
  port in a variety of ways. You'll have to check their respective release notes
  to see just what the differences are. These differences can be either positive
  (e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that are not
  supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be based upon
  a less current source release of perl).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_can_I_get_a_binary_version_of_Perl?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_can_I_get_a_binary_version_of_Perl?">How
  can I get a binary version of Perl?</a></h2>
See CPAN Ports &lt;http://www.cpan.org/ports/&gt;
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="I_don't_have_a_C_compiler._How_can_I_build_my_own_Perl_interpreter?"><a class="selflink" href="#I_don't_have_a_C_compiler._How_can_I_build_my_own_Perl_interpreter?">I
  don't have a C compiler. How can I build my own Perl interpreter?</a></h2>
For Windows, use a binary version of Perl, Strawberry Perl
  &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/&gt; and ActivePerl
  &lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; come with a bundled C compiler.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Otherwise if you really do want to build Perl, you need to get a binary version
  of &quot;gcc&quot; for your system first. Use a search engine to find out how
  to do this for your operating system.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="I_copied_the_Perl_binary_from_one_machine_to_another,_but_scripts_don't_work."><a class="selflink" href="#I_copied_the_Perl_binary_from_one_machine_to_another,_but_scripts_don't_work.">I
  copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't
  work.</a></h2>
That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ. You
  really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will eventually
  live on, and then type &quot;make install&quot;. Most other approaches are
  doomed to failure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out the
  hard-coded @INC that perl looks through for libraries:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % perl -le 'print for @INC'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you may
  need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create symbolic
  links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately. @INC is also printed as part of
  the output of
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    % perl -V
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might also want to check out &quot;How do I keep my own module/library
  directory?&quot; in perlfaq8.

  grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic
  loading/malloc/linking/... failed. How do I make it work?</a></h2>
Read the <i>INSTALL</i> file, which is part of the source distribution. It
  describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the
  &quot;Configure&quot; script can't work around for any given system or
  architecture.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_modules_and_extensions_are_available_for_Perl?_What_is_CPAN?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_modules_and_extensions_are_available_for_Perl?_What_is_CPAN?">What
  modules and extensions are available for Perl? What is CPAN?</a></h2>
CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a multi-gigabyte archive
  replicated on hundreds of machines all over the world. CPAN contains tens of
  thousands of modules and extensions, source code and documentation, designed
  for <i>everything</i> from commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen
  control and running large web sites.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can search CPAN on &lt;http://metacpan.org&gt; or
  &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The master web site for CPAN is &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;,
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html&gt; lists all mirrors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the CPAN FAQ at http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html
  &lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html&gt; for answers to the most
  frequently asked questions about CPAN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Task::Kensho module has a list of recommended modules which you should
  review as a good starting point.

The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution. If you
  have Perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation installed as
  well: type &quot;perldoc perl&quot; in a terminal or view online
  &lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Some operating system distributions may ship the documentation in a different
  package; for instance, on Debian, you need to install the &quot;perl-doc&quot;
  package.)

Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section later in perlfaq2
  for more details.

Perl.com &lt;http://www.perl.com/&gt; used to be part of the O'Reilly Network, a
  subsidiary of O'Reilly Media. Although it retains most of the original content
  from its O'Reilly Network, it is now hosted by The Perl Foundation
  &lt;http://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl Foundation is an advocacy organization for the Perl language which
  maintains the web site &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; as a general advocacy site
  for the Perl language. It uses the domain to provide general support services
  to the Perl community, including the hosting of mailing lists, web sites, and
  other services. There are also many other sub-domains for special topics like
  learning Perl and jobs in Perl, such as:

Perl Mongers &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; uses the pm.org domain for services
  related to local Perl user groups, including the hosting of mailing lists and
  web sites. See the Perl Mongers web site &lt;http://www.pm.org/&gt; for more
  information about joining, starting, or requesting services for a Perl user
  group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
CPAN, or the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, is
  a replicated, worldwide repository of Perl software. See What is CPAN?.

Perl already <i>is</i> commercial software: it has a license that you can grab
  and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in
  well-defined packages. There is a very large and supportive user community and
  an extensive literature.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you still need commercial support ActiveState
  &lt;http://www.activestate.com/activeperl&gt; offers this.

First, ensure that you've found an actual bug. Second, ensure you've found an
  actual bug.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you've found a bug with the perl interpreter or one of the modules in the
  standard library (those that come with Perl), you can use the perlbug utility
  that comes with Perl (&gt;= 5.004). It collects information about your
  installation to include with your message, then sends the message to the right
  place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To determine if a module came with your version of Perl, you can install and use
  the Module::CoreList module. It has the information about the modules (with
  their versions) included with each release of Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Every CPAN module has a bug tracker set up in RT, &lt;http://rt.cpan.org&gt;.
  You can submit bugs to RT either through its web interface or by email. To
  email a bug report, send it to bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org . For
  example, if you wanted to report a bug in Business::ISBN, you could send a
  message to bug-Business-ISBN@rt.cpan.org .
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some modules might have special reporting requirements, such as a Github or
  Google Code tracking system, so you should check the module documentation too.
