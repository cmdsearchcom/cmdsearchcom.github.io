<p>DECOPY(1) DECOPY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
decopy - Automatic debian/copyright generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
decopy [options] [files or dirs]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Decopy is a tool that automates creating and updating the
debian/copyright files. It does this by parsing all files in
a source tree, figuring out the copyright attribution and
<br>
license for each file (when possible) and then structuring
the output in the copyright format 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Simply running decopy in the source tree that needs to be
parsed will process all files in the tree, group them by
license, wildcard those groups and generate the proper
output <br>
to be written to the debian/copyright file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source tree already
includes a debian/copyright file, it will be used as input
for files where the license could not be inferred, for the
copyright of the debian directory <br>
and for the license snippets (which need to be filled in
manually if there is no debian/copyright file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The files or directories
specified as positional arguments can be used to limit the
processing to the indicated subset instead of processing the
complete source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
On top of the simple decopy usage, these examples show some
of the most common usecases. Please see the following
sections for detailed explanations of what each of the
parame&acirc; <br>
ters do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decopy --root src/hello-1.0/
--output src/hello-1.0/debian/copyright <br>
This runs the parser in the hello-1.0 source tree and
generates the debian/copyright file in the source tree (the
debian/ directory needs to pre-exist this call).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decopy --mode partial
src/3rdparty/ninja <br>
This shows the licensing and copyright information for the
src/3rdparty/ninja directory. Only that directory is
analized and the output includes only files contained in
<br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decopy --group-by copyright <br>
This processes the complete current source tree, paragraphs
are split not only according to the licenses but also
according to the copyright owners.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decopy src <br>
This will process the src directory but, provided
debian/copyright already exists, show the complete updated
debian/copyright file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
--mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
Indicates the mode to use when generating the output. The
full mode (default) will generate a complete
debian/copyright file, even if only some files were
processed (the <br>
rest of the contents are taken from the original
debian/copyright file). While the partial mode will only
print the copyright and licensing information for the
indicated <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output &lt;file&gt;, -o
&lt;file&gt; <br>
Store the generated output in the indicated file. This will
overwrite the file if it already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--root &lt;path&gt; <br>
Process the indicated path instead of the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROUPING CRITERIA <br>
The generated output will always create separate paragraphs
for groups of files with different licenses, additionally,
it can also split paragraphs according to the following <br>
grouping options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group-by &lt;criteria&gt; <br>
When grouping by license (default), all copyright owners of
different files with the same license are listed together.
When grouping by copyright, each different group of <br>
copyright owners is listed separatedly (files that have the
exact same list of copyright owners are listed
together).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--split-on-license <br>
When a subdirectory has its own license file (COPYING,
LICENSE, etc), the subdirectory is given its own paragraph,
even if it has the same license as the main directory. <br>
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-split-on-license <br>
Even if a subdirectory has its own license file, the
contents are listed together with other files in the tree
that have the same license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--split-debian <br>
Even if the contents of the debian/ subdirectory have the
same license as the main content, split it onto a separate
paragraph. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-split-debian <br>
If the contents of the debian/ subdirectory have the same
license as the main content, they are listed together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG LEVEL OPTIONS <br>
The default logging shows WARN and ERROR messages. It can be
modified with the following flags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Show DEBUG, INFO, WARN and ERROR messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v <br>
Show INFO, WARN and ERROR messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet, -q <br>
Show only ERROR messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESS COMMON OPTIONS <br>
--copyright-file &lt;filename&gt; <br>
Specify a different copyright file to be used as a base for
the processing. Defaults to debian/copyright</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--text Parse all files as text
files, instead of using the different parsers according to
the file types (e.g. using exiv2 for images).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude &lt;path&gt;, -X
&lt;path&gt; <br>
Exclude files from being parsed. The path can be specified
as a regular expression that is matched against the full
relative path for the file (e.g. -X
&Acirc;&acute;.*.jpg$&Acirc;&acute; to <br>
exclude all files that have the .jpg extension. or -X doc/
to exclude all files inside the doc/ directory). As a
special case, debian/copyright and debian/changelog are <br>
always excluded..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPARISON WITH OTHER HELPERS
<br>
Decopy was inspired by previous copyright helpers like
copyright-helper by Modestas Vainius
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/users/modax/copyright-helper.git/,
licensecheck(1) by <br>
Jonas Smedegaard, or the copyright helper shipped with
debmake(1), written by Osamu Aoki.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main difference with all of
them, is that decopy aims to detects as many licenses as
possible, including many more that those in the other
helpers, as well as the fact that <br>
it&Acirc;&acute;s capable of processing more than just plain
text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, while it is
possible to use it for the creation of the copyright file,
its main usecase is to keep the copyright file updated with
any changes that are done to the <br>
source tree as time passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Decopy was written by Maximiliano Curia. The debian
packaging and this manpage were created by Margarita
Manterola.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHT <br>
Decopy and all the associated code and documentation are
released under the ISC license.</p>
