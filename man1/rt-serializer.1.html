<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rt-serializer - Serialize an RT database to disk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rt-validator --check &amp;&amp; rt-serializer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This script is used to write out
the entire RT database to disk, for later import into a
different RT instance. It requires that the data in the
database be self-consistent, in <br>
order to do so; please make sure that the database being
exported passes validation by rt-validator before attempting
to use &quot;rt-serializer&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While running, it will attempt
to estimate the number of remaining objects to be
serialized; these estimates are pessimistic, and will be
incorrect if &quot;--no-users&quot;, <br>
&quot;--no-groups&quot;, or &quot;--no-tickets&quot; are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the controlling terminal is
large enough (more than 25 columns high) and the
&quot;gnuplot&quot; program is installed, it will also show
a textual graph of the queue size over time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--directory name <br>
The name of the output directory to write data files to,
which should not exist yet; it is a fatal error if it does.
Defaults to &quot;./$Organization:Date/&quot;, where
$Organization <br>
is as set in RT_SiteConfig.pm, and Date is today&rsquo;s
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
Remove the output directory before starting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--size megabytes <br>
By default, &quot;rt-serializer&quot; chunks its output into
data files which are around 32Mb in size; this option is
used to set a different threshold size, in megabytes. Note
that <br>
this is the threshold after which it rotates to writing a
new file, and is as such the lower bound on the size of each
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-users <br>
By default, all privileged users are serialized; passing
&quot;--no-users&quot; limits it to only those users which
are referenced by serialized tickets and history, and are
thus <br>
necessary for internal consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-groups <br>
By default, all groups are serialized; passing
&quot;--no-groups&quot; limits it to only system-internal
groups, which are needed for internal consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-deleted <br>
By default, all tickets, including deleted tickets, are
serialized; passing &quot;--no-deleted&quot; skips deleted
tickets during serialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scrips <br>
No scrips or templates are serialized by default; this
option forces all scrips and templates to be serialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--acls <br>
No ACLs are serialized by default; this option forces all
ACLs to be serialized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tickets <br>
Skip serialization of all ticket data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clone <br>
Serializes your entire database, creating a clone. This
option should be used if you want to migrate your RT
database from one database type to another (e.g. MySQL to
<br>
Postgres). It is an error to combine &quot;--clone&quot;
with any option that limits object types serialized. No
dependency walking is performed when cloning.
&quot;rt-importer&quot; will <br>
detect that your serialized data set was generated by a
clone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--incremental <br>
Will generate an incremenal serialized dataset using the
data stored in your IncrementalRecords database table. This
assumes that you have created that table and run RT <br>
using the Record_Local.pm shim as documented in
&quot;docs/incremental-export/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gc n <br>
Adjust how often the garbage collection sweep is done; lower
numbers are more frequent. See &quot;GARBAGE
COLLECTION&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--page n <br>
Adjust how many rows are pulled from the database in a
single query. Disable paging by setting this to 0. Defaults
to 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind that rows from
RT&rsquo;s Attachments table are the limiting factor when
determining page size. You should likely be aiming for
60-75% of your total memory on an <br>
otherwise unloaded box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Do not show graphical progress UI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Do not show graphical progress UI, but rather log was each
row is written out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GARBAGE COLLECTION <br>
&quot;rt-serializer&quot; maintains a priority queue of
objects to serialize, or searches which may result in
objects to serialize. When inserting into this queue, it
does no checking if <br>
the object in question is already in the queue, or if the
search will contain any results. These checks are done when
the object reaches the front of the queue, or during <br>
periodic garbage collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During periodic garbage
collection, the entire queue is swept for objects which have
already been serialized, occur more than once in the queue,
and searches which contain no <br>
results in the database. This is done to reduce the memory
footprint of the serialization process, and is triggered
when enough new objects have been placed in the queue. This
<br>
parameter is tunable via the &quot;--gc&quot; parameter,
which defaults to running garbage collection every 5,000
objects inserted into the queue; smaller numbers will result
in more <br>
frequent garbage collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default of 5,000 is roughly
tuned based on a database with several thousand tickets, but
optimal values will vary wildly depending on database
configuration and size. Values <br>
as low as 25 have provided speedups with smaller databases;
if speed is a factor, experimenting with different
&quot;--gc&quot; values may be helpful. Note that there are
significant <br>
boundary condition changes in serialization rate, as the
queue empties and fills, causing the time estimates to be
rather imprecise near the start and end of the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting &quot;--gc&quot; to 0
turns off all garbage collection. Be aware that this will
bloat the memory usage of the serializer. Any negative value
for &quot;--gc&quot; turns off periodic garbage <br>
collection and instead objects already serialized or in the
queue are checked for at the time they would be
inserted.</p>
