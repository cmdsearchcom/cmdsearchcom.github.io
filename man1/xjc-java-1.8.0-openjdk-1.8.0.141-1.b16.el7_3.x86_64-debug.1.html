<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xjc - Compiles an XML schema file into fully annotated Java
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xjc [ options ] schema file/URL/dir/jar ... [-b bindinfo ]
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
The command-line options. See Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">schema file/URL/dir/jar ... <br>
The location of the XML schema file. If dir is specified,
then all schema files in it are compiled. If jar is
specified, then the /META-INF/sun-jaxb.episode binding file
<br>
is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bindinfo <br>
The location of the bindings files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Start the binding compiler with the appropriate xjc shell
script in the bin directory for your platform. There is also
an Ant task to run the binding complier. See Using the XJC
<br>
with Ant at
http://jaxb.java.net/nonav/2.1.3/docs/xjcTask.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; See also Nonstandard Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; See also
Deprecated and Removed Options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nv <br>
By default, the XJC binding compiler performs strict
validation of the source schema before processing it. Use
this option to disable strict schema validation. This does
not <br>
mean that the binding compiler will not perform any
validation, but means that it will perform a less-strict
validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extension <br>
By default, the XJC binding compiler strictly enforces the
rules outlined in the Compatibility chapter of the JAXB
Specification. Appendix E.2 defines a set of W3C XML Schema
<br>
features that are not completely supported by JAXB v1.0. In
some cases, you may be allowed to use them in the -extension
mode enabled by this switch. In the default (strict) <br>
mode, you are also limited to using only the binding
customization defined in the specification. By using the
-extension switch, you will be allowed to use the JAXB
Vendor <br>
Extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b file <br>
Specifies one or more external binding files to process.
Each binding file must have its own -b switch. The syntax of
the external binding files is flexible. You can have a <br>
single binding file that contains customization for multiple
schemas or you can break the customization into multiple
bindings files: xjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd schema3.xsd -b
<br>
bindings123.xjbxjc schema1.xsd schema2.xsd schema3.xsd -b
bindings1.xjb -b bindings2.xjb -b bindings3.xjb. In
addition, the ordering of the schema files and binding files
on <br>
the command line does not matter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d dir <br>
By default, the XJC binding compiler generates the Java
content classes in the current directory. Use this option to
specify an alternate output directory. The output directory
<br>
must already exist. The XJC binding compiler does not create
it for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pkg <br>
When you specify a target package with this command-line
option, it overrides any binding customization for the
package name and the default package name algorithm defined
in <br>
the specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-httpproxy proxy <br>
Specifies the HTTP or HTTPS proxy in the format
[user[:password]@]proxyHost[:proxyPort]. The old -host and
-port options are still supported by the RI for backward
<br>
compatibility, but they were deprecated. The password
specified with this option is an argument that is visible to
other users who use the top command. For greater security,
<br>
use the -httpproxyfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-httpproxyfile file <br>
Specifies the HTTP or HTTPS proxy with a file. The same
format as the -httpproxy option, but the password specified
in the file is not visible to other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath arg <br>
Specifies where to find client application class files used
by the jxb:javaType and xjc:superClass customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-catalog file <br>
Specifies catalog files to resolve external entity
references. Supports the TR9401, XCatalog, and OASIS XML
Catalog formats. See XML Entity and URI Resolvers at <br>

http://xerces.apache.org/xml-commons/components/resolver/resolver-article.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-readOnly <br>
By default, the XJC binding compiler does not write-protect
the Java source files it generates. Use this option to force
the XJC binding compiler to mark the generated Java <br>
sources as read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-npa <br>
Suppresses the generation of package level annotations into
**/package-info.java. Using this switch causes the generated
code to internalize those annotations into the other <br>
generated classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-header <br>
Suppresses the generation of a file header comment that
includes some note and time stamp. Using this makes the
generated code more compatible with the diff command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target 2.0 <br>
Avoids generating code that relies on any JAXB 2.1 features.
This will allow the generated code to run with JAXB 2.0
runtime environment (such as Java SE 6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xmlschema <br>
Treats input schemas as W3C XML Schema (default). If you do
not specify this switch, then your input schemas are treated
as though they are W3C XML Schemas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-relaxing <br>
Treats input schemas as RELAX NG (experimental and
unsupported). Support for RELAX NG schemas is provided as a
JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-relaxing-compact <br>
Treat input schemas as RELAX NG compact syntax (experimental
and unsupported). Support for RELAX NG schemas is provided
as a JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dtd <br>
Treats input schemas as XML DTD (experimental and
unsupported). Support for RELAX NG schemas is provided as a
JAXB Vendor Extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wsdl <br>
Treats input as WSDL and compiles schemas inside it
(experimental and unsupported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
Suppress compiler output, such as progress information and
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Be extra verbose, such as printing informational messages or
displaying stack traces upon some errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays a brief summary of the compiler switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Displays the compiler version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">schema file/URL/dir <br>
Specifies one or more schema files to compile. If you
specify a directory, then the xjc command scans it for all
schema files and compiles them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NONSTANDARD OPTIONS <br>
-XLocator <br>
Causes the generated code to expose SAX Locator information
about the source XML in the Java bean instances after
unmarshalling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xsync-methods <br>
Causes all of the generated method signatures to include the
synchronized keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mark-generated <br>
Marks the generated code with the annotation
@javax.annotation.Generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-episode file <br>
Generates the specified episode file for separate
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPRECATED AND REMOVED OPTIONS
<br>
-host &amp; -port <br>
These options are replaced with the -httpproxy option. For
backward compatibility, these options are supported, but
will not be documented and might be removed from future <br>
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use-runtime <br>
Because the JAXB 2.0 specification has defined a portable
runtime environment, it is no longer necessary for the JAXB
RI to generate **/impl/runtimepackages. Therefore, <br>
this switch is obsolete and was removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-source <br>
The -source compatibility switch was introduced in the first
JAXB 2.0 Early Access release. This switch is removed from
future releases of JAXB 2.0. If you need to <br>
generate 1.0.x code, then use an installation of the 1.0.x
code base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPILER RESTRICTIONS <br>
In general, it is safest to compile all related schemas as a
single unit with the same binding compiler switches. Keep
the following list of restrictions in mind when running the
<br>
xjc command. Most of these issues only apply when you
compile multiple schemas with multiple invocations of the
xjc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compile multiple schemas at
the same time, keep the following precedence rules for the
target Java package name in mind:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The -p option has the highest
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. jaxb:package
customization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If targetNamespace is
declared, then apply the targetNamespace to the Java package
name algorithm defined in the specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. If no targetNamespace is
declared, then use a hard coded package named generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot have more than one
jaxb:schemaBindings per name space, so it is impossible to
have two schemas in the same target name space compiled into
different Java packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All schemas being compiled into
the same Java package must be submitted to the XJC binding
compiler at the same time. They cannot be compiled
independently and work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Element substitution groups that
are spread across multiple schema files must be compiled at
the same time.</p>
