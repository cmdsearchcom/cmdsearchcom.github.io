<p>MSH(1) General Commands Manual MSH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
msh - nmh shell (and BBoard reader)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
msh [-prompt string] [-scan | -noscan] [-topcur | -notopcur]
[file] [-version] [-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS <br>
msh is deprecated and will be removed from the next nmh
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
msh is an interactive program that implements a subset of
the normal nmh commands operating on a single file in mmdf
format. That is, msh is used to read a file that contains a
<br>
number of messages, as opposed to the standard nmh style of
reading a number of files, each file being a separate
message in a folder. msh&rsquo;s chief advantage is that the
normal <br>
nmh style does not allow a file to have more than one
message in it. Hence, msh is ideal for reading BBoards, as
these files are delivered by the transport system in this
for&acirc; <br>
mat. In addition, msh can be used on other files, such as
message archives which have been packed (see packf(1)).
Finally, msh is an excellent nmh tutor. As the only commands
<br>
available to the user are nmh commands, this allows nmh
beginners to concentrate on how commands to nmh are formed
and (more or less) what they mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked, msh reads the
named file, and enters a command loop. The user may type
most of the normal nmh commands. The syntax and semantics of
these commands typed to msh <br>
are identical to their nmh counterparts. In cases where the
nature of msh would be inconsistent (e.g., specifying a
+folder with some commands), msh will duly inform the user.
<br>
The commands that msh currently supports (in some slightly
modified or restricted forms) are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ali <br>
burst <br>
comp <br>
dist <br>
folder <br>
forw <br>
inc <br>
mark <br>
mhmail <br>
mhn <br>
msgchk <br>
next <br>
packf <br>
pick <br>
prev <br>
refile <br>
repl <br>
rmm <br>
scan <br>
send <br>
show <br>
sortm <br>
whatnow <br>
whom</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, msh has a help
command which gives a brief overview. To terminate msh, type
CTRL-D, or use the quit command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file is writable and has
been modified, then using quit will query the user if the
file should be updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -prompt string switch sets
the prompting string for msh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may wish to use an alternate
nmh profile for the commands that msh executes; see
mh-profile(5) for details about the $MH environment
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit command is identical to
the quit command in msh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msh supports an output
redirection facility. Commands may be followed by one of</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^&gt; file~^write output to file
<br>
^&gt;&gt; file~^append output to file <br>
^| command~^pipe output to UNIX command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file starts with a &acirc;
&acirc; (tilde), then a csh-like expansion takes place. Note
that command is interpreted by sh. Also note that msh does
NOT support history substitutions, <br>
variable substitutions, or alias substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When parsing commands to the
left of any redirection symbol, msh will honor
&lsquo;&acute; (backslash) as the quote next-character
symbol, and &lsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; (double-quote) as
quote-word delimiters. <br>
All other input tokens are separated by whitespace (spaces
and tabs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.mh_profile The user profile <br>
/etc/nmh/mts.conf nmh mts configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILE COMPONENTS <br>
Path: To determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory <br>
Msg-Protect: To set mode when creating a new
&lsquo;file&rsquo; <br>
fileproc: Program to file messages <br>
showproc: Program to show messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
packf(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
&lsquo;file&rsquo; defaults to &acirc;./msgbox&acirc; <br>
&lsquo;-prompt (msh) &rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;-noscan&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;-notopcur&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is a strict limit of messages per file in
packf&rsquo;d format which msh can handle. Usually, this
limit is 1000 messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please remember that msh is not
the C-Shell, and that a lot of the nice facilities provided
by the latter are not present in the former.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, msh does not
understand backquoting, so the only effective way to use
pick inside msh is to always use the -seq select switch.
Clever users of nmh will put the <br>
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pick: -seq select -list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in their .mh_profile file so
that pick works equally well from both the shell and
msh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sortm always uses -noverbose and
if -textfield field is used, -limit 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The msh program inherits most
(if not all) of the bugs from the nmh commands it
implements.</p>
