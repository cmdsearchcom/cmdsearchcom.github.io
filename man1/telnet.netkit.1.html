<p>TELNET(1) BSD General Commands Manual TELNET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
telnet &acirc; user interface to the TELNET protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
telnet [-468ELadr] [-S tos] [-b address] [-e escapechar] [-l
user] [-n tracefile] [host [port]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The telnet command is used for interactive communication
with another host using the TELNET protocol. It begins in
command mode, where it prints a telnet prompt
(&quot;telnet&gt; &quot;). If <br>
telnet is invoked with a host argument, it performs an open
command implicitly; see the description below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Force IPv4 address
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Force IPv6 address
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-8 Request 8-bit operation. This
causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option for
both input and output. By default telnet is not 8-bit
clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Disables the escape character
functionality; that is, sets the escape character to
&lsquo;&lsquo;no character&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Specifies an 8-bit data path
on output. This causes the TELNET BINARY option to be
negotiated on just output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Attempt automatic login.
Currently, this sends the user name via the USER variable of
the NEW-ENVIRON option if supported by the remote system.
The username is retrieved <br>
via getlogin(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b address <br>
Use bind(2) on the local socket to bind it to a specific
local address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Sets the initial value of the
debug toggle to TRUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Emulate rlogin(1). In this
mode, the default escape character is a tilde. Also, the
interpretation of the escape character is changed: an escape
character followed by a <br>
dot causes telnet to disconnect from the remote host. A ^Z
instead of a dot suspends telnet, and a ^] (the default
telnet escape character) generates a normal telnet <br>
prompt. These codes are accepted only at the beginning of a
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S tos Sets the IP
type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connection to
the value tos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e escapechar <br>
Sets the escape character to escapechar. If no character is
supplied, no escape character will be used. Entering the
escape character while connected causes telnet to drop <br>
to command mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l user <br>
Specify user as the user to log in as on the remote system.
This is accomplished by sending the specified name as the
USER environment variable, so it requires that the <br>
remote system support the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON option. This
option implies the -a option, and may also be used with the
open command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n tracefile <br>
Opens tracefile for recording trace information. See the set
tracefile command below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host Specifies a host to contact
over the network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port Specifies a port number or
service name to contact. If not specified, the telnet port
(23) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a connection has been
opened, telnet will attempt to enable the TELNET LINEMODE
option. If this fails, then telnet will revert to one of two
input modes: either &acirc;character at <br>
a time&acirc; or &acirc;old line by line&acirc; depending on
what the remote system supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When LINEMODE is enabled,
character processing is done on the local system, under the
control of the remote system. When input editing or
character echoing is to be disabled, the <br>
remote system will relay that information. The remote system
will also relay changes to any special characters that
happen on the remote system, so that they can take effect on
<br>
the local system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &acirc;character at a
time&acirc; mode, most text typed is immediately sent to the
remote host for processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &acirc;old line by
line&acirc; mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally)
only completed lines are sent to the remote host. The
&acirc;local echo character&acirc; (initially
&acirc;^E&acirc;) may be used to <br>
turn off and on the local echo (this would mostly be used to
enter passwords without the password being echoed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the LINEMODE option is
enabled, or if the localchars toggle is TRUE (the default
for &acirc;old line by line&acirc;; see below), the
user&rsquo;s quit, intr, and flush characters are trapped
<br>
locally, and sent as TELNET protocol sequences to the remote
side. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the
user&rsquo;s susp and eof are also sent as TELNET protocol
sequences, and <br>
quit is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK There are
options (see toggle autoflush and toggle autosynch below)
which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the
termi&acirc; <br>
nal (until the remote host acknowledges the TELNET sequence)
and flush previous terminal input (in the case of quit and
intr).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following telnet commands
are available. Unique prefixes are understood as
abbreviations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">auth argument ... <br>
The auth command controls the TELNET AUTHENTICATE protocol
option. If telnet was compiled without authentication, the
auth command will not be supported. Valid argu&acirc; <br>
ments are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable type Disable the
specified type of authentication. To obtain a list of
available types, use the auth disable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable type Enable the specified
type of authentication. To obtain a list of available types,
use the auth enable ? command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status List the current status
of the various types of authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the current version of
telnet does not support authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">close Close the connection to
the remote host, if any, and return to command mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display argument ... <br>
Display all, or some, of the set and toggle values (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encrypt argument ... <br>
The encrypt command controls the TELNET ENCRYPT protocol
option. If telnet was compiled without encryption, the
encrypt command will not be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid arguments are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disable type [input|output] <br>
Disable the specified type of encryption. If you do not
specify input or output, encryption of both is disabled. To
obtain a list of available types, use <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt disable ?&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable type [input|output] <br>
Enable the specified type of encryption. If you do not
specify input or output, encryption of both is enabled. To
obtain a list of available types, use <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt enable ?&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input This is the same as
&lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt start input&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-input This is the same as
&lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt stop input&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">output This is the same as
&lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt start output&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output This is the same as
&lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt stop output&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start [input|output] <br>
Attempt to begin encrypting. If you do not specify input or
output, encryption of both input and output is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Display the current
status of the encryption module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop [input|output] <br>
Stop encrypting. If you do not specify input or output,
encryption of both is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type type Sets the default type
of encryption to be used with later &lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt
start&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;encrypt
stop&rsquo;&rsquo; commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the current version of
telnet does not support encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">environ arguments... <br>
The environ command is used to propagate environment
variables across the telnet link using the TELNET
NEW-ENVIRON protocol option. All variables exported from the
<br>
shell are defined, but only the DISPLAY and PRINTER
variables are marked to be sent by default. The USER
variable is marked to be sent if the -a or -l command-line
<br>
options were used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid arguments for the environ
command are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">define variable value <br>
Define the variable variable to have a value of value. Any
variables defined by this command are automatically marked
for propagation (&lsquo;&lsquo;exported&rsquo;&rsquo;). The
<br>
value may be enclosed in single or double quotes so that
tabs and spaces may be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefine variable <br>
Remove any existing definition of variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export variable <br>
Mark the specified variable for propagation to the remote
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexport variable <br>
Do not mark the specified variable for propagation to the
remote host. The remote host may still ask explicitly for
variables that are not exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list List the current set of
environment variables. Those marked with a * will be
propagated to the remote host. The remote host may still ask
explicitly for the <br>
rest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the environ command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">logout Send the TELNET LOGOUT
protocol option to the remote host. This command is similar
to a close command. If the remote host does not support the
LOGOUT option, nothing <br>
happens. But if it does, this command should cause it to
close the connection. If the remote side also supports the
concept of suspending a user&rsquo;s session for later <br>
reattachment, the logout command indicates that the session
should be terminated immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode type Type is one of several
options, depending on the state of the session. Telnet asks
the remote host to go into the requested mode. If the remote
host says it can, that <br>
mode takes effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character Disable the TELNET
LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not understand
the LINEMODE option, then enter &acirc;character at a
time&acirc; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line Enable the TELNET LINEMODE
option, or, if the remote side does not understand the
LINEMODE option, then attempt to enter
&acirc;old-line-by-line&acirc; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">isig (-isig) Attempt to enable
(disable) the TRAPSIG mode of the LINEMODE option. This
requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit (-edit) Attempt to enable
(disable) the EDIT mode of the LINEMODE option. This
requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">softtabs (-softtabs) <br>
Attempt to enable (disable) the SOFT_TAB mode of the
LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">litecho (-litecho) <br>
Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO mode of the
LINEMODE option. This requires that the LINEMODE option be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the mode command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open host [[-l] user][- port]
<br>
Open a connection to the named host. If no port number is
specified, telnet will attempt to contact a telnet daemon at
the standard port (23). The host specification <br>
may be a host name or IP address. The -l option may be used
to specify a user name to be passed to the remote system,
like the -l command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When connecting to ports other
than the telnet port, telnet does not attempt telnet
protocol negotiations. This makes it possible to connect to
services that do not sup&acirc; <br>
port the telnet protocol without making a mess. Protocol
negotiation can be forced by placing a dash before the port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After establishing a connection,
any commands associated with the remote host in
/etc/telnetrc and the user&rsquo;s .telnetrc file are
executed, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the telnetrc files
is as follows: Lines beginning with a #, and blank lines,
are ignored. The rest of the file should consist of
hostnames and sequences <br>
of telnet commands to use with that host. Commands should be
one per line, indented by whitespace; lines beginning
without whitespace are interpreted as hostnames. <br>
Lines beginning with the special hostname
&acirc;DEFAULT&acirc; will apply to all hosts. Hostnames
including &acirc;DEFAULT&acirc; may be followed immediately
by a colon and a port number or <br>
string. If a port is specified it must match exactly with
what is specified on the command line. If no port was
specified on the command line, then the value
&acirc;telnet&acirc; <br>
is used. Upon connecting to a particular host, the commands
associated with that host are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit Close any open session and
exit telnet. An end of file condition on input, when in
command mode, will trigger this operation as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send arguments <br>
Send one or more special telnet protocol character sequences
to the remote host. The following are the codes which may be
specified (more than one may be used in one <br>
command):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abort Sends the TELNET ABORT
(Abort Processes) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ao Sends the TELNET AO (Abort
Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
flush all output from the remote system to the user&rsquo;s
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ayt Sends the TELNET AYT (Are
You There?) sequence, to which the remote system may or may
not choose to respond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brk Sends the TELNET BRK (Break)
sequence, which may have significance to the remote
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ec Sends the TELNET EC (Erase
Character) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
erase the last character entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">el Sends the TELNET EL (Erase
Line) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
erase the line currently being entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of
File) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eor Sends the TELNET EOR (End of
Record) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape Sends the current telnet
escape character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ga Sends the TELNET GA (Go
Ahead) sequence, which likely has no significance to the
remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getstatus <br>
If the remote side supports the TELNET STATUS command,
getstatus will send the subnegotiation to request that the
server send its current option status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ip Sends the TELNET IP
(Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote
system to abort the currently running process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nop Sends the TELNET NOP (No
Operation) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">susp Sends the TELNET SUSP
(Suspend Process) sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">synch Sends the TELNET SYNCH
sequence. This sequence causes the remote system to discard
all previously typed (but not yet read) input. This sequence
is sent as TCP <br>
urgent data (and may not work if the remote system is a
4.2BSD system -- if it doesn&rsquo;t work, a lower case
&acirc;r&acirc; may be echoed on the terminal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dont cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will cmd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wont cmd <br>
Sends the TELNET DO cmd sequence. cmd can be either a
decimal number between 0 and 255, or a symbolic name for a
specific TELNET command. cmd can also be <br>
either help or ? to print out help information, including a
list of known symbolic names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the send command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set argument value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unset argument value <br>
The set command will set any one of a number of telnet
variables to a specific value or to TRUE. The special value
off turns off the function associated with the vari&acirc;
<br>
able. This is equivalent to using the unset command. The
unset command will disable or set to FALSE any of the
specified variables. The values of variables may be <br>
interrogated with the display command. The variables which
may be set or unset, but not toggled, are listed here. In
addition, any of the variables for the toggle com&acirc;
<br>
mand may be explicitly set or unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ayt If telnet is in localchars
mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the status character is
typed, a TELNET AYT sequence is sent to the remote host. The
initial value <br>
for the &quot;Are You There&quot; character is the
terminal&rsquo;s status character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo This is the value
(initially &acirc;^E&acirc;) which, when in &acirc;line by
line&acirc; mode, toggles between doing local echoing of
entered characters (for normal processing), and <br>
suppressing echoing of entered characters (for entering,
say, a password).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eof If telnet is operating in
LINEMODE or &acirc;old line by line&acirc; mode, entering
this character as the first character on a line will cause
this character to be sent to <br>
the remote system. The initial value of the eof character is
taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s eof character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">erase If telnet is in localchars
mode (see toggle localchars below), and if telnet is
operating in &acirc;character at a time&acirc; mode, then
when this character is typed, a <br>
TELNET EC sequence (see send ec above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the erase character is taken
to be the terminal&rsquo;s erase character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escape This is the telnet escape
character (initially &acirc;^]&acirc;) which causes entry
into telnet command mode (when connected to a remote
system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flushoutput <br>
If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle localchars
below) and the flushoutput character is typed, a TELNET AO
sequence (see send ao above) is sent to the <br>
remote host. The initial value for the flush character is
taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s flush character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forw1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">forw2 If TELNET is operating in
LINEMODE, these are the characters that, when typed, cause
partial lines to be forwarded to the remote system. The
initial value for <br>
the forwarding characters are taken from the
terminal&rsquo;s eol and eol2 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">interrupt <br>
If telnet is in localchars mode (see toggle localchars
below) and the interrupt character is typed, a TELNET IP
sequence (see send ip above) is sent to the <br>
remote host. The initial value for the interrupt character
is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s intr character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill If telnet is in localchars
mode (see toggle localchars below), and if telnet is
operating in &acirc;character at a time&acirc; mode, then
when this character is typed, a <br>
TELNET EL sequence (see send el above) is sent to the remote
system. The initial value for the kill character is taken to
be the terminal&rsquo;s kill character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lnext If telnet is operating in
LINEMODE or &acirc;old line by line&acirc; mode, then this
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s lnext
character. The initial value for the <br>
lnext character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s lnext
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit If telnet is in localchars
mode (see toggle localchars below) and the quit character is
typed, a TELNET BRK sequence (see send brk above) is sent to
the remote <br>
host. The initial value for the quit character is taken to
be the terminal&rsquo;s quit character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reprint <br>
If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or &acirc;old line by
line&acirc; mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminal&rsquo;s reprint character. The initial value for
the <br>
reprint character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s
reprint character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlogin This is the rlogin mode
escape character. Setting it enables rlogin mode, as with
the r command-line option (q.v.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">start If the TELNET
TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s start
character. The initial value for the kill <br>
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s start
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop If the TELNET
TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been enabled, then this
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s stop
character. The initial value for the kill <br>
character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s stop
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">susp If telnet is in localchars
mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the suspend character is
typed, a TELNET SUSP sequence (see send susp above) is sent
to the remote <br>
host. The initial value for the suspend character is taken
to be the terminal&rsquo;s suspend character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracefile <br>
This is the file to which the output, caused by netdata or
option tracing being TRUE, will be written. If it is set to
&acirc;-&acirc;, then tracing information will be <br>
written to standard output (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">worderase <br>
If telnet is operating in LINEMODE or &acirc;old line by
line&acirc; mode, then this character is taken to be the
terminal&rsquo;s worderase character. The initial value for
the <br>
worderase character is taken to be the terminal&rsquo;s
worderase character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Displays the legal set (unset)
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slc state The slc command (Set
Local Characters) is used to set or change the state of the
the special characters when the TELNET LINEMODE option has
been enabled. Special char&acirc; <br>
acters are characters that get mapped to TELNET commands
sequences (like ip or quit) or line editing characters (like
erase and kill). By default, the local special <br>
characters are exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">check Verify the current
settings for the current special characters. The remote side
is requested to send all the current special character
settings, and if <br>
there are any discrepancies with the local side, the local
side will switch to the remote value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export Switch to the local
defaults for the special characters. The local default
characters are those of the local terminal at the time when
telnet was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import Switch to the remote
defaults for the special characters. The remote default
characters are those of the remote system at the time when
the TELNET connec&acirc; <br>
tion was established.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints out help information
for the slc command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status Show the current status
of telnet. This includes the name of the remote host, if
any, as well as the current mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toggle arguments ... <br>
Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control
how telnet responds to events. These flags may be set
explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the set and unset <br>
commands. More than one flag may be toggled at once. The
state of these flags may be examined with the display
command. Valid flags are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authdebug Turns on debugging for
the authentication code. This flag only exists if
authentication support is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoflush If autoflush and
localchars are both TRUE, then when the ao, or quit
characters are recognized (and transformed into TELNET
sequences; see set above for <br>
details), telnet refuses to display any data on the
user&rsquo;s terminal until the remote system acknowledges
(via a TELNET TIMING MARK option) that it has pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed those TELNET sequences. The initial value for this
toggle is TRUE if the terminal user had not done an
&quot;stty noflsh&quot;, otherwise FALSE (see <br>
stty(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autodecrypt When the TELNET
ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by default the actual
encryption (decryption) of the data stream does not start
automatically. The autoen&acirc; <br>
crypt (autodecrypt) command states that encryption of the
output (input) stream should be enabled as soon as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this flag exists only
if encryption support is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autologin If the remote side
supports the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option, telnet attempts
to use it to perform automatic authentication. If the TELNET
AUTHENTICATION <br>
option is not supported, the user&rsquo;s login name is
propagated using the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON option. Setting this
flag is the same as specifying the a option <br>
to the open command or on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autosynch If autosynch and
localchars are both TRUE, then when either the intr or quit
characters is typed (see set above for descriptions of the
intr and quit char&acirc; <br>
acters), the resulting telnet sequence sent is followed by
the TELNET SYNCH sequence. This procedure should cause the
remote system to begin throwing away <br>
all previously typed input until both of the telnet
sequences have been read and acted upon. The initial value
of this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">binary Enable or disable the
TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inbinary Enable or disable the
TELNET BINARY option on input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">outbinary Enable or disable the
TELNET BINARY option on output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crlf If this is TRUE, then
carriage returns will be sent as &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. If
this is FALSE, then carriage returns will be send as
&lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;. The initial value for <br>
this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">crmod Toggle carriage return
mode. When this mode is enabled, most carriage return
characters received from the remote host will be mapped into
a carriage <br>
return followed by a line feed. This mode does not affect
those characters typed by the user, only those received from
the remote host. This mode is not <br>
very useful unless the remote host only sends carriage
return, but never line feed. The initial value for this
toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Toggles socket level
debugging (useful only to the super user). The initial value
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encdebug Turns on debugging
information for the encryption code. Note that this flag
only exists if encryption support is available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localchars If this is TRUE, then
the flush, interrupt, quit, erase, and kill characters (see
set above) are recognized locally, and transformed into
(hopefully) <br>
appropriate TELNET control sequences (respectively ao, ip,
brk, ec, and el; see send above). The initial value for this
toggle is TRUE in &acirc;old line by <br>
line&acirc; mode, and FALSE in &acirc;character at a
time&acirc; mode. When the LINEMODE option is enabled, the
value of localchars is ignored, and assumed to always be
<br>
TRUE. If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then quit is sent
as abort, and eof and suspend are sent as eof and susp, see
send above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">netdata Toggles the display of
all network data (in hexadecimal format). The initial value
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options Toggles the display of
some internal telnet protocol processing (having to do with
telnet options). The initial value for this toggle is
FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prettydump When the netdata
toggle is enabled, if prettydump is enabled the output from
the netdata command will be formatted in a more
user-readable format. Spaces <br>
are put between each character in the output, and the
beginning of telnet escape sequences are preceded by a
&rsquo;*&rsquo; to aid in locating them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skiprc When the skiprc toggle is
TRUE, telnet does not read the telnetrc files. The initial
value for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">termdata Toggles the display of
all terminal data (in hexadecimal format). The initial value
for this toggle is FALSE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose_encrypt <br>
When the verbose_encrypt toggle is TRUE, TELNET prints out a
message each time encryption is enabled or disabled. The
initial value for this toggle is <br>
FALSE. This flag only exists if encryption support is
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Displays the legal toggle
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Suspend telnet. This command
only works when the user is using the csh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! [command] <br>
Execute a single command in a subshell on the local system.
If command is omitted, then an interactive subshell is
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? [command] <br>
Get help. With no arguments, telnet prints a help summary.
If a command is specified, telnet will print the help
information for just that command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Telnet uses at least the HOME, SHELL, DISPLAY, and TERM
environment variables. Other environment variables may be
propagated to the other side via the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/telnetrc global telnet startup values <br>
~/.telnetrc user customized telnet startup values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The Telnet command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually
when in &acirc;old line by line&acirc; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In &acirc;old line by
line&acirc; mode or LINEMODE the terminal&rsquo;s eof
character is only recognized (and sent to the remote system)
when it is the first character on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
