<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRUNCH(1) General Commands
Manual CRUNCH(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
crunch - generate wordlists from a character set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
crunch &lt;min-len&gt; &lt;max-len&gt; [&lt;charset
string&gt;] [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Crunch can create a wordlist based on criteria you specify.
The output from crunch can be sent to the screen, file, or
to another program. The required parameters are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">min-len <br>
The minimum length string you want crunch to start at. This
option is required even for parameters that won&rsquo;t use
the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max-len <br>
The maximum length string you want crunch to end at. This
option is required even for parameters that won&rsquo;t use
the value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charset string <br>
You may specify character sets for crunch to use on the
command line or if you leave it blank crunch will use the
default character sets. The order MUST BE lower case <br>
characters, upper case characters, numbers, and then
symbols. If you don&rsquo;t follow this order you will not
get the results you want. You MUST specify either values for
<br>
the character type or a plus sign. NOTE: If you want to
include the space character in your character set you must
escape it using the &nbsp;character or enclose your
charac&acirc; <br>
ter set in quotes i.e. &quot;abc &quot;. See the examples 3,
11, 12, and 13 for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b number[type] <br>
Specifies the size of the output file, only works if -o
START is used, i.e.: 60MB The output files will be in the
format of starting letter-ending letter for example: <br>
./crunch 4 5 -b 20mib -o START will generate 4 files:
aaaa-gvfed.txt, gvfee-ombqy.txt, ombqz-wcydt.txt,
wcydu-zzzzz.txt valid values for type are kb, mb, gb, kib,
mib, and <br>
gib. The first three types are based on 1000 while the last
three types are based on 1024. NOTE There is no space
between the number and type. For example 500mb is cor&acirc;
<br>
rect 500 mb is NOT correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c number <br>
Specifies the number of lines to write to output file, only
works if -o START is used, i.e.: 60 The output files will be
in the format of starting letter-ending letter <br>
for example: ./crunch 1 1 -f
/pentest/password/crunch/charset.lst
mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o START -c 60 will result in 2
files: a-7.txt and 8-&nbsp;.txt The reason for <br>
the slash in the second filename is the ending character is
space and ls has to escape it to print it. Yes you will need
to put in the &nbsp;when specifying the filename <br>
because the last character is a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d numbersymbol <br>
Limits the number of duplicate characters. -d 2@ limits the
lower case alphabet to output like aab and aac. aaa would
not be generated as that is 3 consecutive letters <br>
of a. The format is number then symbol where number is the
maximum number of consecutive characters and symbol is the
symbol of the the character set you want to limit <br>
i.e. @,%^ See examples 17-19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e string <br>
Specifies when crunch should stop early</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f /path/to/charset.lst
charset-name <br>
Specifies a character set from the charset.lst</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Inverts the output so instead
of aaa,aab,aac,aad, etc you get aaa,baa,caa,daa,aba,bba,
etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l When you use the -t option
this option tells crunch which symbols should be treated as
literals. This will allow you to use the placeholders as
letters in the pattern. The <br>
-l option should be the same length as the -t option. See
example 15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Merged with -p. Please use -p
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o wordlist.txt <br>
Specifies the file to write the output to, eg:
wordlist.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p charset OR -p word1 word2 ...
<br>
Tells crunch to generate words that don&rsquo;t have
repeating characters. By default crunch will generate a
wordlist size of #of_chars_in_charset ^ max_length. This
option <br>
will instead generate #of_chars_in_charset!. The ! stands
for factorial. For example say the charset is abc and max
length is 4.. Crunch will by default generate 3^4 = <br>
81 words. This option will instead generate 3! = 3x2x1 = 6
words (abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba). THIS MUST BE THE LAST
OPTION! This option CANNOT be used with -s and it <br>
ignores min and max length however you must still specify
two numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q filename.txt <br>
Tells crunch to read filename.txt and permute what is read.
This is like the -p option except it gets the input from
filename.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Tells crunch to resume
generate words from where it left off. -r only works if you
use -o. You must use the same command as the original
command used to generate the words. <br>
The only exception to this is the -s option. If your
original command used the -s option you MUST remove it
before you resume the session. Just add -r to the end of the
<br>
original command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s startblock <br>
Specifies a starting string, eg: 03god22fs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t @,%^ <br>
Specifies a pattern, eg: @@god@@@@ where the only the
@&rsquo;s, ,&rsquo;s, %&rsquo;s, and ^&rsquo;s will change.
<br>
@ will insert lower case characters <br>
, will insert upper case characters <br>
% will insert numbers <br>
^ will insert symbols</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
The -u option disables the printpercentage thread. This
should be the last option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z gzip, bzip2, lzma, and 7z
<br>
Compresses the output from the -o option. Valid parameters
are gzip, bzip2, lzma, and 7z. <br>
gzip is the fastest but the compression is minimal. bzip2 is
a little slower than gzip but has better compression. 7z is
slowest but has the best compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Example 1 <br>
crunch 1 8 <br>
crunch will display a wordlist that starts at a and ends at
zzzzzzzz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 2 <br>
crunch 1 6 abcdefg <br>
crunch will display a wordlist using the character set
abcdefg that starts at a and ends at gggggg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 3 <br>
crunch 1 6 abcdefg there is a space at the end of the
character string. In order for crunch to use the space you
will need to escape it using the &nbsp;character. In this
example you could also put <br>
quotes around the letters and not need the i.e.
&quot;abcdefg &quot;. Crunch will display a wordlist using
the character set abcdefg that starts at a and ends at (6
spaces)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 4 <br>
crunch 1 8 -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o
wordlist.txt <br>
crunch will use the mixalpha-numeric-all-space character set
from charset.lst and will write the wordlist to a file named
wordlist.txt. The file will start with a and end with &quot;
<br>
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 5 <br>
crunch 8 8 -f charset.lst mixalpha-numeric-all-space -o
wordlist.txt -t @@dog@@@ -s cbdogaaa <br>
crunch should generate a 8 character wordlist using the
mixalpha-number-all-space character set from charset.lst and
will write the wordlist to a file named wordlist.txt. The
<br>
file will start at cbdogaaa and end at &quot; dog &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 6 <br>
crunch 2 3 -f charset.lst ualpha -s BB <br>
crunch with start generating a wordlist at BB and end with
ZZZ. This is useful if you have to stop generating a
wordlist in the middle. Just do a tail wordlist.txt and set
the <br>
-s parameter to the next word in the sequence. Be sure to
rename the original wordlist BEFORE you begin as crunch will
overwrite the existing wordlist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 7 <br>
crunch 4 5 -p abc <br>
The numbers aren&rsquo;t processed but are needed. <br>
crunch will generate abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 8 <br>
crunch 4 5 -p dog cat bird <br>
The numbers aren&rsquo;t processed but are needed. <br>
crunch will generate birdcatdog, birddogcat, catbirddog,
catdogbird, dogbirdcat, dogcatbird.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 9 <br>
crunch 1 5 -o START -c 6000 -z bzip2 <br>
crunch will generate bzip2 compressed files with each file
containing 6000 words. The filenames of the compressed files
will be first_word-last_word.txt.bz2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># time ./crunch 1 4 -o START -c

3.8K aaaa-aiwt.txt.bz2 <br>
1.1K aaaa-aiwt.txt.lzma</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 10 <br>
crunch 4 5 -b 20mib -o START <br>
will generate 4 files: aaaa-gvfed.txt, gvfee-ombqy.txt,
ombqz-wcydt.txt, wcydu-zzzzz.txt <br>
the first three files are 20MBs (real power of 2 MegaBytes)
and the last file is 11MB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 11 <br>
crunch 3 3 abc + 123 !@# -t @%^ <br>
will generate a 3 character long word with a character as
the first character, and number as the second character, and
a symbol for the third character. The order in which you
<br>
specify the characters you want is important. You must
specify the order as lower case character, upper case
character, number, and symbol. If you aren&rsquo;t going to
use a partic&acirc; <br>
ular character set you use a plus sign as a placeholder. As
you can see I am not using the upper case character set so I
am using the plus sign placeholder. The above will <br>
start at a1! and end at c3#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 12 <br>
crunch 3 3 abc + 123 !@# -t ^%@ <br>
will generate 3 character words starting with !1a and ending
with #3c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 13 <br>
crunch 4 4 + + 123 + -t %%@^ <br>
the plus sign (+) is a place holder so you can specify a
character set for the character type. crunch will use the
default character set for the character type when crunch
<br>
encounters a + (plus sign) on the command line. You must
either specify values for each character type or use the
plus sign. I.E. if you have two characters types you MUST
<br>
either specify values for each type or use a plus sign. So
in this example the character sets will be: <br>
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz <br>
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <br>
123 <br>
!@#$%^&amp;*()-_+=~&lsquo;[]{}|;&quot;&rsquo;&lt;&gt;,.?/
<br>
there is a space at the end of the above string <br>
the output will start at 11a! and end at &quot;33z &quot;.
The quotes show the space at the end of the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 14 <br>
crunch 5 5 -t ddd@@ -o j -p dog cat bird <br>
any character other than one of the following: @,%^ <br>
is the placeholder for the words to permute. The @,%^
symbols have the same function as -t. <br>
If you want to use @,%^ in your output you can use the -l
option to specify which character you want crunch to treat
as a literal. <br>
So the results are <br>
birdcatdogaa <br>
birdcatdogab <br>
birdcatdogac <br>
&lt;skipped&gt; <br>
dogcatbirdzy <br>
dogcatbirdzz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 15 <br>
crunch 7 7 -t p@ss,%^ -l a@aaaaa <br>
crunch will now treat the @ symbol as a literal character
and not replace the character with a uppercase letter. <br>
this will generate <br>
p@ssA0! <br>
p@ssA0@ <br>
p@ssA0# <br>
p@ssA0$ <br>
&lt;skipped&gt; <br>
p@ssZ9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 16 <br>
crunch 5 5 -s @4#S2 -t @%^,2 -e @8 Q2 -l @dddd -b 10KB -o
START <br>
crunch will generate 5 character strings starting with @4#S2
and ending at @8 Q2. The output will be broken into 10KB
sized files named for the files starting and ending <br>
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 17 <br>
crunch 5 5 -d 2@ -t @@@%% <br>
crunch will generate 5 character strings staring with aab00
and ending at zzy99. Notice that aaa and zzz are not
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 18 <br>
crunch 10 10 -t @@@^%%%%^^ -d 2@ -d 3% -b 20mb -o START <br>
crunch will generate 10 character strings starting with
aab!0001!! and ending at zzy 9998 The output will be written
to 20mb files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 19 <br>
crunch 8 8 -d 2@ <br>
crunch will generate 8 characters that limit the same number
of lower case characters to 2. Crunch will start at aabaabaa
and end at zzyzzyzz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example 20 <br>
crunch 4 4 -f unicode_test.lst japanese -t @@%% -l @xdd <br>
crunch will load some Japanese characters from the
unicode_test character set file. The output will start at
@&aelig;&yen;00 and end at @&egrave;&ordf;99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REDIRECTION <br>
You can use crunch&rsquo;s output and pipe it into other
programs. The two most popular programs to pipe crunch into
are: aircrack-ng and airolib-ng. The syntax is as follows:
<br>
crunch 2 4 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz | aircrack-ng
/root/Mycapfile.cap -e MyESSID -w- <br>
crunch 10 10 12345 --stdout | airolib-ng testdb -import
passwd -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
1. Starting in version 2.6 crunch will display how much data
is about to be generated. In 2.7 it will also display how
many lines will be generated. Crunch will now wait 3
sec&acirc; <br>
onds BEFORE it begins generating data to give you time to
press Ctrl-C to abort crunch if you find the values are too
large for your application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. I have added hex-lower
(0123456789abcdef) and hex-upper (0123456789ABCDEF) to
charset.lst.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Several people have requested
that I add support for the space character to crunch. crunch
has always supported the space character on the command line
and in the <br>
charset.lst. To add a space on the command line you must
escape it using the / character. See example 3 for the
syntax. You may need to escape other characters like ! or #
<br>
depending on your operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Starting in 2.7 if you are
generating a file then every 10 seconds you will receive the
% done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Starting in 3.0 I had to
change the -t * character to a , as the * is a reserved
character. You could still use it if you put a &nbsp;in
front of the *. Yes it breaks crunch&rsquo;s <br>
syntax and I do my best to avoid doing that, but in this
instance it is easier to make the change for long term
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Some output is missing. A
file didn&rsquo;t get generated. <br>
The mostly explanation is you ran out of disk space. If you
have verified you have plenty of disk space then the problem
is most likely the filename begins with a period. In <br>
Linux filenames that begin with a period are hidden. To view
them do a ls -l .*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. Crunch says The maximum and
minimum length should be the same size as the pattern you
specified, however the length is set correctly. <br>
This usually means your pattern contains a character that
needs to be escaped. In bash you need to escape the
followings: &amp;, *, space, (, ), |, &rsquo;, &quot;, ;,
&lt;, &gt;. <br>
The escape character in bash is a . So a pattern that has a
&amp; and a * in it would look like this: <br>
crunch 4 4 -t @ <br>
An alternative to escaping characters is to wrap your string
with quotes. For example: <br>
crunch 4 4 -t &quot;&amp;*d@&quot; <br>
If you want to use the &quot; in your pattern you will need
to escape it like this: crunch 4 4 -t &quot;&amp;* <br>
Please note that different terminals have different escape
characters and probably have different characters that will
need escaping. Please check the manpage of your terminal
<br>
for the escape characters and characters that need
escaping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. When using the -z 7z option,
7z does not delete the original file. You will have to
delete those files by hand.</p>
