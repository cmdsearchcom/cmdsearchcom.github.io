<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debtree - show relationships between packages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debtree [options] package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Generates dependency graphs (in &lsquo;dot&rsquo; syntax)
for the specified package. The output is written to STDOUT
and can be used as input for the command dot(1) from the
package <br>
&lsquo;graphviz&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dependency graphs will by
default show (pre-)dependencies, recommended packages,
unversioned conflicts, and virtual packages provided by the
requested package. Optionally also <br>
suggested packages and versioned conflicts can be
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides graphs showing regular
dependencies, debtree can also generate graphs showing the
reverse dependencies of and the build dependencies for a
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dependency types <br>
The type of dependency between packages is by line type and
the color of the arrow indicating the dependency: <br>
Build-Depends: dark gold, bold <br>
Build-Depends-Indep: light gold <br>
Pre-Depends: purple, bold <br>
Depends: blue <br>
Recommends: black <br>
Suggests: black, dotted <br>
Conflicts: red <br>
Provides: green, inverted arrow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the version
requirements for versioned dependencies and conflicts will
be shown alongside the arrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternative dependencies <br>
Alternative dependencies will be shown within a single node
(a rectangular shape with horizontal lines separating the
packages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative dependency will
be indicated by a single arrow, unless one or more of the
dependencies are versioned. In that case a separate arrow
(ending at the relevant pack&acirc; <br>
age) showing the version requirement is drawn. Arrows for
dependencies on a package in a set of alternatives will
originate at the correct package in the set, though in some
<br>
cases this may be on the separation line between two
alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a package included in an
alternative dependency also needs to be displayed separately
or is also part of some other alternative dependency set,
its dependencies will only be <br>
included once, with the package&rsquo;s first occurrence.
For the secondary occurrences the package name will be shown
between square brackets: &lsquo;[...]&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the --show-installed
option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual packages <br>
Virtual packages will be shown as an octagonal shape with a
green inverted arrow from the providing package(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only a single package
provides the virtual package, this package (and its
dependencies) will be displayed in the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are multiple packages
that provide the virtual package, they will be shown within
a single node with rounded corners but only if there are
less than three (or the number <br>
set by the --max-providers option). If there are more than
that number, this will be indicated by an ellipsis
(&lsquo;...&rsquo;) in the node; no individual packages will
be shown but the <br>
number of providing packages is indicated alongside the
arrow. Dependencies of the providing packages will not be
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A regular dependency graph will
by default also show any virtual packages provided by the
requested binary package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown packages <br>
Packages that are listed as dependency, but that are unknown
in the package database will be displayed with a reddish
shade. In the case of alternative dependencies, the package
<br>
name will be shown between question marks:
&lsquo;?...?&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package versions <br>
If multiple versions of a package are available, the
dependency information for the highest available version
will be used, with one exception. If the --show-installed
option is <br>
used, the installed version will be used for packages that
are installed on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Managing graph size and
complexity <br>
debtree offers several mechanisms to help reduce the size of
dependency graphs of packages with large or complex
dependency trees. The first mechanism is to limit what types
of <br>
dependencies are included, for example excluding Recommended
or Conflicting packages from the graph. The second mechanism
is the configuration of lists of skip and end packages; <br>
see the section CONFIGURATION below for details. The last
mechanism is to place a hard limit on the depth of the
dependency tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to include
the dependencies of suggested packages. Doing so would in
almost all cases result in an explosion of the size of
graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some packages it is
unfortunately almost impossible to generate a usable
dependency graph due to the number of dependencies they
have. This is often the case for meta pack&acirc; <br>
ages, for example those for KDE or GNOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with
long options starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;). An
overview of supported options is included below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-installed, -I <br>
Show which packages are installed on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nodes for packages which are
installed on the system will be colored light green. For
alternative dependencies, only installed packages will be
included (an ellipsis <br>
is used to indicate omitted alternatives); for unsatisfied
alternative dependencies, all alternatives will be
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-rdeps, -R <br>
Also show reverse dependencies of the package and any
virtual packages it provides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reverse dependencies that are
not installed will be colored light yellow; installed ones
light blue. Displaying reverse dependencies of type Suggests
is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of the option
--show-installed in combination with this option is
recommended. See also the options --rdeps-depth and
--max-rdeps. This option is ignored if <br>
--build-dep is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-dep, -b <br>
Show build dependencies instead of package dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suggested packages will never be
included in a build dependency graph. If there are
alternative packages to satisfy a dependency, normally only
the first alternative will <br>
be shown. However, when used in combination with the
--show-installed option, all already installed alternatives
will be included for satisfied dependencies (unless the <br>
--no-alternatives option is also given).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch=architecture <br>
Specify the architecture (or &lsquo;all&rsquo;) for the
build dependency graph. If the option --buildep option is
not present, this option will be ignored. Default is the
architec&acirc; <br>
ture of the system on which the command is being run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If architecture
&lsquo;all&rsquo; is specified, all build dependencies will
be shown. If any build dependencies have &lsquo;architecture
conditions&rsquo;, those will be displayed in a graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an architecture is specified
(including the default), only build dependencies that are
relevant for that architecture will be shown; build
dependencies for other archi&acirc; <br>
tectures will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-suggests, -S <br>
Include suggested packages; dependencies of suggested
packages are never included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-recommends <br>
Don&rsquo;t show recommended packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will be ignored if
used in combination with the --with-suggests option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-alternatives <br>
Only show the first package from a set of alternative
dependencies. Effectively this shows what package would be
installed by default (in most cases).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-provides <br>
Don&rsquo;t show virtual packages provided by the requested
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-providers=number <br>
When there are multiple packages providing a virtual
package, only show the providing packages if there are less
than this number. Default is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-versions <br>
Don&rsquo;t show the versions for versioned
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conflicts <br>
Don&rsquo;t show unversioned conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--versioned-conflicts, -VC <br>
Include versioned conflicts; by default only unversioned
conflicts are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will be ignored if
used in combination with the --no-conflicts option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-depth=number <br>
Limit the number of levels of dependencies that is
traversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a limit to the
number of levels debtree will recurse when determining
dependencies. Packages at the specified level will be
treated as end packages (see <br>
section CONFIGURATION below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option can be used both to
reduce the size of graphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rdeps-depth=number <br>
The maximum number of levels for reverse dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default only one level is
displayed. Use this option to display more levels. Implies
--show-rdeps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-rdeps=number <br>
Limit the display of indirect reverse dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When displaying multiple levels
of reverse dependencies, a reverse dependency that itself
has a lot of reverse dependencies can really explode the
graph. By default up to <br>
5 indirect reverse dependencies are shown individually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-skip <br>
Also display dependencies that are suppressed by default
(e.g. libc6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selected, skip packages
will be treated as end packages instead. This means that
dependencies that by default are not included in graphs,
will now be shown, but <br>
their dependencies will not. See also the section
CONFIGURATION below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--show-all <br>
Display the full dependency tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When selected, all default
limits in the form of end and skip packages are disabled and
the full dependency graph for the package will be generated.
See also the section <br>
CONFIGURATION below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option implies the
--no-skip option, but can be used in combination with the
--max-depth option. Note that this option does not affect
the types of dependencies that <br>
are included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rotate, -r <br>
Draw the graph top-town instead of left-to-right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--condense <br>
Activates an option of dot(1) that can help reduce the
clutter in dense graphs by concentrating lines
(relationships) between packages together for parts of their
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet, -q <br>
Suppress any informational/warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v <br>
Increase verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displays additional
informational and debug messages; can be repeated up to
three times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
debtree can be configured to limit the size and complexity
of dependency graphs. This is done using two lists:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/debtree/skiplist,
~/.debtree/skiplist <br>
List of skip packages. Packages included in this list are
completely excluded from graphs. The list should only
contain dependencies that are so common that including them
<br>
in graphs only clutters the graph and does not really add
any information. Examples are libc6 and zlib1g. If an
alternative dependency contains only skip packages it will
<br>
be omitted; if it contains a mix of skip and non-skip
packages, the presence of the skip packages will be shown
using an ellipsis (&rsquo;...&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/debtree/endlist,
~/.debtree/endlist <br>
List of end packages. Packages included in this list are
shown in the graph, but their dependencies will not be
shown. A diamond shape is used to indicate an end package;
<br>
in the case of alternative dependencies, the package name
will be shown between braces: &lsquo;{...}&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preferably only packages that
offer a functionality that is somewhat distinct from its
reverse dependencies should be included in this list. In
some cases it may be neces&acirc; <br>
sary to also include packages because their dependency tree
is just too big or complex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a list is present under the
HOME directory of the user, that file will be used instead
of the default file in /etc/debtree/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the options --no-skip,
--show-all and --max-depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
