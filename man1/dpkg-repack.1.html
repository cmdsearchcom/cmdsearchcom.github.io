<p>dpkg-repack(1) dpkg suite dpkg-repack(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dpkg-repack - put an unpacked .deb file back together</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dpkg-repack [option...] package-name...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dpkg-repack creates a .deb file out of a Debian package that
has already been installed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any changes have been made to
the package while it was unpacked (e.g. conffiles files in
/etc modified), the new package will inherit the changes.
(There are exceptions to <br>
this, including changes to configuration files that are not
conffiles, including those managed by ucf.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This utility can make it easy to
copy packages from one computer to another, or to recreate
packages that are installed on your system, but no longer
available elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: dpkg-repack will place the
created package in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--root=dir <br>
Take package from filesystem rooted on dir. This is useful
if, for example, you have another computer nfs mounted on
/mnt, then you can use --root=/mnt to reassemble pack&acirc;
<br>
ages from that computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--arch=architecture <br>
Make the package be for a specific architecture. dpkg-repack
might not be able to tell if an installed package is
architecture all or is specific to the system&rsquo;s
archi&acirc; <br>
tecture, in case it lacks the Architecture field. If you
know the package architecture, you can use this option to
force dpkg-repack to use the right architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --deb-option=option <br>
Pass option as build argument to dpkg-deb. This option can
be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--generate <br>
Generate a temporary directory suitable for building a
package from, but do not actually create the package. This
is useful if you want to move files around in the package
<br>
before building it. The package can be built from this
temporary directory by running &quot;dpkg-deb --build dir
.&quot; as root (or by using fakroot -u), where dir is the
generated <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tag=thing[,...] <br>
Specify a comma-separated list of things to tag in the
package as having been repackaged. The current list of
things to tag is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none Tag nothing. This can be
specified first to be augmented by more specific things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">description <br>
Append a timestamped &quot;Repackaged by dpkg-repack&quot;
tagline to the package&rsquo;s control file Description
field. This tag is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
Append a &quot;+repack&quot; tag to the package version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Tag everything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package-name <br>
The name of the package to attempt to repack. Multiple
packages can be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
There is a tricky situation that can occur if you
dpkg-repack a package that has modified conffiles. The
modified conffiles are packed up. Now if you install the
package, dpkg(1) <br>
does not realize that the conffiles in it are modified. So
if you later upgrade to a new version of the package,
dpkg(1) will believe that the old (repacked) package has
older <br>
conffiles than the new version, and will silently replace
the conffiles with those in the package you are upgrading
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While dpkg-repack can be run
under fakeroot(1) and will work most of the time, fakeroot
-u must be used if any of the files to be repacked are owned
by non-root users. Otherwise <br>
the package will have them owned by root. dpkg-repack will
warn if you run it under fakeroot(1) without the -u
flag.</p>
