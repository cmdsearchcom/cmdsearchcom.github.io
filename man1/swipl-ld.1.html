<p>SWI(1) General Commands Manual SWI(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
swipl-ld - Create a SWI-Prolog embedded executable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
swipl-ld options c-files o-files pl-files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The utility swipl-ld is a front-end for the C-compiler and
linker to create a stand-alone executable from a series of
C/C++ and Prolog input files. It extracts information from
<br>
the SWI-Prolog executable swipl, after which it scans the
arguments and breaks them into several categories. It then
calls the C-compiler to create an executable containing the
<br>
user&rsquo;s C-code and the SWI-Prolog kernel. After this,
it will call the development environment to create a Prolog
saved state from the prolog files and finally it will create
the <br>
target executable by concatenating the state to the
emulator. See also qsave_program/2 from the SWI-Prolog
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-pl prolog <br>
Specifies the prolog version to use. The default is swipl.
This flag may be used to choose between different versions
installed on your system, or to specify a modified <br>
version. A modified version should understands the flags
-dump-runtime-variables -f file -F file -g goal -t
toplevel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Shows options briefly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nostate <br>
Just relinks the kernel. The newly linked kernel can only
function in the presence of the development system. Any
supplied prolog sourcefiles are ignored, and so are the <br>
options -goal -toplevel -initfile. -class This is the
preferred way to attach external modules to Prolog if
dynamic loading is not supported on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Compile C or C++ source-files
into object files. This turns swipl-ld into a replacement
for the C or C++ compiler where proper options such as the
location of the include <br>
directory are passed automatically to the compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Invoke the C preprocessor.
Used to make swipl-ld a replacement for the C or C++
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-shared <br>
Link C, C++ or object files into a shared object (DLL) that
can be loaded by the load_foreign_library/1 predicate. If
used with -c it sets the proper options to compile a <br>
C or C++ file ready for linking into a shared object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-embed-shared <br>
Embed SWI-Prolog into a DLL/Shared object rather than an
executable. See the reference manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dll Windows only Same as
-embed-shared Backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F base <br>
By default, none is passed to the swipl command to create
the saved state. Using -F xpce you can specify loading
xpce.rc, making XPCE available to the saved state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-goal goal <br>
The goal that is initially executed when the toplevel is
started using PL_toplevel(). E.i. the default. -g flag for
the new executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toplevel goal <br>
The goal that is executed as the main toplevel goal. E.i.
the default. -t flag for the new executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-initfile file <br>
The file that is loaded by the toplevel. E.i. the default.
-f flag for the new executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-class
{runtime,kernel,development} <br>
Set the save-class of the Prolog saved-state that is
created. If runtime (default), the resulting system leave
interpretation of all arguments to the application. If <br>
kernel all predicates will be locked for the tracer.
Finally, if development the state is saved
&lsquo;as-is&rsquo; and the resulting system processes
options just as the basic SWI- <br>
Prolog executable does. See also qsave_program/2 in the
SWI-Prolog reference manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation. This echos
the commands before executing them. Note that some commands
are printed as shell commands, but actually executed by
swipl-ld itself for <br>
compatibility with the Win32 platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Fake operation. Together with
-v this prints the commands that need to be executed without
actually doing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ecppargument ... <br>
If the first option is -E, all subsequent options are
appended and handed to the program selected by SWI-Prolog
configure to run cpp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Specifies the name of the final executable. The default is
a.out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc C-compiler <br>
Specify the compiler to use for *.c files. Default is the
compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog itself, as read from the
feature c_cc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c++ C++-compiler <br>
Specify the compiler to use for C++ input files. If the
C-compiler is gcc this is g++, otherwise c++ is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ld linker <br>
Specifies the linker to use. Default is the C-compiler. On
Win32 platforms, the default is link.exe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llibrary <br>
Specifies a C-library for linking the application. By
default, -lswipl as well as the libraries required by the
SWI-Prolog kernel will be passed to the C-compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Llibrary-directory <br>
Specifies an additional library directory for the
C-compiler. By default, the runtime directory for the
current architecture is passed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g|-I*|-D*|-U*|-O*|-W* <br>
Passed to the compiler as c-flags. By default, the
SWI-Prolog include directory is passed as additional include
directory. The following -D flags are added by swipl-ld:
<br>
-D__SWI_PROLOG__ and -D__SWI_EMBEDDED__.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pl-options* <br>
Specify additional options for swipl. The first character
following -pl-options determines the option-separator. The
remainder of the argument is split using this sepa&acirc;
<br>
rator and the parts are added to the option list for Prolog.
See also -cc-options and -ld-options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ld-options* <br>
Additional options passed to the linker. For example:
-ld-options,-Bstatic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cc-options* <br>
Additional options passed to both C- and C++-compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.o Passed as input files to the
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.c Compiled using the
C-compiler, after which the object-file is passed to the
linker. The object file is deleted at cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.cc|*.C|*.cxx|*.cpp <br>
Compiled using the C++-compiler, after which the object-file
is passed to the linker. The object file is deleted at
cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*.pl|*.qlf <br>
Passed as Prolog input files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Parsing the options and distributing them over the various
programs is probably incomplete. Feel free to modify it and
please forward generally useful modifications to bugs@swi-
<br>
prolog.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some care has to be taken that
the state created with qsave_program/2 is self-contained
(i.e. contains no references to the Prolog libraries). Also,
as the state is created <br>
using the development environment rather then the
user&rsquo;s emulator, the Prolog code cannot use directives
that rely on the C-code added by the user.</p>
