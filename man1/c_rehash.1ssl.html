<p>C_REHASH(1SSL) OpenSSL C_REHASH(1SSL)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
c_rehash - Create symbolic links to files named by the hash
values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
c_rehash [-old] [-h] [-n] [-v] [ directory...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
c_rehash scans directories and calculates a hash value of
each &quot;.pem&quot;, &quot;.crt&quot;, &quot;.cer&quot;,
or &quot;.crl&quot; file in the specified directory list and
creates symbolic links for each file, <br>
where the name of the link is the hash value. (If the
platform does not support symbolic links, a copy is made.)
This utility is useful as many programs that use OpenSSL
<br>
require directories to be set up like this in order to find
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any directories are named on
the command line, then those are processed in turn. If not,
then the SSL_CERT_DIR environment variable is consulted;
this shold be a colon- <br>
separated list of directories, like the Unix PATH variable.
If that is not set then the default directory
(installation-specific but often /usr/local/ssl/certs) is
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order for a directory to be
processed, the user must have write permissions on that
directory, otherwise it will be skipped. The links created
are of the form &quot;HHHHHHHH.D&quot;, <br>
where each H is a hexadecimal character and D is a single
decimal digit. When processing a directory, c_rehash will
first remove all links that have a name in that syntax. If
<br>
you have links in that format used for other purposes, they
will be removed. To skip the removal step, use the -n flag.
Hashes for CRL&rsquo;s look similar except the letter r <br>
appears after the period, like this:
&quot;HHHHHHHH.rD&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple objects may have the
same hash; they will be indicated by incrementing the D
value. Duplicates are found by comparing the full SHA-1
fingerprint. A warning will be <br>
displayed if a duplicate is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A warning will also be displayed
if there are files that cannot be parsed as either a
certificate or a CRL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program uses the openssl
program to compute the hashes and fingerprints. If not found
in the user&rsquo;s PATH, then set the OPENSSL environment
variable to the full pathname. Any <br>
program can be used, it will be invoked as follows for
either a certificate or CRL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$OPENSSL x509 -hash -fingerprint
-noout -in FILENAME <br>
$OPENSSL crl -hash -fingerprint -noout -in FILENAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where FILENAME is the filename.
It must output the hash of the file on the first line, and
the fingerprint on the second, optionally prefixed with some
text and an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-old <br>
Use old-style hashing (MD5, as opposed to SHA-1) for
generating links for releases before 1.0.0. Note that
current versions will not use the old style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display a brief usage
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not remove existing links.
This is needed when keeping new and old-style links in the
same directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print messages about old
links removed and new links created. By default, c_rehash
only lists each directory as it is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
OPENSSL <br>
The path to an executable to use to generate hashes and
fingerprints (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL_CERT_DIR <br>
Colon separated list of directories to operate on. Ignored
if directories are listed on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
openssl(1), crl(1). x509(1).</p>
