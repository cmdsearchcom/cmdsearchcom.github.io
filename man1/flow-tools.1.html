<b>flow-tools</b> &#x2014; Tool set for working with NetFlow data.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Flow-tools is library and a collection of programs used to collect, send,
  process, and generate reports from NetFlow data. The tools can be used
  together on a single server or distributed to multiple servers for large
  deployments. The flow-toools library provides an API for development of custom
  applications for NetFlow export versions 1,5,6 and the 14 currently defined
  version 8 subversions. A Perl and Python interface have been contributed and
  are included in the distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Flow data is collected and stored by default in host byte order, yet the files
  are portable across big and little endian architectures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Commands that utilize the network use a localip/remoteip/port designation for
  communication. &quot;localip&quot; is the IP address the host will use as a
  source for sending or bind to when receiving NetFlow PDU's (ie the destination
  address of the exporter. Configuring the &quot;localip&quot; to 0 will force
  the kernel to decide what IP address to use for sending and listen on all IP
  addresses for receiving. &quot;remoteip&quot; is the destination IP address
  used for sending or the expected address of the source when receiving. If the
  &quot;remoteip&quot; is 0 then the application will accept flows from any
  source address. The &quot;port&quot; is the UDP port number used for sending
  or receiving. When using multicast addresses the localip/remoteip/port is used
  to represent the source, group, and port respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Flows are exported from a router in a number of different configurable versions.
  A flow is a collection of key fields and additional data. The flow key is
  {srcaddr, dstaddr, input, output, srcport, dstport, prot, ToS}. Flow-tools
  supports one export version per file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Export versions 1, 5, 6, and 7 all maintain {nexthop, dPkts, dOctets, First,
  Last, flags}, ie the next-hop IP address, number of packets, number of octets
  (bytes), start time, end time, and flags such as the TCP header bits. Version
  5 adds the additional fields {src_as, dst_as, src_mask, dst_mask}, ie source
  AS, destination AS, source network mask, and destination network mask. Version
  7 which is specific to the Catalyst switches adds in addition to the version 5
  fields {router_sc}, which is the Router IP address which populates the flow
  cache shortcut in the Supervisor. Version 6 which is not officially supported
  by Cisco adds in addition to the version 5 fields {in_encaps, out_encaps,
  peer_nexthop}, ie the input and output interface encapsulation size, and the
  IP address of the next hop within the peer. Version 1 exports do not contain a
  sequence number and therefore should be avoided, although it is safe to store
  the data as version 1 if the additional fields are not used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Version 8 IOS NetFlow is a second level flow cache that reduces the data
  exported from the router. There are currently 11 formats, all of which provide
  {dFlows, dOctets, dPkts, First, Last} for the key fields.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  8.1 -  Source and Destination AS, Input and Output interface
  8.2 -  Protocol and Port
  8.3 -  Source Prefix and Input interface
  8.4 -  Destination Prefix and Output interface
  8.5 -  Source/Destination Prefix and Input/Output interface
  8.9 -  8.1 + ToS
  8.10 - 8.2 + ToS
  8.11 - 8.3 + ToS
  8.12 - 8.5 + ToS
  8.13 - 8.2 + ToS
  8.14 - 8.3 + ports + ToS
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Version 8 CatIOS NetFlow appears to be a less fine grained first level flow
  cache.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  8.6 - Destination IP, ToS, Marked ToS, 
  8.7 - Source/Destination IP, Input/Output interface, ToS, Marked ToS, 
  8.8 - Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination Port,
        Input/Output interface, ToS, Marked ToS, 
</pre>

The following programs are included in the flow-tools distribution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-capture</b> - Collect, compress, store, and manage disk space for
  exported flows from a router.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-cat</b> - Concatenate flow files. Typically flow files will contain a
  small window of 5 or 15 minutes of exports. Flow-cat can be used to append
  files for generating reports that span longer time periods.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-fanout</b> - Replicate NetFlow datagrams to unicast or multicast
  destinations. Flow-fanout is used to facilitate multiple collectors attached
  to a single router.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-report</b> - Generate reports for NetFlow data sets. Reports include
  source/destination IP pairs, source/destination AS, and top talkers. Over 50
  reports are currently supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-tag</b> - Tag flows based on IP address or AS #. Flow-tag is used to
  group flows by customer network. The tags can later be used with flow-fanout
  or flow-report to generate customer based traffic reports.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-filter</b> - Filter flows based on any of the export fields. Flow-filter
  is used in-line with other programs to generate reports based on flows
  matching filter expressions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-import</b> - Import data from ASCII or cflowd format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-export</b> - Export data to ASCII or cflowd format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-send</b> - Send data over the network using the NetFlow protocol.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-receive</b> - Receive exports using the NetFlow protocol without storing
  to disk like flow-capture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-gen</b> - Generate test data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-dscan</b> - Simple tool for detecting some types of network scanning and
  Denial of Service attacks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-merge</b> - Merge flow files in chronoligical order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-xlate</b> - Perform translations on some flow fields.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-expire</b> - Expire flows using the same policy of flow-capture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-header</b> - Display meta information in flow file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>flow-split</b> - Split flow files into smaller files based on size, time, or
  tags.
