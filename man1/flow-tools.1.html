<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
flow-tools &acirc; Tool set for working with NetFlow
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Flow-tools is library and a collection of programs used to
collect, send, process, and generate reports from NetFlow
data. The tools can be used together on a single server or
<br>
distributed to multiple servers for large deployments. The
flow-toools library provides an API for development of
custom applications for NetFlow export versions 1,5,6 and
the <br>
14 currently defined version 8 subversions. A Perl and
Python interface have been contributed and are included in
the distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flow data is collected and
stored by default in host byte order, yet the files are
portable across big and little endian architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands that utilize the
network use a localip/remoteip/port designation for
communication. &quot;localip&quot; is the IP address the
host will use as a source for sending or bind to <br>
when receiving NetFlow PDU&rsquo;s (ie the destination
address of the exporter. Configuring the &quot;localip&quot;
to 0 will force the kernel to decide what IP address to use
for sending and <br>
listen on all IP addresses for receiving.
&quot;remoteip&quot; is the destination IP address used for
sending or the expected address of the source when
receiving. If the &quot;remoteip&quot; is 0 <br>
then the application will accept flows from any source
address. The &quot;port&quot; is the UDP port number used
for sending or receiving. When using multicast addresses the
<br>
localip/remoteip/port is used to represent the source,
group, and port respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flows are exported from a router
in a number of different configurable versions. A flow is a
collection of key fields and additional data. The flow key
is {srcaddr, dstaddr, <br>
input, output, srcport, dstport, prot, ToS}. Flow-tools
supports one export version per file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Export versions 1, 5, 6, and 7
all maintain {nexthop, dPkts, dOctets, First, Last, flags},
ie the next-hop IP address, number of packets, number of
octets (bytes), start time, <br>
end time, and flags such as the TCP header bits. Version 5
adds the additional fields {src_as, dst_as, src_mask,
dst_mask}, ie source AS, destination AS, source network
mask, <br>
and destination network mask. Version 7 which is specific to
the Catalyst switches adds in addition to the version 5
fields {router_sc}, which is the Router IP address which
<br>
populates the flow cache shortcut in the Supervisor. Version
6 which is not officially supported by Cisco adds in
addition to the version 5 fields {in_encaps, out_encaps,
<br>
peer_nexthop}, ie the input and output interface
encapsulation size, and the IP address of the next hop
within the peer. Version 1 exports do not contain a sequence
number and <br>
therefore should be avoided, although it is safe to store
the data as version 1 if the additional fields are not
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 8 IOS NetFlow is a
second level flow cache that reduces the data exported from
the router. There are currently 11 formats, all of which
provide {dFlows, dOctets, dPkts, <br>
First, Last} for the key fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8.1 - Source and Destination AS,
Input and Output interface <br>
8.2 - Protocol and Port <br>
8.3 - Source Prefix and Input interface <br>
8.4 - Destination Prefix and Output interface <br>
8.5 - Source/Destination Prefix and Input/Output interface
<br>
8.9 - 8.1 + ToS <br>
8.10 - 8.2 + ToS <br>
8.11 - 8.3 + ToS <br>
8.12 - 8.5 + ToS <br>
8.13 - 8.2 + ToS <br>
8.14 - 8.3 + ports + ToS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 8 CatIOS NetFlow appears
to be a less fine grained first level flow cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8.6 - Destination IP, ToS,
Marked ToS, <br>
8.7 - Source/Destination IP, Input/Output interface, ToS,
Marked ToS, <br>
8.8 - Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination Port, <br>
Input/Output interface, ToS, Marked ToS,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following programs are
included in the flow-tools distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-capture - Collect,
compress, store, and manage disk space for exported flows
from a router.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-cat - Concatenate flow
files. Typically flow files will contain a small window of 5
or 15 minutes of exports. Flow-cat can be used to append
files for generating reports <br>
that span longer time periods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-fanout - Replicate NetFlow
datagrams to unicast or multicast destinations. Flow-fanout
is used to facilitate multiple collectors attached to a
single router.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-report - Generate reports
for NetFlow data sets. Reports include source/destination IP
pairs, source/destination AS, and top talkers. Over 50
reports are currently sup&acirc; <br>
ported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-tag - Tag flows based on IP
address or AS #. Flow-tag is used to group flows by customer
network. The tags can later be used with flow-fanout or
flow-report to generate <br>
customer based traffic reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-filter - Filter flows based
on any of the export fields. Flow-filter is used in-line
with other programs to generate reports based on flows
matching filter expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-import - Import data from
ASCII or cflowd format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-export - Export data to
ASCII or cflowd format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-send - Send data over the
network using the NetFlow protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-receive - Receive exports
using the NetFlow protocol without storing to disk like
flow-capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-gen - Generate test
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-dscan - Simple tool for
detecting some types of network scanning and Denial of
Service attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-merge - Merge flow files in
chronoligical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-xlate - Perform
translations on some flow fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-expire - Expire flows using
the same policy of flow-capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-header - Display meta
information in flow file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flow-split - Split flow files
into smaller files based on size, time, or tags.</p>
