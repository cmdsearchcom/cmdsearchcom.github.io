<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
wvdial - PPP dialer with built-in intelligence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
wvdial [ OPTIONS ] [ SECTION ] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
wvdial is an intelligent PPP dialer, which means that it
dials a modem and starts PPP in order to connect to the
Internet. It is something like the chat(8) program, except
that <br>
it uses heuristics to guess how to dial and log into your
server rather than forcing you to write a login script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When wvdial starts, it first
loads its configuration from /etc/wvdial.conf and
~/.wvdialrc which contains basic information about the modem
port, speed, and init string, along <br>
with information about your Internet Service Provider (ISP),
such as the phone number, your username, and your
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then it initializes your modem
and dials the server and waits for a connection (a CONNECT
string from the modem). It understands and responds to
typical connection problems <br>
(like BUSY and NO DIALTONE).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any time after connecting,
wvdial will start PPP if it sees a PPP sequence from the
server. Otherwise, it tries to convince the server to start
PPP by doing the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; responding to
any login/password prompts it sees;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; interpreting
&acirc;choose one of the following&acirc;-style menus;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; eventually,
sending the word &acirc;ppp&acirc; (a common terminal server
command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all of this fails, wvdial
just runs pppd(8) and hopes for the best. It will bring up
the connection, and then wait patiently for you to drop the
link by pressing CTRL-C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Several options are recognized by wvdial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --chat <br>
Run wvdial as a chat replacement from within pppd, instead
of the more normal method of having wvdial negotiate the
connection and then call pppd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --config=CONFIGFILE <br>
Run wvdial with CONFIGFILE as the configuration file,
instead of /etc/wvdial.conf. This is mainly useful only if
you want to have per-user configurations, or you want to
<br>
avoid having dial-up information (usernames, passwords,
calling card numbers, etc.) in a system wide configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remotename <br>
Override the Remote Name setting in the dialer configuration
section of the configuration file. This is mainly useful
when you dial to multiple systems with the same user <br>
name and password, and you don&rsquo;t want to use
inheritance to override this setting (which is the
recommended way to do it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-syslog <br>
Don&rsquo;t output debug information to the syslog daemon
(only useful together with --chat).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wvdial is normally run without
command line options, in which case it reads its
configuration from the [Dialer Defaults] section of
/etc/wvdial.conf. (The configuration file is <br>
described in more detail in wvdial.conf(5) manual page.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more SECTIONs of
/etc/wvdial.conf may be specified on the command line.
Settings in these sections will override settings in [Dialer
Defaults].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the command: <br>
wvdial phone2 <br>
will read default options from the [Dialer Defaults]
section, then override any or all of the options with those
found in the [Dialer phone2] section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one section is
specified, they are processed in the order they are given.
Each section will override all the sections that came before
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the command: <br>
wvdial phone2 pulse shh <br>
will read default options from the [Dialer Defaults]
section, then override any or all of the options with those
found in the [Dialer phone2] section, followed by the
[Dialer <br>
pulse] section, and lastly the [Dialer shh] section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using this method, it is
possible to easily configure wvdial to switch between
different internet providers, modem init strings, account
names, and so on without specifying the <br>
same configuration information over and over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
&acirc;Intelligent&acirc; programs are frustrating when they
don&rsquo;t work right. This version of wvdial has only
minimal support for disabling or overriding its
&acirc;intelligence&acirc;, with the <br>
&acirc;Stupid Mode&acirc;, &acirc;Login Prompt&acirc;, and
&acirc;Password Prompt&acirc; options. So, in general if you
have a nice ISP, it will probably work, and if you have a
weird ISP, it might not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Still, it&rsquo;s not much good
if it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, right? Don&rsquo;t be
fooled by the fact that wvdial finally made it to version
1.00; it could well contain many bugs and misfea&acirc; <br>
tures. Let us know if you have problems by sending e-mail to
&lt;wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may encounter some error
messages if you don&rsquo;t have write access to
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets.
Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s really no nice way around this
<br>
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/wvdial.conf <br>
Configuration file which contains modem, dialing, and login
information. See wvdial.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/dev/ttyS* <br>
Serial port devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/peers/wvdial <br>
Required for correct authentication in pppd version 2.3.0 or
newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/ppp/{pap,chap}-secrets <br>
Contains a list of usernames and passwords used by pppd for
authentication. wvdial maintains this list
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Dave Coombs and Avery Pennarun for Net Integration
Technologies. We would also like to thank SuSE and RedHat
for adding a number of various cool features to wvdial.
Thanks <br>
guys!</p>
