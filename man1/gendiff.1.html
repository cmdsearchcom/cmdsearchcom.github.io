<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gendiff - utility to aid in error-free diff file
generation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gendiff &lt;directory&gt; &lt;diff-extension&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gendiff is a rather simple script which aids in generating a
diff file from a single directory. It takes a directory name
and a &quot;diff-extension&quot; as its only arguments. The
diff <br>
extension should be a unique sequence of characters added to
the end of all original, unmodified files. The output of the
program is a diff file which may be applied with the <br>
patch program to recreate the changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual sequence of events for
creating a diff is to create two identical directories, make
changes in one directory, and then use the diff utility to
create a list of differ&acirc; <br>
ences between the two. Using gendiff eliminates the need for
the extra, original and unmodified directory copy. Instead,
only the individual files that are modified need to be <br>
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before editing a file, copy the
file, appending the extension you have chosen to the
filename. I.e. if you were going to edit somefile.cpp and
have chosen the extension &quot;fix&quot;, <br>
copy it to somefile.cpp.fix before editing it. Then edit the
first copy (somefile.cpp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After editing all the files you
need to edit in this fashion, enter the directory one level
above where your source code resides, and then type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gendiff somedirectory .fix
&gt; mydiff-fix.patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should redirect the output
to a file (as illustrated) unless you want to see the
results on stdout.</p>
