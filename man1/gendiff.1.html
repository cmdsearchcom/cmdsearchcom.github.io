<b>gendiff</b> is a rather simple script which aids in generating a diff file
  from a single directory. It takes a directory name and a
  &quot;diff-extension&quot; as its only arguments. The diff extension should be
  a unique sequence of characters added to the end of all original, unmodified
  files. The output of the program is a diff file which may be applied with the
  <b>patch</b> program to recreate the changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to create two identical
  directories, make changes in one directory, and then use the <b>diff</b>
  utility to create a list of differences between the two. Using gendiff
  eliminates the need for the extra, original and unmodified directory copy.
  Instead, only the individual files that are modified need to be saved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before editing a file, copy the file, appending the extension you have chosen to
  the filename. I.e. if you were going to edit somefile.cpp and have chosen the
  extension &quot;fix&quot;, copy it to somefile.cpp.fix before editing it. Then
  edit the first copy (somefile.cpp).
<div class="Pp"></div>
After editing all the files you need to edit in this fashion, enter the
  directory one level above where your source code resides, and then type
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
    $ gendiff somedirectory .fix &gt; mydiff-fix.patch
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should redirect the output to a file (as illustrated) unless you want to see
  the results on stdout.
