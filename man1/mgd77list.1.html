between the option flag and the associated arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mgd77list reads MGD77 files and produces an ASCII [or
binary] table. The MGD77 files contain track information
such as leg-id, time and position, geophysical observables
such as <br>
gravity, magnetics, and bathymetry, and control codes and
corrections such as Eotvos and diurnal corrections. The
MGD77+ extended netCDF files may also contain additional
user <br>
columns (for a listing of available columns, use mgd77info
-C, and to learn how to add your own custom columns, see
mgd77manage). The user may extract any combination of these
<br>
parameters, any of 8 computed quantities (distance, heading,
course-change, velocity, Carter correction, Eotvos
correction and gravity and magnetic global reference
fields), cal&acirc; <br>
endar sub-units of time (year, month, day, hour, min, sec),
the NGDC id, and finally a preset weight (see -W). A
sub-section can be specified by passing time- or
distance-inter&acirc; <br>
vals along track or by selecting a geographical region.
Finally, each output record may be required to pass any
number of logical tests involving data values or bit flags.
If <br>
multiple cruises are requested then they are separated by
segment headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS <br>
NGDC-ids <br>
Can be one or more of five kinds of specifiers:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. 8-character NGDC IDs, e.g.,
01010083, JA010010etc., etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. 2-character agency codes
which will return all cruises from each agency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. 4-character
&lt;agency&gt;&lt;vessel&gt; codes, which will return all
cruises from those vessels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. =list, where list is a table
with NGDC IDs, one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. If nothing is specified we
return all cruises in the data base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(See mgd77info -L for agency and
vessel codes). If no file extension is given then we search
for files with one of the four known extensions. The search
order (and the <br>
extensions) tried is MGD77+ (&acirc;.nc&acirc;), MGD77T
(&acirc;.m77t&acirc;), MGD77 (&acirc;.mgd77&acirc; ) and
plain text file (&acirc;.dat&acirc;). Use -I to ignore one
or more of these file types). Cruise files <br>
will be looked for first in the current directory and second
in all directories listed in $MGD77_HOME/mgd77_paths.txt [If
$MGD77_HOME is not set it will default to <br>
$GMT_SHAREDIR/mgd77].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Fcolumns[,logic][:bittests]
<br>
The required columns string must be a comma-separated list
of parameter abbreviations given in the desired output
order. Any parameters given in UPPER case must not be NaN

in a record for output to occur. Unless specified
separately, the output format (if ASCII) is controlled by
the GMT parameter FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT. The available column

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ngrav International Gravity
reference Field (&acirc;normal gravity&acirc;) (in mGal).
Field is selected based on the parameter Gravity Theoretical
Formula Code in the cruise&acirc;s MGD77 <br>
header. If this is not set or is invalid we default to the
IGF 1980. Alternatively, specify the field directly using
-Af (see that option for more details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ceot Calculated Eotvos
correction from navigation, using E = 7.5038 * V * cos(lat)
* sin(az) + 0.004154 * V^2 (in mGal). Sign: Correction is to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following short-hand flags
are also recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mgd77 This results in all 27
MGD77 fields being written out in the official MGD77
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mgd77t The full set of all 26
columns in the MGD77T specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geo This limits the output to 10
fields (time, lon, lat plus the seven geophysical
observations twt, depth, mtf1, mtf2, mag, gobs, and faa). By
appending + to either of <br>
these set we will also append dist, azim, cc, vel, and
weight as listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all This returns all data
columns in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allt As mgd77t but with time
items written as a date-time string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an option, logical tests may
be added for any of the observations by appending ,logic,
which is itself composed of one or more comma-separated
instructions of the form <br>
parOPvalue, where par is one of the parameters listed above,
OP is a logical operator (&lt;, &lt;=, =, !=, &gt;=, &gt;,
|), and value is a constant used in the comparison. Floating
<br>
point parameters are compared numerically; character
parameters are compared lexically (after leading and
trailing blanks have been removed). The bit comparison (|)
means <br>
that at least one of the bits in value must be turned on in
par. At least one of the tests must be true for the record
to be output, except for tests using UPPER case <br>
parameters which all must be true for output to occur.
Notes: (1) Specifying a test does not imply that the
corresponding column will be included in the output stream;
it <br>
must be present in columns for that to occur. (2) Some of
the operators are special UNIX characters and you are
advised to place quotes around the entire argument to -F.
<br>
(3) The logical tests only apply to observed data; derived
data (such as distances, velocities, etc.) must be limited
using program options such as -D, -Q, -S, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, for MGD77+ files you
may optionally append :bittests which is : (a colon)
followed by one or more comma-separated +-col terms. This
compares specific bitflags <br>
only for each listed column. Here, + means the chosen bit
must be 1 (ON) whereas - means it must be 0 (OFF). All bit
tests given must be passed. By default, MGD77+ files <br>
that have the special MGD77_flags column present will use
those flags, and observations associated with ON-bits
(meaning they are flagged as bad) will be set to NaN; <br>
append : with no trailing information to turn this behavior
off (i.e., no bit flags will be consulted). Note that these
record-based flags are different from any system&acirc; <br>
atic corrections along track; the latter are deactivated by
-T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS <br>
-A[+]c|d|f|m|tcode <br>
By default, corrected depth (depth), magnetic residual
anomaly (mag), free-air gravity anomaly (faa), and the
derived quantity Carter depth correction (carter) are all
<br>
output as is (if selected in -F); this option adjusts that
behavior. For each of these columns there are 2-4 ways to
adjust the data. Append c(arter), d(epth), f(aa), or <br>
m(ag) and select the code for the procedure you want
applied. You may select more than one procedure for a data
column by summing their numerical codes (1, 2, 4, and 8).
<br>
E.g., -Ac3 will first try method -Ac1 to estimate a Carter
correction but if depth is NaN we will next try -Ac2 which
only uses twt. In all cases, if any of the values <br>
required by an adjustment procedure is NaN then the result
will be NaN. This is also true if the original anomaly is
NaN. Specify -A+ to recalculate anomalies even if the <br>
anomaly in the file is NaN. Additionally, you can use -At to
create fake times for cruises that has no time; these are
based on distances and cruise duration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ac Determines how the carter
correction term is calculated. Below, C(twt) stands for the
Carter-corrected depth (it also depends on lon, lat), U(twt,
v) is the uncorrected <br>
depth (= twt * v / 2) using as v the &acirc;Assumed Sound
Velocity&acirc; parameter in the MGD77 header (if it is a
valid velocity, otherwise we default to 1500 m/s);
alternatively, <br>
append your preferred velocity v in m/s, TU(depth, v) is the
2-way travel time estimated from the (presumably)
uncorrected depth, and TC(depth) is the 2-way travel time
<br>
obtained by inverting the (presumably) corrected depth using
the Carter correction formula. Select from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ac1[,v] returns difference
between U(twt, v) and depth [Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ac2[,v] returns difference
between U(twt, v) and Carter (twt).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ac4[,v] returns difference
between (assumed uncorrected) depth and Carter
(TU(depth)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ac8[,v] returns difference
between U(TC(depth), v) and depth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ad Determines how the depth
column output is obtained:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ad1 returns depth as stored in
the data set [Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ad2[,v] returns calculated
uncorrected depth U(twt, v).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ad4 returns calculated
corrected depth C(twt).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Af Determines how the faa
column output is obtained. If ngrav (i.e., the International
Gravity reference Field (IGF), or &acirc;normal
gravity&acirc;) is required it is selected based on <br>
the MGD77 header parameter &acirc;Theoretical Gravity
Formula Code&acirc;; if this code is not present or is
invalid we default to 4. Alternatively, append the preferred
field (1-4) <br>
to select 1 (Heiskanen 1924), 2 (IGF 1930), 3 (IGF 1967) or
4 (IGF 1980). Select from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Af1[,field] returns faa as
stored in the data set [Default]. Optionally, sets the IGF
field to use if you also have requested ngrav as an output
column in -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Af2[,field] returns the
difference between gobs and ngrav (with optional field
directive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Af4[,field] returns the
combination of gobs + eot - ngrav (with optional field
directive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Af8[,field] returns the
combination of gobs + pred_eot - ngrav (with optional field
directive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Am Determines how the mag
column output is obtained. There may be one or two total
field measurements in the file (mtf1 and mtf2), and the
column msens may state which one is <br>
the leading sensor (1 or 2; it may also be undefined).
Select from</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Am1 returns mag as stored in
the data set [Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Am2 returns the difference
between mgfx and igrf, where x is the leading sensor (1 or
2) indicated by the msens data field (defaults to 1 if
unspecified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Am4 returns the difference
between mgfx and igrf, where x is the sensor (2 or 1) not
indicated by the msens data field (defaults to 2 if
unspecified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Amcoffset[unit] applies a
correction to compensate for the fact that the magnetic
field was not acquired at the same position as the
ship&acirc;s position [i.e., the naviga&acirc; <br>
tion]. This is accomplished by re-interpolating the total
magnetic field to what it would have been if it were
measured at the ship&acirc;s position (remember, it probably
was <br>
measured offset meters behind). Due to this interpolation
step, bad navigation, namely too many repeated points, may
cause trouble. Measures are taken to minimize this <br>
effect but they aren&acirc;t 100% fool proof. The
interpolation method is controlled by the GMT default
GMT_INTERPOLANT. Append e for meter, f for feet, k for km, M
for miles, n <br>
for nautical miles, or u for survey feet [Default is e
(meters)].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Cf|g|e <br>
Append a one-letter code to select the procedure for
along-track distance calculation (see -N for selecting
units):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Flat Earth distances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g Great circle distances
[Default].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Geodesic distances on current
GMT ellipsoid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dastartdate <br>
Do not list data collected before startdate
(yyyy-mm-ddT[hh:mm:ss]) [Default is start of cruise]. Use
-DA to exclude records whose time is undefined (i.e., NaN).
[Default <br>
reports those records].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dbstopdate <br>
Do not list data collected on or after stopdate
(yyyy-mm-ddT[hh:mm:ss]). [Default is end of cruise]. Use -DB
to exclude records whose time is undefined (i.e., NaN). <br>
[Default reports those records].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Exact match: Only output
records that match all the requested geophysical columns
[Default outputs records that matches at least one of the
observed columns].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gastartrec <br>
Do not list records before startrec [Default is 0, the first
record].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Gbstoprec <br>
Do not list data after stoprec. [Default is the last
record].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iignore <br>
Ignore certain data file formats from consideration. Append
a|c|m|t to ignore MGD77 ASCII, MGD77+ netCDF, MGD77T ASCII,
or plain tab-separated ASCII table files, respec&acirc; <br>
tively. The option may be repeated to ignore more than one
format. [Default ignores none].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L[corrtable] <br>
Apply optimal corrections to columns where such corrections
are available. Append the correction table to use [Default
uses the correction table mgd77_corrections.txt in <br>
the $MGD77_HOME directory]. For the format of this file, see
CORRECTIONS below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Issue a segment header record
with cruise ID for each cruise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Nd|sunit <br>
Append d for distance or s for speed, then give the desired
unit as e (meter or m/s), f (feet or feet/s), k (km or
km/hr), m (miles or miles/hr), n (nautical miles or <br>
knots), or u (survey feet or sfeet/s). [Default is -Ndk -Nse
(km and m/s)].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Qamin/max <br>
Specify an accepted range (min/max) of azimuths. Records
whose track azimuth falls outside this range are ignored
[0/360].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Qcmin/max <br>
Specify an accepted range (min/max) of course changes.
Records whose track course change falls outside this range
are ignored [-360/+360]. Use -QC to take the absolute <br>
value of the course change before the test [Default uses
signed course changes].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Qvmin/max <br>
Specify an accepted range (min/max; or just min if there is
no upper limit) of velocities. Records whose track speed
falls outside this range are ignored [0/infinity].</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Rwest/east/south/north[/zmin/zmax][+r][+uunit]
<br>
west, east, south, and north specify the region of interest,
and you may specify them in decimal degrees or in
[&Acirc;&plusmn;]dd:mm[:ss.xxx][W|E|S|N] format Append +r if
lower left <br>
and upper right map coordinates are given instead of
w/e/s/n. The two shorthands -Rg and -Rd stand for global
domain (0/360 and -180/+180 in longitude respectively, with
<br>
-90/+90 in latitude). Alternatively for grid creation, give
Rcodelon/lat/nx/ny, where code is a 2-character combination
of L, C, R (for left, center, or right) and T, M, <br>
B for top, middle, or bottom. e.g., BL for lower left. This
indicates which point on a rectangular region the lon/lat
coordinate refers to, and the grid dimensions nx and <br>
ny with grid spacings via -I is used to create the
corresponding region. Alternatively, specify the name of an
existing grid file and the -R settings (and grid spacing,
<br>
if applicable) are copied from the grid. Appending +uunit
expects projected (Cartesian) coordinates compatible with
chosen -J and we inversely project to determine actual <br>
rectangular geographic region. For perspective view (-p),
optionally append /zmin/zmax. In case of perspective view
(-p), a z-range (zmin, zmax) can be appended to indi&acirc;
<br>
cate the third dimension. This needs to be done only when
using the -Jz option, not when using only the -p option. In
the latter case a perspective view of the plane is <br>
plotted, with no third dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sastartdist[unit] <br>
Do not list data that are less than startdist meter along
track from port of departure. Append e for meter, f for
feet, k for km, m for miles, n for nautical miles, or u <br>
for survey feet [Default is 0e (meters)].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sbstopdist[unit] <br>
Do not list data that are stopdist or more meters along
track from port of departure. Append e for meter, f for
feet, k for km, m for miles, n for nautical miles, or u for
<br>
survey feet [Default is end of track].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T[m|e] <br>
Turns OFF the otherwise automatic adjustment of values based
on correction terms that are stored in the MGD77+ file and
used to counteract such things as wrong units used <br>
by the source institution when creating the original MGD77
file from which the MGD77+ file derives (the option has no
effect on plain MGD77 ASCII files). Append m or e to <br>
limit the option to the MGD77 or extended columns set only
[Default applies to both]. Note that record-based E77 flags
(MGD77+ format only) are not considered systematic <br>
corrections. Instead, the application of these bit-flags can
be controlled via the : (colon) modifier to OPT(F).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[level] (more &acirc;&brvbar;)
<br>
Select verbosity level [c].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wweight <br>
Set the weight for these data. Weight output option must be
set in -F. This is useful if the data are to be processed
with the weighted averaging techniques offered by <br>
blockmean, blockmedian, and blockmode [1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z+|- Append the sign you want
for depth, carter, and msd values below sea level (-Z- gives
negative bathymetry) [Default is positive down].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bo[ncols][type] (more
&acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Select native binary output. ignored if -bo is selected.
Likewise, string-fields cannot be selected. Note that if
time is one of the binary output columns it will be <br>
stored as Unix-time (seconds since 1970). To read this
information in GMT to obtain absolute calendar time will
require you to use --TIME_SYSTEM=1.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h[i|o][n][+c][+d][+rremark][+rtitle]
(more &acirc;&brvbar;) <br>
Skip or produce header record(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-^ or just - <br>
Print a short message about the syntax of the command, then

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To get a (distance, heading, gravity, bathymetry) listing
from 01010047.mgd77, starting at June 3 1971 20:45 and
ending at distance = 5000 km, use the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt mgd77list 01010047
-Da1971-06-03T20:45 -Sb5000 -Fdist,azim,faa,depth &gt;
myfile.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make input for blockmean and
surface using free-air anomalies from all the cruises listed
in the file cruises.lis, but only the data that are inside
the specified area, and <br>
make the output binary:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt mgd77list &lsquo;cat
cruises.lis&lsquo; -Flon,lat,faa -R-40/-30/25/35 -bo &gt;
allgrav.b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract the locations of
depths exceeding 9000 meter that were not interpolated (btc
!= 1) from all the cruises listed in the file
cruises.lis:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt mgd77list &lsquo;cat
cruises.lis&lsquo; -F&quot;depth,DEPTH&gt;9000,BTC!=1&quot;
&gt; really_deep.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To extract dist, faa, and
grav12_2 from records whose depths are shallower than 3 km
and where none of the requested fields are NaN, from all the
MGD77+ netCDF files whose cruise <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt mgd77list &lsquo;cat

-F&quot;dist,faa,grav12_2,depth&lt;3000&quot; &gt;

are listed in the file cruises.lis, but only retrieve
records whose bitflag for faa indicates <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To output lon, lat, mag, and faa
from all the cruises listed in the file cruises.lis, but
recalculate the two residuals based on the latest reference
fields, try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gmt mgd77list &lsquo;cat
cruises.lis&lsquo; -Flon,lat,mag,faa -Af2,4 -Am2 &gt;
data.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RECALCULATED ANOMALIES <br>
When recalculated anomalies are requested (either explicitly
via the -A option or implicitly via E77 metadata in the
MGD77+ file) we only do so for the records whose original
<br>
anomaly was not a NaN. This restriction is implemented since
many anomaly columns contains corrections, usually in the
form of hand-edited changes, that cannot be duplicated from
<br>
the corresponding observation.</p>

C via f2c by Joaquim Luis, U Algarve, and adapted to <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CORRECTIONS <br>
The correction table is an ASCII file with coefficients and
parameters needed to carry out corrections. Comment records
beginning with # are allowed. All correction records are
<br>
of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cruiseID observation
correction</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where cruiseID is a NGDC prefix,
observation is one of the abbreviations for geophysical
observations listed under -F above, and correction consists
of one or more terms that <br>
will be summed up and then subtracted from the observation
before output. Each term must have this exact syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">factor[*[function]([scale](abbrev[-origin]))[^power]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where terms in brackets are
optional (the brackets themselves are not used but regular
parentheses must be used as indicated). No spaces are
allowed except between terms. The <br>
factor is the amplitude of the basis function, while the
optional function can be one of sin, cos, or exp. The
optional scale and origin can be used to translate the
argument <br>
(before giving it to the optional function). The argument
abbrev is one of the abbreviations for observations listed
above. If origin is given as T it means that we should <br>
replace it with the value of abbrev for the very first
record in the file (this is usually only done for time). If
the first record entry is NaN we revert origin to zero.
Option&acirc; <br>
ally, raise the entire expression to the given power, before
multiplying by the amplitude. The following is an example of
fictitious corrections to the cruise 99999999, implying <br>
the depth should have the Carter correction removed, faa
should have a linear trend removed, the magnetic anomaly
(mag) should be corrected by a strange dependency on ship
head&acirc; <br>
ing and latitude, and gobs needs to have 10 mGal added
(hence given as -10):</p>
