<p>TALK(1) BSD General Commands Manual TALK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
talk &acirc; talk to another user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
talk person [-x] [ttyname]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Talk is a visual communication program which copies lines
from your terminal to that of another user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">person If you wish to talk to
someone on your own machine, then person is just the
person&rsquo;s login name. If you wish to talk to a user on
another host, then person is of the form <br>
&acirc;user@host&acirc; ( or &acirc;host.user&acirc; or
&acirc;host!user&acirc; or &acirc;host:user&acirc; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x If you wish to talk to a user
who has dot character in username, the -x argument will
force &acirc;user@host&acirc; form of the person and talk
will take dots as part of user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ttyname If you wish to talk to a
user who is logged in more than once, the ttyname argument
may be used to indicate the appropriate terminal name, where
ttyname is of the form <br>
&acirc;ttyXX&acirc; or &acirc;pts/X&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When first called, talk contacts
the talk daemon on the other user&rsquo;s machine, which
sends the message <br>
Message from TalkDaemon@his_machine... <br>
talk: connection requested by your_name@your_machine. <br>
talk: respond with: talk your_name@your_machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to that user. At this point, he
then replies by typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">talk your_name@your_machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It doesn&rsquo;t matter from
which machine the recipient replies, as long as his login
name is the same. Once communication is established, the two
parties may type simultaneously; <br>
their output will appear in separate windows. Typing
control-L (^L) will cause the screen to be reprinted. The
erase, kill line, and word erase characters (normally ^H,
^U, and ^W <br>
respectively) will behave normally. To exit, just type the
interrupt character (normally ^C); talk then moves the
cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores the terminal
to <br>
its previous state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of netkit-ntalk 0.15 talk
supports scrollback; use esc-p and esc-n to scroll your
window, and ctrl-p and ctrl-n to scroll the other window.
These keys are now opposite from the <br>
way they were in 0.16; while this will probably be confusing
at first, the rationale is that the key combinations with
escape are harder to type and should therefore be used to
<br>
scroll one&rsquo;s own screen, since one needs to do that
much less often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do not want to receive
talk requests, you may block them using the mesg(1) command.
By default, talk requests are normally not blocked. Certain
commands, in particular <br>
nroff(1), pine(1), and pr(1), may block messages temporarily
in order to prevent messy output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/hosts to find the recipient&rsquo;s machine <br>
/var/run/utmp to find the recipient&rsquo;s tty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mail(1), mesg(1), who(1), write(1), talkd(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The protocol used to communicate with the talk daemon is
braindead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, the version of talk(1)
released with 4.2BSD uses a different and even more
braindead protocol that is completely incompatible. Some
vendor Unixes (particularly those from <br>
Sun) have been found to use this old protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Old versions of talk may have
trouble running on machines with more than one IP address,
such as machines with dynamic SLIP or PPP connections. This
problem is fixed as of netkit- <br>
ntalk 0.11, but may affect people you are trying to
communicate with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The talk command appeared in 4.2BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux NetKit (0.17) November 24,
1999 Linux NetKit (0.17)</p>
