<p>AUTOINST(1) Marc Penninga AUTOINST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
autoinst - wrapper around the LCDF TypeTools, for installing
OpenType fonts in LaTeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
autoinst [options] fontfile(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Eddie Kohler&rsquo;s LCDF TypeTools are superb tools for
installing OpenType fonts in LaTeX, but they can be hard to
use: they need many, often long, command lines and
don&rsquo;t generate <br>
the fd and sty files LaTeX needs. autoinst simplifies the
use of the TypeTools for font installation by generating and
executing all commands for otftotfm and by creating and <br>
installing all necessary fd and sty files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given a family of font files (in
otf or ttf format), autoinst will create several LaTeX font
families:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Four text families (with
lining and oldstyle digits, in both tabular and proportional
variants), each with the following shapes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Roman text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it, sl Italic and slanted
(sometimes called oblique) text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc Small caps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sw Swash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tl Titling shape. Meant for
all-caps text only (even though it sometimes contains
lowercase glyphs as well), where letterspacing and the
positioning of punctuation <br>
characters have been adjusted to suit all-caps text. (This
shape is only generated for the families with lining digits,
since old-style digits make no sense with <br>
all-caps text.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scit, scsl <br>
Italic and slanted small caps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nw &quot;Upright swash&quot;;
usually normal text with &quot;oldstyle&quot; ligatures such
as ct, sp and st.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tlit, tlsl <br>
Italic and slanted titling text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- For each text family: a family
of TS1-encoded symbol fonts, in roman, italic and slanted
shapes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Four families with superiors,
inferiors, numerators and denominators, in roman, italic and
slanted shapes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- An ornament family, in roman,
italic and slanted shapes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, if the fonts
don&rsquo;t contain italics, oldstyle digits, small caps
etc., the corresponding shapes and families are not created.
Furthermore, the creation of most <br>
families and shapes can be controlled by command-line
options (see &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These families use the FontPro
project&rsquo;s naming scheme:
&lt;FontFamily&gt;-&lt;Suffix&gt;, where &lt;Suffix&gt;
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LF proportional (i.e., figures
have varying widths) lining figures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TLF tabular (i.e., all figures
have the same width) lining figures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OsF proportional oldstyle
figures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOsF tabular oldstyle
figures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sup superior characters (many
fonts have only an incomplete set of superior characters:
digits, some punctuation and the letters abdeilmnorst;
normal forms are used for other <br>
characters)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inf inferior characters; usually
only digits and some punctuation, normal forms for other
characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Orn ornaments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numr numerators</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dnom denominators</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated fonts are named
&lt;FontName&gt;-&lt;suffix&gt;-&lt;shape&gt;-&lt;enc&gt;,
where &lt;suffix&gt; is the same as above (but in
lowercase), &lt;shape&gt; is either empty, &quot;sc&quot;,
&quot;swash&quot; or &quot;titling&quot;, and <br>
&lt;enc&gt; is the encoding. A typical name in this scheme
is &quot;LinLibertineO-osf-sc-ly1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the choice of text encoding
<br>
By default, autoinst generates text fonts with OT1, T1 and
LY1 encodings, and the generated style files use LY1 as the
default text encoding. LY1 has been chosen over T1 because
<br>
it has some empty slots to accomodate the additional
ligatures provided by many OpenType fonts. Different
encodings can be chosen using the -encoding command-line
option (see <br>
&quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot; below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the fonts in your LaTeX
documents <br>
autoinst generates a style file for using the font in LaTeX
documents, named &lt;FontFamily&gt;.sty. This style file
also takes care of loading the fontenc and textcomp
packages. To <br>
use the font, simply put
&quot;sepackage{&lt;FontFamily&gt;}&quot; in the preamble of
your document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This style file defines a number
of options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;lining&quot;,
&quot;oldstyle&quot;, &quot;tabular&quot;,
&quot;proportional&quot; <br>
Choose which figure style to use. The defaults are
&quot;oldstyle&quot; and &quot;proportional&quot; (if
available).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;scale=&lt;number&gt;&quot;
<br>
Scale the font by a factor of &lt;number&gt;. For example:
to increase the size of the font by 5%, use
&quot;sepackage[scale=1.05]{&lt;FontFamily&gt;}&quot;. May
also be spelled &quot;scaled&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only available
when you have the xkeyval package installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ultrablack&quot;,
&quot;ultrabold&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;,
&quot;extrablack&quot;, &quot;black&quot;,
&quot;extrabold&quot;, &quot;demibold&quot;,
&quot;semibold&quot;, &quot;bold&quot; <br>
Choose the weight that LaTeX will use for the
&quot;bold&quot; weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;light&quot;,
&quot;medium&quot;, &quot;regular&quot; <br>
Choose the weight that LaTeX will use for the
&quot;regular&quot; weight.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These last two groups of options
will only work if you have the mweights package
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The style file will also try to
load the fontaxes package (available on CTAN), which gives
easy access to various font shapes and styles. Using the
machinery set up by fontaxes, <br>
the generated style file defines a number of commands (which
take the text to be typeset as argument) and declarations
(which don&rsquo;t take arguments, but affect all text up to
the <br>
end of the current group) of its own:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DECLARATION COMMAND SHORT FORM
OF COMMAND</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lshape exttitling exttl <br>
igures extsuperior extsu <br>
infigures extinferior extin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the
&quot;hape&quot; and &quot;extsw&quot; commands are
redefined to place swash on the secondary shape axis
(fontaxes places it on the primary shape axis); this makes
these <br>
commands behave properly when nested, so that
&quot;hapepshape&quot; will give upright swash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no commands for
accessing the numerator and denominator fonts; these can be
selected using fontaxes&rsquo; standard commands, e.g.,
&quot;ntfigurestyle{numerator}ectfont&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The style file also provides a
command &quot;e&gt;}&quot;, where &quot;&lt;number&gt;&quot;
is a number from 0 to the total number of ornaments minus
one. Ornaments are always typeset using <br>
the current family, series and shape. A list of all
ornaments in a font can be created by running LaTeX on the
file nfssfont.tex (part of a standard LaTeX installation)
and <br>
supplying the name of the ornament font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To access the ornaments,
autoinst creates a font-specific encoding file
&lt;FontFamily&gt;_orn.enc, but only if that file
doesn&rsquo;t yet exist in the current directory. This is a
<br>
deliberate feature that allows you to provide your own
encoding vector, e.g. if your fonts use non-standard glyph
names for ornaments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These commands are only
generated for existing shapes and number styles; no commands
are generated for shapes and styles that don&rsquo;t exist,
or whose generation has been turned off <br>
using command-line options. Also: these commands are built
on top of fontaxes; if that package cannot be found,
you&rsquo;re limited to using the lower-level commands from
standard <br>
NFSS (&quot;ntfamily&quot;, &quot;ntseries&quot;,
&quot;ntshape&quot; etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using multiple font families in
one document <br>
Style files generated by versions of autoinst older dand
2013-07-25 redefined &quot;default&quot; and
&quot;eault&quot;, whereas newer style files use the
mweights package instead. If you <br>
use multiple autoinst-generated font familes in the same
document, it is best if all style files are generated by the
same version of autoinst; re-generate the older families if
<br>
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NFSS codes <br>
NFSS identifies fonts by a combination of family, series
(weight plus width), shape and size. autoinst parses the
output of &quot;otfinfo --info&quot; to determine these
parameters. When <br>
this fails (e.g., because the font family contains uncommon
widths or weights), autoinst ends up with different fonts
having the same values for these font parameters, which <br>
means that these fonts cannot be used in NFSS. In that case,
autoinst will split the font family into multiple
subfamilies (based on each font file&rsquo;s
&quot;Subfamily&quot; value) and try <br>
again. (Since many font vendors misunderstand the
&quot;Subfamily&quot; concept and make each font file its
own separate subfamily, this strategy is only used as a last
resort.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If such a proliferation of font
families is unwanted, either run autoinst on a smaller set
of fonts or add the missing widths, weights and shapes to
the tables %FD_WIDTH, <br>
%FD_WEIGHT and %FD_SHAPE, at the top of the source code.
Please also send a bug report (see AUTHOR below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autoinst maps widths, weights
and shapes to NFSS codes using the following tables. These
are based as much as possible on the standard Fontname
scheme and Philipp Lehman&rsquo;s Font <br>
Installation Guide, but some changes were made to avoid name
clashes in font families with many widths and weights.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WEIGHT WIDTH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thin t Ultra Compressed up <br>
Ultra Light ul Extra Compressed ep <br>
Extra Light el Compressed p <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1] When both weight and width
are empty, the &quot;series&quot; attribute becomes
&quot;m&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2] Adobe Silentium Pro contains
two &quot;Roman&quot; shapes (&quot;RomanI&quot; and
&quot;RomanII&quot;); the first of these is mapped to
&quot;n&quot;, the second one to &quot;it&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[3] New in release 2014-01-21;
before that, slanted fonts were mapped to
&quot;it&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A note for MiKTeX users <br>
Automatically installing the fonts into a suitable TEXMF
tree (as autoinst does by default) requires a
TeX-installation that uses the kpathsea library; with TeX
distributions <br>
that implement their own directory searching (such as
MiKTeX), autoinst will complain that it cannot find the
kpsewhich program and install all generated files into <br>
subdirectories of the current directory. If you use such a
TeX distribution, you should either move these files to
their correct destinations by hand, or use the -target
option <br>
(see &quot;COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS&quot; below) to specify a
TEXMF tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, some OpenType fonts may
lead to pl and vpl files that are too big for MiKTeX&rsquo;s
pltotf and vptovf; the versions that come with W32TeX
(http://www.w32tex.org) and TeXLive <br>
(http://tug.org/texlive) don&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
autoinst tries hard to do The Right Thing (TM) by default,
so in many cases you won&rsquo;t need these options; but
most aspects of its operation can be changed if you want
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may use either one or two
dashes before options, and option names may be shortened to
a unique prefix (e.g., -encoding may be abbreviated to -enc
or even -en, but -e is <br>
ambiguous (-encoding, -extra).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dryrun <br>
Don&rsquo;t actually generate any fonts and files, only
create a logfile showing which fonts would be generated. By
default, this information is written to autoinst.log; use
the <br>
-logfile option to specify a different filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-encoding=encoding[,encoding]
<br>
Generate the specified encoding(s) for the text fonts. The
default is &quot;OT1,T1,LY1&quot;. For each encoding, a file
&lt;encoding&gt;.enc (lowercase) should be somewhere where
otftotfm <br>
can find it. Suitable encoding files for OT1, T1/TS1 and LY1
come with autoinst. (These files are called fontools_ot1.enc
etc. to avoid name clashes with other packages; the <br>
&quot;fontools_&quot; prefix may be omitted.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple text encodings can be
specified as a comma-separated list:
&quot;-encoding=OT1,T1&quot;. The encodings are passed to
fontenc in the order specified, so the last one will be <br>
the default text encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ts1 / -nots1 <br>
Control the creation of TS1-encoded fonts. The default is
-ts1 if the text encodings (see -encoding above) include T1,
-nots1 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sanserif <br>
Install the font as a sanserif font, accessed via
&quot;amily&quot; and &quot;extsf&quot;. The generated style
file redefines &quot;milydefault&quot;, so including it will
still make this font <br>
the default text font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-typewriter <br>
Install the font as a typewriter font, accessed via
&quot;tfamily&quot; and &quot;exttt&quot;. The generated
style file redefines &quot;milydefault&quot;, so including
it will still make this font <br>
the default text font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lining / -nolining <br>
Control the creation of fonts with lining figures. The
default is -lining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oldstyle / -nooldstyle <br>
Control the creation of fonts with oldstyle figures. The
default is -oldstyle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-proportional / -noproportional
<br>
Control the creation of fonts with proportional figures. The
default is -proportional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tabular / -notabular <br>
Control the creation of fonts with tabular figures. The
default is -tabular.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smallcaps / -nosmallcaps <br>
Control the creation of small caps fonts. The default is
-smallcaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-swash / -noswash <br>
Control the creation of swash fonts. The default is
-swash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-titling / -notitling <br>
Control the creation of titling fonts. The default is
-titling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-superiors / -nosuperiors <br>
Control the creation of fonts with superior characters. The
default is -superiors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inferiors / -noinferiors <br>
Control the creation of fonts with inferior digits. The
default is -noinferiors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fractions / -nofractions <br>
Control the creation of fonts with numerators and
denominators. The default is -nofractions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ornaments / -noornaments <br>
Control the creation of ornament fonts. The default is
-ornaments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Verbose mode; print detailed information about which fonts
autoinst is generating. By default, this information is
written to autoinst.log; a different filename can be <br>
specified using the -logfile option. Repeat this option for
even more detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile=LOGFILE <br>
Write the logging information to LOGFILE instead of
autoinst.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-defaultlining /
-defaultoldstyle <br>
-defaulttabular / -defaultproportional <br>
Tell autoinst which figure style is the current font
family&rsquo;s default (i.e., which figures you get when you
don&rsquo;t specify any OpenType features).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t use these options
unless you are certain you need them! They are only needed
for fonts that don&rsquo;t provide OpenType features for
their default figure style; and even in <br>
that case, the default values (-defaultlining and
-defaulttabular) are usually correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-figurekern / -nofigurekern <br>
Some fonts provide kerning pairs for tabular figures. This
is very probably not what you want (e.g., numbers in tables
won&rsquo;t line up exactly). The option -nofigurekern adds
<br>
extra --ligkern options to the commands for otftotfm to
suppress such kerns (but of course only for the families
with tabular figures). Since this leads to very long <br>
commands (one hundred such options in total!) and the
problem only occurs in very few fonts, the default is
-figurekern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extra=text <br>
Add text to the command line to otftotfm. To prevent text
from accidentily being interpreted as options to autoinst,
it should be properly quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-manual <br>
Manual mode. By default, autoinst executes all otftotfm
commands it generates; with the -manual option, these
commands are instead written to a file autoinst.bat. Also,
the <br>
generated otftotfm commands specify the --pl option (which
tells otftotfm to generate human readable/editable pl and
vpl files instead of the default tfm and vf files) and <br>
omit the --automatic option (which causes otftotfm to leave
all generated files in the current directory, rather than
install them into your TEXMF tree).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using this option, you
should run pltotf and vptovf after executing all commands,
to convert the pl and vf files to tfm and vf format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are only
meaningful in automatic mode, and hence ignored in manual
mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-target=DIRECTORY <br>
Install all generated files into the TEXMF tree at
DIRECTORY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, autoinst searches
your $TEXMFLOCAL and $TEXMFHOME paths and installs all files
into subdirectories of the first writable TEXMF tree it
finds (or into <br>
subdirectories of the current directory, if no writable
directory is found).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vendor=VENDOR <br>
-typeface=TYPEFACE <br>
These options are equivalent to otftotfm&rsquo;s --vendor
and --typeface options: they change the &quot;vendor&quot;
and &quot;typeface&quot; parts of the names of the
subdirectories in the TEXMF <br>
tree where generated files will be stored. The default
values are &quot;lcdftools&quot; and the font&rsquo;s
FontFamily name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that these options change
only directory names, not the names of any generated
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-updmap / -noupdmap <br>
Control whether or not updmap is called after the last call
to otftotfm. The default is -updmap.</p>
