<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
caveconverter - convert cave survey data between formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
caveconverter infile outfile in_format out_format [ lrud
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
caveconverter is a program for converting cave survey data
from one format into another. It can read and write a
variety of cave survey data file formats, translating the
data, <br>
and can also generate LRUD info from splay shots.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats read: <br>
Survex - Supports the most common data formats (from to tape
compass clino) assuming units are metres and degrees. Single
data files only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PocketTopo text export - <br>
Text export option in PocketTopo menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXF - Reads Lines and Polylines
as survey centreline data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formats written: <br>
Toporobot - <br>
For using to import data into PocketTopo software on a
PDA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Survex - <br>
Normal formated metric units only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The format codes are: <br>
d - DXF <br>
p - PocketTopo text export <br>
s - Survex <br>
t - Toporobot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrud - Adding the lrud flag to
the end of the command causes LRUD (left rght up down) info
to be generated from splay data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERSION DETAILS <br>
Converting from DXF files to survex shows how editable
survey data can be regenerated from Survex .3d files via the
Convert to DXF option provided by Survex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is also how you can
generate a DXF file to convert to Toporobot using
caveconverter , enabling existing cave surveys to be
imported into PocketTopo regardless of the origi&acirc; <br>
nal Survex format data. So if your Survex file is not
readable by caveconvter (e.g. because it contains diving
data, or different units or data ordering than the default)
then <br>
you can still process it using Survex to generate a 3d file
and convert that to DXF using Survex. Then convert it to
Toporobot format using Cave Converter and import that file
<br>
into PocketTopo. This enables existing surveys to be loaded
into PocketTopo so that new data can be tied into the known
cave on surveying trips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Converting Survex data to
Toporobot will cause all the survey station numbers and
series names to get regenerated unfortunately. This is
because Toporobot format requires survey <br>
series to consist only of linear chains of survey stations.
Junctions are not allowed in series. This means that data
from other formats cannot be simply converted, so all
sta&acirc; <br>
tions are renumbered and reorganised into new numbered
series to conform to this constraint of the Toporobot
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find files that give
errors on conversion, send them to me (Footleg). I can be
contacted by email: drfootleg [at] gmail.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While caveconverter can
regenerate survey data files from DXF files generated from
Survex do get is the equivalent calculated survey leg data
(tape, compass, clino) for the posi&acirc; <br>
tions of the stations in the DXF file. So any loop closure
corrections and instrument calibrations will have already
been applied to the data. This feature is really intended as
<br>
a way to recover some sort of workable data when the
original data has been lost and only the 3d files remain.
Some small rounding errors occur during the Conversion to
DXF from <br>
the .3d file, so the exact positions of survey stations and
the cave length reported may differ by a few cm compared to
the original data. This is because in the DXF file, Survex
<br>
has rounded all station positions to the nearest 1cm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Survex file reader does not
currently read passage data blocks. So any passage data
blocks will be removed if a Survex file is read in and
written out again. However if the <br>
Survex file contains splays and the lrud option is specified
on the command line then new passage data blocks will be
generated from the splays and replace any previously present
<br>
passage data blocks in the file which is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPLAY/LRUD conversion <br>
The original approach to reading splay legs from PocketTopo
files in Cave Converter was to treat them as just a way of
measuring passage dimensions as Left, Right, Up, Down
mea&acirc; <br>
surements at each station. So when no more than four splays
were found at a station the code used their lengths as LRUD
measurements and removed the splays from the data in the
<br>
process. This kept Survex models looking like they used to
before we started measuring lots of splays. But as my own
surveying experience increased over recent years I realised
<br>
that splays are a much more useful tool than just a way to
take LRUD measurements. With a DistoX the splays can quickly
and accurately be fired from stations to pick out key
fea&acirc; <br>
tures and passage shapes at corners and in chambers. These
splays aid drawing the correct position of walls, ceiling
and floor as well as passage features. They are valuable
data <br>
which should not be replaced with LRUD passage dimension
data. LRUD data still has value. A number of file formats
support LRUD data to represent the position of passage walls
at <br>
each station, and 3D model generation uses this data. But
the splays should still be kept when generating LRUD data
from them. The latest Aven viewer (part of the Survex 1.2.7
<br>
release) and the Loch Viewer (part of Therion) now both
allow splay legs to be shown or hidden. So it is possible to
view centreline only models without actually removing the
<br>
splays from the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So this latest version of Cave
Converter no longer removes splay legs used to generate LRUD
measurements. The LRUD generation code has also been
completely rewritten and made <br>
part of the core data model rather than an operation done
during reading of PocketTopo files. This means it is now
possible to generate LRUD data from splays in any data file
<br>
which can be read. Unfortunately for those of you who used
Cave Converter in the past to convert PocketTopo data to
Survex format it will have removed a lot of the splays, so
you <br>
will want to convert from the original PocketTopo exported
text files again with this version. The LRUD generation does
a much better job of selecting the best splay to determine
<br>
a passage dimension measurement from in this version of the
code. The splay which contributes the greatest distance of
the wall/ceiling/floor from the station is used to
calcu&acirc; <br>
late the distance to the wall. Previous versions of the code
just used the total length of the best splay, rather than
the distance in the direction of the LRUD measurement being
<br>
set. This was flawed and splays almost parallel to a survey
leg could generate much larger passage dimension
measurements than was appropriate. Now trigonometry is used
to deter&acirc; <br>
mine the appropriate distance in the direction of the
passage dimension, and the direction for the left and right
measurements is calculated from the best matching previous
leg <br>
as well as the onward leg from the station.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conversion of Survex data
(containing splays) to Toporobot format in order to import
existing survey data into PocketTopo to extend off on new
survey trips can now generate <br>
and output LRUD data too. PocketTopo will display this data
as splays orthogonal to the direction of the survey legs to
indicate passage width and height. Note that Cave Con&acirc;
<br>
verter does not yet read passage data back in from Survex
files. So unless you have all the splays in a Survex file
you will lose the LRUD data if you read in a Survex file and
<br>
output it again in the same or another format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another bug bear of previous
versions of Cave Converter was that LRUD data was output in
Survex files as one continuous block of stations with LRUD
data regardless of how the <br>
stations were connected by survey legs. This has now been
fixed so the survey legs in each series are used to
determine the grouping of passage data stations into blocks
of con&acirc; <br>
nected stations. The following screenshots of a model in
Aven for the same survey data using previous and the latest
versions of Cave Converter illustrate the improved passage
<br>
data generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To convert existing Survex data into Toporobot format so you
can import it in to PocketTopo: <br>
caveconverter survexfile.svx output.text s t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert data exported from
PocketTopo into Survex format, including LRUD info from
splays: <br>
caveconverter pdaexport.txt survexfile.svx p s lrud</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert data from DXF format
into Toporobot format so you can import it into PocketTopo:
<br>
caveconverter datafile.dxf toporobotfileout.text d t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert data from DXF format
into Survex format: <br>
caveconverter datafile.dxf survexfile.svx d s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Survex output re-uses &rsquo;to station&rsquo; numbers for
splay legs if all splays from a station are not together in
the file. So if a set of splay legs occur in a series of
legs within <br>
the same begin/end block followed by a leg from a different
station, and then another splay leg from the original
station is found further down the block then the &rsquo;to
station&rsquo; <br>
numbering will start from &rsquo;a&rsquo; again. So you can
for example get two splays from station 10 with to station
names of &rsquo;10a&rsquo; in the file. The file can be
processed but shows a large <br>
loop closure error for the splays as it equates the two 10a
stations at the end of the two splays as being the same
point.</p>
