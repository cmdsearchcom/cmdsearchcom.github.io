<b>caveconverter</b> is a program for converting cave survey data from one
  format into another. It can read and write a variety of cave survey data file
  formats, translating the data, and can also generate LRUD info from splay
  shots.

Converting from DXF files to survex shows how editable survey data can be
  regenerated from Survex .3d files via the Convert to DXF option provided by
  Survex
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is also how you can generate a DXF file to convert to Toporobot using
  <b>caveconverter</b> , enabling existing cave surveys to be imported into
  PocketTopo regardless of the original Survex format data. So if your Survex
  file is not readable by <b>caveconvter</b> (e.g. because it contains diving
  data, or different units or data ordering than the default) then you can still
  process it using Survex to generate a 3d file and convert that to DXF using
  Survex. Then convert it to Toporobot format using Cave Converter and import
  that file into PocketTopo. This enables existing surveys to be loaded into
  PocketTopo so that new data can be tied into the known cave on surveying
  trips.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Converting Survex data to Toporobot will cause all the survey station numbers
  and series names to get regenerated unfortunately. This is because Toporobot
  format requires survey series to consist only of linear chains of survey
  stations. Junctions are not allowed in series. This means that data from other
  formats cannot be simply converted, so all stations are renumbered and
  reorganised into new numbered series to conform to this constraint of the
  Toporobot format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find files that give errors on conversion, send them to me (Footleg). I
  can be contacted by email: drfootleg [at] gmail.com
<div class="Pp"></div>
While <b>caveconverter</b> can regenerate survey data files from DXF files
  generated from Survex do get is the equivalent calculated survey leg data
  (tape, compass, clino) for the positions of the stations in the DXF file. So
  any loop closure corrections and instrument calibrations will have already
  been applied to the data. This feature is really intended as a way to recover
  some sort of workable data when the original data has been lost and only the
  3d files remain. Some small rounding errors occur during the Conversion to DXF
  from the .3d file, so the exact positions of survey stations and the cave
  length reported may differ by a few cm compared to the original data. This is
  because in the DXF file, Survex has rounded all station positions to the
  nearest 1cm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Survex file reader does not currently read passage data blocks. So any
  passage data blocks will be removed if a Survex file is read in and written
  out again. However if the Survex file contains splays and the lrud option is
  specified on the command line then new passage data blocks will be generated
  from the splays and replace any previously present passage data blocks in the
  file which is generated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="SPLAY/LRUD_conversion"><a class="selflink" href="#SPLAY/LRUD_conversion">SPLAY/LRUD
  conversion</a></h2>
The original approach to reading splay legs from PocketTopo files in Cave
  Converter was to treat them as just a way of measuring passage dimensions as
  Left, Right, Up, Down measurements at each station. So when no more than four
  splays were found at a station the code used their lengths as LRUD
  measurements and removed the splays from the data in the process. This kept
  Survex models looking like they used to before we started measuring lots of
  splays. But as my own surveying experience increased over recent years I
  realised that splays are a much more useful tool than just a way to take LRUD
  measurements. With a DistoX the splays can quickly and accurately be fired
  from stations to pick out key features and passage shapes at corners and in
  chambers. These splays aid drawing the correct position of walls, ceiling and
  floor as well as passage features. They are valuable data which should not be
  replaced with LRUD passage dimension data. LRUD data still has value. A number
  of file formats support LRUD data to represent the position of passage walls
  at each station, and 3D model generation uses this data. But the splays should
  still be kept when generating LRUD data from them. The latest Aven viewer
  (part of the Survex 1.2.7 release) and the Loch Viewer (part of Therion) now
  both allow splay legs to be shown or hidden. So it is possible to view
  centreline only models without actually removing the splays from the data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So this latest version of Cave Converter no longer removes splay legs used to
  generate LRUD measurements. The LRUD generation code has also been completely
  rewritten and made part of the core data model rather than an operation done
  during reading of PocketTopo files. This means it is now possible to generate
  LRUD data from splays in any data file which can be read. Unfortunately for
  those of you who used Cave Converter in the past to convert PocketTopo data to
  Survex format it will have removed a lot of the splays, so you will want to
  convert from the original PocketTopo exported text files again with this
  version. The LRUD generation does a much better job of selecting the best
  splay to determine a passage dimension measurement from in this version of the
  code. The splay which contributes the greatest distance of the
  wall/ceiling/floor from the station is used to calculate the distance to the
  wall. Previous versions of the code just used the total length of the best
  splay, rather than the distance in the direction of the LRUD measurement being
  set. This was flawed and splays almost parallel to a survey leg could generate
  much larger passage dimension measurements than was appropriate. Now
  trigonometry is used to determine the appropriate distance in the direction of
  the passage dimension, and the direction for the left and right measurements
  is calculated from the best matching previous leg as well as the onward leg
  from the station.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The conversion of Survex data (containing splays) to Toporobot format in order
  to import existing survey data into PocketTopo to extend off on new survey
  trips can now generate and output LRUD data too. PocketTopo will display this
  data as splays orthogonal to the direction of the survey legs to indicate
  passage width and height. Note that Cave Converter does not yet read passage
  data back in from Survex files. So unless you have all the splays in a Survex
  file you will lose the LRUD data if you read in a Survex file and output it
  again in the same or another format.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another bug bear of previous versions of Cave Converter was that LRUD data was
  output in Survex files as one continuous block of stations with LRUD data
  regardless of how the stations were connected by survey legs. This has now
  been fixed so the survey legs in each series are used to determine the
  grouping of passage data stations into blocks of connected stations. The
  following screenshots of a model in Aven for the same survey data using
  previous and the latest versions of Cave Converter illustrate the improved
  passage data generation.

Survex output re-uses 'to station' numbers for splay legs if all splays from a
  station are not together in the file. So if a set of splay legs occur in a
  series of legs within the same begin/end block followed by a leg from a
  different station, and then another splay leg from the original station is
  found further down the block then the 'to station' numbering will start from
  'a' again. So you can for example get two splays from station 10 with to
  station names of '10a' in the file. The file can be processed but shows a
  large loop closure error for the splays as it equates the two 10a stations at
  the end of the two splays as being the same point.
