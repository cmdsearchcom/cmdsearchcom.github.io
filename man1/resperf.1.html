<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>resperf</b> is a companion tool to <b>dnsperf</b>. <b>dnsperf</b> was
  primarily designed for benchmarking authoritative servers, and it does not
  work well with caching servers that are talking to the live Internet. One
  reason for this is that dnsperf uses a &quot;self-pacing&quot; approach, which
  is based on the assumption that you can keep the server 100% busy simply by
  sending it a small burst of back-to-back queries to fill up network buffers,
  and then send a new query whenever you get a response back. This approach
  works well for authoritative servers that process queries in order and one at
  a time; it also works pretty well for a caching server in a closed laboratory
  environment talking to a simulated Internet that's all on the same LAN.
  Unfortunately, it does not work well with a caching server talking to the
  actual Internet, which may need to work on thousands of queries in parallel to
  achieve its maximum throughput. There have been numerous attempts to use
  dnsperf (or its predecessor, queryperf) for benchmarking live caching servers,
  usually with poor results. Therefore, a separate tool designed specifically
  for caching servers is needed.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_resperf_works"><a class="selflink" href="#How_resperf_works">How
  resperf works</a></h2>
Unlike the &quot;self-pacing&quot; approach of dnsperf, resperf works by sending
  DNS queries at a controlled, steadily increasing rate. By default, resperf
  will send traffic for 60 seconds, linearly increasing the amount of traffic
  from zero to 100,000 queries per second.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
During the test, resperf listens for responses from the server and keeps track
  of response rates, failure rates, and latencies. It will also continue
  listening for responses for an additional 40 seconds after it has stopped
  sending traffic, so that there is time for the server to respond to the last
  queries sent. This time period was chosen to be longer than the overall query
  timeout of both Nominum Vantio and current versions of BIND.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the test is successful, the query rate will at some point exceed the capacity
  of the server and queries will be dropped, causing the response rate to stop
  growing or even decrease as the query rate increases.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The result of the test is a set of measurements of the query rate, response
  rate, failure response rate, and average query latency as functions of time.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_you_will_need"><a class="selflink" href="#What_you_will_need">What
  you will need</a></h2>
Benchmarking a live caching server is serious business. A fast caching server
  like Nominum Vantio running on a XEON server, resolving a mix of cacheable and
  non-cacheable queries typical of ISP customer traffic, is capable of resolving
  over 100,000 queries per second. In the process, it will send more than 40,000
  queries per second to authoritative servers on the Internet, and receive
  responses to most of them. Assuming an average request size of 50 bytes and a
  response size of 150 bytes, this amounts to some 16 Mbps of outgoing and 48
  Mbps of incoming traffic. If your Internet connection can't handle the
  bandwidth, you will end up measuring the speed of the connection, not the
  server, and may saturate the connection causing a degradation in service for
  other users.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Make sure there is no stateful firewall between the server and the Internet,
  because most of them can't handle the amount of UDP traffic the test will
  generate and will end up dropping packets, skewing the test results. Some will
  even lock up or crash.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You should run resperf on a machine separate from the server under test, on the
  same LAN. Preferably, this should be a Gigabit Ethernet network. The machine
  running resperf should be at least as fast as the machine being tested;
  otherwise, it may end up being the bottleneck.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There should be no other applications running on the machine running resperf.
  Performance testing at the traffic levels involved is essentially a hard
  real-time application - consider the fact that at a query rate of 100,000
  queries per second, if resperf gets delayed by just 1/100 of a second, 1000
  incoming UDP packets will arrive in the meantime. This is more than most
  operating systems will buffer, which means packets will be dropped.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because the granularity of the timers provided by operating systems is typically
  too coarse to accurately schedule packet transmissions at sub-millisecond
  intervals, resperf will busy-wait between packet transmissions, constantly
  polling for responses in the meantime. Therefore, it is normal for resperf to
  consume 100% CPU during the whole test run, even during periods where query
  rates are relatively low.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You will also need a set of test queries in the <b>dnsperf</b> file format. See
  the <b>dnsperf</b> man page for instructions on how to construct this query
  file. To make the test as realistic as possible, the queries should be derived
  from recorded production client DNS traffic, without removing duplicate
  queries or other filtering. With the default settings, resperf will use up to
  3 million queries in each test run.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the caching server to be tested has a configurable limit on the number of
  simultaneous resolutions, like the <b>max-recursive-clients</b> statement in
  Nominum Vantio or the <b>recursive-clients</b> option in BIND 9, you will
  probably have to increase it. As a starting point, we recommend a value of
  10000 for Nominum Vantio and 100000 for BIND 9. Should the limit be reached,
  it will show up in the plots as an increase in the number of failure
  responses.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The server being tested should be restarted at the beginning of each test to
  make sure it is starting with an empty cache. If the cache already contains
  data from a previous test run that used the same set of queries, almost all
  queries will be answered from the cache, yielding inflated performance
  numbers.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To use the <b>resperf-report</b> script, you need to have <b>gnuplot</b>
  installed. Make sure your installed version of <b>gnuplot</b> supports the png
  terminal driver. If your <b>gnuplot</b> doesn't support png but does support
  gif, you can change the line saying terminal=png in the <b>resperf-report</b>
  script to terminal=gif.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Running_the_test"><a class="selflink" href="#Running_the_test">Running
  the test</a></h2>
Resperf is typically invoked via the <b>resperf-report</b> script, which will
  run <b>resperf</b> with its output redirected to a file and then automatically
  generate an illustrated report in HTML format. Command line arguments given to
  resperf-report will be passed on unchanged to resperf.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When running resperf-report, you will need to specify at least the server IP
  address and the query data file. A typical invocation will look like
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
resperf-report -s 10.0.0.2 -d queryfile
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
With default settings, the test run will take at most 100 seconds (60 seconds of
  ramping up traffic and then 40 seconds of waiting for responses), but in
  practice, the 60-second traffic phase will usually be cut short. To be
  precise, resperf can transition from the traffic-sending phase to the
  waiting-for-responses phase in three different ways:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Running for the full allotted time and successfully
      reaching the maximum query rate (by default, 60 seconds and 100,000 qps,
      respectively). Since this is a very high query rate, this will rarely
      happen (with today's hardware); one of the other two conditions listed
      below will usually occur first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Exceeding 65,536 outstanding queries. This often happens as
      a result of (successfully) exceeding the capacity of the server being
      tested, causing the excess queries to be dropped. The limit of 65,536
      queries comes from the number of possible values for the ID field in the
      DNS packet. Resperf needs to allocate a unique ID for each outstanding
      query, and is therefore unable to send further queries if the set of
      possible IDs is exhausted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When resperf finds itself unable to send queries fast
      enough. Resperf will notice if it is falling behind in its scheduled query
      transmissions, and if this backlog reaches 1000 queries, it will print a
      message like &quot;Fell behind by 1000 queries&quot; (or whatever the
      actual number is at the time) and stop sending traffic.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Regardless of which of the above conditions caused the traffic-sending phase of
  the test to end, you should examine the resulting plots to make sure the
  server's response rate is flattening out toward the end of the test. If it is
  not, then you are not loading the server enough. If you are getting the
  &quot;Fell behind&quot; message, make sure that the machine running resperf is
  fast enough and has no other applications running.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You should also monitor the CPU usage of the server under test. It should reach
  close to 100% CPU at the point of maximum traffic; if it does not, you most
  likely have a bottleneck in some other part of your test setup, for example,
  your external Internet connection.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The report generated by <b>resperf-report</b> will be stored with a unique file
  name based on the current date and time, e.g., <i>20060812-1550.html</i>. The
  PNG images of the plots and other auxiliary files will be stored in separate
  files beginning with the same date-time string. To view the report, simply
  open the <i>.html</i> file in a web browser.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to copy the report to a separate machine for viewing, make sure to
  copy the .png files along with the .html file (or simply copy all the files,
  e.g., using scp 20060812-1550.* host:directory/).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Interpreting_the_report"><a class="selflink" href="#Interpreting_the_report">Interpreting
  the report</a></h2>
The <i>.html</i> file produced by <b>resperf-report</b> consists of two
  sections. The first section, &quot;Resperf output&quot;, contains output from
  the <b>resperf</b> program such as progress messages, a summary of the command
  line arguments, and summary statistics. The second section, &quot;Plots&quot;,
  contains two plots generated by <b>gnuplot</b>: &quot;Query/response/failure
  rate&quot; and &quot;Latency&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Query/response/failure rate&quot; plot contains three graphs. The
  &quot;Queries sent per second&quot; graph shows the amount of traffic being
  sent to the server; this should be very close to a straight diagonal line,
  reflecting the linear ramp-up of traffic.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Total responses received per second&quot; graph shows how many of the
  queries received a response from the server. All responses are counted,
  whether successful (NOERROR or NXDOMAIN) or not (e.g., SERVFAIL).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Failure responses received per second&quot; graph shows how many of
  the queries received a failure response. A response is considered to be a
  failure if its RCODE is neither NOERROR nor NXDOMAIN.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By visually inspecting the graphs, you can get an idea of how the server behaves
  under increasing load. The &quot;Total responses received per second&quot;
  graph will initially closely follow the &quot;Queries sent per second&quot;
  graph (often rendering it invisible in the plot as the two graphs are plotted
  on top of one another), but when the load exceeds the server's capacity, the
  &quot;Total responses received per second&quot; graph may diverge from the
  &quot;Queries sent per second&quot; graph and flatten out, indicating that
  some of the queries are being dropped.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Failure responses received per second&quot; graph will normally show a
  roughly linear ramp close to the bottom of the plot with some random
  fluctuation, since typical query traffic will contain some small percentage of
  failing queries randomly interspersed with the successful ones. As the total
  traffic increases, the number of failures will increase proportionally.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the &quot;Failure responses received per second&quot; graph turns sharply
  upwards, this can be another indication that the load has exceeded the
  server's capacity. This will happen if the server reacts to overload by
  sending SERVFAIL responses rather than by dropping queries. Since Nominum
  Vantio and BIND 9 will both respond with SERVFAIL when they exceed their
  <b>max-recursive-clients</b> or <b>recursive-clients</b> limit, respectively,
  a sudden increase in the number of failures could mean that the limit needs to
  be increased.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;Latency&quot; plot contains a single graph marked &quot;Average
  latency&quot;. This shows how the latency varies during the course of the
  test. Typically, the latency graph will exhibit a downwards trend because the
  cache hit rate improves as ever more responses are cached during the test, and
  the latency for a cache hit is much smaller than for a cache miss. The latency
  graph is provided as an aid in determining the point where the server gets
  overloaded, which can be seen as a sharp upwards turn in the graph. The
  latency graph is not intended for making absolute latency measurements or
  comparisons between servers; the latencies shown in the graph are not
  representative of production latencies due to the initially empty cache and
  the deliberate overloading of the server towards the end of the test.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that all measurements are displayed on the plot at the horizontal position
  corresponding to the point in time when the query was sent, not when the
  response (if any) was received. This makes it it easy to compare the query and
  response rates; for example, if no queries are dropped, the query and response
  graphs will be identical. As another example, if the plot shows 10% failure
  responses at t=5 seconds, this means that 10% of the queries sent at t=5
  seconds eventually failed, not that 10% of the responses received at t=5
  seconds were failures.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Determining_the_server's_maximum_throughput"><a class="selflink" href="#Determining_the_server's_maximum_throughput">Determining
  the server's maximum throughput</a></h2>
Often, the goal of running <b>resperf</b> is to determine the server's maximum
  throughput, in other words, the number of queries per second it is capable of
  handling. This is not always an easy task, because as a server is driven into
  overload, the service it provides may deteriorate gradually, and this
  deterioration can manifest itself either as queries being dropped, as an
  increase in the number of SERVFAIL responses, or an increase in latency. The
  maximum throughput may be defined as the highest level of traffic at which the
  server still provides an acceptable level of service, but that means you first
  need to decide what an acceptable level of service means in terms of packet
  drop percentage, SERVFAIL percentage, and latency.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The summary statistics in the &quot;Resperf output&quot; section of the report
  contains a &quot;Maximum throughput&quot; value which by default is determined
  from the maximum rate at which the server was able to return responses,
  without regard to the number of queries being dropped or failing at that
  point. This method of throughput measurement has the advantage of simplicity,
  but it may or may not be appropriate for your needs; the reported value should
  always be validated by a visual inspection of the graphs to ensure that
  service has not already deteriorated unacceptably before the maximum response
  rate is reached. It may also be helpful to look at the &quot;Lost at that
  point&quot; value in the summary statistics; this indicates the percentage of
  the queries that was being dropped at the point in the test when the maximum
  throughput was reached.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Alternatively, you can make resperf report the throughput at the point in the
  test where the percentage of queries dropped exceeds a given limit (or the
  maximum as above if the limit is never exceeded). This can be a more realistic
  indication of how much the server can be loaded while still providing an
  acceptable level of service. This is done using the <b>-L</b> command line
  option; for example, specifying <b>-L 10</b> makes resperf report the highest
  throughput reached before the server starts dropping more than 10% of the
  queries.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There is no corresponding way of automatically constraining results based on the
  number of failed queries, because unlike dropped queries, resolution failures
  will occur even when the the server is not overloaded, and the number of such
  failures is heavily dependent on the query data and network conditions.
  Therefore, the plots should be manually inspected to ensure that there is not
  an abnormal number of failures.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GENERATING_CONSTANT_TRAFFIC"><a class="selflink" href="#GENERATING_CONSTANT_TRAFFIC">GENERATING
  CONSTANT TRAFFIC</a></h1>
In addition to ramping up traffic linearly, <b>resperf</b> also has the
  capability to send a constant stream of traffic. This can be useful when using
  <b>resperf</b> for tasks other than performance measurement; for example, it
  can be used to &quot;soak test&quot; a server by subjecting it to a sustained
  load for an extended period of time.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To generate a constant traffic load, use the <b>-c</b> command line option,
  together with the <b>-m</b> option which specifies the desired constant query
  rate. For example, to send 10000 queries per second for an hour, use <b>-m
  10000 -c 3600</b>. This will include the usual 30-second gradual ramp-up of
  traffic at the beginning, which may be useful to avoid initially overwhelming
  a server that is starting with an empty cache. To start the onslaught of
  traffic instantly, use <b>-m 10000 -c 3600 -r 0</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To be precise, <b>resperf</b> will do a linear ramp-up of traffic from 0 to
  <b>-m</b> queries per second over a period of <b>-r</b> seconds, followed by a
  plateau of steady traffic at <b>-m</b> queries per second lasting for
  <b>-c</b> seconds, followed by waiting for responses for an extra 40 seconds.
  Either the ramp-up or the plateau can be suppressed by supplying a duration of
  zero seconds with <b>-r 0</b> and <b>-c 0</b>, respectively. The latter is the
  default.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Sending traffic at high rates for hours on end will of course require very large
  amounts of input data. Also, a long-running test will generate a large amount
  of plot data, which is kept in memory for the duration of the test. To reduce
  the memory usage and the size of the plot file, consider increasing the
  interval between measurements from the default of 0.5 seconds using the
  <b>-i</b> option in long-running tests.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When using <b>resperf</b> for long-running tests, it is important that the
  traffic rate specified using the <b>-m</b> is one that both <b>resperf</b>
  itself and the server under test can sustain. Otherwise, the test is likely to
  be cut short as a result of either running out of query IDs (because of large
  numbers of dropped queries) or of resperf falling behind its transmission
  schedule.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Because the <b>resperf-report</b> script passes its command line options
  directly to the <b>resperf</b> programs, they both accept the same set of
  options, with one exception: <b>resperf-report</b> automatically adds an
  appropriate <b>-P</b> to the <b>resperf</b> command line, and therefore does
  not itself take a <b>-P</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-d </b><i>datafile</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the input data file. If not
  specified, <b>resperf</b> will read from standard input.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-s </b><i>server_addr</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the name or address of the server to
  which requests will be sent. The default is the loopback address,
  127.0.0.1.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-p </b><i>port</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Sets the port on which the DNS packets are
  sent. If not specified, the standard DNS port (53) is used.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-a </b><i>local_addr</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the local address from which to send
  requests. The default is the wildcard address.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-x </b><i>local_port</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the local port from which to send
  requests. The default is the wildcard port (0).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If acting as multiple clients and the wildcard port is used, each client will
  use a different random port. If a port is specified, the clients will use a
  range of ports starting with the specified one.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-t </b><i>timeout</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the request timeout value, in
  seconds. <b>resperf</b> will no longer wait for a response to a particular
  request after this many seconds have elapsed. The default is 45 seconds.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>resperf</b> times out unanswered requests in order to reclaim query IDs so
  that the query ID space will not be exhausted in a long-running test, such as
  when &quot;soak testing&quot; a server for an day with <b>-m 10000 -c
  86400</b>. The timeouts and the ability to tune them are of little use in the
  more typical use case of a performance test lasting only a minute or two.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default timeout of 45 seconds was chosen to be longer than the query timeout
  of current caching servers. Note that this is longer than the corresponding
  default in <b>dnsperf</b>, because caching servers can take many orders of
  magnitude longer to answer a query than authoritative servers do.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a short timeout is used, there is a possibility that <b>resperf</b> will
  receive a response after the corresponding request has timed out; in this

<b>-m </b><i>max_qps</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the target maximum query rate (in
  queries per second). This should be higher than the expected maximum
  throughput of the server being tested. Traffic will be ramped up at a linearly
  increasing rate until this value is reached, or until one of the other
  conditions described in the section &quot;Running the test&quot; occurs. The
  default is 100000 queries per second.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the maximum acceptable query loss
  percentage for purposes of determining the maximum throughput value. The
  default is 100%, meaning that <b>resperf</b> will measure the maximum
  throughput without regard to query loss.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-C </b><i>clients</i><b></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Act as multiple clients. Requests are sent

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_PLOT_DATA_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_PLOT_DATA_FILE">THE
  PLOT DATA FILE</a></h1>
The plot data file is written by the <b>resperf</b> program and contains the
  data to be plotted using <b>gnuplot</b>. When running <b>resperf</b> via the
  <b>resperf-report</b> script, there is no need for the user to deal with this
  file directly, but its format and contents are documented here for
  completeness and in case you wish to run <b>resperf</b> directly and use its
  output for purposes other than viewing it with <b>gnuplot</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The first line of the file is a comment identifying the fields. It may be
  recognized as a comment by its leading hash sign (#).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Subsequent lines contain the actual plot data. For purposes of generating the
  plot data file, the test run is divided into time intervals of 0.5 seconds (or
  some other length of time specified with the <b>-i</b> command line option).
  Each line corresponds to one such interval, and contains the following values
  as floating-point numbers:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Time</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The midpoint of this time interval, in seconds
  since the beginning of the run</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Target queries per second</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The number of queries per second scheduled to
  be sent in this time interval</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Actual queries per second</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The number of queries per second actually sent
  in this time interval</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Responses per second</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The number of responses received corresponding
  to queries sent in this time interval, divided by the length of the
  interval</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Failures per second</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The number of responses received corresponding
  to queries sent in this time interval and having an RCODE other than NOERROR
  or NXDOMAIN, divided by the length of the interval</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Average latency</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">The average time between sending the query and
  receiving a response, for queries sent in this time interval</div>
