<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
resperf is a companion tool to dnsperf. dnsperf was
primarily designed for benchmarking authoritative servers,
and it does not work well with caching servers that are
talking to <br>
the live Internet. One reason for this is that dnsperf uses
a &quot;self-pacing&quot; approach, which is based on the
assumption that you can keep the server 100% busy simply by
sending it <br>
a small burst of back-to-back queries to fill up network
buffers, and then send a new query whenever you get a
response back. This approach works well for authoritative
servers <br>
that process queries in order and one at a time; it also
works pretty well for a caching server in a closed
laboratory environment talking to a simulated Internet
that&rsquo;s all on <br>
the same LAN. Unfortunately, it does not work well with a
caching server talking to the actual Internet, which may
need to work on thousands of queries in parallel to achieve
its <br>
maximum throughput. There have been numerous attempts to use
dnsperf (or its predecessor, queryperf) for benchmarking
live caching servers, usually with poor results. Therefore,
<br>
a separate tool designed specifically for caching servers is
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How resperf works <br>
Unlike the &quot;self-pacing&quot; approach of dnsperf,
resperf works by sending DNS queries at a controlled,
steadily increasing rate. By default, resperf will send
traffic for 60 sec&acirc; <br>
onds, linearly increasing the amount of traffic from zero to
100,000 queries per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During the test, resperf listens
for responses from the server and keeps track of response
rates, failure rates, and latencies. It will also continue
listening for responses for <br>
an additional 40 seconds after it has stopped sending
traffic, so that there is time for the server to respond to
the last queries sent. This time period was chosen to be
longer <br>
than the overall query timeout of both Nominum Vantio and
current versions of BIND.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the test is successful, the
query rate will at some point exceed the capacity of the
server and queries will be dropped, causing the response
rate to stop growing or even de&acirc; <br>
crease as the query rate increases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result of the test is a set
of measurements of the query rate, response rate, failure
response rate, and average query latency as functions of
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What you will need <br>
Benchmarking a live caching server is serious business. A
fast caching server like Nominum Vantio running on a XEON
server, resolving a mix of cacheable and non-cacheable
queries <br>
typical of ISP customer traffic, is capable of resolving
over 100,000 queries per second. In the process, it will
send more than 40,000 queries per second to authoritative
<br>
servers on the Internet, and receive responses to most of
them. Assuming an average request size of 50 bytes and a
response size of 150 bytes, this amounts to some 16 Mbps of
<br>
outgoing and 48 Mbps of incoming traffic. If your Internet
connection can&rsquo;t handle the bandwidth, you will end up
measuring the speed of the connection, not the server, and
may <br>
saturate the connection causing a degradation in service for
other users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure there is no stateful
firewall between the server and the Internet, because most
of them can&rsquo;t handle the amount of UDP traffic the
test will generate and will end up <br>
dropping packets, skewing the test results. Some will even
lock up or crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should run resperf on a
machine separate from the server under test, on the same
LAN. Preferably, this should be a Gigabit Ethernet network.
The machine running resperf <br>
should be at least as fast as the machine being tested;
otherwise, it may end up being the bottleneck.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There should be no other
applications running on the machine running resperf.
Performance testing at the traffic levels involved is
essentially a hard real-time application - <br>
consider the fact that at a query rate of 100,000 queries
per second, if resperf gets delayed by just 1/100 of a
second, 1000 incoming UDP packets will arrive in the
meantime. <br>
This is more than most operating systems will buffer, which
means packets will be dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because the granularity of the
timers provided by operating systems is typically too coarse
to accurately schedule packet transmissions at
sub-millisecond intervals, resperf will <br>
busy-wait between packet transmissions, constantly polling
for responses in the meantime. Therefore, it is normal for
resperf to consume 100% CPU during the whole test run, even
<br>
during periods where query rates are relatively low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will also need a set of test
queries in the dnsperf file format. See the dnsperf man page
for instructions on how to construct this query file. To
make the test as realistic <br>
as possible, the queries should be derived from recorded
production client DNS traffic, without removing duplicate
queries or other filtering. With the default settings,
resperf <br>
will use up to 3 million queries in each test run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the caching server to be
tested has a configurable limit on the number of
simultaneous resolutions, like the max-recursive-clients
statement in Nominum Vantio or the recur&acirc; <br>
sive-clients option in BIND 9, you will probably have to
increase it. As a starting point, we recommend a value of
10000 for Nominum Vantio and 100000 for BIND 9. Should the
lim&acirc; <br>
it be reached, it will show up in the plots as an increase
in the number of failure responses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server being tested should
be restarted at the beginning of each test to make sure it
is starting with an empty cache. If the cache already
contains data from a previous test <br>
run that used the same set of queries, almost all queries
will be answered from the cache, yielding inflated
performance numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the resperf-report
script, you need to have gnuplot installed. Make sure your
installed version of gnuplot supports the png terminal
driver. If your gnuplot doesn&rsquo;t sup&acirc; <br>
port png but does support gif, you can change the line
saying terminal=png in the resperf-report script to
terminal=gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the test <br>
Resperf is typically invoked via the resperf-report script,
which will run resperf with its output redirected to a file
and then automatically generate an illustrated report in
<br>
HTML format. Command line arguments given to resperf-report
will be passed on unchanged to resperf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running resperf-report, you
will need to specify at least the server IP address and the
query data file. A typical invocation will look like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resperf-report -s 10.0.0.2 -d
queryfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With default settings, the test
run will take at most 100 seconds (60 seconds of ramping up
traffic and then 40 seconds of waiting for responses), but
in practice, the 60-second <br>
traffic phase will usually be cut short. To be precise,
resperf can transition from the traffic-sending phase to the
waiting-for-responses phase in three different ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Running for the
full allotted time and successfully reaching the maximum
query rate (by default, 60 seconds and 100,000 qps,
respectively). Since this is a very high query <br>
rate, this will rarely happen (with today&rsquo;s hardware);
one of the other two conditions listed below will usually
occur first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Exceeding 65,536
outstanding queries. This often happens as a result of
(successfully) exceeding the capacity of the server being
tested, causing the excess queries to be <br>
dropped. The limit of 65,536 queries comes from the number
of possible values for the ID field in the DNS packet.
Resperf needs to allocate a unique ID for each outstanding
<br>
query, and is therefore unable to send further queries if
the set of possible IDs is exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When resperf
finds itself unable to send queries fast enough. Resperf
will notice if it is falling behind in its scheduled query
transmissions, and if this backlog reaches 1000 <br>
queries, it will print a message like &quot;Fell behind by
1000 queries&quot; (or whatever the actual number is at the
time) and stop sending traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regardless of which of the above
conditions caused the traffic-sending phase of the test to
end, you should examine the resulting plots to make sure the
server&rsquo;s response rate is <br>
flattening out toward the end of the test. If it is not,
then you are not loading the server enough. If you are
getting the &quot;Fell behind&quot; message, make sure that
the machine run&acirc; <br>
ning resperf is fast enough and has no other applications
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should also monitor the CPU
usage of the server under test. It should reach close to
100% CPU at the point of maximum traffic; if it does not,
you most likely have a bottle&acirc; <br>
neck in some other part of your test setup, for example,
your external Internet connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The report generated by
resperf-report will be stored with a unique file name based
on the current date and time, e.g., 20060812-1550.html. The
PNG images of the plots and other <br>
auxiliary files will be stored in separate files beginning
with the same date-time string. To view the report, simply
open the .html file in a web browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to copy the report
to a separate machine for viewing, make sure to copy the
.png files along with the .html file (or simply copy all the
files, e.g., using scp <br>
20060812-1550.* host:directory/).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interpreting the report <br>
The .html file produced by resperf-report consists of two
sections. The first section, &quot;Resperf output&quot;,
contains output from the resperf program such as progress
messages, a <br>
summary of the command line arguments, and summary
statistics. The second section, &quot;Plots&quot;, contains
two plots generated by gnuplot: &quot;Query/response/failure
rate&quot; and &quot;Latency&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Query/response/failure
rate&quot; plot contains three graphs. The &quot;Queries
sent per second&quot; graph shows the amount of traffic
being sent to the server; this should be very close <br>
to a straight diagonal line, reflecting the linear ramp-up
of traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Total responses
received per second&quot; graph shows how many of the
queries received a response from the server. All responses
are counted, whether successful (NOERROR or NXDO&acirc; <br>
MAIN) or not (e.g., SERVFAIL).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Failure responses
received per second&quot; graph shows how many of the
queries received a failure response. A response is
considered to be a failure if its RCODE is neither NO&acirc;
<br>
ERROR nor NXDOMAIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By visually inspecting the
graphs, you can get an idea of how the server behaves under
increasing load. The &quot;Total responses received per
second&quot; graph will initially closely <br>
follow the &quot;Queries sent per second&quot; graph (often
rendering it invisible in the plot as the two graphs are
plotted on top of one another), but when the load exceeds
the server&rsquo;s <br>
capacity, the &quot;Total responses received per
second&quot; graph may diverge from the &quot;Queries sent
per second&quot; graph and flatten out, indicating that some
of the queries are being <br>
dropped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Failure responses
received per second&quot; graph will normally show a roughly
linear ramp close to the bottom of the plot with some random
fluctuation, since typical query traf&acirc; <br>
fic will contain some small percentage of failing queries
randomly interspersed with the successful ones. As the total
traffic increases, the number of failures will increase <br>
proportionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;Failure responses
received per second&quot; graph turns sharply upwards, this
can be another indication that the load has exceeded the
server&rsquo;s capacity. This will happen if <br>
the server reacts to overload by sending SERVFAIL responses
rather than by dropping queries. Since Nominum Vantio and
BIND 9 will both respond with SERVFAIL when they exceed <br>
their max-recursive-clients or recursive-clients limit,
respectively, a sudden increase in the number of failures
could mean that the limit needs to be increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Latency&quot; plot
contains a single graph marked &quot;Average latency&quot;.
This shows how the latency varies during the course of the
test. Typically, the latency graph will exhibit a <br>
downwards trend because the cache hit rate improves as ever
more responses are cached during the test, and the latency
for a cache hit is much smaller than for a cache miss. The
<br>
latency graph is provided as an aid in determining the point
where the server gets overloaded, which can be seen as a
sharp upwards turn in the graph. The latency graph is not
<br>
intended for making absolute latency measurements or
comparisons between servers; the latencies shown in the
graph are not representative of production latencies due to
the ini&acirc; <br>
tially empty cache and the deliberate overloading of the
server towards the end of the test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that all measurements are
displayed on the plot at the horizontal position
corresponding to the point in time when the query was sent,
not when the response (if any) was re&acirc; <br>
ceived. This makes it it easy to compare the query and
response rates; for example, if no queries are dropped, the
query and response graphs will be identical. As another
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, if the plot shows 10% failure responses at t=5 seconds,
this means that 10% of the queries sent at t=5 seconds
eventually failed, not that 10% of the responses received at
<br>
t=5 seconds were failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Determining the server&rsquo;s
maximum throughput <br>
Often, the goal of running resperf is to determine the
server&rsquo;s maximum throughput, in other words, the
number of queries per second it is capable of handling. This
is not always <br>
an easy task, because as a server is driven into overload,
the service it provides may deteriorate gradually, and this
deterioration can manifest itself either as queries being
<br>
dropped, as an increase in the number of SERVFAIL responses,
or an increase in latency. The maximum throughput may be
defined as the highest level of traffic at which the server
<br>
still provides an acceptable level of service, but that
means you first need to decide what an acceptable level of
service means in terms of packet drop percentage, SERVFAIL
per&acirc; <br>
centage, and latency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The summary statistics in the
&quot;Resperf output&quot; section of the report contains a
&quot;Maximum throughput&quot; value which by default is
determined from the maximum rate at which the serv&acirc;
<br>
er was able to return responses, without regard to the
number of queries being dropped or failing at that point.
This method of throughput measurement has the advantage of
sim&acirc; <br>
plicity, but it may or may not be appropriate for your
needs; the reported value should always be validated by a
visual inspection of the graphs to ensure that service has
not <br>
already deteriorated unacceptably before the maximum
response rate is reached. It may also be helpful to look at
the &quot;Lost at that point&quot; value in the summary
statistics; this <br>
indicates the percentage of the queries that was being
dropped at the point in the test when the maximum throughput
was reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can make
resperf report the throughput at the point in the test where
the percentage of queries dropped exceeds a given limit (or
the maximum as above if the <br>
limit is never exceeded). This can be a more realistic
indication of how much the server can be loaded while still
providing an acceptable level of service. This is done using
<br>
the -L command line option; for example, specifying -L 10
makes resperf report the highest throughput reached before
the server starts dropping more than 10% of the queries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no corresponding way of
automatically constraining results based on the number of
failed queries, because unlike dropped queries, resolution
failures will occur even <br>
when the the server is not overloaded, and the number of
such failures is heavily dependent on the query data and
network conditions. Therefore, the plots should be manually
in&acirc; <br>
spected to ensure that there is not an abnormal number of
failures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATING CONSTANT TRAFFIC <br>
In addition to ramping up traffic linearly, resperf also has
the capability to send a constant stream of traffic. This
can be useful when using resperf for tasks other than
per&acirc; <br>
formance measurement; for example, it can be used to
&quot;soak test&quot; a server by subjecting it to a
sustained load for an extended period of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generate a constant traffic
load, use the -c command line option, together with the -m
option which specifies the desired constant query rate. For
example, to send 10000 <br>
queries per second for an hour, use -m 10000 -c 3600. This
will include the usual 30-second gradual ramp-up of traffic
at the beginning, which may be useful to avoid initially
<br>
overwhelming a server that is starting with an empty cache.
To start the onslaught of traffic instantly, use -m 10000 -c
3600 -r 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be precise, resperf will do a
linear ramp-up of traffic from 0 to -m queries per second
over a period of -r seconds, followed by a plateau of steady
traffic at -m queries per <br>
second lasting for -c seconds, followed by waiting for
responses for an extra 40 seconds. Either the ramp-up or the
plateau can be suppressed by supplying a duration of zero
sec&acirc; <br>
onds with -r 0 and -c 0, respectively. The latter is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending traffic at high rates
for hours on end will of course require very large amounts
of input data. Also, a long-running test will generate a
large amount of plot data, which <br>
is kept in memory for the duration of the test. To reduce
the memory usage and the size of the plot file, consider
increasing the interval between measurements from the
default <br>
of 0.5 seconds using the -i option in long-running
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using resperf for
long-running tests, it is important that the traffic rate
specified using the -m is one that both resperf itself and
the server under test can sustain. <br>
Otherwise, the test is likely to be cut short as a result of
either running out of query IDs (because of large numbers of
dropped queries) or of resperf falling behind its
trans&acirc; <br>
mission schedule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Because the resperf-report script passes its command line
options directly to the resperf programs, they both accept
the same set of options, with one exception: resperf-report
<br>
automatically adds an appropriate -P to the resperf command
line, and therefore does not itself take a -P option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d datafile <br>
Specifies the input data file. If not specified, resperf
will read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s server_addr <br>
Specifies the name or address of the server to which
requests will be sent. The default is the loopback address,
127.0.0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port <br>
Sets the port on which the DNS packets are sent. If not
specified, the standard DNS port (53) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a local_addr <br>
Specifies the local address from which to send requests. The
default is the wildcard address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x local_port <br>
Specifies the local port from which to send requests. The
default is the wildcard port (0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If acting as multiple clients
and the wildcard port is used, each client will use a
different random port. If a port is specified, the clients
will use a range of ports <br>
starting with the specified one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Specifies the request timeout value, in seconds. resperf
will no longer wait for a response to a particular request
after this many seconds have elapsed. The default is 45 <br>
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">resperf times out unanswered
requests in order to reclaim query IDs so that the query ID
space will not be exhausted in a long-running test, such as
when &quot;soak testing&quot; a <br>
server for an day with -m 10000 -c 86400. The timeouts and
the ability to tune them are of little use in the more
typical use case of a performance test lasting only a <br>
minute or two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default timeout of 45
seconds was chosen to be longer than the query timeout of
current caching servers. Note that this is longer than the
corresponding default in <br>
dnsperf, because caching servers can take many orders of
magnitude longer to answer a query than authoritative
servers do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a short timeout is used,
there is a possibility that resperf will receive a response
after the corresponding request has timed out; in this case,
a message like Warn&acirc; <br>
ing: Received a response with an unexpected id: 141 will be
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bufsize <br>
Sets the size of the socket&rsquo;s send and receive
buffers, in kilobytes. If not specified, the operating
system&rsquo;s default is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f family <br>
Specifies the address family used for sending DNS packets.
The possible values are &quot;inet&quot;, &quot;inet6&quot;,
or &quot;any&quot;. If &quot;any&quot; (the default value)
is specified, resperf will use <br>
whichever address family is appropriate for the server it is
sending packets to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e <br>
Enables EDNS0 [RFC2671], by adding an OPT record to all
packets sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D <br>
Sets the DO (DNSSEC OK) bit [RFC3225] in all packets sent.
This also enables EDNS0, which is required for DNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y [alg:]name:secret <br>
Add a TSIG record [RFC2845] to all packets sent, using the
specified TSIG key algorithm, name and secret, where the
algorithm defaults to hmac-md5 and the secret is ex&acirc;
<br>
pressed as a base-64 encoded string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Print a usage statement and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interval <br>
Specifies the time interval between data points in the plot
file. The default is 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m max_qps <br>
Specifies the target maximum query rate (in queries per
second). This should be higher than the expected maximum
throughput of the server being tested. Traffic will be <br>
ramped up at a linearly increasing rate until this value is
reached, or until one of the other conditions described in
the section &quot;Running the test&quot; occurs. The default
<br>
is 100000 queries per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P plot_data_file <br>
Specifies the name of the plot data file. The default is
resperf.gnuplot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rampup_time <br>
Specifies the length of time over which traffic will be
ramped up. The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c constant_traffic_time <br>
Specifies the length of time for which traffic will be sent
at a constant rate following the initial ramp-up. The
default is 0 seconds, meaning no sending of traffic at a
<br>
constant rate will be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L max_loss <br>
Specifies the maximum acceptable query loss percentage for
purposes of determining the maximum throughput value. The
default is 100%, meaning that resperf will measure the <br>
maximum throughput without regard to query loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C clients <br>
Act as multiple clients. Requests are sent from multiple
sockets. The default is to act as 1 client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q max_outstanding <br>
Sets the maximum number of outstanding requests. resperf
will stop ramping up traffic when this many queries are
outstanding. The default is 64k, and the limit is 64k per
<br>
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE PLOT DATA FILE <br>
The plot data file is written by the resperf program and
contains the data to be plotted using gnuplot. When running
resperf via the resperf-report script, there is no need for
<br>
the user to deal with this file directly, but its format and
contents are documented here for completeness and in case
you wish to run resperf directly and use its output for <br>
purposes other than viewing it with gnuplot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of the file is a
comment identifying the fields. It may be recognized as a
comment by its leading hash sign (#).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subsequent lines contain the
actual plot data. For purposes of generating the plot data
file, the test run is divided into time intervals of 0.5
