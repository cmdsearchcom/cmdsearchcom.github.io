<p>PERLMODSTYLE(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLMODSTYLE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlmodstyle - Perl module style guide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
This document attempts to describe the Perl
Community&rsquo;s &quot;best practice&quot; for writing Perl
modules. It extends the recommendations found in perlstyle ,
which should be considered <br>
required reading before reading this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While this document is intended
to be useful to all module authors, it is particularly aimed
at authors who wish to publish their modules on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The focus is on elements of
style which are visible to the users of a module, rather
than those parts which are only seen by the module&rsquo;s
developers. However, many of the <br>
guidelines presented in this document can be extrapolated
and applied successfully to a module&rsquo;s internals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document differs from
perlnewmod in that it is a style guide rather than a
tutorial on creating CPAN modules. It provides a checklist
against which modules can be compared <br>
to determine whether they conform to best practice, without
necessarily describing in detail how to achieve this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the advice contained in this
document has been gleaned from extensive conversations with
experienced CPAN authors and users. Every piece of advice
given here is the result <br>
of previous mistakes. This information is here to help you
avoid the same mistakes and the extra work that would
inevitably be required to fix them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first section of this
document provides an itemized checklist; subsequent sections
provide a more detailed discussion of the items on the list.
The final section, &quot;Common <br>
Pitfalls&quot;, describes some of the most popular mistakes
made by CPAN authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUICK CHECKLIST <br>
For more detail on each item in this checklist, see
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you start <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Don&rsquo;t re-invent the wheel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patch, extend or
subclass an existing module where possible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do one thing and
do it well</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose an
appropriate name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The API <br>
&Acirc;&middot; API should be understandable by the average
programmer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Simple methods
for simple tasks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Separate
functionality from output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Consistent
naming of subroutines or methods</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use named
parameters (a hash or hashref) when there are more than two
parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stability <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Ensure your module works under &quot;use
strict&quot; and &quot;-w&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stable modules
should maintain backwards compatibility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Write documentation in POD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Document
purpose, scope and target applications</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Document each
publically accessible method or subroutine, including params
and return values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Give examples of
use in your documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Provide a README
file and perhaps also release notes, changelog, etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Provide links to
further information (URL, email)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Release considerations <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Specify pre-requisites in Makefile.PL or
Build.PL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Specify Perl
version requirements with &quot;use&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Include tests
with your module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose a
sensible and consistent version numbering scheme (X.YY is
the common Perl module numbering scheme)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Increment the
version number for every change, no matter how small</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Package the
module using &quot;make dist&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Choose an
appropriate license (GPL/Artistic is a good default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BEFORE YOU START WRITING A
MODULE <br>
Try not to launch headlong into developing your module
without spending some time thinking first. A little
forethought may save you a vast amount of effort later
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Has it been done before? <br>
You may not even need to write the module. Check whether
it&rsquo;s already been done in Perl, and avoid re-inventing
the wheel unless you have a good reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Good places to look for
pre-existing modules include http://search.cpan.org/ and
asking on modules@perl.org</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an existing module almost
does what you want, consider writing a patch, writing a
subclass, or otherwise extending the existing module rather
than rewriting it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do one thing and do it well <br>
At the risk of stating the obvious, modules are intended to
be modular. A Perl developer should be able to use modules
to put together the building blocks of their application.
<br>
However, it&rsquo;s important that the blocks are the right
shape, and that the developer shouldn&rsquo;t have to use a
big block when all they need is a small one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your module should have a
clearly defined scope which is no longer than a single
sentence. Can your module be broken down into a family of
related modules?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;FooBar.pm provides an
implementation of the FOO protocol and the related BAR
standard.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Good example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Foo.pm provides an
implementation of the FOO protocol. Bar.pm implements the
related BAR protocol.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that if a developer
only needs a module for the BAR standard, they should not be
forced to install libraries for FOO as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s in a name? <br>
Make sure you choose an appropriate name for your module
early on. This will help people find and remember your
module, and make programming with your module more
intuitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When naming your module,
consider the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Be descriptive
(i.e. accurately describes the purpose of the module).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Be consistent
with existing modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Reflect the
functionality of the module, not the implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Avoid starting a
new top-level hierarchy, especially if a suitable hierarchy
already exists under which you could place your module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should contact
modules@perl.org to ask them about your module name before
publishing your module. You should also try to ask people
who are already familiar with the <br>
module&rsquo;s application domain and the CPAN naming
system. Authors of similar modules, or modules with similar
names, may be a good place to start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESIGNING AND WRITING YOUR
MODULE <br>
Considerations for module design and coding:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To OO or not to OO? <br>
Your module may be object oriented (OO) or not, or it may
have both kinds of interfaces available. There are pros and
cons of each technique, which should be considered when you
<br>
design your API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl Best Practices
(copyright 2004, Published by O&rsquo;Reilly Media, Inc.),
Damian Conway provides a list of criteria to use when
deciding if OO is the right fit for your <br>
problem:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The system being
designed is large, or is likely to become large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The data can be
aggregated into obvious structures, especially if
there&rsquo;s a large amount of data in each aggregate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The various
types of data aggregate form a natural hierarchy that
facilitates the use of inheritance and polymorphism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You have a piece
of data on which many different operations are applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You need to
perform the same general operations on related types of
data, but with slight variations depending on the specific
type of data the operations are applied to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It&rsquo;s
likely you&rsquo;ll have to add new data types later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The typical
interactions between pieces of data are best represented by
operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
implementation of individual components of the system is
likely to change over time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The system
design is already object-oriented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Large numbers of
other programmers will be using your code modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Think carefully about whether OO
is appropriate for your module. Gratuitous object
orientation results in complex APIs which are difficult for
the average module user to <br>
understand or use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Designing your API <br>
Your interfaces should be understandable by an average Perl
programmer. The following guidelines may help you judge
whether your API is sufficiently straightforward:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write simple routines to do
simple things. <br>
It&rsquo;s better to have numerous simple routines than a
few monolithic ones. If your routine changes its behaviour
significantly based on its arguments, it&rsquo;s a sign that
you <br>
should have two (or more) separate routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Separate functionality from
output. <br>
Return your results in the most generic form possible and
allow the user to choose how to use them. The most generic
form possible is usually a Perl data structure which can
<br>
then be used to generate a text report, HTML, XML, a
database query, or whatever else your users require.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your routine iterates through
some kind of list (such as a list of files, or records in a
database) you may consider providing a callback so that
users can manipulate each <br>
element of the list in turn. File::Find provides an example
of this with its &quot;find(wanted, $dir)&quot; syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provide sensible shortcuts and
defaults. <br>
Don&rsquo;t require every module user to jump through the
same hoops to achieve a simple result. You can always
include optional parameters or routines for more complex or
non- <br>
standard behaviour. If most of your users have to type a few
almost identical lines of code when they start using your
module, it&rsquo;s a sign that you should have made that
<br>
behaviour a default. Another good indicator that you should
use defaults is if most of your users call your routines
with the same arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Naming conventions <br>
Your naming should be consistent. For instance, it&rsquo;s
better to have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display_day(); <br>
display_week(); <br>
display_year();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">than</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">display_day(); <br>
week_display(); <br>
show_year();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies equally to method
names, parameter names, and anything else which is visible
to the user (and most things that aren&rsquo;t!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameter passing <br>
Use named parameters. It&rsquo;s easier to use a hash like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$obj-&gt;do_something( <br>
name =&gt; &quot;wibble&quot;, <br>
type =&gt; &quot;text&quot;, <br>
size =&gt; 1024, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">... than to have a long list of
unnamed parameters like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$obj-&gt;do_something(&quot;wibble&quot;,
&quot;text&quot;, 1024);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the list of arguments
might work fine for one, two or even three arguments, any
more arguments become hard for the module user to remember,
and hard for the module <br>
author to manage. If you want to add a new parameter you
will have to add it to the end of the list for backward
compatibility, and this will probably make your list order
<br>
unintuitive. Also, if many elements may be undefined you may
see the following unattractive method calls:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$obj-&gt;do_something(undef,
undef, undef, undef, undef, undef, 1024);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Provide sensible defaults for
parameters which have them. Don&rsquo;t make your users
specify parameters which will almost always be the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The issue of whether to pass the
arguments in a hash or a hashref is largely a matter of
personal style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of hash keys starting
with a hyphen (&quot;-name&quot;) or entirely in upper case
(&quot;NAME&quot;) is a relic of older versions of Perl in
which ordinary lower case strings were not <br>
handled correctly by the &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator. While
some modules retain uppercase or hyphenated argument keys
for historical reasons or as a matter of personal style,
most new <br>
modules should use simple lower case keys. Whatever you
choose, be consistent!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strictness and warnings <br>
Your module should run successfully under the strict pragma
and should run without generating any warnings. Your module
should also handle taint-checking where appropriate, <br>
though this can cause difficulties in many cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backwards compatibility <br>
Modules which are &quot;stable&quot; should not break
backwards compatibility without at least a long transition
phase and a major change in version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Error handling and messages <br>
When your module encounters an error it should do one or
more of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Return an
undefined value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; set
$Module::errstr or similar (&quot;errstr&quot; is a common
name used by DBI and other popular modules; if you choose
something else, be sure to document it clearly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;warn()&quot; or &quot;carp()&quot; a message to
STDERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;croak()&quot; only when your module absolutely cannot
figure out what to do. (&quot;croak()&quot; is a better
version of &quot;die()&quot; for use within modules, which
reports its errors from the <br>
perspective of the caller. See Carp for details of
&quot;croak()&quot;, &quot;carp()&quot; and other useful
routines.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As an
alternative to the above, you may prefer to throw exceptions
using the Error module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configurable error handling can
be very useful to your users. Consider offering a choice of
levels for warning and debug messages, an option to send
messages to a separate file, <br>
a way to specify an error-handling routine, or other such
features. Be sure to default all these options to the
commonest use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOCUMENTING YOUR MODULE <br>
POD <br>
Your module should include documentation aimed at Perl
developers. You should use Perl&rsquo;s &quot;plain old
documentation&quot; (POD) for your general technical
documentation, though you may <br>
wish to write additional documentation (white papers,
tutorials, etc) in some other format. You need to cover the
following subjects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A synopsis of
the common uses of the module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The purpose,
scope and target applications of your module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of each
publically accessible method or subroutine, including
parameters and return values</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Examples of
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sources of
further information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A contact email
address for the author/maintainer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The level of detail in Perl
module documentation generally goes from less detailed to
more detailed. Your SYNOPSIS section should contain a
minimal example of use (perhaps as <br>
little as one line of code; skip the unusual use cases or
anything not needed by most users); the DESCRIPTION should
describe your module in broad terms, generally in just a few
<br>
paragraphs; more detail of the module&rsquo;s routines or
methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth material
should be given in subsequent sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ideally, someone who&rsquo;s
slightly familiar with your module should be able to refresh
their memory without hitting &quot;page down&quot;. As your
reader continues through the document, they <br>
should receive a progressively greater amount of
knowledge.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recommended order of
sections in Perl module documentation is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; NAME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SYNOPSIS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DESCRIPTION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; One or more
sections or subsections giving greater detail of available
methods and routines and any other relevant information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
BUGS/CAVEATS/etc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; AUTHOR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; SEE ALSO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; COPYRIGHT and
LICENSE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep your documentation near the
code it documents (&quot;inline&quot; documentation).
Include POD for a given method right above that
method&rsquo;s subroutine. This makes it easier to keep <br>
the documentation up to date, and avoids having to document
each piece of code twice (once in POD and once in
comments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">README, INSTALL, release notes,
changelogs <br>
Your module should also include a README file describing the
module and giving pointers to further information (website,
author email).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An INSTALL file should be
included, and should contain simple installation
instructions. When using ExtUtils::MakeMaker this will
usually be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL <br>
make <br>
make test <br>
make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using Module::Build, this
will usually be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Build.PL <br>
perl Build <br>
perl Build test <br>
perl Build install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Release notes or changelogs
should be produced for each release of your software
describing user-visible changes to your module, in terms
relevant to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELEASE CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Version numbering <br>
Version numbers should indicate at least major and minor
releases, and possibly sub-minor releases. A major release
is one in which most of the functionality has changed, or in
<br>
which major new functionality is added. A minor release is
one in which a small amount of functionality has been added
or changed. Sub-minor version numbers are usually used <br>
for changes which do not affect functionality, such as
documentation patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most common CPAN version
numbering scheme looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.00, 1.10, 1.11, 1.20, 1.30,
1.31, 1.32</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A correct CPAN version number is
a floating point number with at least 2 digits after the
decimal. You can test whether it conforms to CPAN by
using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le
&rsquo;print MM-&gt;parse_version(shift)&rsquo;
&rsquo;Foo.pm&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to release a
&rsquo;beta&rsquo; or &rsquo;alpha&rsquo; version of a
module but don&rsquo;t want CPAN.pm to list it as most
recent use an &rsquo;_&rsquo; after the regular version
number followed by at least 2 <br>
digits, eg. 1.20_01. If you do this, the following idiom is
recommended:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$VERSION = &quot;1.12_01&quot;;
<br>
$XS_VERSION = $VERSION; # only needed if you have XS code
<br>
$VERSION = eval $VERSION;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With that trick MakeMaker will
only read the first line and thus read the underscore, while
the perl interpreter will evaluate the $VERSION and convert
the string into a number. <br>
Later operations that treat $VERSION as a number will then
be able to do so without provoking a warning about $VERSION
not being a number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Never release anything (even a
one-word documentation patch) without incrementing the
number. Even a one-word documentation patch should result in
a change in version at the <br>
sub-minor level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pre-requisites <br>
Module authors should carefully consider whether to rely on
other modules, and which modules to rely on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most importantly, choose modules
which are as stable as possible. In order of preference:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Core Perl
modules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stable CPAN
modules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unstable CPAN
modules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modules not
available from CPAN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify version requirements for
other Perl modules in the pre-requisites in your Makefile.PL
or Build.PL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be sure to specify Perl version
requirements both in Makefile.PL or Build.PL and with
&quot;require 5.6.1&quot; or similar. See the section on
&quot;use VERSION&quot; of &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc
for <br>
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
All modules should be tested before distribution (using
&quot;make disttest&quot;), and the tests should also be
available to people installing the modules (using &quot;make
test&quot;). For <br>
Module::Build you would use the &quot;make test&quot;
equivalent &quot;perl Build test&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The importance of these tests is
proportional to the alleged stability of a module. A module
which purports to be stable or which hopes to achieve wide
use should adhere to as <br>
strict a testing regime as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Useful modules to help you write
tests (with minimum impact on your development process or
your time) include Test::Simple, Carp::Assert and
Test::Inline. For more sophisticated <br>
test suites there are Test::More and Test::MockObject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packaging <br>
Modules should be packaged using one of the standard
packaging tools. Currently you have the choice between
ExtUtils::MakeMaker and the more platform independent
Module::Build, <br>
allowing modules to be installed in a consistent manner.
When using ExtUtils::MakeMaker, you can use &quot;make
dist&quot; to create your package. Tools exist to help you
to build your <br>
module in a MakeMaker-friendly style. These include
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker and h2xs. See also perlnewmod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Licensing <br>
Make sure that your module has a license, and that the full
text of it is included in the distribution (unless
it&rsquo;s a common one and the terms of the license
don&rsquo;t require you to <br>
include it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t know what
license to use, dual licensing under the GPL and Artistic
licenses (the same as Perl itself) is a good idea. See
perlgpl and perlartistic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON PITFALLS <br>
Reinventing the wheel <br>
There are certain application spaces which are already very,
very well served by CPAN. One example is templating systems,
another is date and time modules, and there are many <br>
more. While it is a rite of passage to write your own
version of these things, please consider carefully whether
the Perl world really needs you to publish it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trying to do too much <br>
Your module will be part of a developer&rsquo;s toolkit. It
will not, in itself, form the entire toolkit. It&rsquo;s
tempting to add extra features until your code is a
monolithic system <br>
rather than a set of modular building blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inappropriate documentation <br>
Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of writing for the wrong
audience. Your primary audience is a reasonably experienced
developer with at least a moderate understanding of your
module&rsquo;s <br>
application domain, who&rsquo;s just downloaded your module
