<b>httperf</b> is a tool to measure web server performance. It speaks the HTTP
  protocol both in its HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 flavors and offers a variety of
  workload generators. While running, it keeps track of a number of performance
  metrics that are summarized in the form of statistics that are printed at the
  end of a test run. The most basic operation of <b>httperf</b> is to generate a
  fixed number of HTTP GET requests and to measure how many replies (responses)
  came back from the server and at what rate the responses arrived.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> To obtain correct results, it is necessary to run at most one
  <b>httperf</b> process per client machine. Also, there should be as few
  background processes as possible both on the client and server machines.

      ids are not reused, so the entire SSL connection establishment process
      (known as the SSL handshake) occurs for each connection.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The operation of <b>httperf</b> can be controlled through a number of options.
  The tool supports both short (one-character) and long (arbitrary-length)
  option names. Short options are prefixed with a single leading dash (-), long
  options with a double-dash (--). Multiple short options can be grouped
  together (e.g., ``<b>-vV</b>'' is equivalent to ``<b>-v -V</b>'') and long
  options can be abbreviated so long as they remain unique. Parameters to
  options can be specified either by following the long option name with an
  equal sign and the parameter value (e.g., <b>--burst=10</b>) or by separating
  the option name and value with whitespace (e.g., <b>--burst 10</b>).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--add-header=</b><i>S</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies to include string <i>S</i> as an additional
      request header. It is necessary to specify the terminating
      carriage-return/line-feed sequence explicitly. This can be done by using
      the escape sequence ``\n''. This makes it possible to include multiple
      request headers. For example, ``--add-header &quot;Referer: foo\nAuth:
      secret\n&quot;'' would add two request headers (``Referer'' and ``Auth'')
      to each request. Other supported escape sequences are ``\r''
      (carriage-return), ``\a'' (line-feed), ``\\'' (backslash), and ``\N''

      connection/session ``interarrival time'' can alternatively be specified by
      the <b>--rate</b> option, although more flexibility is available with
      <b>--period.</b> The <i>D</i> parameter specifies the interarrival time
      distribution. If omitted or set to ``<b>d</b>'', a deterministic (i.e.,
      fixed) period is used as specified by parameter <i>T1</i> in units of
      seconds. If <i>D</i> is set to ``<b>e</b>'', an exponential (i.e.,
      Poisson) distribution is used with a mean interarrival time of <i>T1</i>.
      Finally, if <i>D</i> is set to ``<b>u</b>'', a uniform distribution over
      the interval [<i>T1</i>,<i>T2</i>) is used for the interarrival time. In
      all cases, a period of 0 results in connections or sessions being
      generated sequentially (a new connection/session is initiated as soon as
      the previous one completes). The default value for this option is 0. Note
      that specifying, for example, <b>--rate=5</b> is equivalent to specifying
      <b>--period=d0.2</b> or <b>--period=0.2</b>. By specifying
      <b>--period=u1,3</b>, the interarrival times will be randomly chosen from
      the interval between 1 and 3 seconds. The specific sequence of

      value is added to the normal timeout value (see option <b>--timeout</b>).
      When accessing static web content, it is usually not necessary to specify
      this option. However, when performing tests with long-running CGI scripts,
      it may be necessary to use this option to allow for larger response-times.

      seconds and can be a fractional number (e.g., <b>--timeout 3.5</b>). This
      timeout value is used when establishing a TCP connection, when sending a
      request, when waiting for a reply, and when receiving a reply. If during
      any of those activities a request fails to make forward progress within
      the alloted time, <b>httperf</b> considers the request to have died,
      closes the associated connection or session and increases the
      <b>client-timo</b> error count. The actual timeout value used when waiting

  <dd class="It-tag">Requests the generation and measurement of sessions instead
      of individual requests. A session consists of a sequence of bursts which
      are spaced out by the user think-time. Each burst consists of a fixed
      number <i>L</i> of calls to the server (<i>L</i> is specified by option
      <b>--burst-length</b>). The calls in a burst are issued as follows: at
      first, a single call is issued. Once the reply to this first call has been
      fully received, all remaining calls in the burst are issued concurrently.
      The concurrent calls are issued either as pipelined calls on an existing
      persistent connection or as individual calls on separate connections.
      Whether a persistent connection is used depends on whether the server
      responds to the first call with a reply that includes a ``Connection:
      close'' header line. If such a line is present, separate connections are
      used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The option specifies the following parameters: <i>N1</i> is the total number
      of sessions to generate, <i>N2</i> is the number of calls per session, and
      <i>X</i> is the user think-time (in seconds) that separates consecutive
      call bursts. For example, the options ``<b>--wsess=100,50,10 --burst-len
      5</b>'' would result in 100 sessions with a total of 50 calls each. Since
      each burst has a length of 5 calls, a total of 10 call bursts would be
      generated per session. The user think-time between call bursts would be 10
      seconds. Note that user think-time <i>X</i> denotes the time between
      receiving the last reply of the previous call burst and the sending of the
      first request of the next burst.

    A test involving sessions finishes as soon as the requested number <i>N1</i>

    The above description specifies 2 sessions. The first session will start
      with a request for /foo.html. When the /foo.html response comes back, a
      burst of 2 requests will follow (/pict1.gif and /pict2.gif). When the last
      of those responses is received, a two second user think time is inserted
      before the next request of /foo2.html is issued. This request is sent as a
      POST. The posted data can be contained between single- or double-quotes.
      Newlines can appear within posted data as ``\n'' or as a ``\&lt;CR&gt;''.
      The /foo2.html response is followed by a burst request of /pict3.gif and
      /pict4.gif, which concludes this session. The second session is started
      some time after the first, as specified by the <b>--rate</b> or
      <b>--period</b> options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The second session consists of 2 requests separated by the default user
      think time as specified by the <i>X</i> parameter of the <b>--wsesslog</b>
      option. If the <i>N</i> parameter of <b>--wsesslog</b> is greater than the
      number of sessions defined in input file <i>F</i>, then the defined
      sessions are used repeatedly until <i>N</i> sessions have been created
      (i.e., the defined sessions are used in a round-robin fashion).

    One should avoid using <b>--wsesslog</b> in conjunction with other

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--wset=</b><i>N</i><b>,</b><i>X</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option can be used to walk through a list of URIs at a
      given rate. Parameter <i>N</i> specifies the number of distinct URIs that
      should be generated and <i>X</i> specifies the rate at which new URIs are

      accessed four times in a row before moving on to the next URI. This type
      of access pattern is useful in generating a workload that induces a
      relatively predictable amount of traffic in the disk I/O subsystem of the
      server (assuming <i>N</i> and the accessed files are big enough to exceed
      the server's buffer cache). The URIs generated are of the form
      <i>prefix</i>/<i>path</i>.html, where <i>prefix</i> is the URI prefix
      specified by option <b>--wset</b> and <i>path</i> is generated as follows:

      decimal, prefixing the number with as many zeroes as necessary to get a
      string that has as many digits as <i>N</i>-1. Then insert a slash
      character between each digit. For example, the 103rd file in a working set
      consisting of 1024 files would result in a path of ``<b>0/1/0/3</b>''.
      Thus, if the URI-prefix is <b>/wset1024</b>, then the URI being accessed
      would be <b>/wset1024/0/1/0/3.html</b>. In other words, the files on the

There are six groups of statistics: overall results (``Total''), connection
  related results (``Connection''), results relating to the issuing of HTTP
  requests (``Request''), results relating to the replies received from the
  server (``Reply''), miscellaneous results relating to the CPU (``CPU'') and
  network (``Net I/O'') utilization and, last but not least, a summary of errors
  encountered (``Errors'').
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Total Section</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This section summarizes how many TCP connections were initiated by
      <b>httperf</b>, how many requests it sent out, how many replies it
      received, and what the total test duration was. In the example output
      shown above, 30,000 connections were created, 29,997 requests were sent
      out and 29,997 replies were received. The duration of the test was almost
      exactly 5 minutes (300 seconds).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Connection Section</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This section conveys information related to TCP connections generated by the
      tool. Specifically, the ``Connection rate'' line shows that new
      connections were initiated at a rate of 100.0 connections per second. This
      rate corresponds to a period of 10.0 milliseconds per connection. The last
      number in this line shows that at most 14 connections were open at any
      given time.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The first line labeled ``Connection time'' gives lifetime statistics for
      successful connections. The lifetime of a connection is the time between a
      TCP connection is initiated and the time the connection is closed. A
      connection is considered successful if it had at least one call that
      completed successfully. In the example output, the line indicates that the
      minimum (``min'') connection lifetime was 1.4 milliseconds, the average
      (``avg'') lifetime was 3.0 milliseconds, the maximum (``max'') was 163.4
      milliseconds, the median (``median'') lifetime was 1.5 milliseconds, and
      that the standard deviation of the lifetimes was 7.3 milliseconds. The
      median lifetime is computed based on a histogram with one millisecond
      resolution and a maximum lifetime of 100 seconds. Thus, the median is
      accurate to within half a millisecond if at least half of the successful
      connections have a lifetime of no more than 100 seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The next statistic in this section is the average time it took to establish
      a TCP connection. Only successful TCP connection establishments are
      counted. In the example, the second line labeled ``Connection time'' shows
      that, on average, it took 0.6 milliseconds to establish a connection.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The final line in this section is labeled ``Connection length.'' It gives
      the average number of replies received on each connection that received at
      least one reply (i.e., connections that failed before yielding the first
      reply are not counted). This number can be bigger than 1.0 due to
      persistent connections.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Request Section</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The line labeled ``Request rate'' gives the rate at which HTTP requests were
      issued and the period that this rate corresponds to. In the example above,
      the request rate was 100.0 requests per second, which corresponds to 10.0
      milliseconds per request. As long as no persistent connections are
      employed, the results in this section are very similar or identical to
      results in the connection section. However, when persistent connections
      are used, several calls can be performed on a single connection in which
      case the results would be different.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The line labeled ``Request size'' gives the average size of the HTTP
      requests in bytes. In the example above, the average request size was 75
      bytes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Reply Section</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    For simple measurements, this section is often the most interesting one as
      the line labeled ``Reply rate'' gives various statistics for the reply
      rate. In the example above, the minimum (``min'') reply rate was 98.8
      replies per second, the average (``avg'') was 100 replies per second, and
      the maximum (``max'') rate was 101.2 replies per second. The standard
      deviation was 0.3 replies per second. The number enclosed in parentheses
      shows that 60 reply rate samples were acquired. At present, <b>httperf</b>
      collects a rate sample once every five seconds. To obtain a meaningful
      standard deviation, it is recommended to run tests long enough so at least
      thirty samples are obtained. This corresponds to a test duration of at
      least 150 seconds.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The line labeled ``Reply Time'' gives information on how long it took for
      the server to respond and how long it took to receive the reply. In the
      example, it took on average 2.4 milliseconds between sending the first
      byte of the request and receiving the first byte of the reply. The time to
      ``transfer'', or read, the reply was too short to be measured, so it shows
      up as zero. The is typical when the entire reply fits into a single TCP
      segment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The next line, labeled ``Reply size'' contains statistics on the average
      size of the replies---all numbers are in reported bytes. Specifically, the
      line lists the average length of reply headers, the content, and footers
      (HTTP/1.1 uses footers to realize the ``chunked'' transfer encoding). For
      convenience, the average total number of bytes in the replies is also
      given in parentheses. In the example, the average header length
      (``header'') was 242 bytes, the average content length (``content'') was
      1010 bytes, and there were no footers (``footer'' length is zero). The
      total reply length of 1252 bytes on average.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The final line in this section is a histogram of the major status codes
      received in the replies from the server. The major status code is the
      ``hundreds''-digit of the full HTTP status code. In the example, all
      29,997 replies had a major status code of 2. It's a good guess that all
      status codes were ``200 OK'' but the information in the histogram is not
      detailed enough to allow distinguishing status codes with the same major
      code.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Miscellaneous Section</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This section starts with a summary of the CPU utilization on the client
      machine. In the example, the line labeled ``CPU time'' shows that 94.31
      seconds were spent executing in user mode (``user''), 205.26 seconds were
      spent executing in system mode (``system'') and that this corresponds to
      31.4% user mode execution and 68.4% system execution. The total
      utilization was 99.9%, which is expected given that <b>httperf</b> is a
      CPU hog. A total CPU utilization of significantly less than 100% is a sign
      that there were competing processes that interfered with the test.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The line labeled ``Net I/O'' gives the average network throughput in
      kilobytes per second (where a kilobyte is 1024 bytes) and in megabits per
      second (where a megabit is 10^6 bits). In the example, an average network
      usage of about 129.6 kilobytes per second was sustained. The number in
      parentheses shows that this corresponds to about 1.1 megabits per second.
      This network bandwidth is computed based on the number of bytes sent and
      received on the TCP connections. In other words, it does not account for
      the network headers or TCP retransmissions that may have occurred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Errors Section</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    The last section contains statistics on the errors that were encountered
      during a test. In the example, the two lines labeled ``Errors'' show that
      there were a total of three errors and that all three errors were due to
      the server refusing to accept a connection (``connrefused''). A
      description of each error counter follows:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>client-timo:</b> The number of times a session, connection, or call
      failed due to a client timeout (as specified by the <b>--timeout</b> and
      <b>--think-timeout</b>) options.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>socket-timo:</b> The number of times a TCP connection failed with a
      socket-level timeout (ETIMEDOUT).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>connrefused:</b> The number of times a TCP connection attempt failed with
      a ``connection refused by server'' error (ECONNREFUSED).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>connreset:</b> The number of times a TCP connection failed due to a RESET
      from the server. Typically, a RESET is received when the client attempts
      to send data to the server at a time the server has already closed its end
      of the connection. NT servers also send RESETs when attempting to
      establish a new connection when the listen queue is full.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>fd-unavail:</b> The number of times the <b>httperf</b> process was out of
      file descriptors. Whenever this count is non-zero, the test results are
      meaningless because the client was overloaded (see section &quot;CHOOSING
      TIMEOUT VALUES&quot;).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>addrunavail:</b> The number of times the client was out of TCP port
      numbers (EADDRNOTAVAIL). This error should never occur. If it does, the
      results should be discarded.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>ftab-full:</b> The number of times the system's file descriptor table is
      full. Again, this error should never occur. If it does, the results should
      be discarded.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>other:</b> The number of times some other type of error occurred.
      Whenever this counter is non-zero, it is necessary to track down the real
      cause of the error. To assist in doing this, <b>httperf</b> prints the
      error code (errno) of the first unknown errors that occurs during a test
      run.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>--wsess</b> or <b>--wsesslog</b> is specified, <b>httperf</b> generates
  and measures sessions instead of individual calls and additional statistics
  are printed at the end of a test. An example output is shown below.

<div class="Pp"></div>
The line labeled ``Session rate'' shows the minium, average, and maximum rate at
  which sessions completed (based on a 5 second sampling interval). It also
  shows the standard deviation of the session completion rate. The numbers in
  parentheses show how many sessions succeeded and how many sessions were
  initiated. In the example above, the minimum, average, and maximum session
  completion rates were 0.00, 0.59, and 2.40 sessions per second, respectively.
  The standard deviation was 0.37 sessions per second and 240 out of 450
  sessions completed successfully (210 failed due to errors such as timeouts).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The next line, labeled ``Session:'' shows the average length of a session
  measured in connections. In the example above, an average of 6.45 connections
  were required to complete a session.

The line labeled ``Session lifetime'' gives the average time it took to complete
  a successful session. In the example above, it took an average of 123.9
  seconds.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The line labeled ``Session failtime'' gives the average time it took before an
  unsuccessful session failed. In the example above, it took on average 58.5
  seconds for a session to fail.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, the line labeled ``Session length histogram'' gives a histogram of the
  number of replies received by each session. In the example above, 4 sessions
  ended after receiving no reply at all, 7 ended after receiving one reply, and
  so on (the ellipsis indicates additional histogram counts that were omitted
  from this manual for space reasons). Note that this histogram does not
  distinguish between successful and failed sessions.

  TIMEOUT VALUES</a></h1>
Since the machine that <b>httperf</b> runs on has only a finite set of resource
  available, it can not sustain arbitrarily high HTTP loads. For example, one
  limiting factor is that there are only roughly 60,000 TCP port numbers that
  can be in use at any given time. Since on most UNIX systems it takes one
  minute for a TCP connection to be fully closed (leave the TIME_WAIT state),
  the maximum rate a client can sustain is at most 1,000 requests per second.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The actual sustainable rate is often much lower than that because before running
  out of TCP ports, the machine is likely to run out of file descriptors (one
  file descriptor is used up for each open TCP connection). By default, HP-UX
  10.20 allows 1,024 open file descriptors per process. This means that without
  extra precautions, <b>httperf</b> could potentially very quickly use up all
  available file descriptors, at which point it could not induce any additional
  load on the server. To avoid this problem, <b>httperf</b> provides option
  <b>--timeout</b> to set a timeout for all communication with the server. If
  the server does not respond before the timeout expires, the client considers
  the corresponding session, connection, or call to be ``dead,'' closes the
  associated TCP connection, and increases the ``client-timo'' error count. The
  only exception to this rule is that after sending an entire request to the
  server, <b>httperf</b> allows the server to take some additional time before
  it starts sending the reply. This is to accommodate HTTP requests that take a
  long time to complete on the server. This additional time is called the
  ``server think time'' and can be specified by option <b>--think-timeout</b>.
  By default, this additional think time is zero seconds, so the server would
  always have to respond within the time alloted by option <b>--timeout</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Timeouts allow <b>httperf</b> to sustain high offered loads even when the server
  is overloaded. For example, with a timeout of 2 seconds and assuming that
  1,000 file-descriptors are available, the offered load could be up to 500
  requests per second (in practice, the sustainable load is often somewhat
  smaller than the theoretical value). On the downside, timeouts artificially
  truncate the connection lifetime distribution. Thus, it is recommended to pick
  a timeout value that is as large as possible yet small enough to allow
  sustaining the desired offered rate. A timeout as short as one second may be
  acceptable, but larger timeouts (5-10 seconds) are preferable.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is important to keep in mind that timeouts do not guarantee that a client can
  sustain a particular offered load---there are many other potential resource
  bottlenecks. For example, in some cases the client machine may simply run out
  of CPU time. To ensure that a given test really measured the server's
  capabilities and not the client's, it is a good idea to vary the number of
  machines participating in a test. If observed performance remains the same as
  the number of client machines is varied, the test results are likely to be
  valid.

<b>httperf</b> was developed by David Mosberger and was heavily influenced by an
  earlier tool written by Tai Jin. Stephane Eranian contributed the log-file
  based URI generator. Dick Carter contributed the <b>--wsesslog</b> workload
  generator, the support behind the <b>--period</b> option, and bug fixes. All
  four authors are with Hewlett-Packard Research Laboratories.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Probably many. Always be sure to double-check results and don't fall prey to
  measuring client-performance instead of server performance!
<div class="Pp"></div>
The user-interface definitely could be improved. A simple workload description
  language might be more suitable than the dozens of little command-line options
  the tool has right now.</div>
