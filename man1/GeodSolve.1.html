<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid at
(lat1, lon1) and (lat2, lon2) is called the geodesic. Its
length is s12 and the geodesic from point 1 to point 2 has
<br>
forward azimuths azi1 and azi2 at the two end points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeodSolve operates in one of
three modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. By default, GeodSolve accepts
lines on the standard input containing lat1 lon1 azi1 s12
and prints lat2 lon2 azi2 on standard output. This is the
direct geodesic <br>
calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. With the -i command line
argument, GeodSolve performs the inverse geodesic
calculation. It reads lines containing lat1 lon1 lat2 lon2
and prints the corresponding values of <br>
azi1 azi2 s12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Command line arguments -L
lat1 lon1 azi1 specify a geodesic line. GeodSolve then
accepts a sequence of s12 values (one per line) on standard
input and prints lat2 lon2 azi2 <br>
for each. This generates a sequence of points on a single
geodesic. Command line arguments -D and -I work similarly
with the geodesic line defined in terms of a direct or <br>
inverse geodesic calculation, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i perform an inverse geodesic calculation (see 2
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L lat1 lon1 azi1 <br>
line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along
the geodesic specified by lat1 lon1 azi1. The -w flag can be
used to swap the default order of the 2 geographic <br>
coordinates, provided that it appears before -L. (-l is an
alternative, deprecated, spelling of this flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D lat1 lon1 azi1 s13 <br>
line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along
the geodesic specified by lat1 lon1 azi1 s13. The -w flag
can be used to swap the default order of the 2 <br>
geographic coordinates, provided that it appears before -D.
Similarly, the -a flag can be used to change the
interpretation of s13 to a13, provided that it appears
before <br>
-D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I lat1 lon1 lat3 lon3 <br>
line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along
the geodesic specified by lat1 lon1 lat3 lon3. The -w flag
can be used to swap the default order of the 2 <br>
geographic coordinates, provided that it appears before
-I.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a toggle the arc mode flag (it
starts off); if this flag is on, then on input and output
s12 is replaced by a12 the arc length (in degrees) on the
auxiliary sphere. See <br>
&quot;AUXILIARY SPHERE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e a f <br>
specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the
flattening, f. Setting f = 0 results in a sphere. Specify f
&lt; 0 for a prolate ellipsoid. A simple fraction, <br>
e.g., 1/297, is allowed for f. By default, the WGS84
ellipsoid is used, a = 6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u unroll the longitude.
Normally, on output longitudes are reduced to lie in
[-180deg,180deg). However with this option, the returned
longitude lon2 is &quot;unrolled&quot; so that <br>
lon2 - lon1 indicates how often and in what sense the
geodesic has encircled the earth. Use the -f option, to get
both longitudes printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F fractional mode. This only
has any effect with the -D and -I options (and is otherwise
ignored). The values read on standard input are interpreted
as fractional distances <br>
to point 3, i.e., as s12/s13 instead of s12. If arc mode is
in effect, then the values denote fractional arc length,
i.e., a12/a13.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d output angles as degrees,
minutes, seconds instead of decimal degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-: like -d, except use : as a
separator instead of the d, &rsquo;, and &quot;
delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w toggle the longitude first
flag (it starts off); if the flag is on, then on input and
output, longitude precedes latitude (except that, on input,
this can be overridden by a <br>
hemisphere designator, N, S, E, W).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b report the back azimuth at
point 2 instead of the forward azimuth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f full output; each line of
output consists of 12 quantities: lat1 lon1 azi1 lat2 lon2
azi2 s12 a12 m12 M12 M21 S12. a12 is described in
&quot;AUXILIARY SPHERE&quot;. The four <br>
quantities m12, M12, M21, and S12 are described in
&quot;ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prec <br>
set the output precision to prec (default 3); prec is the
precision relative to 1 m. See &quot;PRECISION&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E use &quot;exact&quot;
algorithms (based on elliptic integrals) for the geodesic
calculations. These are more accurate than the (default)
series expansions for |f| &gt; 0.02.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--comment-delimiter commentdelim
<br>
set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g.,
&quot;#&quot; or &quot;//&quot;). If set, the input lines
will be scanned for this delimiter and, if found, the
delimiter and the rest of the <br>
line will be removed prior to processing and subsequently
appended to the output line (separated by a space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
print version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h print usage and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help <br>
print full documentation and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input-file infile <br>
read input from the file infile instead of from standard
input; a file name of &quot;-&quot; stands for standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input-string instring <br>
read input from the string instring instead of from standard
input. All occurrences of the line separator character
(default is a semicolon) in instring are converted to <br>
newlines before the reading begins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line-separator linesep <br>
set the line separator character to linesep. By default this
is a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-file outfile <br>
write output to the file outfile instead of to standard
output; a file name of &quot;-&quot; stands for standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br>
GeodSolve measures all angles in degrees and all lengths
(s12) in meters, and all areas (S12) in meters^2. On input
angles (latitude, longitude, azimuth, arc length) can be as
<br>
decimal degrees or degrees, minutes, seconds. For example,
&quot;40d30&quot;, &quot;40d30&rsquo;&quot;,
&quot;40:30&quot;, &quot;40.5d&quot;, and 40.5 are all
equivalent. By default, latitude precedes longitude for each
<br>
point (the -w flag switches this convention); however on
input either may be given first by appending (or prepending)
N or S to the latitude and E or W to the longitude. <br>
Azimuths are measured clockwise from north; however this may
be overridden with E or W.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For details on the allowed
formats for angles, see the &quot;GEOGRAPHIC
COORDINATES&quot; section of GeoConvert(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUXILIARY SPHERE <br>
Geodesics on the ellipsoid can be transferred to the
auxiliary sphere on which the distance is measured in terms
of the arc length a12 (measured in degrees) instead of s12.
In <br>
terms of a12, 180 degrees is the distance from one equator
crossing to the next or from the minimum latitude to the
maximum latitude. Geodesics with a12 &gt; 180 degrees do not
<br>
correspond to shortest paths. With the -a flag, s12 (on both
input and output) is replaced by a12. The -a flag does not
affect the full output given by the -f flag (which <br>
always includes both s12 and a12).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES <br>
The -f flag reports four additional quantities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reduced length of the
geodesic, m12, is defined such that if the initial azimuth
is perturbed by dazi1 (radians) then the second point is
displaced by m12 dazi1 in the <br>
direction perpendicular to the geodesic. m12 is given in
meters. On a curved surface the reduced length obeys a
symmetry relation, m12 + m21 = 0. On a flat surface, we have
<br>
m12 = s12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M12 and M21 are geodesic scales.
If two geodesics are parallel at point 1 and separated by a
small distance dt, then they are separated by a distance M12
dt at point 2. M21 is <br>
defined similarly (with the geodesics being parallel to one
another at point 2). M12 and M21 are dimensionless
quantities. On a flat surface, we have M12 = M21 = 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If points 1, 2, and 3 lie on a
single geodesic, then the following addition rules hold:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s13 = s12 + s23, <br>
a13 = a12 + a23, <br>
S13 = S12 + S23, <br>
m13 = m12 M23 + m23 M21, <br>
M13 = M12 M23 - (1 - M12 M21) m23 / m12, <br>
M31 = M32 M21 - (1 - M23 M32) m12 / m23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, S12 is the area between
the geodesic from point 1 to point 2 and the equator; i.e.,
it is the area, measured counter-clockwise, of the geodesic
quadrilateral with <br>
corners (lat1,lon1), (0,lon1), (0,lon2), and (lat2,lon2). It
is given in meters^2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRECISION <br>
prec gives precision of the output with prec = 0 giving 1 m
precision, prec = 3 giving 1 mm precision, etc. prec is the
number of digits after the decimal point for lengths. <br>
For decimal degrees, the number of digits after the decimal
point is prec + 5. For DMS (degree, minute, seconds) output,
the number of digits after the decimal point in the <br>
seconds component is prec + 1. The minimum value of prec is
0 and the maximum is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
An illegal line of input will print an error message to
standard output beginning with &quot;ERROR:&quot; and causes
GeodSolve to return an exit code of 1. However, an error
does not <br>
cause GeodSolve to terminate; following lines will be
converted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCURACY <br>
Using the (default) series solution, GeodSolve is accurate
to about 15 nm (15 nanometers) for the WGS84 ellipsoid. The
approximate maximum error (expressed as a distance) for an
<br>
ellipsoid with the same major radius as the WGS84 ellipsoid
and different values of the flattening is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|f| error <br>
0.01 25 nm <br>
0.02 30 nm <br>
0.05 10 um <br>
0.1 1.5 mm <br>
0.2 300 mm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -E is specified, GeodSolve is
accurate to about 40 nm (40 nanometers) for the WGS84
ellipsoid. The approximate maximum error (expressed as a
distance) for an ellipsoid with a <br>
quarter meridian of 10000 km and different values of the a/b
= 1 - f is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1-f error (nm) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS <br>
The shortest distance returned for the inverse problem is
(obviously) uniquely defined. However, in a few special
cases there are multiple azimuths which yield the same
shortest <br>
distance. Here is a catalog of those cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lat1 = -lat2 (with neither point
at a pole) <br>
If azi1 = azi2, the geodesic is unique. Otherwise there are
two geodesics and the second one is obtained by setting
[azi1,azi2] = [azi2,azi1], [M12,M21] = [M21,M12], S12 = <br>
-S12. (This occurs when the longitude difference is near
+/-180 for oblate ellipsoids.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lon2 = lon1 +/- 180 (with
neither point at a pole) <br>
If azi1 = 0 or +/-180, the geodesic is unique. Otherwise
there are two geodesics and the second one is obtained by
setting [azi1,azi2] = [-azi1,-azi2], S12 = -S12. (This <br>
occurs when lat2 is near -lat1 for prolate ellipsoids.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Points 1 and 2 at opposite poles
<br>
There are infinitely many geodesics which can be generated
by setting [azi1,azi2] = [azi1,azi2] + [d,-d], for arbitrary
d. (For spheres, this prescription applies when <br>
points 1 and 2 are antipodal.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s12 = 0 (coincident points) <br>
There are infinitely many geodesics which can be generated
by setting [azi1,azi2] = [azi1,azi2] + [d,d], for arbitrary
d.</p>
