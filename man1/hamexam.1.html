<p>HAMEXAM(1) General Commands Manual HAMEXAM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME hamexam - Study guide for
USA FCC amateur radio (ham radio) license examinations.
SYNOPSIS <br>
hamexam {t,g,e,q}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hamexam presents questions in random order from the selected
question pool, and terminates when all questions have been
answered correctly. The session may be interrupted with <br>
^C, and resumed later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some questions refer to figures.
The figures for the selected question pool are displayed in
a separate window using $PNG_VIEWER, if it is executable. If
$PNG_VIEWER is unde&acirc; <br>
fined, eog(1), gwenview(1), gpicview(1), ristretto(1), will
be used, whichever is first found to be an executable
command. If $PNG_VIEWER is not an executable command (e.g.
&quot;&quot;), <br>
or if none of the other viewers are installed, then
questions which refer to figures will be noted and
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Licenses are issued by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but examinations
are administered by Volunteer Examiners.</p>
