This manual page documents briefly the <b>igrp</b> command. This manual page was
  written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have
  a manual page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IGRP is a tool for route injection. The routing protocol IGRP is no longer
  really widely used in the outside world, but for the first steps, we decided
  to use this one as a starting point.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The whole purpose is to define a routing table with all possible parameters by
  hand without having your system actually running any kind of dynamic routing
  and sending this information out to the routers. Since IGRP is a broadcast
  based protocol, the default behavior is to send these messages to the ip
  broadcast address (255.255.255.255). If you want to inject a route to a system
  remote from you, you have to address the 'update' accordingly and make sure
  that you send the packet(s) with the right source address, so the router
  accepts the update.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before using the tool, you have to design your routing table you want to inject
  in the target router. It should contain data which makes your route the
  preferred one for the victim. The format is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
destination:delay:bandwidth:mtu:reliability:load:hopcount
<div class="Pp"></div>
where destination is the network (192.168.1.0), delay is in ms/10, bandwidth in
  MBit per second, MTU is the maximum transfer unit (1500 for ethernet),
  reliability and load are in percent (255=100%, 1=0%) and hopcount just in
  hops.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
-i &lt;interface&gt; interface
<div class="Pp"></div>
-v verbose
<div class="Pp"></div>
-f &lt;routes file&gt; file, which contains the routes (as much as you like)
<div class="Pp"></div>
-a &lt;autonomous system&gt; autonomous system the IGRP process is running on,
  use ASS to find it out or specify a range to use with -a START -b STOP to send
  updates to all AS from START to STOP (I highly recommend using ASS for this!!)
<div class="Pp"></div>
-S &lt;spoofed source IP&gt; maybe you need this
<div class="Pp"></div>
-D &lt;destination IP&gt; If you don't specify this, the broadcast address is
  used
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want the routes to be persistent (after some testing around), make up a
  shell loop and run the program within this loop every 25-30 seconds, to keep
  the router beliving your routes.
