<p>xscreensaver(1) XScreenSaver manual xscreensaver(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xscreensaver - extensible screen saver and screen locking
framework</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xscreensaver [-display host:display.screen] [-verbose]
[-no-splash] [-no-capture-stderr] [-log filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xscreensaver program waits until the keyboard and mouse
have been idle for a period, and then runs a graphics demo
chosen at random. It turns off as soon as there is any <br>
mouse or keyboard activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program can lock your
terminal in order to prevent others from using it, though
its default mode of operation is merely to display pretty
pictures on your screen when it is <br>
not in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also provides configuration
and control of your monitor&rsquo;s power-saving
features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
For the impatient, try this: <br>
xscreensaver &amp; <br>
xscreensaver-demo <br>
The xscreensaver-demo(1) program pops up a dialog box that
lets you configure the screen saver, and experiment with the
various display modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that xscreensaver has a
client-server model: the xscreensaver program is a daemon
that runs in the background; it is controlled by the
foreground xscreensaver-demo(1) and <br>
xscreensaver-command(1) programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The easiest way to configure xscreensaver is to simply run
the xscreensaver-demo(1) program, and change the settings
through the GUI. The rest of this manual page describes <br>
lower level ways of changing settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;ll repeat that because
it&rsquo;s important:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The easy way to configure
xscreensaver is to run the xscreensaver-demo(1) program. You
shouldn&rsquo;t need to know any of the stuff described in
this manual unless you are trying <br>
to do something tricky, like customize xscreensaver for
site-wide use or something.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options to xscreensaver are
stored in one of two places: in a .xscreensaver file in your
home directory; or in the X resource database. If the
.xscreensaver file exists, it <br>
overrides any settings in the resource database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of the .xscreensaver
file is similar to that of the .Xdefaults file; for example,
to set the timeout parameter in the .xscreensaver file, you
would write the follow&acirc; <br>
ing: <br>
timeout: 5 <br>
whereas, in the .Xdefaults file, you would write <br>
xscreensaver.timeout: 5 <br>
If you change a setting in the .xscreensaver file while
xscreensaver is already running, it will notice this, and
reload the file. (The file will be reloaded the next time
the <br>
screen saver needs to take some action, such as blanking or
unblanking the screen, or picking a new graphics mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you change a setting in your
X resource database, or if you want xscreensaver to notice
your changes immediately instead of the next time it wakes
up, then you will need to <br>
reload your .Xdefaults file, and then tell the running
xscreensaver process to restart itself, like so: <br>
xrdb &lt; ~/.Xdefaults <br>
xscreensaver-command -restart <br>
If you want to set the system-wide defaults, then make your
edits to the xscreensaver app-defaults file, which should
have been installed when xscreensaver itself was installed.
<br>
The app-defaults file will usually be named
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver, but different
systems might keep it in a different place (for example,
/usr/openwin/lib/app- <br>
defaults/XScreenSaver on Solaris.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When settings are changed in the
Preferences dialog box (see above) the current settings will
be written to the .xscreensaver file. (The .Xdefaults file
and the app-defaults <br>
file will never be written by xscreensaver itself.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
xscreensaver also accepts a few command-line options, mostly
for use when debugging: for normal operation, you should
configure things via the ~/.xscreensaver file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display host:display.screen
<br>
The X display to use. For displays with multiple screens,
XScreenSaver will manage all screens on the display
simultaniously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Same as setting the verbose resource to true: print
diagnostics on stderr and on the xscreensaver window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-capture-stderr <br>
Do not redirect the stdout and stderr streams to the
xscreensaver window itself. If xscreensaver is crashing, you
might need to do this in order to see the error mes&acirc;
<br>
sage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log filename <br>
This is exactly the same as redirecting stdout and stderr to
the given file (for append). This is useful when reporting
bugs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW IT WORKS <br>
When it is time to activate the screensaver, a full-screen
black window is created on each screen of the display. Each
window is created in such a way that, to any subsequently-
<br>
created programs, it will appear to be a &quot;virtual
root&quot; window. Because of this, any program which draws
on the root window (and which understands virtual roots) can
be used as <br>
a screensaver. The various graphics demos are, in fact, just
standalone programs that know how to draw on the provided
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the user becomes active
again, the screensaver windows are unmapped, and the running
subprocesses are killed by sending them SIGTERM. This is
also how the subprocesses are <br>
killed when the screensaver decides that it&rsquo;s time to
run a different demo: the old one is killed and a new one is
launched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can control a running
screensaver process by using the xscreensaver-command(1)
program (which see.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POWER MANAGEMENT <br>
Modern X servers contain support to power down the monitor
after an idle period. If the monitor has powered down, then
xscreensaver will notice this (after a few minutes), and
<br>
will not waste CPU by drawing graphics demos on a black
screen. An attempt will also be made to explicitly power the
monitor back up as soon as user activity is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ~/.xscreensaver file
controls the configuration of your display&rsquo;s power
management settings: if you have used xset(1) to change your
power management settings, then xscreen&acirc; <br>
saver will override those changes with the values specified
in ~/.xscreensaver (or with its built-in defaults, if there
is no ~/.xscreensaver file yet.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change your power management
settings, run xscreensaver-demo(1) and change the various
timeouts through the user interface. Alternately, you can
edit the ~/.xscreensaver file <br>
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the power management section
is grayed out in the xscreensaver-demo(1) window, then that
means that your X server does not support the XDPMS
extension, and so control over <br>
the monitor&rsquo;s power state is not available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using a laptop,
don&rsquo;t be surprised if changing the DPMS settings has
no effect: many laptops have monitor power-saving behavior
built in at a very low level that is <br>
invisible to Unix and X. On such systems, you can typically
adjust the power-saving delays only by changing settings in
the BIOS in some hardware-specific way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If DPMS seems not to be working
with XFree86, make sure the &quot;DPMS&quot; option is set
in your /etc/X11/XF86Config file. See the XF86Config(5)
manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING GNOME OR UNITY <br>
For the better part of a decade, GNOME shipped xscreensaver
as-is, and everything just worked out of the box. In 2005,
however, they decided to re-invent the wheel and ship <br>
their own replacement for the xscreensaver daemon called
&quot;gnome-screensaver&quot;, rather than improving
xscreensaver and contributing their changes back. As a
result, the &quot;gnome- <br>
screensaver&quot; program is insecure, bug-ridden, and
missing many features of xscreensaver. You shouldn&rsquo;t
use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To replace gnome-screensaver
with xscreensaver:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: Fully uninstall the
gnome-screensaver package. <br>
sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver <br>
or possibly <br>
sudo dpkg -P gnome-screensaver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2: Launch xscreensaver at login.
<br>
Select &quot;Startup Applications&quot; from the menu (or
manually launch &quot;gnome-session-properties&quot;) and
add &quot;xscreensaver&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do this as your normal user
account, not as root. (This should go without saying,
because you should never, ever, ever be logged in to the
graphical desktop as user <br>
&quot;root&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3: Make GNOME&rsquo;s &quot;Lock
Screen&quot; use xscreensaver. <br>
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command
/usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command <br>
That doesn&rsquo;t work under Unity, though. Apparently it
has its own built-in screen locker which is not
gnome-screensaver, and cannot be removed, and yet still
manages to be <br>
bug-addled and insecure. Keep reinventing that wheel, guys!
(If you have figured out how to replace Unity&rsquo;s
locking &quot;feature&quot; with xscreensaver, let me
know.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4: Turn off Unity&rsquo;s
built-in blanking. <br>
Open &quot;System Settings / Brightness &amp; Lock&quot;;
<br>
Un-check &quot;Start Automatically&quot;; <br>
Set &quot;Turn screen off when inactive for&quot; to
&quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING KDE <br>
Like GNOME, KDE also decided to invent their own screen
saver framework from scratch instead of simply using
xscreensaver. To replace the KDE screen saver with
xscreensaver, do <br>
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: Turn off KDE&rsquo;s screen
saver. <br>
Open the &quot;Control Center&quot; and select the
&quot;Appearance &amp; Themes / Screensaver&quot; page.
Un-check &quot;Start Automatically&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2: Find your Autostart
directory. <br>
Open the &quot;System Administration / Paths&quot; page, and
see what your &quot;Autostart path&quot; is set to: it will
probably be ~/.kde/Autostart/ or something similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3: Make xscreensaver be an
Autostart program. <br>
Create a .desktop file in your autostart directory called
xscreensaver.desktop that contains the following five
lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Desktop Entry] <br>
Exec=xscreensaver <br>
Name=XScreenSaver <br>
Type=Application <br>
X-KDE-StartupNotify=false</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4: Make the various &quot;lock
session&quot; buttons call xscreensaver. <br>
The file you want to replace next has moved around over the
years. It might be called /usr/libexec/kde4/kscreenlocker,
or it might be called &quot;kdesktop_lock&quot; or
&quot;krun&acirc; <br>
ner_lock&quot; or &quot;kscreenlocker_greet&quot;, and it
might be in /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/ or in /usr/kde/3.5/bin/
or even in /usr/bin/, depending on the distro and phase of
the moon. <br>
Replace the contents of that file with these two lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
xscreensaver-command -lock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the file is executable
(chmod a+x).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now use xscreensaver normally,
controlling it via the usual xscreensaver-demo(1) and
xscreensaver-command(1) mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING SYSTEMD <br>
If the above didn&rsquo;t do it, and your system has
systemd(1), then give this a try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1: Create a service. <br>
Create the file ~/.config/systemd/user/xscreensaver.service
containing: <br>
[Unit] <br>
Description=XScreenSaver <br>
[Service] <br>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/xscreensaver <br>
[Install] <br>
WantedBy=default.target <br>
2. Enable it. <br>
systemctl --user enable xscreensaver <br>
Then restart X11.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING UPSTART <br>
Still not working, but on your distro, that newfangled
systemd(1) nonsense has already fallen out of favor? Then
maybe this will work: launch the Startup Applications
applet, <br>
click &quot;Add&quot;, and enter these lines, then restart
X11: <br>
Name: XScreenSaver <br>
Command: xscreensaver <br>
Comment: xscreensaver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING GDM <br>
You can run xscreensaver from your gdm(1) session, so that
the screensaver will run even when nobody is logged in on
the console. To do this, run gdmconfig(1) and on the
Back&acirc; <br>
ground page, type the command &quot;xscreensaver
-nosplash&quot; into the Background Program field. That will
cause gdm to run xscreensaver while nobody is logged in, and
kill it as soon <br>
as someone does log in. (The user will then be responsible
for starting xscreensaver on their own, if they want.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to accomplish the
same thing is to edit the file /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf to
include: <br>
BackgroundProgram=xscreensaver -nosplash <br>
RunBackgroundProgramAlways=true <br>
In this situation, the xscreensaver process will probably be
running as user gdm instead of root. You can configure the
settings for this nobody-logged-in state (timeouts, DPMS,
<br>
etc.) by editing the ~gdm/.xscreensaver file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get gdm to run the
BackgroundProgram, you may need to switch it from the
&quot;Graphical Greeter&quot; to the &quot;Standard
Greeter&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is safe to run xscreensaver
as root (as xdm or gdm may do.) If run as root, xscreensaver
changes its effective user and group ids to something safe
(like &quot;nobody&quot;) before <br>
connecting to the X server or launching user-specified
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An unfortunate side effect of
this (important) security precaution is that it may conflict
with cookie-based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you get &quot;connection
refused&quot; errors when running xscreensaver from gdm,
then this probably means that you have xauth(1) or some
other security mechanism turned on. For infor&acirc; <br>
mation on the X server&rsquo;s access control mechanisms,
see the man pages for X(1), Xsecurity(1), xauth(1), and
xhost(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Bugs? There are no bugs. Ok, well, maybe. If you find one,
please let me know.
https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html explains how to
construct the most useful bug <br>
reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locking and root logins <br>
In order for it to be safe for xscreensaver to be launched
by xdm, certain precautions had to be taken, among them that
xscreensaver never runs as root. In particular, if it <br>
is launched as root (as xdm is likely to do), xscreensaver
will disavow its privileges, and switch itself to a safe
user id (such as nobody.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An implication of this is that
if you log in as root on the console, xscreensaver will
refuse to lock the screen (because it can&rsquo;t tell the
difference between root being <br>
logged in on the console, and a normal user being logged in
on the console but xscreensaver having been launched by the
xdm(1) Xsetup file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The solution to this is simple:
you shouldn&rsquo;t be logging in on the console as root in
the first place! (What, are you crazy or something?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proper Unix hygiene dictates
that you should log in as yourself, and su(1) to root as
necessary. People who spend their day logged in as root are
just begging for disaster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAUTH and XDM <br>
For xscreensaver to work when launched by xdm(1) or gdm(1),
programs running on the local machine as user
&quot;nobody&quot; must be able to connect to the X server.
This means that <br>
if you want to run xscreensaver on the console while nobody
is logged in, you may need to disable cookie-based access
control (and allow all users who can log in to the local
<br>
machine to connect to the display.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should be sure that this is
an acceptable thing to do in your environment before doing
it. See the &quot;Using GDM&quot; section, above, for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Passwords <br>
If you get an error message at startup like
&quot;couldn&rsquo;t get password of user&quot; then this
probably means that you&rsquo;re on a system in which the
getpwent(3) library routine can only <br>
be effectively used by root. If this is the case, then
xscreensaver must be installed as setuid to root in order
for locking to work. Care has been taken to make this a <br>
safe thing to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also may mean that your
system uses shadow passwords instead of the standard
getpwent(3) interface; in that case, you may need to change
some options with configure and <br>
recompile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you change your password
after xscreensaver has been launched, it will continue using
your old password to unlock the screen until xscreensaver is
restarted. On some sys&acirc; <br>
tems, it may accept both your old and new passwords. So,
after you change your password, you&rsquo;ll have to do <br>
xscreensaver-command -restart <br>
to make xscreensaver notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAM Passwords <br>
If your system uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules),
then in order for xscreensaver to use PAM properly, PAM must
be told about xscreensaver. The xscreensaver instal&acirc;
<br>
lation process should update the PAM data (on Linux, by
creating the file /etc/pam.d/xscreensaver for you, and on
Solaris, by telling you what lines to add to the <br>
/etc/pam.conf file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the PAM configuration files
do not know about xscreensaver, then you might be in a
situation where xscreensaver will refuse to ever unlock the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a design flaw in PAM
(there is no way for a client to tell the difference between
PAM responding &quot;I have never heard of your
module&quot;, and responding, &quot;you typed the <br>
wrong password&quot;.) As far as I can tell, there is no way
for xscreensaver to automatically work around this, or
detect the problem in advance, so if you have PAM, make sure
<br>
it is configured correctly!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Machine Load <br>
Although this program &quot;nices&quot; the subprocesses
that it starts, graphics-intensive subprograms can still
overload the machine by causing the X server process itself
(which is <br>
not &quot;niced&quot;) to consume many cycles. Care has been
taken in all the modules shipped with xscreensaver to sleep
periodically, and not run full tilt, so as not to cause
appre&acirc; <br>
ciable load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you are running the
OpenGL-based screen savers on a machine that does not have a
video card with 3D acceleration, they will make your machine
slow, despite <br>
nice(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Your options are: don&rsquo;t
use the OpenGL display modes; or, collect the spare change
hidden under the cushions of your couch, and use it to buy a
video card manufactured after <br>
1998. (It doesn&rsquo;t even need to be fast 3D hardware:
the problem will be fixed if there is any 3D hardware at
all.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XFree86&rsquo;s Magic Keystrokes
<br>
The XFree86 X server traps certain magic keystrokes before
client programs ever see them. Two that are of note are
Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, which causes the X server to exit; and
<br>
Ctrl+Alt+Fn, which switches virtual consoles. The X server
will respond to these keystrokes even if xscreensaver has
the screen locked. Depending on your setup, you might <br>
consider this a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, there is no way
for xscreensaver itself to override the interpretation of
these keys. If you want to disable Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
globally, you need to set the <br>
DontZap flag in your /etc/X11/XF86Config file. To globally
disable VT switching, you can set the DontVTSwitch flag. See
the XF86Config(5) manual for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X RESOURCES <br>
These are the X resources use by the xscreensaver program.
You probably won&rsquo;t need to change these manually
(that&rsquo;s what the xscreensaver-demo(1) program is
for).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeout (class Time) <br>
The screensaver will activate (blank the screen) after the
keyboard and mouse have been idle for this many minutes.
Default 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cycle (class Time) <br>
After the screensaver has been running for this many
minutes, the currently running graphics-hack sub-process
will be killed (with SIGTERM), and a new one started. If
<br>
this is 0, then the graphics hack will never be changed:
only one demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated
by user activity. Default 10 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The running saver will be
restarted every cycle minutes even when mode is one, since
some savers tend to converge on a steady state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock (class Boolean) <br>
Enable locking: before the screensaver will turn off, it
will require you to type the password of the logged-in user
(really, the person who ran xscreensaver), or the <br>
root password. (Note: this doesn&rsquo;t work if the
screensaver is launched by xdm(1) because it can&rsquo;t
know the user-id of the logged-in user. See the &quot;Using
XDM(1)&quot; sec&acirc; <br>
tion, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lockTimeout (class Time) <br>
If locking is enabled, this controls the length of the
&quot;grace period&quot; between when the screensaver
activates, and when the screen becomes locked. For example,
if this is <br>
5, and -timeout is 10, then after 10 minutes, the screen
would blank. If there was user activity at 12 minutes, no
password would be required to un-blank the screen. <br>
But, if there was user activity at 15 minutes or later (that
is, -lock-timeout minutes after activation) then a password
would be required. The default is 0, meaning <br>
that if locking is enabled, then a password will be required
as soon as the screen blanks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">passwdTimeout (class Time) <br>
If the screen is locked, then this is how many seconds the
password dialog box should be left on the screen before
giving up (default 30 seconds.) This should not be too <br>
large: the X server is grabbed for the duration that the
password dialog box is up (for security purposes) and
leaving the server grabbed for too long can cause
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpmsEnabled (class Boolean) <br>
Whether power management is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpmsStandby (class Time) <br>
If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor
goes solid black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpmsSuspend (class Time) <br>
If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor
goes into power-saving mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpmsOff (class Time) <br>
If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor
powers down completely. Note that these settings will have
no effect unless both the X server and the display <br>
hardware support power management; not all do. See the Power
Management section, below, for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpmsQuickOff (class Boolean)
<br>
If mode is blank and this is true, then the screen will be
powered down immediately upon blanking, regardless of other
power-management settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">visualID (class VisualID) <br>
Specify which X visual to use by default. (Note carefully
that this resource is called visualID, not merely visual; if
you set the visual resource instead, things will <br>
malfunction in obscure ways for obscure reasons.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Legal values for the VisualID
resource are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default Use the screen&rsquo;s
default visual (the visual of the root window.) This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">best Use the visual which
supports the most colors. Note, however, that the visual
with the most colors might be a TrueColor visual, which does
not support colormap <br>
animation. Some programs have more interesting behavior when
run on PseudoColor visuals than on TrueColor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mono Use a monochrome visual, if
there is one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gray Use a grayscale or
staticgray visual, if there is one and it has more than one
plane (that is, it&rsquo;s not monochrome.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">color Use the best of the color
visuals, if there are any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GL Use the visual that is best
for OpenGL programs. (OpenGL programs have somewhat
different requirements than other X programs.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class where class is one of
StaticGray, StaticColor, TrueColor, GrayScale, PseudoColor,
or DirectColor. Selects the deepest visual of the given
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number where number (decimal or
hex) is interpreted as a visual id number, as reported by
the xdpyinfo(1) program; in this way you can have finer
control over exactly <br>
which visual gets used, for example, to select a shallower
one than would otherwise have been chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this option specifies
only the default visual that will be used: the visual used
may be overridden on a program-by-program basis. See the
description of the <br>
programs resource, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">installColormap (class Boolean)
<br>
On PseudoColor (8-bit) displays, install a private colormap
while the screensaver is active, so that the graphics hacks
can get as many colors as possible. This is the <br>
default. (This only applies when the screen&rsquo;s default
visual is being used, since non-default visuals get their
own colormaps automatically.) This can also be
overrid&acirc; <br>
den on a per-hack basis: see the discussion of the default-n
name in the section about the programs resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does nothing if you have a
TrueColor (16-bit or deeper) display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose (class Boolean) <br>
Whether to print diagnostics. Default false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timestamp (class Boolean) <br>
Whether to print the time of day along with any other
diagnostic messages. Default true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splash (class Boolean) <br>
Whether to display a splash screen at startup. Default
true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">splashDuration (class Time) <br>
How long the splash screen should remain visible; default 5
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">helpURL (class URL) <br>
The splash screen has a Help button on it. When you press
it, it will display the web page indicated here in your web
browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadURL (class LoadURL) <br>
This is the shell command used to load a URL into your web
browser. The default setting will load it into
Mozilla/Netscape if it is already running, otherwise, will
<br>
launch a new browser looking at the helpURL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">demoCommand (class DemoCommand)
<br>
This is the shell command run when the Demo button on the
splash window is pressed. It defaults to
xscreensaver-demo(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prefsCommand (class
PrefsCommand) <br>
This is the shell command run when the Prefs button on the
splash window is pressed. It defaults to xscreensaver-demo
-prefs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newLoginCommand (class
NewLoginCommand) <br>
If set, this is the shell command that is run when the
&quot;New Login&quot; button is pressed on the unlock dialog
box, in order to create a new desktop session without
logging <br>
out the user who has locked the screen. Typically this will
be some variant of gdmflexiserver(1) or kdmctl(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice (class Nice) <br>
The sub-processes created by xscreensaver will be
&quot;niced&quot; to this level, so that they are given
lower priority than other processes on the system, and
don&rsquo;t increase the <br>
load unnecessarily. The default is 10. (Higher numbers mean
lower priority; see nice(1) for details.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fade (class Boolean) <br>
If this is true, then when the screensaver activates, the
current contents of the screen will fade to black instead of
simply winking out. This only works on certain <br>
systems. A fade will also be done when switching graphics
hacks (when the cycle timer expires.) Default: true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unfade (class Boolean) <br>
If this is true, then when the screensaver deactivates, the
original contents of the screen will fade in from black
instead of appearing immediately. This only works on <br>
certain systems, and if fade is true as well. Default
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fadeSeconds (class Time) <br>
If fade is true, this is how long the fade will be in
seconds (default 3 seconds.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fadeTicks (class Integer) <br>
If fade is true, this is how many times a second the
colormap will be changed to effect a fade. Higher numbers
yield smoother fades, but may make the fades take longer
<br>
than the specified fadeSeconds if your server isn&rsquo;t
fast enough to keep up. Default 20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">captureStderr (class Boolean)
<br>
Whether xscreensaver should redirect its stdout and stderr
streams to the window itself. Since its nature is to take
over the screen, you would not normally see error <br>
messages generated by xscreensaver or the sub-programs it
runs; this resource will cause the output of all relevant
programs to be drawn on the screensaver window itself, <br>
as well as being written to the controlling terminal of the
screensaver driver process. Default true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignoreUninstalledPrograms (class
Boolean) <br>
There may be programs in the list that are not installed on
the system, yet are marked as &quot;enabled.&quot; If this
preference is true, then such programs will simply be <br>
ignored. If false, then a warning will be printed if an
attempt is made to run the nonexistent program. Also, the
xscreensaver-demo(1) program will suppress the non- <br>
existent programs from the list if this is true. Default:
false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authWarningSlack (class Integer)
<br>
If all failed unlock attempts (incorrect password entered)
were made within this period of time, the usual dialog that
warns about such attempts after a successful login <br>
will be suppressed. The assumption is that incorrect
passwords entered within a few seconds of a correct one are
user error, rather than hostile action. Default 20
sec&acirc; <br>
onds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GetViewPortIsFullOfLies (class
Boolean) <br>
Set this to true if the xscreensaver window doesn&rsquo;t
cover the whole screen. This works around a longstanding
XFree86 bug #421. See the xscreensaver FAQ for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">font (class Font) <br>
The font used for the stdout/stderr text, if captureStderr
is true. Default *-medium-r-*-140-*-m-* (a 14 point
fixed-width font.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode (class Mode) <br>
Controls the behavior of xscreensaver. Legal values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">random When blanking the screen,
select a random display mode from among those that are
enabled and applicable. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">random-same <br>
Like random, but if there are multiple screens, each screen
will run the same random display mode, instead of each
screen running a different one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">one When blanking the screen,
only ever use one particular display mode (the one indicated
by the selected setting.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blank When blanking the screen,
just go black: don&rsquo;t run any graphics hacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">off Don&rsquo;t ever blank the
screen, and don&rsquo;t ever allow the monitor to power
down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selected (class Integer) <br>
When mode is set to one, this is the one, indicated by its
index in the programs list. You&rsquo;re crazy if you count
them and set this number by hand: let xscreen&acirc; <br>
saver-demo(1) do it for you!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">programs (class Programs) <br>
The graphics hacks which xscreensaver runs when the user is
idle. The value of this resource is a multi-line string, one
sh-syntax command per line. Each line must con&acirc; <br>
tain exactly one command: no semicolons, no ampersands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the screensaver starts up,
one of these is selected (according to the mode setting),
and run. After the cycle period expires, it is killed, and
another is selected <br>
and run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a line begins with a dash (-)
then that particular program is disabled: it won&rsquo;t be
selected at random (though you can still select it
explicitly using the xscreen&acirc; <br>
saver-demo(1) program.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all programs are disabled,
then the screen will just be made blank, as when mode is set
to blank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable a program, you must
mark it as disabled with a dash instead of removing it from
the list. This is because the system-wide (app-defaults) and
per-user <br>
(.xscreensaver) settings are merged together, and if a user
just deletes an entry from their programs list, but that
entry still exists in the system-wide list, then it <br>
will come back. However, if the user disables it, then their
setting takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the display has multiple
screens, then a different program will be run for each
screen. (All screens are blanked and unblanked
simultaneously.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you must escape the
newlines; here is an example of how you might set this in
your ~/.xscreensaver file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">programs: qix -root ico -r
-faces -sleep 1 -obj ico xdaliclock -builtin2 -root xv -root
-rmode 5 image.gif -quit <br>
Make sure your $PATH environment variable is set up
correctly before xscreensaver is launched, or it won&rsquo;t
be able to find the programs listed in the programs
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use a program as a
screensaver, two things are required: that that program draw
on the root window (or be able to be configured to draw on
the root window); and that <br>
that program understand &quot;virtual root&quot; windows, as
used by virtual window managers such as tvtwm(1).
(Generally, this is accomplished by just including the
&quot;vroot.h&quot; <br>
header file in the program&rsquo;s source.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Visuals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because xscreensaver was created
back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, it still contains
support for some things you&rsquo;ve probably never seen,
such as 1-bit monochrome mon&acirc; <br>
itors, grayscale monitors, and monitors capable of
displaying only 8-bit colormapped images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are some programs that
you want to run only when using a color display, and others
that you want to run only when using a monochrome display,
you can specify <br>
that like this: <br>
mono: mono-program -root color: color-program -root More
generally, you can specify the kind of visual that should be
used for the window on which the program will be drawing.
For example, if one program works best if it <br>
has a colormap, but another works best if it has a 24-bit
visual, both can be accommodated: <br>
PseudoColor: cmap-program -root TrueColor: 24bit-program
-root In addition to the symbolic visual names described
above (in the discussion of the visualID resource) one other
visual name is supported in the programs list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-n <br>
This is like default, but also requests the use of the
default colormap, instead of a private colormap. (That is,
it behaves as if the -no-install command-line <br>
option was specified, but only for this particular hack.)
This is provided because some third-party programs that draw
on the root window (notably: xv(1), and <br>
xearth(1)) make assumptions about the visual and colormap of
the root window: assumptions which xscreensaver can
violate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify a particular
visual for a program, and that visual does not exist on the
screen, then that program will not be chosen to run. This
means that on displays <br>
with multiple screens of different depths, you can arrange
for appropriate hacks to be run on each. For example, if one
screen is color and the other is monochrome, <br>
hacks that look good in mono can be run on one, and hacks
that only look good in color will show up on the other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You shouldn&rsquo;t ever need to
change the following resources:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointerPollTime (class Time)
<br>
When server extensions are not in use, this controls how
frequently xscreensaver checks to see if the mouse position
or buttons have changed. Default 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointerHysteresis (class
Integer) <br>
If the mouse moves less than this-many pixels in a second,
ignore it (do not consider that to be &quot;activity.&quot;)
This is so that the screen doesn&rsquo;t un-blank (or fail
to <br>
blank) just because you bumped the desk. Default: 10
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">windowCreationTimeout (class
Time) <br>
When server extensions are not in use, this controls the
delay between when windows are created and when xscreensaver
selects events on them. Default 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">initialDelay (class Time) <br>
When server extensions are not in use, xscreensaver will
wait this many seconds before selecting events on existing
windows, under the assumption that xscreensaver is <br>
started during your login procedure, and the window state
may be in flux. Default 0. (This used to default to 30, but
that was back in the days when slow machines and X <br>
terminals were more common...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">procInterrupts (class Boolean)
<br>
This resource controls whether the /proc/interrupts file
should be consulted to decide whether the user is idle. This
is the default if xscreensaver has been compiled on <br>
a system which supports this mechanism (i.e., Linux
systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The benefit to doing this is
that xscreensaver can note that the user is active even when
the X console is not the active one: if the user is typing
in another virtual <br>
console, xscreensaver will notice that and will fail to
activate. For example, if you&rsquo;re playing Quake in
VGA-mode, xscreensaver won&rsquo;t wake up in the middle of
your game <br>
and start competing for CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The drawback to doing this is
that perhaps you really do want idleness on the X console to
cause the X display to lock, even if there is activity on
other virtual con&acirc; <br>
soles. If you want that, then set this option to False. (Or
just lock the X console manually.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value for this
resource is True, on systems where it works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overlayStderr (class Boolean)
<br>
If captureStderr is True, and your server supports
&quot;overlay&quot; visuals, then the text will be written
into one of the higher layers instead of into the same layer
as the <br>
running screenhack. Set this to False to disable that
(though you shouldn&rsquo;t need to.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overlayTextForeground (class
Foreground) <br>
The foreground color used for the stdout/stderr text, if
captureStderr is true. Default: Yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">overlayTextBackground (class
Background) <br>
The background color used for the stdout/stderr text, if
captureStderr is true. Default: Black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bourneShell (class BourneShell)
<br>
The pathname of the shell that xscreensaver uses to start
subprocesses. This must be whatever your local variant of
/bin/sh is: in particular, it must not be csh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY to get the default host and display number, and to
inform the sub-programs of the screen on which to draw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW <br>
Passed to sub-programs to indicate the ID of the window on
which they should draw. This is necessary on Xinerama/RANDR
systems where multiple physical monitors share a <br>
single X11 &quot;Screen&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH to find the sub-programs to
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME for the directory in which
to read the .xscreensaver file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XENVIRONMENT <br>
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global
resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>
