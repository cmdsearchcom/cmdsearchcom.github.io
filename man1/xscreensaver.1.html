xscreensaver - extensible screen saver and screen locking framework
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>xscreensaver</b> [-display <i>host:display.screen</i>] [-verbose]
  [-no-splash] [-no-capture-stderr] [-log <i>filename</i>]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>xscreensaver</i> program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been
  idle for a period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random. It turns
  off as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This program can lock your terminal in order to prevent others from using it,
  though its default mode of operation is merely to display pretty pictures on
  your screen when it is not in use.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It also provides configuration and control of your monitor's power-saving
  features.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="selflink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
For the impatient, try this:
<pre>
xscreensaver &amp;
xscreensaver-demo
</pre>
The <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) program pops up a dialog box that lets you
  configure the screen saver, and experiment with the various display modes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Note that xscreensaver has a client-server model:</b> the <i>xscreensaver</i>
  program is a daemon that runs in the background; it is controlled by the
  foreground <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) and <b>xscreensaver-command</b>(1)
  programs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The easiest way to configure <i>xscreensaver</i> is to simply run the
  <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) program, and change the settings through the GUI.
  The rest of this manual page describes lower level ways of changing settings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
I'll repeat that because it's important:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">The easy way to configure xscreensaver is to
  run the <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) program. You shouldn't need to know any of
  the stuff described in <i>this</i> manual unless you are trying to do
  something tricky, like customize xscreensaver for site-wide use or
  something.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Options to <i>xscreensaver</i> are stored in one of two places: in a
  <i>.xscreensaver</i> file in your home directory; or in the X resource
  database. If the <i>.xscreensaver</i> file exists, it overrides any settings
  in the resource database.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The syntax of the <i>.xscreensaver</i> file is similar to that of the
  <i>.Xdefaults</i> file; for example, to set the <i>timeout</i> parameter in
  the <i>.xscreensaver</i> file, you would write the following:
<pre>
timeout: 5
</pre>
whereas, in the <i>.Xdefaults</i> file, you would write
<pre>
xscreensaver.timeout: 5
</pre>
If you change a setting in the <i>.xscreensaver</i> file while xscreensaver is
  already running, it will notice this, and reload the file. (The file will be
  reloaded the next time the screen saver needs to take some action, such as
  blanking or unblanking the screen, or picking a new graphics mode.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you change a setting in your X resource database, or if you want xscreensaver
  to notice your changes immediately instead of the next time it wakes up, then
  you will need to reload your <i>.Xdefaults</i> file, and then tell the running
  xscreensaver process to restart itself, like so:
<pre>
xrdb &lt; ~/.Xdefaults
xscreensaver-command -restart
</pre>
If you want to set the system-wide defaults, then make your edits to the
  xscreensaver app-defaults file, which should have been installed when
  xscreensaver itself was installed. The app-defaults file will usually be named
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver, but different systems might keep it in
  a different place (for example, /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/XScreenSaver on
  Solaris.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When settings are changed in the Preferences dialog box (see above) the current
  settings will be written to the <i>.xscreensaver</i> file. (The
  <i>.Xdefaults</i> file and the app-defaults file will never be written by
  xscreensaver itself.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND-LINE_OPTIONS">COMMAND-LINE
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>xscreensaver</i> also accepts a few command-line options, mostly for use when
  debugging: for normal operation, you should configure things via the
  <i>~/.xscreensaver</i> file.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-display <i>host:display.screen</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The X display to use. For displays with multiple screens,
      XScreenSaver will manage all screens on the display simultaniously.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Same as setting the <i>verbose</i> resource to <i>true</i>:

  <dd class="It-tag">Do not redirect the stdout and stderr streams to the

      do this in order to see the error message.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-log <i>filename</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is exactly the same as redirecting stdout and stderr
      to the given file (for append). This is useful when reporting bugs.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="HOW_IT_WORKS"><a class="selflink" href="#HOW_IT_WORKS">HOW
  IT WORKS</a></h1>
When it is time to activate the screensaver, a full-screen black window is
  created on each screen of the display. Each window is created in such a way
  that, to any subsequently-created programs, it will appear to be a
  &quot;virtual root&quot; window. Because of this, any program which draws on
  the root window (and which understands virtual roots) can be used as a
  screensaver. The various graphics demos are, in fact, just standalone programs
  that know how to draw on the provided window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When the user becomes active again, the screensaver windows are unmapped, and
  the running subprocesses are killed by sending them <b>SIGTERM</b>. This is
  also how the subprocesses are killed when the screensaver decides that it's
  time to run a different demo: the old one is killed and a new one is launched.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can control a running screensaver process by using the
  <b>xscreensaver-command</b>(1) program (which see.)
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="POWER_MANAGEMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#POWER_MANAGEMENT">POWER
  MANAGEMENT</a></h1>
Modern X servers contain support to power down the monitor after an idle period.
  If the monitor has powered down, then <i>xscreensaver</i> will notice this
  (after a few minutes), and will not waste CPU by drawing graphics demos on a
  black screen. An attempt will also be made to explicitly power the monitor
  back up as soon as user activity is detected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>~/.xscreensaver</i> file controls the configuration of your display's
  power management settings: if you have used <b>xset</b>(1) to change your
  power management settings, then xscreensaver will override those changes with
  the values specified in <i>~/.xscreensaver</i> (or with its built-in defaults,
  if there is no <i>~/.xscreensaver</i> file yet.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To change your power management settings, run <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1) and
  change the various timeouts through the user interface. Alternately, you can
  edit the <i>~/.xscreensaver</i> file directly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the power management section is grayed out in the <b>xscreensaver-demo</b>(1)
  window, then that means that your X server does not support the XDPMS
  extension, and so control over the monitor's power state is not available.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you're using a laptop, don't be surprised if changing the DPMS settings has
  no effect: many laptops have monitor power-saving behavior built in at a very
  low level that is invisible to Unix and X. On such systems, you can typically
  adjust the power-saving delays only by changing settings in the BIOS in some
  hardware-specific way.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If DPMS seems not to be working with XFree86, make sure the &quot;DPMS&quot;
  option is set in your <i>/etc/X11/XF86Config</i> file. See the
  <b>XF86Config</b>(5) manual for details.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_GNOME_OR_UNITY"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_GNOME_OR_UNITY">USING
  GNOME OR UNITY</a></h1>
For the better part of a decade, GNOME shipped xscreensaver as-is, and
  everything just worked out of the box. In 2005, however, they decided to
  re-invent the wheel and ship their own replacement for the <i>xscreensaver</i>
  daemon called &quot; <i>gnome-screensaver</i>&quot;, rather than improving
  xscreensaver and contributing their changes back. As a result, the &quot;
  <i>gnome-screensaver</i>&quot; program is insecure, bug-ridden, and missing
  many features of xscreensaver. You shouldn't use it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver:
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1: Fully uninstall the gnome-screensaver
    package.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver
    </pre>
    or possibly
    <pre>
sudo dpkg -P gnome-screensaver
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2: Launch xscreensaver at login.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select &quot;<i>Startup Applications</i>&quot; from the
      menu (or manually launch &quot; <i>gnome-session-properties</i>&quot;) and
      add &quot; <i>xscreensaver</i>&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Do this as your normal user account, not as root. (This should go without
      saying, because you should never, ever, ever be logged in to the graphical
      desktop as user &quot;root&quot;.)</dd>

sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \
            /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command
    </pre>
    That doesn't work under Unity, though. Apparently it has its own built-in
      screen locker which is not gnome-screensaver, and cannot be removed, and
      yet still manages to be bug-addled and insecure. Keep reinventing that
      wheel, guys! (If you have figured out how to replace Unity's locking
      &quot;feature&quot; with xscreensaver, let me know.)</dd>

If the above didn't do it, and your system has <b>systemd</b>(1), then give this
  a try:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1: Create a service.</b></dt>

    </pre>
     <b>2. Enable it.</b>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_UPSTART"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_UPSTART">USING

Still not working, but on your distro, that newfangled <b>systemd</b>(1)
  nonsense has already fallen out of favor? Then maybe this will work: launch
  the <i>Startup Applications</i> applet, click <i>&quot;Add&quot;</i>, and
  enter these lines, then restart X11:
<pre>
Name: XScreenSaver
Command: xscreensaver
Comment: xscreensaver
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_GDM"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_GDM">USING
  GDM</a></h1>
You can run <i>xscreensaver</i> from your <b>gdm</b>(1) session, so that the
  screensaver will run even when nobody is logged in on the console. To do this,
  run <b>gdmconfig</b>(1) and on the <i>Background</i> page, type the command
  <b>&quot;xscreensaver -nosplash&quot;</b> into the <i>Background Program</i>
  field. That will cause gdm to run xscreensaver while nobody is logged in, and
  kill it as soon as someone does log in. (The user will then be responsible for
  starting xscreensaver on their own, if they want.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Another way to accomplish the same thing is to edit the file
  <i>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</i> to include:
<pre>
BackgroundProgram=xscreensaver -nosplash
RunBackgroundProgramAlways=true
</pre>
In this situation, the <i>xscreensaver</i> process will probably be running as
  user <i>gdm</i> instead of <i>root</i>. You can configure the settings for
  this nobody-logged-in state (timeouts, DPMS, etc.) by editing the
  <i>~gdm/.xscreensaver</i> file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To get gdm to run the BackgroundProgram, you may need to switch it from the
  &quot;Graphical Greeter&quot; to the &quot;Standard Greeter&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is safe to run <i>xscreensaver</i> as root (as <i>xdm</i> or <i>gdm</i> may
  do.) If run as root, <i>xscreensaver</i> changes its effective user and group
  ids to something safe (like <i>&quot;nobody&quot;</i>) before connecting to
  the X server or launching user-specified programs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
An unfortunate side effect of this (important) security precaution is that it
  may conflict with cookie-based authentication.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you get &quot;connection refused&quot; errors when running
  <i>xscreensaver</i> from <i>gdm</i>, then this probably means that you have
  <b>xauth</b>(1) or some other security mechanism turned on. For information on
  the X server's access control mechanisms, see the man pages for <b>X</b>(1),
  <b>Xsecurity</b>(1), <b>xauth</b>(1), and <b>xhost</b>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Bugs? There are no bugs. Ok, well, maybe. If you find one, please let me know.
  https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html explains how to construct the most
  useful bug reports.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Locking and root logins</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In order for it to be safe for xscreensaver to be launched
      by <i>xdm</i>, certain precautions had to be taken, among them that
      xscreensaver never runs as <i>root</i>. In particular, if it is launched
      as root (as <i>xdm</i> is likely to do), xscreensaver will disavow its
      privileges, and switch itself to a safe user id (such as <i>nobody</i>.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    An implication of this is that if you log in as <i>root</i> on the console,
      xscreensaver will refuse to lock the screen (because it can't tell the
      difference between <i>root</i> being logged in on the console, and a
      normal user being logged in on the console but xscreensaver having been
      launched by the <b>xdm</b>(1) <i>Xsetup</i> file.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The solution to this is simple: you shouldn't be logging in on the console
      as <i>root</i> in the first place! (What, are you crazy or something?)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Proper Unix hygiene dictates that you should log in as yourself, and
      <b>su</b>(1) to <i>root</i> as necessary. People who spend their day
      logged in as <i>root</i> are just begging for disaster.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>XAUTH and XDM</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For xscreensaver to work when launched by <b>xdm</b>(1) or
      <b>gdm</b>(1), programs running on the local machine as user
      <i>&quot;nobody&quot;</i> must be able to connect to the X server. This
      means that if you want to run xscreensaver on the console while nobody is
      logged in, you may need to disable cookie-based access control (and allow
      all users who can log in to the local machine to connect to the display.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      a system in which the <b>getpwent</b>(3) library routine can only be
      effectively used by root. If this is the case, then <i>xscreensaver</i>
      must be installed as setuid to root in order for locking to work. Care has
      been taken to make this a safe thing to do.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It also may mean that your system uses shadow passwords instead of the
      standard <b>getpwent</b>(3) interface; in that case, you may need to
      change some options with <i>configure</i> and recompile.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you change your password after xscreensaver has been launched, it will
      continue using your old password to unlock the screen until xscreensaver

      you, and on Solaris, by telling you what lines to add to the
      <i>/etc/pam.conf</i> file.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      As far as I can tell, there is no way for xscreensaver to automatically

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>XFree86's Magic Keystrokes</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The XFree86 X server traps certain magic keystrokes before
      client programs ever see them. Two that are of note are
      Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, which causes the X server to exit; and Ctrl+Alt+F
      <i>n</i>, which switches virtual consoles. The X server will respond to
      these keystrokes even if xscreensaver has the screen locked. Depending on
      your setup, you might consider this a problem.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unfortunately, there is no way for xscreensaver itself to override the
      interpretation of these keys. If you want to disable Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
      globally, you need to set the <i>DontZap</i> flag in your
      <i>/etc/X11/XF86Config</i> file. To globally disable VT switching, you can
      set the <i>DontVTSwitch</i> flag. See the <b>XF86Config</b>(5) manual for
      details.</dd>

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When the screensaver starts up, one of these is selected (according to the

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To disable a program, you must mark it as disabled with a dash instead of

      just <i>deletes</i> an entry from their programs list, but that entry

</pre>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">Make sure your <b>$PATH</b> environment
  variable is set up correctly <i>before</i> xscreensaver is launched, or it
  won't be able to find the programs listed in the <i>programs</i> resource.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To use a program as a screensaver, two things are required: that that program
  draw on the root window (or be able to be configured to draw on the root
  window); and that that program understand &quot;virtual root&quot; windows, as
  used by virtual window managers such as <b>tvtwm</b>(1). (Generally, this is
  accomplished by just including the <i>&quot;vroot.h&quot;</i> header file in
  the program's source.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Visuals:</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Because xscreensaver was created back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, it still
  contains support for some things you've probably never seen, such as 1-bit
  monochrome monitors, grayscale monitors, and monitors capable of displaying
  only 8-bit colormapped images.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If there are some programs that you want to run only when using a color display,
  and others that you want to run only when using a monochrome display, you can
  specify that like this:
<pre>
       mono:   mono-program  -root        \n\
       color:  color-program -root        \n\
</pre>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">More generally, you can specify the kind of
  visual that should be used for the window on which the program will be
  drawing. For example, if one program works best if it has a colormap, but
  another works best if it has a 24-bit visual, both can be accommodated:
<pre>
       PseudoColor: cmap-program  -root   \n\
       TrueColor:   24bit-program -root   \n\
</pre>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 8.00ex;">In addition to the symbolic visual names
  described above (in the discussion of the <i>visualID</i> resource) one other
  visual name is supported in the <i>programs</i> list:
<div style="margin-left: 1.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>default-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is like <b>default</b>, but also requests the use of
      the default colormap, instead of a private colormap. (That is, it behaves
      as if the <i>-no-install</i> command-line option was specified, but only
      for this particular hack.) This is provided because some third-party
      programs that draw on the root window (notably: <b>xv</b>(1), and
      <b>xearth</b>(1)) make assumptions about the visual and colormap of the
      root window: assumptions which xscreensaver can violate.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
If you specify a particular visual for a program, and that visual does not exist
  on the screen, then that program will not be chosen to run. This means that on
  displays with multiple screens of different depths, you can arrange for
  appropriate hacks to be run on each. For example, if one screen is color and
  the other is monochrome, hacks that look good in mono can be run on one, and
  hacks that only look good in color will show up on the other.</div>

You shouldn't ever need to change the following resources:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pointerPollTime<i> (class
    </i><b>Time</b><i>)</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When server extensions are not in use, this controls how
      frequently <i>xscreensaver</i> checks to see if the mouse position or
      buttons have changed. Default 5 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>pointerHysteresis<i> (class
    </i><b>Integer</b><i>)</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the mouse moves less than this-many pixels in a second,
      ignore it (do not consider that to be &quot;activity.&quot;) This is so
      that the screen doesn't un-blank (or fail to blank) just because you
      bumped the desk. Default: 10 pixels.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>windowCreationTimeout<i> (class
    </i><b>Time</b><i>)</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When server extensions are not in use, this controls the
      delay between when windows are created and when <i>xscreensaver</i>
      selects events on them. Default 30 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>initialDelay<i> (class </i><b>Time</b><i>)</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When server extensions are not in use, <i>xscreensaver</i>
      will wait this many seconds before selecting events on existing windows,
      under the assumption that <i>xscreensaver</i> is started during your login
      procedure, and the window state may be in flux. Default 0. (This used to
      default to 30, but that was back in the days when slow machines and X
      terminals were more common...)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>procInterrupts<i> (class
    </i><b>Boolean</b><i>)</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This resource controls whether the <b>/proc/interrupts</b>
      file should be consulted to decide whether the user is idle. This is the
      default if <i>xscreensaver</i> has been compiled on a system which
      supports this mechanism (i.e., Linux systems.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The benefit to doing this is that <i>xscreensaver</i> can note that the user
      is active even when the X console is not the active one: if the user is
      typing in another virtual console, xscreensaver will notice that and will
      fail to activate. For example, if you're playing Quake in VGA-mode,
      xscreensaver won't wake up in the middle of your game and start competing
      for CPU.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The drawback to doing this is that perhaps you <i>really do</i> want
      idleness on the X console to cause the X display to lock, even if there is
      activity on other virtual consoles. If you want that, then set this option
      to False. (Or just lock the X console manually.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default value for this resource is True, on systems where it works.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>overlayStderr<i> (class
    </i><b>Boolean</b><i>)</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If <b>captureStderr</b> is True, and your server supports
      &quot;overlay&quot; visuals, then the text will be written into one of the
      higher layers instead of into the same layer as the running screenhack.
      Set this to False to disable that (though you shouldn't need to.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>overlayTextForeground<b> (class
    </b><b>Foreground</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The foreground color used for the stdout/stderr text, if
      <b>captureStderr</b> is true. Default: Yellow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>overlayTextBackground<b> (class
    </b><b>Background</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The background color used for the stdout/stderr text, if
      <b>captureStderr</b> is true. Default: Black.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>bourneShell<b> (class
    </b><b>BourneShell</b><b>)</b></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The pathname of the shell that <i>xscreensaver</i> uses to
      start subprocesses. This must be whatever your local variant of
      <b>/bin/sh</b> is: in particular, it must not be <b>csh</b>.</dd>
