<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pidgin - Instant Messaging client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pidgin [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pidgin is a graphical modular messaging client based on
libpurple which is capable of connecting to AIM, MSN,
Yahoo!, XMPP, ICQ, IRC, SILC, Novell GroupWise, Lotus
Sametime, <br>
Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once. It has many common
features found in other clients, as well as many unique
features. Pidgin is not endorsed by or affiliated with
America <br>
Online, ICQ, Microsoft, or Yahoo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pidgin can be extended by
plugins written in multiple programming languages and
controlled through DBus or purple-remote.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are provided by Pidgin using the
standard GNU command line syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --config=DIR <br>
Use DIR as the directory for config files instead of
~/.purple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Print debugging messages to stdout. These are the same
debugging messages that are displayed in the Debug
Window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force-online <br>
Try to be online even if the network is reported (by
Windows, or NetworkManager on Linux) to be unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a summary of command line options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --multiple <br>
Allow multiple instances of Pidgin to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nologin <br>
Don&rsquo;t automatically login when Pidgin starts. Sets the
global status to Offline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --login[=NAME,NAME,...] <br>
Enable the comma-separated list of accounts provided,
disabling all other accounts. If the user does not specify
such a comma-separated list, the first account in <br>
accounts.xml will be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the current version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMS <br>
Pidgin uses a few terms differently from other applications.
For convenience they are defined here:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buddy List <br>
The list of other users who the user wants to see status
information for and have quick access to for messaging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buddy A user who has been added
to the Buddy List.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Contact <br>
A grouping of more than one buddy who are all the same
person. A contact may contain buddies from any protocol and
may contain as many buddies as the user desires. Con&acirc;
<br>
tact arrangements are stored locally only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alias A private
&quot;nickname&quot; that may be set for Buddies or the user
himself. On some protocols, aliases are saved on the server
but not visible to other users. On other proto&acirc; <br>
cols, aliases are saved only locally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protocol <br>
A messaging service. AIM, XMPP, MSN, Zephyr, etc. are
protocols. Others may call these &quot;service types,&quot;
&quot;account types,&quot; &quot;services,&quot; and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUDDY LIST <br>
The Buddy List window is Pidgin&rsquo;s main interface
window. Using this window a user can see which of his/her
buddies is online, away, idle, etc. The user can also add
buddies to <br>
and remove buddies from the buddy list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Buddy List window contains a
list of the user&rsquo;s buddies who are online and have
allowed the user to be notified of their presence. The icon
to the left of each buddy indi&acirc; <br>
cates the buddy&rsquo;s current status. Double clicking a
buddy will open a new Conversation window. Right clicking
will pop up a menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get Info <br>
Retrieves and displays information about the buddy. This
information is also known as a Profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IM Opens a new Conversation
window to the selected buddy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send File <br>
Sends a file to the selected buddy (only available on
protocols that support file transfer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add Buddy Pounce <br>
A Buddy Pounce is a configurable automated action to be
performed when the buddy&rsquo;s state changes. This will
open the Buddy Pounce dialog, which will be discussed
later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View Log <br>
Pidgin is capable of automatically logging messages. These
logs are either plain text files (with a .txt extension) or
html files (with a .html extension) located under <br>
the ~/.purple/logs directory. This menu command will display
Pidgin&rsquo;s log viewer with logs loaded for that buddy or
chat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alias Create an alias for this
buddy. This will show an editable text field where the
buddy&rsquo;s name was displayed. In this field one can give
this buddy an alternate, more <br>
friendly name to appear on the buddy list and in
conversations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if a buddy&rsquo;s
name was jsmith1281xx and his real name was &rsquo;John Q.
Smith,&rsquo; one could create an alias as to identify the
buddy by his common name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remainder of the menu will
consist of protocol specific commands. These commands vary
depending on the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Selector <br>
At the bottom of the Buddy List is a status selector which
allows one to change his/her status. This will be discussed
further in the STATUS MESSAGES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCOUNT EDITOR <br>
The account editor consists of a list of accounts and
information about them. It can be accessed by selecting
Manage from the Accounts menu. Clicking Delete will delete
the <br>
currently selected account. Clicking Add or Modify will
invoke a Modify Account window. Here, the user can add or
alter account information. When creating a new account, the
<br>
user will submit a username and password. The user will also
choose the protocol for the account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Remember Password is chosen,
the password will be saved in Pidgin&rsquo;s
~/.purple/accounts.xml configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Enabled is checked in the
accounts dialog, this account will follow the status
currently selected in the status selector. If it is not
checked, the account will always be <br>
offline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each protocol has its own
specific options that can be found in the modify screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREFERENCES <br>
All options take effect immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interface <br>
Show system tray icon <br>
Specifies when to show a Pidgin icon in the notification
area of the user&rsquo;s panel (commonly referred to as the
System Tray).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hide new IM conversations <br>
Specifies when to hide new IM messages. Messages will queue
under the specified condition until shown. Clicking the
Pidgin icon in the notification area or system tray <br>
will display the queued messages. An icon also appears in
the buddy list&rsquo;s menu bar; this icon may also be used
to display queued messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show IMs and chats in tabbed
windows <br>
When checked, this option will cause IM and chat sessions to
appear in windows with multiple tabs. One tab will represent
one conversation or chat. Where tabs are placed <br>
will be dictated by the preferences below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show close buttons on tabs <br>
When checked, this option will cause a clickable
&quot;U+2715 MULTIPLICATION X&quot; unicode character to
appear at the right edge of each tab. Clicking this will
cause the tab to <br>
be closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placement <br>
Specifies where to place tabs in the window. Some tab
orientations may allow some users to fit more tabs into a
single window comfortably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New conversations <br>
Specifies under which conditions tabs are placed into
existing windows or into new windows. For a single window,
select Last created window here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversations <br>
Enable buddy icon animation <br>
If a buddy&rsquo;s icon happens to be animated, this option
will enable the animation, otherwise only the first frame
will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notify buddies that you are
typing to them <br>
Some protocols allow clients to tell their buddies when they
are typing. This option enables this feature for protocols
that supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default Formatting <br>
Allows specifying the default formatting to apply to all
outgoing messages (only applicable to protocols that support
formatting in messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smiley Themes <br>
Allows the user to choose between different smiley themes.
The &quot;none&quot; theme will disable graphical emoticons
- they will be displayed as text instead. The Add and Remove
buttons <br>
may be used to install or uninstall smiley themes. Themes
may also be installed by dragging and dropping them onto the
list of themes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sounds <br>
Method Lets the user choose between different playback
methods. The user can also manually enter a command to be
executed when a sound is to be played(%s expands to the full
path <br>
to the file name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sounds when conversation has
focus <br>
When checked, sounds will play for events in the active
conversation if the window is focused. When unchecked,
sounds will not play for the active conversation when the
<br>
window is focused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable Sounds <br>
Determines when to play sounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sound Events <br>
Lets the user choose when and what sounds are to be
played.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network <br>
STUN server <br>
This allows specifying a server which uses the STUN protocol
to determine a host&rsquo;s public IP address. This can be
particularly useful for some protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autodetect IP address <br>
When checked, causes Pidign to attempt to determine the
public IP address of the host on which Pidgin is running and
disables the Public IP text field listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public IP <br>
If Autodetect IP address is disabled, this field allows
manually specifying the public IP address for the host on
which Pidgin is running. This is mainly useful for users
<br>
with multiple network interfaces or behind NATs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manually specify range of ports
to listen on <br>
Specify a range ports to listen on, overriding any defaults.
This is sometimes useful for file transfers and Direct
IM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proxy Server <br>
The configuration section to enable Pidgin to operate
through a proxy server. Pidgin currently supports SOCKS 4/5
and HTTP proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browser <br>
Browser <br>
Allows the user to select Pidgin&rsquo;s default web
browser. Firefox, Galeon, Konqueror, Mozilla, Netscape and
Opera are supported natively. The user can also manually
enter <br>
a command to be executed when a link is clicked (%s expands
to the URL). For example, xterm -e lynx &quot;%s&quot; will
open the link with lynx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open link in <br>
Allows the user to specify whether to use an existing
window, a new tab, a new window, or to let the browser to
decide what to do when calling the browser to open a link.
<br>
Which options are available will depend on which browser is
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging <br>
Log format <br>
Specifies how to log. Pidgin supports HTML and plain text,
but plugins can provide other logging methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log all instant messages <br>
When enabled, all IM conversations are logged. This can be
overridden on a per-conversation basis in the conversation
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log all chats <br>
When enabled, all chat conversations are logged. This can be
overridden on a per-conversation basis in the conversation
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log all status changes to system
log <br>
When enabled, status changes are logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status / Idle <br>
Report idle time <br>
Determines under which conditions to report idle time. Based
on keyboard and mouse use uses keyboard and mouse activity
to determine idle time. From last sent message <br>
uses the time at which the user last sent a message in
Pidgin to determine idle. Never disables idle reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto-reply <br>
Determines when to send an auto-reply on protocols which
support it (currently only AIM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change status when idle <br>
When enabled, this uses the Minutes before becoming idle and
Change status to preferences described below to set status
on idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minutes before becoming idle
<br>
Specifies how many minutes of inactivity are required before
considering the user to be idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change status to <br>
Specifies which &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;saved&quot;
status to use when setting status on idle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use status from last exit at
startup <br>
If this is checked, Pidgin will remember what status was
active when the user closed Pidgin and restore it at the
next run. When disabled, Pidgin will always set the
sta&acirc; <br>
tus selected in Status to apply at startup at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status to apply at startup <br>
When Use status from last exit at startup is disabled, this
specifies which &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;saved&quot;
status to use at startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONVERSATIONS <br>
When starting a new conversation, the user is presented with
the Conversation window. The conversation appears in the
upper text box and the user types his/her message in the
<br>
lower text box. Between the two is a row of options,
represented by icons. Some or all buttons may not be active
if the protocol does not support the specific formatting.
From <br>
left to right:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font This menu provides font
control options for the current conversation. Size, style,
and face may be configured here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert This menu provides the
ability to insert images, horizontal rules, and links where
the protocol supports each of these features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smile! Allows the insertion of
graphical smileys via the mouse. This button shows the user
a dialog with the available smileys for the current
conversation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHATS <br>
For protocols that allow it, Chats can be entered through
the Buddies menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional features available in
chat, depending on the protocol are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whisper <br>
The text will appear in the chat conversation, but it will
only be visible to the sender and the receiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invite Invite other people to
join the chat room.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ignore Ignore anything said by
the chosen person</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Topic <br>
Set the topic of the chat room. This is usually a brief
sentence describing the nature of the chat--an explanation
of the chat room&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Private Message (IM) <br>
Send a message to a specific person in the chat. Messages
sent this way will not appear in the chat window, but
instead open a new IM conversation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS MESSAGES <br>
Most protocols allow for status messages. By using status
messages, a user can leave an informative message for others
to see. Status and status messages are configured via the
<br>
status selector at the bottom of the Buddy List window. By
default the menu shown here is divided into sections for
&quot;primitive&quot; status types, such as Available, Away,
etc.; a <br>
few &quot;popular&quot; statuses (including
&quot;transient&quot; statuses) which have been recently
used, and a section which shows New Status... and Saved
Statuses... options for more advanced <br>
status manipulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Primitive Statuses <br>
A primitive status is a basic status supported by the
protocol. Examples of primitive statuses would be Available,
Away, Invisible, etc. A primitive status can be used <br>
to create a Transient Status or a Saved Status, both
explained below. Essentially, primitive statuses are
building blocks of more complicated statuses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transient Statuses <br>
When one of the statuses from the topmost section of the
status selector&rsquo;s menu is selected, this creates a
transient, or temporary, status. The status will show in the
<br>
&quot;popular statuses&quot; section in the menu until it
has not been used for a sufficiently long time. A transient
status may also be created by selecting New Status... from
the <br>
status selector&rsquo;s menu, then clicking Use once the
user has entered the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Saved Statuses <br>
Saved statuses are permanent--once created, they will exist
until deleted. Saved statuses are useful for statuses and
status messages that will be used on a regular <br>
basis. They are also useful for creating complex statuses in
which some accounts should always have a different status
from others. For example, one might wish to create <br>
a status called &quot;Sleeping&quot; that has all accounts
set to &quot;Away&quot;, then create another status called
&quot;Working&quot; that has three accounts set to
&quot;Away&quot; and another account set <br>
to &quot;Available.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Status Window <br>
When the user selects New Status... from the status selector
menu, Pidgin presents the user with a dialog asking for
status-related information. That information is dis&acirc;
<br>
cussed below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title - The name of the status
that will appear in the status selctor&rsquo;s menu. If the
user clicks the Save or Save &amp; Use button, this name
will also be shown in the Saved <br>
Status Window. The title should be a short description of
the status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status - The type of status
being created, such as Available, Away, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message - The content of the
status message. This is what is visible to other users. Some
protocols will allow formatting in some status messages;
where formatting is <br>
not supported it will be stripped to the bare text
entered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use a different status for some
accounts - This allows the creation of complex statuses in
which some accounts&rsquo; status differs from that of other
accounts. To use this, <br>
the user will click the expander to the left of the text,
then select individual accounts which will have a different
status and/or status message. When the user selects <br>
an account, Pidgin will present another status dialog asking
for a status and a message just for the selected
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Saved Status Window <br>
When the user selects Saved Statuses... from the status
selector&rsquo;s menu, Pidgin presents a dialog that lists
all saved statuses. &quot;Transient&quot; statuses,
discussed above, <br>
are NOT shown here. This window provides the ability to
manage saved statuses by allowing the creation,
modification, and deletion of saved statuses. The Use,
Modify, <br>
and Delete buttons here allow operation on the status
selected from the list; the dd button allows creation of a
new saved status, and the Close button closes the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUDDY POUNCE <br>
A Buddy Pounce is an automated trigger that occurs when a
buddy returns to a normal state from an away state. The
Buddy Pounce dialog box can be activated by selecting the
Buddy <br>
Pounce option from the Tools menu. From this dialog, new
pounces can be created with the Add button and existing
pounces can be removed with the Delete button. A pounce can
be <br>
set to occur on any combination of the events listed, and
any combination of actions can result. If Pounce only when
my status is not Available is checked, the pounce will occur
<br>
only if the user is set to a non-available status, such as
invisible, do not disturb, away, etc. If Recurring is
checked, the pounce will remain until removed by the Delete
but&acirc; <br>
ton.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CUSTOM SMILIES <br>
Pidgin 2.5.0 introduced support for custom smilies on those
protocols for which interested contributors have developed
support. The custom smiley manager can be accessed by <br>
selecting Smiley from the Tools menu. From here, custom
smilies may be added, edited, or deleted by clicking the
Add, Edit, or Delete buttons, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During a conversation with
another user, that user&rsquo;s custom smileys may be added
to the user&rsquo;s own custom smiley list directly from the
conversation window by right-clicking the <br>
new custom smiley and selecting Add Custom Smiley...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLUGINS <br>
Pidgin allows for dynamic loading of plugins to add extra
functionality to Pidgin. See plugins/HOWTO or
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/CHowTo for information on
writing plug&acirc; <br>
ins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The plugins dialog can be
accessed by selecting Plugins from the Tools menu. Each
plugin available appears in this dialog with its name,
version, and a short summary of its func&acirc; <br>
tionality. Plugins can be enabled with the checkbox beside
the name and short description. More information on the
currently selected plugin is available by clicking the <br>
expander beside the text Plugin Details. If the selected
plugin has preferences or configuration options, the
Configure Plugin button will present the plugin&rsquo;s
preferences dia&acirc; <br>
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL <br>
Pidgin allows for plugins to be written in the perl
scripting language. See Perl Scripting HOWTO in the Pidgin
documentation for more information about perl scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TCL <br>
Pidgin allows for plugins to be written in the Tcl scripting
language. See plugins/tcl/TCL-HOWTO for more information
about Tcl scripting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D-Bus <br>
Pidgin allows for interaction via D-Bus. Currently very
little documentation about this interaction exists.</p>
