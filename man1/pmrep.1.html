<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmrep - performance metrics reporter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmrep [-CdGHLpruUVxz?] [-a archive] [-A align] [-b

[-F outfile] [-h host] [-K spec] [-l delimiter] [-o output]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmrep is a customizable performance metrics reporting tool.
Any available performance metric, live or archived, system
and/or application, can be selected for reporting using <br>
one of the output alternatives listed below together with
applicable formatting options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmrep collects the selected
metric values through the facilities of the Performance
Co-Pilot (PCP), see PCPIntro(1). The metrics to be reported
are specified on the command <br>
line, in a configuration file, or both. Metrics can be
automatically converted and scaled using the PCP facilities,
either by default or by per-metric scaling specifications.
<br>
In addition to the existing metrics, derived metrics can be
defined using the arithmetic expressions described in
pmRegisterDerived(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless directed to another host
by the -h option, pmrep will contact the Performance Metrics
Collector Daemon (PMCD, see pmcd(1)) on the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option causes pmrep to
use the specified set of archive logs rather than connecting
to a PMCD. The -a and -h options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -L option causes pmrep to
use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs
(Performance Metrics Domain Agents,
&lsquo;&lsquo;plugins&rsquo;&rsquo;) on the local host
without PMCD. Only some <br>
metrics are available in this mode. The -a, -h, and -L
options are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The metrics of interest are
named in the metricspec argument(s). If a metricspec
specifies a non-leaf node in the Performance Metrics Name
Space (PMNS), then pmrep will recur&acirc; <br>
sively descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes (i.e.,
metrics) for that metricspec. (Use for example pminfo(1) to
list all the leaf nodes and their descriptions.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A metricspec has three different
forms. First, on the command line it can start with a colon
(&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;) to indicate a metricset to
be read from a pmrep configuration file (see <br>
pmrep.conf(5)) which can then consist of any number of
metricspecs. Second, a metricspec starting with non-colon
specifies a PMNS node as described above, optionally
followed by <br>
metric formatting definitions (applicable only to leaf
nodes). This so-called compact form of a metricspec is
defined as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">metric[,label[,instance[,unit/scale[,type[,width]]]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A valid PMNS node (metric) is
mandatory. It can be followed by a text label used by
supporting output targets (such as csv and stdout, see
below). The optional instance defini&acirc; <br>
tion is currently unimplemented. An optional unit/scale is
applicable for dimension-compatible, non-string, and
(currently) non-raw metrics. (See below for supported
unit/scale <br>
specifications.) By default, cumulative counter metrics are
converted to rates. If the optional type field is set to raw
then this rate conversion is disabled, unit/scale
spec&acirc; <br>
ification is (currently) ignored and raw values are reported
instead. Finally, for supporting output targets (currently:
stdout) a numeric width can be used to set the width of <br>
the output column for this metric. Too-wide numeric values
for output will not be printed (apart from decimal places,
numeric values will never be silently truncated). Too-wide
<br>
strings will be truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following metricspec
requests the metric kernel.all.sysfork to be reported under
the label forks, converting to the default rate count/s in
an 8 wide column. Although the <br>
definitions in this compact form are optional, they must
always be provided in the order specified above.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">kernel.all.sysfork,forks,,,,8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third form of a metricspec
is valid only in pmrep.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Derived metrics are specified
like PMNS leaf node metrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration file parameters
override the corresponding built-in default values (if any).
Command line parameters override the corresponding
configuration file parameters (if <br>
any).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The available command line options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Performance metric values are
retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
log files identified by the argument archive, which is a
comma-separated list of <br>
names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
the name of a directory containing one or more archives. See
also -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--archive-folio <br>
Read metric source archives from the PCP archive folio (see
mkaf(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A When reporting archived
metrics, force the initial sample to be aligned on the
boundary of a natural time unit align. Refer to PCPIntro(1)
for a complete description of the <br>
syntax for align.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Unit/scale for space (byte)
metrics, possible values include bytes, Kbytes, KB, Mbytes,
MB, and so forth up to Ebytes. This option will not override
possible per-metric <br>
specifications. See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Specify the config file to
use. The default is ./pmrep.conf. See pmrep.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Exit before reporting any
values, but after parsing the configuration and metrics and
printing possible headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d When replaying from an
archive, this option requests that the prevailing real-time
delay be applied between samples (see -t) to effect a pause,
rather than the default be&acirc; <br>
haviour of replaying at full speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Specify derived performance
metrics. If derived starts with a slash
(&lsquo;&lsquo;/&rsquo;&rsquo;) or with a dot
(&lsquo;&lsquo;.&rsquo;&rsquo;) it will be interpreted as a
derived metrics configuration file, otherwise <br>
it will be interpreted as comma-separated derived metric
expressions. For details see pmLoadDerivedConfig(3) and
pmRegisterDerived(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Repeat the header every lines
of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Use the format string for
formatting the timestamp. The format will be used with
Python&rsquo;s datetime.strftime method which is mostly the
same as that described in strf&acirc; <br>
time(3). An empty format string (i.e., &rsquo;&rsquo;) will
remove the timestamps from the output. The default with
stdout is %H:%M:%S. The default with csv is %Y-%m-%d
%H:%M:%S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Specify the output file
outfile. See -o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Do not include global metrics
in reporting (see pmrep.conf(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Fetch performance metrics
from pmcd(1) on host, rather than the default localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Do not print any headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K When fetching metrics from a
local context (see -L), the -K option may be used to control
the DSO PMDAs that should be made accessible. The spec
argument conforms to the <br>
syntax described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3). More than one -K
option may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Specify the delimiter that
separates each column of csv or stdout output. The delimiter
may only be a single character. The default for stdout is
two spaces (&lsquo;&lsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo;) and <br>
comma (&lsquo;&lsquo;,&rsquo;&rsquo;) for csv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Use a local context to
collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local host without
PMCD. See also -K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Use output target for
reporting. The default target is stdout. The available
target alternatives are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive <br>
Record metrics into a PCP archive which can later be
replayed with PCP tools, including pmrep itself. See
pcp-archive(5) and PCPIntro(1) for details about PCP archive
<br>
files. Requires -F.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">csv <br>
Print metrics in CSV format (subject to formatting
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stdout <br>
Print metrics to stdout (format subject to formatting
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">zabbix <br>
Send metrics to a Zabbix server. See pmrep.conf(5) for the
needed Zabbix configuration parameters. This target is
currently experimental.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O When reporting archived
metrics, start reporting at origin within the time window
(see -S and -T). Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete
description of the syntax for origin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print timestamps. By default
no timestamps are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Use precision for numeric
non-integer output values. If the value is too wide for its
column width, precision is reduced one by one until the
value fits, or not printed at <br>
all if it does not. The default is to use 3 decimal places
(when applicable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Unit/scale for count metrics,
possible values include count x 10^-1, count, count x 10,
count x 10^2, and so forth from 10^-8 to 10^7. (These values
are currently space- <br>
sensitive.) This option will not override possible
per-metric specifications. See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Output raw metric values, do
not convert cumulative counters to rates. This option will
override possible per-metric specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The argument samples defines
the number of samples to be retrieved and reported. If
samples is 0 or -s is not specified, pmrep will sample and
report continuously (in real <br>
time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives (in
archive mode). See also -T.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S When reporting archived
metrics, the report will be restricted to those records
logged at or after starttime. Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of the syntax <br>
for starttime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The default update interval
may be set to something other than the default 1 second. The
interval argument follows the syntax described in
PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest <br>
form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this
case are seconds). See also the -T and -u options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T When reporting archived
metrics, the report will be restricted to those records
logged before or at endtime. Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of the syntax <br>
for endtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When used to define the runtime
before pmrep will exit, if no samples is given (see -s) then
the number of reported samples depends on interval (see -t).
If samples is <br>
given then interval will be adjusted to allow reporting of
samples during runtime. In case all of -T, -s, and -t are
given, endtime determines the actual time pmrep will <br>
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u When reporting archived
metrics, by default values are reported according to the
selected sample interval (-t option), not according to the
actual record interval in an ar&acirc; <br>
chive. To this effect PCP interpolates the values to be
reported based on the records in the archive. With the -u
option uninterpolated reporting is enabled, every <br>
recorded value for the selected metrics is reported and the
requested sample interval (-t) is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So for example, if a PCP archive
contains recorded values for every 10 seconds and the
requested sample interval is 1 hour, by default pmrep will
use an interpolation scheme <br>
to compute the values of the requested metrics from the
values recorded in the proximity of these requested metrics
and values for every 1 hour are reported. With -u every <br>
record every 10 seconds are used as such (the reported
values are still subject to rate conversion, use -r to
disable).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Omit unit information from of
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Set the stdout output column
width. Strings will be truncated to this width. The default
width is the shortest that can fit the metric label, the
forced minimum is 3. <br>
This option will not override possible per-metric
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Print extended header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y Unit/scale for time metrics,
possible values include nanosec, ns, microsec, us, millisec,
and so forth up to hours, hr. This option will not override
possible per-metric <br>
specifications. See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use the local timezone of the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
identified by either the -h or the -a options. The default
is to use the timezone of <br>
the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Use timezone when displaying
the date and time. Timezone is in the format of the
environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? Display usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples use the PCP facilities for collecting
the metric values, no external utilities are needed. The
examples expect the default configuration file to contain
<br>
the metricset specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display network interface
statistics on the local host: <br>
$ pmrep network.interface.total.bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display per-device disk reads
and writes from the host server1 using two seconds interval
and CSV output format: <br>
$ pmrep -h server1 -o csv -t 2s disk.dev.read
disk.dev.write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display timestamped vmstat(8)
like information using MBs instead of bytes and also include
the number of in-use inodes: <br>
