<p>FILE(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
FILE(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
file &acirc; determine file type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
file [&acirc;dh] [&acirc;M file] [&acirc;m file] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file &acirc;i [&acirc;h]
file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The file utility shall perform a series of tests in sequence
on each specified file in an attempt to classify it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If file does not exist,
cannot be read, or its file status could not be determined,
the output shall indicate that the file was processed, but
that its type could not be <br>
determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the file is not a regular
file, its file type shall be identified. The file types
directory, FIFO, socket, block special, and character
special shall be identified as <br>
such. Other implementation-defined file types may also be
identified. If file is a symbolic link, by default the link
shall be resolved and file shall test the type of file <br>
referenced by the symbolic link. (See the &acirc;h and
&acirc;i options below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the length of file is
zero, it shall be identified as an empty file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The file utility shall
examine an initial segment of file and shall make a guess at
identifying its contents based on position-sensitive tests.
(The answer is not guaranteed <br>
to be correct; see the &acirc;d, &acirc;M, and &acirc;m
options below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. The file utility shall
examine file and make a guess at identifying its contents
based on context-sensitive default system tests. (The answer
is not guaranteed to be cor&acirc; <br>
rect.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. The file shall be identified
as a data file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file does not exist, cannot
be read, or its file status could not be determined, the
output shall indicate that the file was processed, but that
its type could not be deter&acirc; <br>
mined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file is a symbolic link, by
default the link shall be resolved and file shall test the
type of file referenced by the symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The file utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that the order of the &acirc;m, &acirc;d,
and &acirc;M options shall <br>
be significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;d Apply any
position-sensitive default system tests and
context-sensitive default system tests to the file. This is
the default if no &acirc;M or &acirc;m option is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;h When a symbolic link is
encountered, identify the file as a symbolic link. If
&acirc;h is not specified and file is a symbolic link that
refers to a nonexistent file, file <br>
shall identify the file as a symbolic link, as if &acirc;h
had been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;i If a file is a regular
file, do not attempt to classify the type of the file
further, but identify the file as specified in the STDOUT
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;M file Specify the name
of a file containing position-sensitive tests that shall be
applied to a file in order to classify it (see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION). No position-sen&acirc; <br>
sitive default system tests nor context-sensitive default
system tests shall be applied unless the &acirc;d option is
also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m file Specify the name
of a file containing position-sensitive tests that shall be
applied to a file in order to classify it (see the EXTENDED
DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &acirc;m option is
specified without specifying the &acirc;d option or the
&acirc;M option, position-sensitive default system tests
shall be applied after the position-sensitive tests
spec&acirc; <br>
ified by the &acirc;m option. If the &acirc;M option is
specified with the &acirc;d option, the &acirc;m option, or
both, or the &acirc;m option is specified with the &acirc;d
option, the concatenation of the posi&acirc; <br>
tion-sensitive tests specified by these options shall be
applied in the order specified by the appearance of these
options. If a &acirc;M or &acirc;m file option-argument is
&acirc;, the results <br>
are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file to be
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be used if a file operand is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; and the implementation treats the
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; as meaning standard input. Otherwise,
the standard input shall not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The file can be any file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
In the POSIX locale, the following format shall be used to
identify each operand, file specified:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s: %s0, &lt;file&gt;,
&lt;type&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values for &lt;type&gt; are
unspecified, except that in the POSIX locale, if file is
identified as one of the types listed in the following
table, &lt;type&gt; shall contain (but is not <br>
limited to) the corresponding string, unless the file is
identified by a position-sensitive test specified by a
&acirc;M or &acirc;m option. Each &lt;space&gt; shown in the
strings shall be <br>
exactly one &lt;space&gt;.</p>

Notes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. This is a file type test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. This test is applied only if
the &acirc;i option is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. This test is applied only if
the &acirc;i option is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. This is a position-sensitive
default system test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. This is a context-sensitive
default system test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Position-sensitive default
system tests and context-sensitive default system tests are
not applied if the &acirc;M option is specified unless the
&acirc;d option is also speci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the POSIX locale, if file is
identified as a symbolic link (see the &acirc;h option), the
following alternative output format shall be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s: %s %s0, &lt;file&gt;,
&lt;type&gt;, &lt;contents of link&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file named by the file
operand does not exist, cannot be read, or the type of the
file named by the file operand cannot be determined, this
shall not be considered an <br>
error that affects the exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
A file specified as an option-argument to the &acirc;m or
&acirc;M options shall contain one position-sensitive test
per line, which shall be applied to the file. If the test
succeeds, the <br>
message field of the line shall be printed and no further
tests shall be applied, with the exception that tests on
immediately following lines beginning with a single
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; charac&acirc; <br>
ter shall be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line shall be composed of
the following four &lt;tab&gt;-separated fields.
(Implementations may allow any combination of one or more
white-space characters other than &lt;newline&gt; to <br>
act as field separators.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">offset An unsigned number
(optionally preceded by a single &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;
character) specifying the offset, in bytes, of the value in
the file that is to be compared against the value <br>
field of the line. If the file is shorter than the specified
offset, the test shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the offset begins with the
character &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, the test contained in the line
shall not be applied to the file unless the test on the last
line for which the offset did <br>
not begin with a &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; was successful. By
default, the offset shall be interpreted as an unsigned
decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the offset shall be
interpreted <br>
as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading 0, the
offset shall be interpreted as an octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type The type of the value in
the file to be tested. The type shall consist of the type
specification characters d, s, and u, specifying signed
decimal, string, and unsigned <br>
decimal, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type string shall be
interpreted as the bytes from the file starting at the
specified offset and including the same number of bytes
specified by the value field. If <br>
insufficient bytes remain in the file past the offset to
match the value field, the test shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type specification
characters d and u can be followed by an optional unsigned
decimal integer that specifies the number of bytes
represented by the type. The type <br>
specification characters d and u can be followed by an
optional C, S, I, or L, indicating that the value is of type
char, short, int, or long, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default number of bytes
represented by the type specifiers d, f, and u shall
correspond to their respective C-language types as follows.
If the system claims con&acirc; <br>
formance to the C-Language Development Utilities option,
those specifiers shall correspond to the default sizes used
in the c99 utility. Otherwise, the default sizes <br>
shall be implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the type specifier
characters d and u, the default number of bytes shall
correspond to the size of a basic integer type of the
implementation. For these specifier <br>
characters, the implementation shall support values of the
optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding to
the number of bytes in the C-language types char, <br>
short, int, or long. These numbers can also be specified by
an application as the characters C, S, I, and L,
respectively. The byte order used when interpreting <br>
numeric values is implementation-defined, but shall
correspond to the order in which a constant of the
corresponding type is stored in memory on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All type specifiers, except for
s, can be followed by a mask specifier of the form
&amp;number. The mask value shall be AND&rsquo;ed with the
value of the input file before the <br>
comparison with the value field of the line is made. By
default, the mask shall be interpreted as an unsigned
decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the mask shall be
<br>
interpreted as an unsigned hexadecimal number; otherwise,
with a leading 0, the mask shall be interpreted as an
unsigned octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The strings byte, short, long,
and string shall also be supported as type fields, being
interpreted as dC, dS, dL, and s, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">value The value to be compared
with the value from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the specifier from the type
field is s or string, then interpret the value as a string.
Otherwise, interpret it as a number. If the value is a
string, then the test <br>
shall succeed only when a string value exactly matches the
bytes from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value is a string, it can
contain the following sequences: &rsquo;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;,,
&rsquo;0, &rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo;, &rsquo;. In addition, the
escape sequence &rsquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; (the &lt;backslash&gt;
character followed by a &lt;space&gt; character) shall be
rec&acirc; <br>
ognized to represent a &lt;space&gt; character. The results
of using any other character, other than an octal digit,
following the &lt;backslash&gt; are unspecified. O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tal sequences that can be used
to represent characters with specific coded values. An octal
sequence shall consist of a &lt;backslash&gt; followed by
the long&acirc; <br>
est sequence of one, two, or three octal-digit characters
(01234567).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, any value that is
not a string shall be interpreted as a signed decimal
number. Any such value, with a leading 0x or 0X, shall be
interpreted as an unsigned <br>
hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading zero, the
value shall be interpreted as an unsigned octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value is not a string, it
can be preceded by a character indicating the comparison to
be performed. Permissible characters and the comparisons
they specify are <br>
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= The test shall succeed if the
value from the file equals the value field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; The test shall succeed if
the value from the file is less than the value field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; The test shall succeed if
the value from the file is greater than the value field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp; The test shall succeed if
all of the set bits in the value field are set in the value
from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ The test shall succeed if at
least one of the set bits in the value field is not set in
the value from the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x The test shall succeed if the
file is large enough to contain a value of the type
specified starting at the offset specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">message The message to be
printed if the test succeeds. The message shall be
interpreted using the notation for the printf formatting
specification; see printf. If the value <br>
field was a string, then the value from the file shall be
the argument for the printf formatting specification;
otherwise, the value from the file shall be the argu&acirc;
<br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The file utility can only be required to guess at many of
the file types because only exhaustive testing can determine
some types with certainty. For example, binary data on some
<br>
implementations might match the initial segment of an
executable or a tar archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the table indicates
that the output contains the stated string. Systems may add
text before or after the string. For executables, as an
example, the machine architec&acirc; <br>
ture and various facts about how the file was link-edited
may be included. Note also that on systems that recognize
shell script files starting with &quot;#!&quot; as
executable files, <br>
these may be identified as executable binary files rather
than as shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Determine whether an argument is a binary executable
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file &acirc;&acirc;
&quot;$1&quot; | grep &acirc;q &rsquo;:.*executable&rsquo;
&amp;&amp; <br>
printf &quot;%s is executable.01&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The &acirc;f option was omitted because the same effect can
(and should) be obtained using the xargs utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical versions of the file
utility attempt to identify the following types of files:
symbolic link, directory, character special, block special,
socket, tar archive, cpio <br>
archive, SCCS archive, archive library, empty, compress
output, pack output, binary data, C source, FORTRAN source,
assembler source, nroff/troff/eqn/tbl source troff output,
<br>
shell script, C shell script, English text, ASCII text,
various executables, APL workspace, compiled terminfo
entries, and CURSES screen images. Only those types that are
reason&acirc; <br>
ably well specified in POSIX or are directly related to
POSIX utilities are listed in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical systems have used a
&lsquo;&lsquo;magic file&rsquo;&rsquo; named /etc/magic to
help identify file types. Because it is generally useful for
users and scripts to be able to identify special <br>
file types, the &acirc;m flag and a portable format for
user-created magic files has been specified. No requirement
is made that an implementation of file use this method of
identify&acirc; <br>
ing files, only that users be permitted to add their own
classifying tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, three options have
been added to historical practice. The &acirc;d flag has
been added to permit users to cause their tests to follow
any default system tests. The &acirc;i flag <br>
has been added to permit users to test portably for regular
files in shell scripts. The &acirc;M flag has been added to
permit users to ignore any default system tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The POSIX.1&acirc;2008
description of default system tests and the interaction
between the &acirc;d, &acirc;M, and &acirc;m options did not
clearly indicate that there were two types of
&lsquo;&lsquo;default system <br>
tests&rsquo;&rsquo;. The &lsquo;&lsquo;position-sensitive
tests&rsquo;&rsquo; determine file types by looking for
certain string or binary values at specific offsets in the
file being examined. These position-sen&acirc; <br>
sitive tests were implemented in historical systems using
the magic file described above. Some of these tests are now
built into the file utility itself on some implementations
<br>
so the output can provide more detail than can be provided
by magic files. For example, a magic file can easily
identify a core file on most implementations, but cannot
name the <br>
program file that dropped the core. A magic file could
produce output such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/dwc/core: ELF 32-bit MSB
core file SPARC Version 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but by building the test into
the file utility, you could get output such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/dwc/core: ELF 32-bit MSB
core file SPARC Version 1, from &rsquo;testprog&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These extended built-in tests
are still to be treated as position-sensitive default system
tests even if they are not listed in /etc/magic or any other
magic file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The context-sensitive default
system tests were always built into the file utility. These
tests looked for language constructs in text files trying to
identify shell scripts, C, <br>
FORTRAN, and other computer language source files, and even
plain text files. With the addition of the &acirc;m and
&acirc;M options the distinction between position-sensitive
and context- <br>
sensitive default system tests became important because the
order of testing is important. The context-sensitive system
default tests should never be applied before any position-
<br>
sensitive tests even if the &acirc;d option is specified
before a &acirc;m option or &acirc;M option due to the high
probability that the context-sensitive system default tests
will incorrectly <br>
identify arbitrary text files as text files before
position-sensitive tests specified by the &acirc;m or
&acirc;M option would be applied to give a more accurate
identification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leaving the meaning of &acirc;M
&acirc; and &acirc;m &acirc; unspecified allows an existing
prototype of these options to continue to work in a
backwards-compatible manner. (In that implementation,
&acirc;M &acirc; <br>
was roughly equivalent to &acirc;d in
POSIX.1&acirc;2008.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The historical &acirc;c option
was omitted as not particularly useful to users or portable
shell scripts. In addition, a reasonable implementation of
the file utility would report any <br>
errors found each time the magic file is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The historical format of the
magic file was the same as that specified by the Rationale
in the ISO POSIX&acirc;2:1993 standard for the offset,
value, and message fields; however, it <br>
used less precise type fields than the format specified by
the current normative text. The new type field values are a
superset of the historical ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of a basic integer data
type is intended to allow the implementation to choose a
word size commonly used by applications on that
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than
eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
