PDL::Course - A journey through PDL's documentation, from beginner to advanced.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUTHOR,_DATE"><a class="selflink" href="#AUTHOR,_DATE">AUTHOR,
  DATE</a></h1>
This is written by David Mertens with edits by Daniel Carrera.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Preface"><a class="selflink" href="#Preface">Preface</a></h1>
PDL's documentation is extensive. Some sections cover deep core magic while
  others cover more usual topics like IO and numerical computation. How are
  these related? Where should you begin?
<div class="Pp"></div>
This document is an attempt to pull all the key PDL documentation together in a
  coherent study course, starting from the beginner level, up to the expert.
<div class="Pp"></div>
I've broken down everything by level of expertise, and within expertise I've
  covered documentation, library, and workflow modules. The documentation
  modules are useful for what they tell you; the library modules are useful for
  the functions that they define for you; the workflow modules are useful for
  the way that they allow you to get your work done in new and different ways.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Introductory"><a class="selflink" href="#Introductory">Introductory</a></h1>
If you are new to PDL, these documentation modules will get you started down the
  right path for using PDL.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Documentation"><a class="selflink" href="#Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
Modules that tell you how to start using PDL. Many of these are library modules
  technically, but they are included when you &quot;use PDL&quot;, so I've
  included them for their documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After the first three, most of the docs listed below are rather dry. Perhaps
  they would be better summarized by tables or better synopses. You should at
  least scan through them to familiarize yourself with the basic capabilities of
  PDL.

    PDL came of age right around the turn of the millennium and NiceSlice came
      on the scene slightly after that. Some of the docs still haven't caught
      up. NiceSlice is the 'modern' way to slice and dice your piddles. Read the
      Synopsis, then scroll down to The New Slicing Syntax. After you've read to

    Like PDL::Primitive, defines a large set of useful functions. Unfortunately,
      some of the functions are quite esoteric, but are mixed in with the rest

    In addition to explaining the original slicing and dicing functions - for

      Spherical-Polar coordinates (although many such standard coordinate

      that this module has not been heavily tested with other modules, so

    Provides many standard matrix operations for piddles, such as computing
      eigenvalues, inverting square matrices, LU-decomposition, and solving a
      system of linear equations. Though it is not built on PDL::Matrix, it
      should generally work with that module. Also, the methods provided by this

      the problem of processing that hashref. PDL::Options assists you in
      writing code to process those options. (You'd think Perl would have tons

      module on CPAN, use PDL::Lite or PDL::LiteF and want to make sure that
      your users have a recent-enough version of PDL. Since the variable is
      defined in PDL.pm, you don't need this module if you &quot;use
    PDL&quot;.</dd>

    Explains the nitty-gritty of the PDL data structures. After reading this (a
      few times :), you should be able to create a piddle completely from
      scratch (i.e. without using the PDL API). Put a little differently, if you
      want to understand how PDL::PP works, you'll need to read this.</dd>
