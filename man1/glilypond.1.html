<p>glilypond(1) General Commands Manual glilypond(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
glilypond &acirc; integrate lilypond parts into groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
glilypond [ options] [-] [--] [ filespec ....]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
glilypond transforms sheet music written in the lilypond
language into the groff(7) language using the .PSPIC
request, such that groff(1) can transform it into a format
that can <br>
be displayed directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files in groff language and
standard input can be provided as arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION OVERVIEW <br>
Breaking Options <br>
-?|-h|--help|--usage <br>
Print help or usage information, then leave the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l|--license <br>
Print license information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for building EPS Files
<br>
[--ly2eps] <br>
Here the lilypond program creates eps files directly. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--pdf2eps] <br>
The program glilypond generates a pdf file using lilypond.
Then the eps file is generated by pdf2ps and ps2epsR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directories and Files <br>
-e|--eps_dir directory_name <br>
Normally all EPS files are sent to the temporary directory.
With this option, you can generate your own directory, in
which all useful EPS files are send. So at last, <br>
the temporary directory can be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p|--prefix begin_of_name <br>
Normally all temporary files get names that start with the
ly.... prefix. With this option, you can freely change this
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k|--keep_all <br>
Normally all temporary files without the eps files are
deleted. With this option, all generated files either by the
lilypond program or other format transposers are kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t|--temp_dir dir <br>
With this option, you call a directory that is the base for
the temporary directory. This directory name is used as is
without any extensions. If this directory does not <br>
exist it is be created. The temporary directory is created
by Perl&rsquo;s security operations directly under this
directory. In this temporary directory, the temporary files
<br>
are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output <br>
-o|--output file_name <br>
Normally all groff output of this program is sent to
STDOUTR. With this option, that can be changed, such that
the output is stored into a file named in the option
argu&acirc; <br>
ment file_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v|-V|--verbose <br>
A lot more of information is sent to STDERR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short Option Collections <br>
The argument handling of options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short options are arguments that
start with a single dash -. Such an argument can consist of
arbitrary many options without option argument, composed as
a collection of option <br>
characters following the single dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Such a collection can be
terminated by an option character that expects an option
argument. If this option character is not the last character
of the argument, the following fi&acirc; <br>
nal part of the argument is the option argument. If it is
the last character of the argument, the next argument is
taken as the option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the standard for POSIX
and GNU option management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kVe some_dir <br>
is a collection of the short options -k and -V without
option argument, followed by the short option -e with option
argument that is the following part of the argument <br>
some_dir. So this argument could also be written as several
arguments -k -V -e some_dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Handling of Long Options <br>
Arguments that start with a double dash -- are so-called
long options R . Each double dash argument can only have a
single long option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long options have or have not an
option argument. An option argument can be the next argument
or can be appended with an equal sign = to the same argument
as the long option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help is a long option without
an option argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eps_dir some_dir <br>
--eps_dir=some_dir <br>
is the long option --eps_dir with the option argument
some_dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover the program allows
abbreviations of long options, as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The long option --keep_all can
be abbreviated from --keep_al up to --k because the program
does not have another long option whose name starts with the
character k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the other hand, the option
--version cannot be abbreviated further than --vers because
there is also the long option --verbose that can be
abbreviated up to --verb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An option argument can also be
appended to an abbreviation. So is --e=some_dir the same as
--eps_dir some_dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover the program allows an
arbitrary usage of upper and lower case in the option name.
This is Perl style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the long option
--keep_all can as well be written as --Keep_All or even as
an abbreviation like --KeE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILESPEC ARGUMENTS <br>
An argument that is not an option or an option argument is
called a filespec argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without any filespec argument,
standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each filespec argument must
either be the name of a readable file or a dash - for
standard input. Each input must be written in the roff or
groff language and can include lily&acirc; <br>
pond parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally arguments starting with
a dash - are interpreted as an option. But if you use an
argument that consists only of a doubled dash -- R , all
following arguments are taken <br>
as filespec argument, even if such an argument starts with a
dash. This is handled according to the GNU standard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE LILYPOND PARTS IN ROFF INPUT
<br>
Integrated Lilypond Codes <br>
A lilypond part within a structure written in the groff
language is the whole part between the marks <br>
.lilypond start <br>
and <br>
.lilypond end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A groff input can have several
of these lilypond parts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When processing such a lilypond
part between .lilypond start and .lilypond end we say that
the glilypond program is in lilypond mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These lilypond parts are sent
into temporary lilypond files with the file name extension
.ly. These files are transformed later on into EPS
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inclusion of ly-Files <br>
An additional command line for file inclusion of lilypond
files is given by <br>
.lilypond include file_name <br>
in groff input. For each such include command, one file of
lilypond code can be included into the groff code.
Arbitrarily many of these commands can be included in the
groff <br>
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These include commands can only
be used outside the lilypond parts. Within the lilypond
mode, this inclusion is not possible. So .lilypond include
may not be used in lilypond <br>
mode, i.e. between .lilypond start and .lilypond end. These
included ly-files are also transformed into EPS files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERATED FILES <br>
By the transformation process of lilypond parts into EPS
files, there are many files generated. By default, these
files are regarded as temporary files and as such stored in
a <br>
temporary directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This process can be changed by
command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Line Options for
Directories <br>
The temporary directory for this program is either created
automatically or can be named by the option -t|--temp_dir
dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, the EPS files that are
later on referred by .PSPIC command in the final groff
output can be stored in a different directory that can be
set by the command line option <br>
-e|--eps_dir directory_name. With this option, the temporary
directory can be removed completely at the end of the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The beginning of the names of
the temporary files can be set by the command line option
[-p |] begin_of_name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the temporary files
except the EPS files are deleted finally. This can be
changed by setting the command line option [-k |] With this,
all temporary files and directories <br>
are kept, not deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These EPS files are stored in a
temporary or EPS directory. But they cannot be deleted by
the transformation process because they are needed for the
display which can take a <br>
long time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES FOR
GENERATING EPS FILES <br>
Mode ly2eps <br>
This mode is the default. It can also be chosen by the
option --ly2eps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode, the .ly files are
transformed by the lilypond program into many files of
different formats, including eps files, using <br>
$ lilypond --ps -dbackend=eps -dgs-load-fonts
--output=file-name <br>
for each .ly file. The output file-name must be provided
without an extension, its directory is temporary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many EPS files
created. One having the complete transformed ly file, named
file-name.eps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover there are EPS files for
each page, named file-name-digit.eps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last step to be done is
replacing all lilypond parts by the collection of the
corresponding EPS page files. This is done by groff commands
<br>
.PSPIC file-name-digit.eps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode pdf2eps <br>
This mode can be chosen by the option --pdf2eps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode, the .ly files are
transformed by the lilypond(1) program into pdf files, using
<br>
lilypond --pdf --output=file-name <br>
for each .ly file. The file-name must be provided without
the extension .pdf. By this process, a file file-name.pdf is
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next step is to transform
these PDF files into a PS file. This is done by the
pdf2ps(1) program using <br>
$ pdf2ps file-name .pdf file-name .ps <br>
The next step creates an EPS file from the PS file. This is
done by the ps2eps(1) program using <br>
$ ps2eps file-name.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By that, a file file-name.eps is
created for each lilypond part in the groff file or standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last step to be done is
replacing all lilypond parts by the groff command <br>
.PSPIC file-name.eps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE GENERATED NEW ROFF STRUCTURE
<br>
The new groff(7) structure generated by glilypond is
either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) sent to standard output and
can there be saved into a file or piped into groff(1) or
groffer(1) or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) stored into a file by given
the option -o | --output file_name</p>
