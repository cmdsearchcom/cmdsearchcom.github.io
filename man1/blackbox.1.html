<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
blackbox - a window manager for X11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
blackbox -help | -version <br>
blackbox [ -rc rcfile ] [ -display display ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Blackbox is a window manager for the Open Group&rsquo;s X
Window System, Version 11 Release 6 and above. Its design is
meant to be visually minimalist and fast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackbox is similar to the NeXT
interface and Windowmaker. Applications are launched using a
menu which is accessed by right clicking on the root window.
Workspaces, a system of <br>
virtual desktops are controlled via a menu which is accessed
by middle clicking on the root window and by using the
toolbar. Individual windows can be controlled by buttons on
<br>
the title bar and more options are available by right
clicking on the title bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackbox is able to generate
beautiful window decorations on the fly at high speed.
Themes, called styles in Blackbox terminology, are very
flexible but the use of pixmaps has <br>
been purposefully avoided to eliminate dependencies and
excess memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackbox itself does not
directly handle key bindings like most other window
managers. This task is handled by a separate utility called
bbkeys. Although Blackbox has a built-in <br>
workspace (paging) system, bbpager, which provides a
graphical pager, is popular with many users. bbkeys, bbpager
and several other bbtools can be found by going to <br>
http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org/ <br>
The slit is an edge of the screen which can hold specially
designed programs called dock apps (from Windowmaker). In
addition, the popular program gkrellm will also run in the
<br>
slit. There is a huge selection of dockapps available and
they run the gamut from must-have gadgets to utterly useless
(but cute and/or funny) eye candy. <br>
http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp/ <br>
http://dockapps.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Blackbox supports the following command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Display command line
options, compiled-in features, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Display version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rc rcfile <br>
Use an alternate resource file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display <br>
Start Blackbox on the specified display, and set the DISPLAY
environment variable to this value for programs started by
Blackbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTING AND EXITING BLACKBOX
<br>
The most common method for starting Blackbox is to place the
the command &quot;blackbox&quot; (no quotes) at the end of
your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession file. The advantage of
putting <br>
Blackbox at the end of the file is that the X Server will
shutdown when you exit Blackbox. Blackbox can also be
started from the command line of a terminal program like
xterm in <br>
an X session that does not already have a window manager
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On startup, Blackbox will look
for ~/.blackboxrc and use the resource session.menuFile to
determine where to get the menu for the session. If this
file is not found Blackbox <br>
will use /etc/X11/blackbox/blackbox-menu as the menu file.
If that fails as well Blackbox will use a default menu that
contains commands to start an xterm as well as restart and
<br>
exit the window manager. The other resources available in
the ~/.blackboxrc file are discussed later in this manual
under the heading RESOURCE FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On exit, Blackbox writes its
current configuration to ~/.blackboxrc. <br>
NOTE: <br>
If ~/.blackboxrc is modified during a Blackbox <br>
session, Blackbox must be restarted with the <br>
&quot;restart&quot; command on the main menu or the changes
<br>
will be lost on exit. Restart causes Blackbox to <br>
re-read ~/.blackboxrc and apply the changes immediately.
<br>
Blackbox can be exited by selecting &quot;exit&quot; on the
main menu (discussed shortly), killing it gently from a
terminal or by the X Window System shutdown hot key combo
<br>
Ctrl+Alt+BackSpace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING BLACKBOX <br>
A three button mouse has the following functions when
clicking on the root window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Two (Middle Button) <br>
Open workspace menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Three (Right Button) <br>
Open main menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that Button One (Left
Button) is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Main Menu <br>
The default installation assumes you have a number of common
X Window System programs in their typical locations. The
default menu is defined by a plain text file named <br>
&rsquo;menu&rsquo;. It is heavily commented and covers a
number of details of menu file syntax. This file can also be
edited graphically by using the extension program bbconf
which <br>
makes menu creation very easy. Menu file syntax is discussed
later in this manual. <br>
Caveat: <br>
Menus can run arbitrary command lines, but <br>
if you wish to use a complex command line <br>
it is best to place it in a shell script. <br>
Remember to put #!/bin/sh on the first <br>
line and chmod 755 on the file to make it <br>
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Workspace Menu <br>
This menu gives the user control of the workspace system.
The user can create a new workspace, remove the last
workspace or go to an application via either the icon menu
<br>
or a workspace entry. Workspaces are listed by name.
Clicking on the workspace name will take you to that
workspace with focus on the program under the mouse. If
there <br>
are programs already running in the workspace, they will
appear in a pop-out menu. Clicking on the application name
will jump to the workspace and focus that application. <br>
If a middle click is used the window will be brought to the
current workspace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackbox uses an external
program, bbpager, to provide a traditional, graphical paging
interface to the workspace system. Many Blackbox users run
another extension program <br>
- bbkeys - to provide keyboard shortcuts for workspace
control. <br>
Caveat: <br>
To name a workspace the user must right <br>
click on the toolbar, select &quot;Edit current <br>
workspace name,&quot; type the workspace name, <br>
And_Press_Enter to finish. <br>
Workspaces can also be named in the .blackboxrc file as
described in RESOURCES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Slit <br>
The Slit provides a user positionable window for running
utility programs called &quot;dockapps&quot;. To learn more
about dockapps refer to the web sites mentioned in the
Descrip&acirc; <br>
tion. Dockapps automatically run in the slit in most cases,
but may require a special command switch. Often, -w is used
for &quot;withdrawn&quot; into the slit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gkrellm is a very useful and
modern dockapp that gives the user near real time
information on machine performance. Other dockapps include
clocks, notepads, pagers, key <br>
grabbers, fishbowls, fire places and many, many others.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only mouse button three is
captured by the Blackbox slit. This menu allows the user to
change the position of the slit, and sets the state of
Always on top, and Auto hide. <br>
These all do what the user expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caveat: <br>
When starting Dockapps from an external script <br>
a race condition can take place where the shell <br>
rapidly forks all of the dockapps, which then <br>
take varied and random times to draw themselves <br>
for the first time. To get the dockapps to start <br>
in a given order, follow each dockapp with <br>
sleep 2; This ensures that each dockapp is placed <br>
in the correct order by the slit. <br>
i.e. <br>
#!/bin/sh <br>
speyes -w &amp; sleep 2 <br>
gkrellm -w &amp; sleep 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Toolbar <br>
The toolbar provides an alternate method for cycling through
multiple workspaces and applications. The left side of the
toolbar is the workspace control, the center is the <br>
application control, and the right side is a clock. The
format of the clock can be controlled as described under
RESOURCES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse button 3 raises a menu
that allows configuration of the toolbar. It can be
positioned either at the top or the bottom of the screen and
can be set to auto hide <br>
and/or to always be on top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caveat: <br>
The toolbar is a permanent fixture. It <br>
can only be removed by modifying the source and <br>
rebuilding, which is beyond the scope of this <br>
document. Setting the toolbar to auto hide is <br>
the next best thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Window Decorations <br>
Window decorations include handles at the bottom of each
window, a title bar, and three control buttons. The handles
at the bottom of the window are divided into three <br>
sections. The two corner sections are resizing handles The
center section is a window moving handle. The bottom center
handle and the title bar respond to a number of <br>
mouse clicks and key + mouse click combinations. The three
buttons in the title bar, left to right, are iconify,
maximize, and close. The resize button has special
behav&acirc; <br>
ior detailed below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button One (Left Button) <br>
Click and drag on titlebar to move or resize from bottom
corners. Click the iconify button to move the window to the
icon list. Click the maximize button to fully maxi&acirc;
<br>
mize the window. Click the close button to close the window
and application. Double-Click the title bar to shade the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt + Button One <br>
Click anywhere on client window and drag to move the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Two (Middle Button) <br>
Click the titlebar to lower the window. Click the maximize
button to maximize the window vertically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button Three (Right Button) <br>
Click on title bar or bottom center handle pulls down a
control menu. Click the maximize button to maximize the
window horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt + Button Three <br>
Click anywhere on client window and drag to resize the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The control menu contains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send To ... <br>
Button One (Left Button) <br>
Click to send this window to another workspace. <br>
Button Two (Middle Button) <br>
Click to send this window to another workspace, change <br>
to that workspace and keep the application focused. <br>
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shade This is the same action as
Double-Click with Button One.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Iconify <br>
Hide the window. It can be accessed with the icon menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maximize <br>
Toggle window maximization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raise Bring window to the front
above the other windows and <br>
focus it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lower Drop the window below the
other ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stick Stick this window to the
glass on the inside of <br>
the monitor so it does not hide when you change <br>
workspaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill Client <br>
This kills the client program with -SIGKILL (-9) <br>
Only use this as a last resort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close Send a close signal to the
client application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STYLES <br>
Styles are a collection of colors, fonts, and textures that
control the appearance of Blackbox. These characteristics
are recorded in style files. The default system style files
<br>
are located in /usr/share/blackbox/styles. The menu system
will identify the style by its filename, and styles can be
sorted into different directories at the user&rsquo;s
discretion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are over 700 styles
available for Blackbox. The official distribution point for
Blackbox styles is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://blackbox.themes.org/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All themes should install by
simply downloading them to ~/.blackbox/ then unzip it, and
de-tar it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On open Unixes this will be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar zxvf stylename.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On commercial Unixes this will
be something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gunzip stylename.tar.gz
&amp;&amp; tar xvf stylename.tar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check your system manuals for
specifics or check with your network administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An entry should appear in the
styles menu immediately. <br>
Security Warning <br>
Style files can execute shell scripts and other <br>
executables. It would is wise to check the <br>
rootCommand in the style file and make sure that <br>
it is benign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Things that go wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The theme is pre Blackbox
0.51. <br>
Style file syntax changed with version 0.51</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The style tarball was
formatted incorrectly. <br>
Some styles use the directories ~/.blackbox/Backgrounds and
~/.blackbox/Styles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can fixed by adding a
[stylemenu] (~/.blackbox/Styles) to your menu file. To be a
complete purist, hack the style file with the correct paths
and move the files into <br>
the correct directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The rootCommmand line is
broken. <br>
The rootCommand line in the style file will run an arbitrary
executable. It is important that this executable be set to
bsetbg to maintain portability between systems with <br>
different graphics software. In addition bsetbg can execute
a shell script and do it in a portable fashion as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The documented method for
creating styles is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Create or acquire the
background for the style if <br>
it will not be using bsetroot to draw a patterned background
for the root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: <br>
Blackbox runs on a wide variety <br>
of systems ranging from PCs with 640x480 256 color <br>
displays to ultra high speed workstations with 25&quot; <br>
screens and extreme resolution. For best results a <br>
style graphic should be at least 1024x768.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Create a style file. <br>
The best way to do this is to make a copy of a similar style
and then edit it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The style file is a list of X
resources and other external variables. Manipulating these
variables allows users to completely change the appearance
of Blackbox. The user <br>
can also change the root window image by using the wrapper
program bsetbg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsetbg knows how to use a number
of programs to set the root window image. This makes styles
much more portable since various platforms have different
graphics software. <br>
For more info see bsetbg (1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Background images should be
placed in <br>
~/.blackbox/backgrounds The style file should be placed in
~/.blackbox/styles any other information about the style
should be placed in ~/.blackbox/about/STYLE_NAME/. <br>
This would include README files, licenses, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous versions of Blackbox
put backgrounds and styles in different directories. The
directories listed above are the only officially supported
directories. However you <br>
may put them whereever you like as long as you update your
menu file so it knows where to find your styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. To create a consistent
experience and to ensure <br>
portability between all systems it is important to use the
following format to create your style archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first create a new directory
named after your style NEW_STYLE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this directory create the
directories <br>
backgrounds <br>
styles <br>
about/NEW_STYLE <br>
Next put everything for the theme in these locations.
Finally type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar cvzf NEW_STYLE.tar.gz *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using commercial Unix
you may need to use gzip and tar separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now when a user downloads a new
style file she knows that all she has to do is put the
tarball in her Blackbox directory, unzip-&gt;un-tar it and
then click on it in her <br>
style menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Style File Syntax and
Details</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By far the easiest way to create
a new style is to use bbconf. bbconf allows complete control
of every facet of style files and gives immediate updates of
the current <br>
style as changes are made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The style file format is not
currently documented in a man page. There is a readme
document included with the Blackbox source containing this
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU FILE <br>
The default menu file is installed in
/etc/X11/blackbox/blackbox-menu. This menu can be customized
as a system default menu or the user can create a personal
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create a personal menu copy
the default menu to a file in your home directory. Then,
open ~/.blackboxrc and add or modify the resource
session.menuFile: ~/.blackbox/menu</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, edit the new menu file.
This can be done during a Blackbox session and the menu will
automatically be updated when the code checks for file
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default menu included with
Blackbox has numerous comments describing the use of all
menu commands. Menu commands follow this general form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[command] (label|filename)
{shell command|filename}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blackbox menu commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># string... <br>
Hash (or pound or number sign) is used as the comment
delimiter. It can be used as a full line comment or as an
end of line comment after a valid command statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[begin] (string) <br>
This tag is used only once at the beginning of the menu
file. &quot;string&quot; is the name or description used at
the top of the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[end] <br>
This tag is used at the end of the menu file and at the end
of a submenu block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[exec] (label string) {command
string} <br>
This is a very flexible tag that allows the user to run an
arbitrary shell command including shell scripts. If a
command is too large to type on the command line by hand
<br>
it is best to put it in a shell script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[nop] (label string) <br>
This tag is used to put a divider in the menu. label string
is an optional description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[submenu] (submenu name) {title
string} <br>
This creates a sub-menu with the name submenu name and if
given, the string title string will be the title of the pop
up menu itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[include] (filename) <br>
This command inserts filename into the menu file at the
point at which it is called. filename should not contain a
begin end pair. This feature can be used to include the <br>
system menu or include a piece of menu that is updated by a
separate program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[stylesdir] (description) (path)
<br>
Causes Blackbox to search path for style files. Blackbox
lists styles in the menu by their file name as returned by
the OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[stylesmenu] (description)
{path} <br>
This command creates a submenu with the name description
with the contents of path. By creating a submenu and then
populating it with stylesmenu entries the user can
cre&acirc; <br>
ate an organized library of styles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[workspaces] (description) <br>
Inserts a link into the main menu to the workspace menu. If
used, description is an optional description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[config] (label) <br>
This command causes Blackbox to insert a menu that gives the
user control over focus models, dithering and other system
preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[reconfig] (label) {shell
command} <br>
The reconfig command causes Blackbox to reread its
configuration files. This does not include ~/.blackboxrc
which is only reread when Blackbox is restarted. If shell
com&acirc; <br>
mand is included Blackbox will run this command or shell
script before rereading the files. This can be used to
switch between multiple configurations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[restart] (label) {shell
command} <br>
This command is actually an exit command that defaults to
restarting Blackbox. If provided shell command is run
instead of Blackbox. This can be used to change versions of
<br>
Blackbox. Not that you would ever want to do this but, it
could also be used to start a different window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[exit] (label) <br>
Shuts down Blackbox. If Blackbox is the last command in your
~/.xinitrc file, this action will also shutdown X. <br>
Here is a working example of a menu file: <br>
[begin] (MenuName) <br>
[exec] (xterm) {xterm -ls -bg black -fg green} <br>
[submenu] (X utilities) <br>
[exec] (xcalc) {xcalc} <br>
[end] <br>
[submenu] (styles) <br>
[stylesmenu] (built-in styles) {/usr/share/blackbox/styles}
<br>
[stylesmenu] (custom styles) {~/.blackbox/styles} <br>
[end] <br>
[workspaces] (workspace list) <br>
[config] (configure) <br>
[reconfig] (config play desktop) {play-config-blackbox} <br>
[reconfig] (config work desktop) {work-config-blackbox} <br>
[restart] (start Blackbox beta 7) {blackbox-beta7} <br>
[restart] (start Blackbox cvs) {blackbox-cvs} <br>
[restart] (restart) <br>
[exit] (exit) <br>
[end]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCE FILE <br>
$HOME/.blackboxrc These options are stored in the
~/.blackboxrc file. They control various features of
Blackbox and most can be set from menus. Some of these can
only be set by <br>
editing .blackboxrc directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: Blackbox only reads this
file during start up. To make changes take effect during a
Blackbox session the user must choose &quot;restart&quot; on
the main menu. If you do not do so, <br>
your changes will be lost when Blackbox exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some resources are named with a
&lt;num&gt; after screen. This should be replaced with the
number of the screen that is being configured. The default
is 0 (zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu Configurable (Slit Menu):
<br>
Right click (button 3) on the slit border.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.placement
SEE BELOW <br>
Determines the position of the slit. Certain combinations of
slit.placement with slit.direction are not terribly useful,
i.e. TopCenter with Vertical direction puts the slit <br>
through the middle of your screen. Certainly some will think
that is cool if only to be different... <br>
Default is CenterLeft. <br>
[ TopLeft | TopCenter | TopRight | <br>
CenterLeft | | CenterRight | <br>
BottomLeft | BottomCenter | BottomRight ]</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.direction
[Horizontal|Vertical] <br>
Determines the direction of the slit. <br>
Default is Vertical.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.onTop
[True|False] <br>
Determines whether the slit is always visible over windows
or if the focused window can hide the slit. <br>
Default is True.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.slit.autoHide
[True|False] <br>
Determines whether the slit hides when not in use. The
session.autoRaiseDelay time determines how long you must
hover to get the slit to raise and how long it stays visible
<br>
after mouse out. <br>
Default is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu Configurable (Main
Menu):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.focusModel
SEE BELOW <br>
Sloppy focus (mouse focus) is the conventional X Window
behavior and can be modified with AutoRaise or
Click-Raise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AutoRaise causes the window to
automatically raise after session.autoRaiseDelay
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickRaise causes the window to
raise if you click anywhere inside the client area of the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sloppy focus alone requires a
click on the titlebar, border or lower grip to raise the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ClickToFocus requires a click on
a Blackbox decoration or in the client area to focus and
raise the window. ClickToFocus cannot be modified by
AutoRaise or ClickRaise. <br>
Default is SloppyFocus <br>
[SloppyFocus [[AutoRaise &amp; ClickRaise] | <br>
[AutoRaise | ClickRaise]] | <br>
ClickToFocus]</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.windowPlacement
SEE BELOW <br>
RowSmartPlacement tries to fit new windows in empty space by

[True|False] <br>
When this resource is enabled, turning on scroll lock keeps
Blackbox from grabbing the Alt and Ctrl keys that it
normally uses for mouse controls. This feature allows users
of <br>
drawing and modeling programs which use keystrokes to modify
mouse actions to maintain their sanity. *NOTE* this has _no_
affect on bbkeys. If you need bbkeys to also behave <br>
this way it has a similar option in its config file. Refer
to the bbkeys manpage for details. <br>
Default is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.screen&lt;num&gt;.edgeSnapThreshold
[integer] <br>
When set to 0 this turns off edge snap. When set to one or
greater edge snap will cause a window that is being moved to
snap to the nearest screen edge, the slit, or or the <br>
toolbar. Windows will not snap to each other. The value
represents a number in pixels which is the distance between
the window and a screen edge which is required before the
<br>
window is snapped to the screen edge. If you prefer this
functionality values between 6 - 10 work nicely. <br>
Default value is 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.menuFile [filepath] <br>

will cache unused decorations. <br>
Default is 5 minutes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">session.cacheMax [integer] <br>

the X server for storing decorations. Increasing this number
may enhance your performance if you have plenty of
mem&acirc; <br>
ory and use lots of different windows. <br>
Default is 200 Kilobytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>

Sean Shaleh Perry &lt;shaleh@debian.org&gt; is the current
maintainer and is actively working together with Brad to
keep Blackbox up-to-date and stable as a rock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Brad Hughes
&lt;bhughes@trolltech.com&gt; originally designed and coded
Blackbox in 1997 with the intent of creating a memory
efficient window manager with no dependencies on external
<br>
libraries. Brad&rsquo;s original idea has become a popular
alternative to other window managers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jeff Raven
&lt;jraven@psu.edu&gt; then picked up the torch for the
0.61.x series after Brad took a full time job at
TrollTech.</p>
