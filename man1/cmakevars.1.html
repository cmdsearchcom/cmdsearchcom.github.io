<p>cmakevars(1) General Commands Manual cmakevars(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cmakevars - Reference of CMake variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE
INFORMATION <br>
variables defined by cmake, that give information about the
project, and cmake</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_AR <br>
Name of archiving tool for static libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the name of the
program that creates archive or static libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_ARGC <br>
Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run in -P script mode,
CMake sets this variable to the number of command line
arguments. See also CMAKE_ARGV0, 1, 2 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_ARGV0 <br>
Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run in -P script mode,
CMake sets this variable to the first command line argument.
It then also sets CMAKE_ARGV1, CMAKE_ARGV2, ... and so on,
up to the number of <br>
command line arguments given. See also CMAKE_ARGC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_BINARY_DIR <br>
The path to the top level of the build tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the full path to the top
level of the current CMake build tree. For an in-source
build, this would be the same as CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL <br>
Tool used for the actual build process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable is set to the
program that will be needed to build the output of CMake. If
the generator selected was Visual Studio 6, the
CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL will be set to <br>
msdev, for Unix Makefiles it will be set to make or gmake,
and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv. For NMake
Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding
<br>
special flags and commands based on the final build
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR <br>
The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the full path to the
directory that has the CMakeCache.txt file in it. This is
the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION <br>
Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This stores the major version of
CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different
when a different version of CMake is run on a previously
created cache file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION <br>
Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This stores the minor version of
CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different
when a different version of CMake is run on a previously
created cache file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION <br>
Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This stores the patch version of
CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different
when a different version of CMake is run on a previously
created cache file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR <br>
Build-time reference to per-configuration output
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For native build systems
supporting multiple configurations in the build tree (such
as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference to a
build-time variable specify&acirc; <br>
ing the name of the per-configuration output subdirectory.
On Makefile generators this evaluates to &quot;.&quot;
because there is only one configuration in a build tree.
Example <br>
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(IntDir) = Visual Studio 6 <br>
$(OutDir) = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9 <br>
$(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10 <br>
$(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode <br>
. = Make-based tools</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since these values are evaluated
by the native build system, this variable is suitable only
for use in command lines that will be evaluated at build
time. Example of <br>
intended usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
<br>
add_custom_command( <br>
OUTPUT out.txt <br>
COMMAND
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool <br>
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt <br>
DEPENDS mytool in.txt <br>
) <br>
add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no
longer necessary for this purpose but has been left for
compatibility with existing projects. Instead
add_custom_command() recognizes <br>
executable target names in its COMMAND option, so
&quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool&quot;
can be replaced by just &quot;mytool&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable is read-only.
Setting it is undefined behavior. In multi-configuration
build systems the value of this variable is passed as the
value of preprocessor sym&acirc; <br>
bol &quot;CMAKE_INTDIR&quot; to the compilation of all
source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_COMMAND <br>
The full path to the cmake executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the full path to the
CMake executable cmake which is useful from custom commands
that want to use the cmake -E option for portable system
commands. (e.g. <br>
/usr/local/bin/cmake</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING <br>
Is CMake currently cross compiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable will be set to
true by CMake if CMake is cross compiling. Specifically if
the build platform is different from the target
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND <br>
Full path to ctest command installed with cmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the full path to the
CTest executable ctest which is useful from custom commands
that want to use the cmake -E option for portable system
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR <br>
The path to the binary directory currently being
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This the full path to the build
directory that is currently being processed by cmake. Each
directory added by add_subdirectory will create a binary
directory in the build <br>
tree, and as it is being processed this variable will be
set. For in-source builds this is the current source
directory being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR <br>
Full directory of the listfile currently being
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As CMake processes the listfiles
in your project this variable will always be set to the
directory where the listfile which is currently being
processed (CMAKE_CUR&acirc; <br>
RENT_LIST_FILE) is located. The value has dynamic scope.
When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it
sets this variable to the directory where this file is <br>
located. When CMake finishes processing commands from the
file it restores the previous value. Therefore the value of
the variable inside a macro or function is the <br>
directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the
call stack, not the directory of the file containing the
macro or function definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE <br>
Full path to the listfile currently being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As CMake processes the listfiles
in your project this variable will always be set to the one
currently being processed. The value has dynamic scope. When
CMake starts <br>
processing commands in a source file it sets this variable
to the location of the file. When CMake finishes processing
commands from the file it restores the previous <br>
value. Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
function is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the
call stack, not the file containing the macro or <br>
function definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also
CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE <br>
The line number of the current file being processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the line number of the
file currently being processed by cmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR <br>
The path to the source directory currently being
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This the full path to the source
directory that is currently being processed by cmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_DL_LIBS <br>
Name of library containing dlopen and dlcose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the library that has
dlopen and dlclose in it, usually -ldl on most UNIX
machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND <br>
Full path to cmake-gui or ccmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the full path to the
CMake executable that can graphically edit the cache. For
example, cmake-gui, ccmake, or cmake -i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX <br>
The suffix for executables on this platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The suffix to use for the end of
an executable filename if any, .exe on Windows.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_&lt;LANG&gt;
overrides this for language &lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR <br>
The extra generator used to build the project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the Eclipse,
CodeBlocks or KDevelop generators, CMake generates Makefiles
(CMAKE_GENERATOR) and additionally project files for the
respective IDE. This IDE <br>
project file generator is stored in CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
(e.g. &quot;Eclipse CDT4&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
<br>
Additional suffixes for shared libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extensions for shared libraries
other than that specified by CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, if
any. CMake uses this to recognize external shared library
files during analy&acirc; <br>
sis of libraries linked by a target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_GENERATOR <br>
The generator used to build the project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the generator that
is being used to generate the build files. (e.g. &quot;Unix
Makefiles&quot;, &quot;Visual Studio 6&quot;, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET <br>
Native build system toolset name specified by user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some CMake generators support a
toolset name to be given to the native build system to
choose a compiler. If the user specifies a toolset name
(e.g. via the cmake -T <br>
option) the value will be available in this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY <br>
Path to top of source tree.</p>

Full path to the CMake file that included the current
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While processing a CMake file
loaded by include() or find_package() this variable contains
the full path to the file including it. The top of the
include stack is always <br>
the CMakeLists.txt for the current directory. See also
CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION <br>
The patch version of cmake (i.e. the 3 in X.X.3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the patch version
of the CMake executable being run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME <br>

current project from the closest inherited PROJECT
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_RANLIB <br>
Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies name of the
program that randomizes libraries on UNIX, not used on
Windows, but may be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_ROOT <br>
Install directory for running cmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the install root for the
running CMake and the Modules directory can be found here.
This is commonly used in this format:
${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE <br>
Full path to the -P script file currently being
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When run in -P script mode,
CMake sets this variable to the full path of the script
file. When run to configure a CMakeLists.txt file, this
variable is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX <br>
The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The prefix to use for the name

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P <br>
Size of a void pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is set to the size of a
pointer on the machine, and is determined by a try compile.
If a 64 bit size is found, then the library search path is
modified to look for 64 <br>
bit libraries first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH <br>
If true, do not add run time path information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is set to TRUE, then the
rpath information is not added to compiled executables. The
default is to add rpath information if the platform supports
it. This allows <br>
for easy running from the build tree. To omit RPATH in the
install step, but not the build step, use
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR <br>
The path to the top level of the source tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the full path to the top
level of the current CMake source tree. For an in-source

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION <br>
The tweak version of cmake (i.e. the 1 in X.X.X.1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the tweak version
of the CMake executable being run. Releases use tweak &lt;
20000000 and development versions use the date format
CCYYMMDD for the tweak <br>
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE <br>
Create verbose makefiles if on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable defaults to false.

format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies the full version
of the CMake executable being run. This variable is defined
by versions 2.6.3 and higher. See variables
CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION, <br>
CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION, CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION, and
CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION for individual version components. The
[-id] component appears in non-release versions and may be
arbi&acirc; <br>
trary text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET <br>
Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VS 10 and above use MSBuild
under the hood and support multiple compiler toolchains.
CMake may specify a toolset explicitly, such as
&quot;v110&quot; for VS 11 or &quot;Windows7.1SDK&quot; <br>
for 64-bit support in VS 10 Express. CMake provides the name
of the chosen toolset in this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
<br>
Xcode compiler selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xcode supports selection of a
compiler from one of the installed toolsets. CMake provides
the name of the chosen toolset in this variable, if any is
explicitly selected <br>
(e.g. via the cmake -T option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROJECT_BINARY_DIR <br>
Full path to build directory for project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the binary directory of
the most recent PROJECT command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the name given to the
most recent PROJECT command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR <br>
Top level source directory for the current project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the source directory of
the most recent PROJECT command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Project name]_BINARY_DIR <br>
Top level binary directory for the named project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variable is created with the
name used in the PROJECT command, and is the binary
directory for the project. This can be useful when SUBDIR is
used to connect several <br>
projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Project name]_SOURCE_DIR <br>
Top level source directory for the named project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variable is created with the
name used in the PROJECT command, and is the source
directory for the project. This can be useful when
add_subdirectory is used to connect <br>
several projects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
<br>
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS <br>
Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries
if on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If present and true, this will
cause all libraries to be built shared unless the library
was explicitly added as a static library. This variable is
often added to <br>
projects as an OPTION so that each user of a project can
decide if they want to build the project using shared or
static libraries.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
<br>
List of files which have been installed using an ABSOLUTE
DESTINATION path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable is defined by
CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake scripts. It can be used
(read-only) by programs or scripts that source those install
scripts. This is used <br>
by some CPack generators (e.g. RPM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE <br>
Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, automoc behaves
exactly as described in the documentation of the AUTOMOC
target property. When set to TRUE, it accepts more input and
tries to find the cor&acirc; <br>
rect input file for moc even if it differs from the
documented behaviour. In this mode it e.g. also checks
whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc
when a <br>
&quot;foo.moc&quot; file has been included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relaxed mode has to be enabled
for KDE4 compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
<br>
Version of cmake required to build project</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From the point of view of
backwards compatibility, this specifies what version of
CMake should be supported. By default this value is the
version number of CMake that you <br>
are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake
to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that
were written to use older versions of CMake. This can <br>
be set by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE <br>
Specifies the build type on single-configuration
generators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This statically specifies what
build type (configuration) will be built in this build tree.
Possible values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo
and MinSizeRel. This <br>
variable is only meaningful to single-configuration
generators (such as make and Ninja) i.e. those which choose
a single configuration when CMake runs to generate a build
<br>
tree as opposed to multi-configuration generators which
offer selection of the build configuration within the
generated build environment. There are many per-config
prop&acirc; <br>
erties and variables (usually following clean
SOME_VAR_&lt;CONFIG&gt; order conventions), such as
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_&lt;CONFIG&gt;, specified as uppercase: <br>
CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL]. For
example, in a build tree configured to build type Debug,
CMake will see to having CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG set&acirc; <br>
tings get added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS settings. See also
CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE <br>
Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When enabled, the generated
Makefiles will produce colored output. Default is ON.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES <br>
Specifies the available build types on multi-config
generators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies what build types
(configurations) will be available such as Debug, Release,
RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable defaults on most
platforms, but can be <br>
extended to provide other build types. See also
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for details of managing configuration data,
and CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
<br>
Enables tracing output for target properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable can be populated
with a list of properties to generate debug output for when
evaluating target properties. Currently it can only be used
when evaluating the <br>
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, COMPILE_DEFINITIONS and COMPILE_OPTIONS
target properties. In that case, it outputs a backtrace for
each entry in the target property. Default is <br>
unset.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;
<br>
Variable for disabling find_package() calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every non-REQUIRED
find_package() call in a project can be disabled by setting
the variable CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_&lt;PackageName&gt;
to TRUE. This can be used to build a <br>
project without an optional package, although that package
is installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This switch should be used
during the initial CMake run. Otherwise if the package has
already been found in a previous CMake run, the variables
which have been stored in <br>
the cache will still be there. In that case it is
recommended to remove the cache variables for this package
from the cache using the cache editor or cmake -U</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED <br>
Whether to issue deprecation errors for macros and
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If TRUE, this can be used by
macros and functions to issue fatal errors when deprecated
macros or functions are used. This variable is FALSE by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
<br>
Ask cmake_install.cmake script to error out as soon as a
file with absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fatal error is emitted
before the installation of the offending file takes place.
This variable is used by CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake
scripts. If one sets <br>
this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
fatal error messages from the script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES <br>
Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies what prefixes to
add to library names when the find_library command looks for
libraries. On UNIX systems this is typically lib, meaning
that when trying to <br>
find the foo library it will look for libfoo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES <br>
Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This specifies what suffixes to
add to library names when the find_library command looks for
libraries. On Windows systems this is typically .lib and
.dll, meaning that <br>
when trying to find the foo library it will look for foo.dll
etc.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
<br>
Tell find_package to warn if called without an explicit
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If find_package is called
without an explicit mode option (MODULE, CONFIG or
NO_MODULE) and no Find&lt;pkg&gt;.cmake module is in
CMAKE_MODULE_PATH then CMake implicitly assumes <br>
that the caller intends to search for a package
configuration file. If no package configuration file is
found then the wording of the failure message must account
for <br>
both the case that the package is really missing and the
case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the
intended Find module. If instead the caller specifies <br>
an explicit mode option then the failure message can be more
specific.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set
CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE to TRUE to tell
find_package to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.
This helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode <br>
in all calls to find_package within a project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH <br>
Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies directories to be
ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful
in cross-compiled environments where some system directories
contain incompatible <br>
but possibly linkable libraries. For example, on
cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to
ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end <br>
machine that modules like FindX11 (and others) would
normally search. By default this is empty; it is intended to
be set by the project. Note that CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH <br>
takes a list of directory names, NOT a list of prefixes. If
you want to ignore paths under prefixes (bin, include, lib,
etc.), you&rsquo;ll need to specify them explicitly. See
<br>
also CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used both by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will
check each of the contained directories for the existence of
the file which is <br>
currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended
to be set by the project. See also
CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
<br>
Default component used in install() commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an install() command is used
without the COMPONENT argument, these files will be grouped
into a default component. The name of this default install
component will be <br>
taken from this variable. It defaults to
&quot;Unspecified&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX <br>
Install directory used by install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;make install&quot; is
invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is prepended
onto all install directories. This variable defaults to
/usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program <br>
Files on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On UNIX one can use the DESTDIR
mechanism in order to relocate the whole installation.
DESTDIR means DESTination DIRectory. It is commonly used by
makefile users in order <br>
to install software at non-default location. It is usually
invoked like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make DESTDIR=/home/john
install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will install the concerned
software using the installation prefix, e.g.
&quot;/usr/local&quot; prepended with the DESTDIR value
which finally gives &quot;/home/john/usr/local&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: DESTDIR may not be used
on Windows because installation prefix usually contains a
drive letter like in &quot;C:/Program Files&quot; which
cannot be prepended with some <br>
other prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The installation prefix is also
added to CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH so that find_package,
find_program, find_library, find_path, and find_file will
search the prefix for <br>
other software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used by FIND_LIBRARY(). FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of
the contained directories for the existence of the library
which is currently <br>
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_MFC_FLAG <br>
Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be set in a
CMakeLists.txt file and will enable MFC in the application.
It should be set to 1 for the static MFC library, and 2 for
the shared MFC library. This <br>
is used in Visual Studio 6 and 7 project files. The
CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL) <br>
set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2) <br>
add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_MODULE_PATH <br>
List of directories to search for CMake modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands like include() and
find_package() search for files in directories listed by
this variable before checking the default modules that come
with CMake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
<br>
Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an internal flag used by
the generators in CMake to tell CMake to skip the
_BUILD_TYPE flags.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;
<br>
Default for CMake Policy CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; when it is
otherwise left unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION) and cmake_policy(VERSION) by
default leave policies introduced after the given version
unset. Set CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt; <br>
to OLD or NEW to specify the default for policy
CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;, where &lt;NNNN&gt; is the policy
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable should not be set
by a project in CMake code; use cmake_policy(SET) instead.
Users running CMake may set this variable in the cache (e.g.
-DCMAKE_POL&acirc; <br>
ICY_DEFAULT_CMP&lt;NNNN&gt;=&lt;OLD|NEW&gt;) to set a policy
not otherwise set by the project. Set to OLD to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to NEW to try
building <br>
the project with new behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate
suffixes added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It contains the
&quot;base&quot; directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append
appropriate subdirectories to the base <br>
directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the
directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each
of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() <br>
append /include . By default it is empty, it is intended to
be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PRO&acirc;
<br>
GRAM_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PROGRAM() will check each of
the contained directories for the existence of the program
which is currently <br>
searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set
by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
<br>
Don&rsquo;t make the install target depend on the all
target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the
&quot;install&quot; target depends on the &quot;all&quot;
target. This has the effect, that when &quot;make
install&quot; is invoked or INSTALL is built, first the
&quot;all&quot; target is <br>
built, then the installation starts. If
CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE, this
dependency is not created, so the installation process will
start immedi&acirc; <br>
ately, independent from whether the project has been
completely built or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH <br>
Path to be ignored by FIND_XXX() commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies directories to be
ignored by searches in FIND_XXX() commands. This is useful
in cross-compiled environments where some system directories
contain incompatible <br>
but possibly linkable libraries. For example, on
cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to
ignore directories containing libraries meant for the
front-end <br>

directories containing incompatible binaries for the host
system. <br>
See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH,
CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, and
CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used both by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will
check each of the contained directories for the existence of
the file which is <br>
currently searched. By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be
modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for <br>
this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used by FIND_LIBRARY(). FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of
the contained directories for the existence of the library
which is currently <br>
searched. By default it contains the standard directories
for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by
the project, use CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See <br>
also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be
used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It contains the
&quot;base&quot; directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append
appropriate subdirectories to the base <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH <br>
Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifies a path which will be

also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
<br>
Specify a CMake file that overrides platform
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMake loads the specified file
while enabling support for each language from either the
project() or enable_language() commands. It is loaded after
CMake&rsquo;s builtin com&acirc; <br>
piler and platform information modules have been loaded but
before the information is used. The file may set platform
information variables to override CMake&rsquo;s
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is intended for use
only in overriding information variables that must be set
before CMake builds its first test project to check that the
compiler for a lan&acirc; <br>
guage works. It should not be used to load a file in cases
that a normal include() will work. Use it only as a last
resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any other <br>
way. For example, one may set CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT to change
the default value used to initialize CMAKE_C_FLAGS before it
is cached. The override file should NOT be used <br>
to set anything that could be set after languages are
enabled, such as variables like
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY that affect the placement of
binaries. Information <br>
set in the file will be used for try_compile and try_run
builds too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED <br>
Whether to issue deprecation warnings for macros and
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If TRUE, this can be used by
macros and functions to issue deprecation warnings. This
variable is FALSE by default.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
<br>
Ask cmake_install.cmake script to warn each time a file with
absolute INSTALL DESTINATION is encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable is used by
CMake-generated cmake_install.cmake scripts. If one sets
this variable to ON while running the script, it may get
warning messages from the <br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE

the host system instead of the target system when cross
compiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME <br>
Name of the OS CMake is running on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME

CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE as detected for one
of the enabled languages.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
<br>
Regex matching possible target architecture library
directory names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is used to detect
CMAKE_&lt;lang&gt;_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE from the implicit
linker search path by matching the &lt;arch&gt; name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX <br>
Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMake computes for every source
file an object file name that is unique to the source file
and deterministic with respect to the full path to the
source file. This allows <br>
multiple source files in a target to share the same name if
they lie in different directories without rebuilding when
one is added or removed. However, it can produce <br>
long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file
exceeds a limit. CMake has a built-in limit for <br>
each platform that is sufficient for common tools, but some
native tools may have a lower limit. This variable may be
set to specify the limit explicitly. The value must <br>
be an integer no less than 128.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM <br>
Name of system cmake is compiling for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This variable is the composite
of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this

CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION is not set, <br>
then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME <br>
Name of the OS CMake is building for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the name of the

Windows, and Darwin for Mac OS X are the values found on the
big three operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR <br>
The name of the CPU CMake is building for.</p>

this variable is set to the output of uname -p, on windows
it is set to the value of the environment variable
PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION <br>
OS version CMake is building for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A numeric version string for the

information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
<br>
Use the install path for the RPATH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally CMake uses the build
tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems
that use RPATH. When the software is installed the
executables etc are relinked <br>
by CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set
to true then the software is always built with the install
path for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked <br>
when installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH <br>
Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on
installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an ELF binary needs to have
a different RPATH after installation than it does in the
build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change the RPATH
in the installed <br>
copy. If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink
the binary before installation instead of using its builtin
editor.</p>

generated build system supports multiple configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS <br>
Use relative paths (May not work!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is set to TRUE, then
CMake will use relative paths between the source and binary

<br>
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMake does not explicitly

<br>
Implicit linker search path detected for language
&lt;LANG&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilers typically pass
directories containing language runtime libraries and
default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
These paths are implicit linker <br>
search directories for the compiler&rsquo;s language. CMake
automatically detects these directories for each language
and reports the results in this variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a library in one of these
directories is given by full path to target_link_libraries()
CMake will generate the -l&lt;name&gt; form on link lines to
ensure the linker <br>
searches its implicit directories for the library. Note that
some toolchains read implicit directories from an
