<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xdmshell - shell for starting xdm on login</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/bin/xdmshell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Xdmshell can be used on systems that are configured to start
a console in text mode by default, to allow users to start
the X display manager by logging in as a special user with
<br>
the shell set to the xdmshell program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many servers set the keyboard to
do non-blocking I/O under the assumption that they are the
only programs attempting to read from the keyboard.
Unfortunately, some versions of <br>
getty(8) will immediately see a continuous stream of
zero-length reads which they interpret as end-of-file
indicators. Eventually, init(8) will disable logins on that
line until <br>
somebody types the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some platforms, one
alternative is to disable logins on the console and always
run xdm(1) from /etc/inittab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another approach is to set up an
account whose shell is the xdmshell program found in the xdm
distribution. This program is not installed by default so
that site administrators <br>
will examine it to see if it meets their needs. The xdmshell
utility makes sure that it is being run from the appropriate
type of terminal, starts xdm, waits for it to finish, <br>
and then resets the console if necessary. If the xdm
resources file (specified by the DisplayManager*resources
entry in the xdm-config file) contains a binding to the
abort-dis&acirc; <br>
play action similar to the following <br>
xlogin*login.translations: #override Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;R:
abort-display() <br>
the console can then by restored by pressing the indicated
key (Control-R in the above example) in the xdm login
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xdmshell program is usually
installed setuid to root but executable only by members of a
special group, of which the only member is the account which
has xdmshell as its <br>
shell: <br>
% grep xdm /etc/passwd <br>
x::101:51:Account for starting up X:/tmp:/usr/bin/xdmshell
<br>
% grep 51 /etc/group <br>
xdmgrp:*:51: <br>
% ls -lg /usr/bin/xdmshell <br>
-rws--x--- 1 root xdmgrp 20338 Nov 1 01:32
/usr/bin/xdmshell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the xdm resources have not
been configured to have a key bound to the abort-display()
action, there will be no way for general users to login to
the console directly. Whether <br>
or not this is desirable depends on the particular site.</p>
