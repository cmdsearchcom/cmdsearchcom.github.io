<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ipa-replica-manage - Manage an IPA replica</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ipa-replica-manage [OPTION]... [COMMAND]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Manages the replication agreements of an IPA server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To manage IPA replication
agreements in a domain at domain level 1, use IPA CLI or Web
UI, see &lsquo;ipa help topology&lsquo; for additional
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">connect [SERVER_A]
&lt;SERVER_B&gt; <br>
- Adds a new replication agreement between
SERVER_A/localhost and SERVER_B. At domain level 1
applicable only for winsync agreements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disconnect [SERVER_A]
&lt;SERVER_B&gt; <br>
- Removes a replication agreement between SERVER_A/localhost
and SERVER_B. At domain level 1 applicable only for winsync
agreements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">del &lt;SERVER&gt; <br>
- Removes all replication agreements and data about SERVER.
At domain level 1 it removes data and agreements for both
suffixes - domain and ca.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list [SERVER] <br>
- Lists all the servers or the list of agreements of
SERVER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">re-initialize <br>
- Forces a full re-initialization of the IPA server
retrieving data from the server specified with the --from
option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">force-sync <br>
- Immediately flush any data to be replicated from a server
specified with the --from option</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-ruv <br>
- List the replication IDs on this server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean-ruv [REPLICATION_ID] <br>
- Run the CLEANALLRUV task to remove a replication ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clean-dangling-ruv <br>
- Cleans all RUVs and CS-RUVs that are left in the system
from uninstalled replicas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abort-clean-ruv [REPLICATION_ID]
<br>
- Abort a running CLEANALLRUV task. With --force option the
task does not wait for all the replica servers to have been
sent the abort task, or be online, before complet&acirc;
<br>
ing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list-clean-ruv <br>
- List all running CLEANALLRUV and abort CLEANALLRUV
tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnarange-show [SERVER] <br>
- List the DNA ranges</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnarange-set SERVER START-END
<br>
- Set the DNA range on a master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnanextrange-show [SERVER] <br>
- List the next DNA ranges</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dnanextrange-set SERVER
START-END <br>
- Set the DNA next range on a master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The connect and disconnect
options are used to manage the replication topology. When a
replica is created it is only connected with the master that
created it. The connect option <br>
may be used to connect it to other existing replicas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The disconnect option cannot be
used to remove the last link of a replica. To remove a
replica from the topology use the del option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a replica is deleted and then
re-added within a short time-frame then the 389-ds instance
on the master that created it should be restarted before
re-installing the replica. <br>
The master will have the old service principals cached which
will cause replication to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each IPA master server has a
unique replication ID. This ID is used by 389-ds-base when
storing information about replication status. The output
consists of the masters and their <br>
respective replication ID. See clean-ruv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a master is removed, all
other masters need to remove its replication ID from the
list of masters. Normally this occurs automatically when a
master is deleted with <br>
ipa-replica-manage. If one or more masters was down or
unreachable when ipa-replica-manage was executed then this
replica ID may still exist. The clean-ruv command may be
used to <br>
clean up an unused replication ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: clean-ruv is VERY
DANGEROUS. Execution against the wrong replication ID can
result in inconsistent data on that master. The master
should be re-initialized from another if <br>
this happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The replication topology is
examined when a master is deleted and will attempt to
prevent a master from being orphaned. For example, if your
topology is A &lt;-&gt; B &lt;-&gt; C and you <br>
attempt to delete master B it will fail because that would
leave masters and A and C orphaned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list of masters is stored in
cn=masters,cn=ipa,cn=etc,dc=example,dc=com. This should be
cleaned up automatically when a master is deleted. If it
occurs that you have deleted <br>
the master and all the agreements but these entries still
exist then you will not be able to re-install IPA on it, the
installation will fail with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An IPA master host cannot be
deleted or disabled using standard commands (host-del, for
example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An orphaned master may be
cleaned up using the del directive with the --cleanup
option. This will remove the entries from
cn=masters,cn=ipa,cn=etc that otherwise prevent host-del
<br>
from working, its dna profile, s4u2proxy configuration,
service principals and remove it from the default DUA
profile defaultServerList.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-H HOST, --host=HOST <br>
The IPA server to manage. The default is the machine on
which the command is run Not honoured by the re-initialize
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p DM_PASSWORD,
--password=DM_PASSWORD <br>
The Directory Manager password to use for authentication</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Provide additional information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Ignore some types of errors, don&rsquo;t prompt when
deleting a master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --cleanup <br>
When deleting a master with the --force flag, remove
leftover references to an already deleted master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-lookup <br>
Do not perform DNS lookup checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binddn=ADMIN_DN <br>
Bind DN to use with remote server (default is cn=Directory
Manager) - Be careful to quote this value on the command
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bindpw=ADMIN_PWD <br>
Password for Bind DN to use with remote server (default is
the DM_PASSWORD above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--winsync <br>
Specifies to create/use a Windows Sync Agreement</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cacert=/path/to/cacertfile
<br>
Full path and filename of CA certificate to use with TLS/SSL
to the remote server - this CA certificate will be installed
in the directory server&rsquo;s certificate database</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--win-subtree=cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com
<br>
DN of Windows subtree containing the users you want to sync
(default cn=Users,&lt;domain suffix&gt; - this is typically
what Windows AD uses as the default value) - Be careful <br>
to quote this value on the command line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--passsync=PASSSYNC_PWD <br>
Password for the IPA system user used by the Windows
PassSync plugin to synchronize passwords. Required when
using --winsync. This does not mean you have to use the <br>
PassSync service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--from=SERVER <br>
The server to pull the data from, used by the re-initialize
and force-sync commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANGES <br>
IPA uses the 389-ds Distributed Numeric Assignment (DNA)
Plugin to allocate POSIX ids for users and groups. A range
is created when IPA is installed and half the range is <br>
assigned to the first IPA master for the purposes of
allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New IPA masters do not
automatically get a DNA range assignment. A range assignment
is done only when a user or POSIX group is added on that
master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNA plugin also supports an
&quot;on-deck&quot; or next range configuration. When the
primary range is exhaused, rather than going to another
master to ask for more, it will use its <br>
on-deck range if one is defined. Each master can have only
one range and one on-deck range defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a master is removed an
attempt is made to save its DNA range(s) onto another master
in its on-deck range. IPA will not attempt to extend or
merge ranges. If there are no <br>
available on-deck range slots then this is reported to the
user. The range is effectively lost unless it is manually
merged into the range of another master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DNA range and on-deck (next)
values can be managed using the dnarange-set and
dnanextrange-set commands. The rules for managing these
ranges are: <br>
- The range must be completely contained within a local
range as defined by the ipa idrange command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The range cannot overlap the
DNA range or on-deck range on another IPA master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The range cannot overlap the
ID range of an AD Trust.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The primary DNA range cannot
be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- An on-deck range range can be
removed by setting it to 0-0. The assumption is that the
range will be manually moved or merged elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The range and next range of a
specific master can be displayed by passing the FQDN of that
master to the dnarange-show or dnanextrange-show
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performing range changes as a
delegated administrator (e.g. not using the Directory
Manager password) requires additional 389-ds ACIs. These are
installed in upgraded masters but <br>
not existing ones. The changs are made in cn=config which is
not replicated. The result is that DNA ranges cannot be
managed on non-upgraded masters as a delegated
administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
List all masters: <br>
# ipa-replica-manage list <br>
srv1.example.com: master <br>
srv2.example.com: master <br>
srv3.example.com: master <br>
srv4.example.com: master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List a server&rsquo;s
replication agreements. <br>
# ipa-replica-manage list srv1.example.com <br>
srv2.example.com: replica <br>
srv3.example.com: replica</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Re-initialize a replica: <br>
# ipa-replica-manage re-initialize --from
srv2.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will re-initialize the data
on the server where you execute the command, retrieving the
data from the srv2.example.com replica</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add a new replication agreement:
<br>
# ipa-replica-manage connect srv2.example.com
srv4.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove an existing replication
agreement: <br>
# ipa-replica-manage disconnect srv1.example.com
srv3.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completely remove a replica:
<br>
# ipa-replica-manage del srv4.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using connect/disconnect you can
manage the replication topology.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">List the replication IDs in use:
<br>
# ipa-replica-manage list-ruv <br>
Replica Update Vectors: <br>
srv1.example.com:389: 7 <br>
srv2.example.com:389: 4 <br>
Certificate Server Replica Update Vectors: <br>
srv1.example.com:389: 9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove references to an orphaned
and deleted master: <br>
# ipa-replica-manage del --force --cleanup
master.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINSYNC <br>
Creating a Windows AD Synchronization agreement is similar
to creating an IPA replication agreement, there are just a
couple of extra steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special user entry is created
for the PassSync service. The DN of this entry is
uid=passsync,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,&lt;basedn&gt;. You are
not required to use PassSync to use a Win&acirc; <br>
dows synchronization agreement but setting a password for
the user is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following examples use the
AD administrator account as the synchronization user. This
is not mandatory but the user must have read-access to the
subtree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Transfer the base64-encoded
Windows AD CA Certificate to your IPA Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Remove any existing kerberos
credentials <br>
# kdestroy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Add the winsync replication
agreement <br>
# ipa-replica-manage connect --winsync
--passsync=&lt;bindpwd_for_syncuser_that
will_be_used_for_agreement&gt;
--cacert=/path/to/adscacert/WIN-CA.cer --binddn
&quot;cn=administra&acirc; <br>
tor,cn=users,dc=ad,dc=example,dc=com&quot; --bindpw
&lt;ads_administrator_password&gt; -v
&lt;adserver.fqdn&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will be prompted to supply
the Directory Manager&rsquo;s password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a winsync replication
agreement:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># ipa-replica-manage connect
--winsync --passsync=MySecret --cacert=/root/WIN-CA.cer
--binddn
&quot;cn=administrator,cn=users,dc=ad,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
--bindpw MySecret -v <br>
windows.ad.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove a winsync replication
agreement: <br>
# ipa-replica-manage disconnect windows.ad.example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PASSSYNC <br>
PassSync is a Windows service that runs on AD Domain
Controllers to intercept password changes. It sends these
password changes to the IPA LDAP server over TLS. These
password <br>
changes bypass normal IPA password policy settings and the
password is not set to immediately expire. This is because
by the time IPA receives the password change it has already
<br>
been accepted by AD so it is too late to reject it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPA maintains a list of DNs that
are exempt from password policy. A special user is added
automatically when a winsync replication agreement is
created. The DN of this user is <br>
added to the exemption list stored in passSyncManagersDNs in
the entry cn=ipa_pwd_extop,cn=plugins,cn=config.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 if the command was successful</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 if an error occurred</p>
