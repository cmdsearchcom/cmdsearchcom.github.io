<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
hashdeep - Compute, compare, or audit multiple message
digests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
hashdeep -V | -h <br>
hashdeep [-c &lt;alg1&gt;[,&lt;alg2&gt;]] [-k &lt;file&gt;]
[-i &lt;size&gt;] [-f &lt;file&gt;] [-o &lt;fbcplsde&gt;]

[FILES]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Computes multiple hashes, or message digests, for any number
of files while optionally recursively digging through the
directory structure. By default the program computes MD5
<br>
and SHA-256 hashes, equivalent to -c md5,sha256. Can also
take a list of known hashes and display the filenames of
input files whose hashes either do or do not match any of
the <br>
known hashes. Can also use a list of known hashes to audit a
set of FILES. Errors are reported to standard error. If no
FILES are specified, reads from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c
&lt;alg1&gt;[,&lt;alg2&gt;...] <br>
Computation mode. Compute hashes of FILES using the
algorithms specified. Legal values are md5, sha1, sha256,
tiger, and whirlpool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Load a file of known hashes.
This flag is required when using any of the matching or
audit modes (i.e. -m, -x, -M, -X, or -a) This flag may be
used more than once to add <br>
multiple sets of known hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Loading sets with different hash
algorithms can sometimes generate spurrious hash collisions.
For example, let&rsquo;s say we have two hash sets, A and B,
which have some over&acirc; <br>
lapping files. For example, the file /usr/bin/bad is in both
sets. In A we&rsquo;ve recorded the MD5 and SHA-256. In B
we&rsquo;ve recorded the MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Because
these <br>
two records are different, they will both be loaded. When
the program computes all three hashes and compares them to
the set of knowns, we will get an exact match from the <br>
record in B and a collision from the record in A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Audit mode. Each input file
is compared against the set of knowns. An audit is said to
pass if each input file is matched against exactly one file
in set of knowns. Any <br>
collisions, new files, or missing files will make the audit
fail. Using this flag alone produces a message, either
&quot;Audit passed&quot; or &quot;Audit Failed&quot;. Use
the verbose modes, <br>
-v, for more details. Using -v prints the number of files in
each category. Using -v a second time prints any
discrepancies. Using -v a third time prints the results for
<br>
every file examined and every known file. <br>
Due to limitations in the program, any filenames with
Unicode characters will appear to have moved during an
audit. See the section &quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Positive matching, requires
at least one use of the -k flag. The input files are
examined one at a time, and only those files that match the
list of known hashes are out&acirc; <br>
put. The only acceptable format for known hashes is the
output of previous hashdeep runs. <br>
If standard input is used with the -m flag, displays
&quot;stdin&quot; if the input matches one of the hashes in
the list of known hashes. If the hash does not match, the
program <br>
displays no output. <br>
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -x, -X, or
-a flags. See the section &quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Negative matching. Same as
the -m flag above, but does negative matching. That is, only
those files NOT in the list of known hashes are displayed.
<br>
This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -m, -M, or
-a flags. See the section &quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;file&gt; <br>
Takes a list of files to be hashed from the specified file.
Each line is assumed to be a filename. This flag can only be
used once per invocation. If it&rsquo;s used a second <br>
time, the second instance will clobber the first. <br>
Note that you can still use other flags, such as the -m or
-x modes, and submit additional FILES on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w When used with positive
matching modes (-m,-M) displays the filename of the known
hash that matched the input file. See the section
&quot;UNICODE SUPPORT&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M and -X <br>
Same as -m and -x above, but displays the hash for each file
that does (or does not) match the list of known hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Enables recursive mode. All
subdirectories are traversed. Please note that recursive
mode cannot be used to examine all files of a given file
extension. For example, call&acirc; <br>
ing hashdeep -r *.txt will examine all files in directories
that end in .txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Displays a progress indicator
and estimate of time remaining for each file being
processed. Time estimates for files larger than 4GB are not
available on Windows. This <br>
mode may not be used with th -p mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E When in audit mode, performs
case insensitive r w i matching of filenames. For example,
oltch to o0 l m <br>
names are case insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;size&gt; <br>
Size threshold mode. Only hash files smaller than the given
the threshold. Sizes may be specified using IEC multipliers
b,k,m,g,t,p, and e.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o &lt;bcpflsd&gt; <br>
Enables expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only
which) types of files are processed. Directory processing is
still controlled with the -r flag. The expert <br>
mode options allowed are: <br>
f - Regular files <br>
b - Block Devices <br>
c - Character Devices <br>
p - Named Pipes <br>
l - Symbolic Links <br>
s - Sockets <br>
d - Solaris Doors <br>
e - Windows PE executables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Enables silent mode. All
error messages are suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Piecewise mode. Breaks files
into chunks before hashing. Chunks may be specified using
IEC multipliers b,k,m,g,t,p, and e. (Never let it be said
that the author didn&acirc;t <br>
plan ahead.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Enables bare mode. Strips any
leading directory information from displayed filenames. This
flag may not be used in conjunction with the -l flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enables relative file paths.
Instead of printing the absolute path for each file,
displays the relative file path as indicated on the command
line. This flag may not be <br>
used in conjunction with the -b flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enables verbose mode. Use
again to make the program more verbose. This mostly changes
the behvaior of the audit mode, -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jnn Controls multi-threading.
By default the program will create one producer thread to
scan the file system and one hashing thread per CPU core.
Multi-threading causes output <br>
filenames to be in non-deterministic order, as files that
take longer to hash will be delayed while they are hashed.
If a deterministic order is required, specify -j0 to <br>
disable multi-threading</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Output in Digital Forensics
XML (DFXML) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Quote Unicode output. For
example, the snowman is shown as U+C426.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F&lt;bum&gt; <br>
Specifies the input mode that is used to read files. The
default is -Fb (buffered I/O) which reads files with
fopen(). Specifying -Fu will use unbuffered I/O and read the
<br>
file with open(). Specifying -Fm will use memory-mapped I/O
which will be faster on some platforms, but which
(currently) will not work with files that produce I/O
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show a help screen and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show the version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNICODE SUPPORT <br>
As of version 3.0 the program supports Unicode characters in
filenames on Microsoft Windows systems for filenames
specified on the command line with globbing (e.g. *), for
files <br>
specified with the -f of files to hash, and for files read
from directories using the -r option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default all program input and
output should be in UTF-8. The program automatically
converts this to UTF-16 for opening files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix/Linux/MacOS, you should
use a terminal emulator that supports UTF-8 and UTF-8
characters in filenames will be properly displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, the programs do not
display Unicode characters on the console. You must either
redirect output to a file and open the file with Wordpad
(which can display Unicode), <br>
or you must specify the -u option to quote Unicode using
standard U+XXXX notation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the file name of a
file containing known hashes may not be specified as a
unicode filename, but you can specify the name using tab
completion or an asterisk (e.g. <br>
md5deep -m *.txt where there is only one file with a .txt
extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Returns a bit-wise value based on the success of the
operation and the status of any matching operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Success. Note that the program
considers itself successful even when it encounters read
errors, permission denied errors, or finds directories when
not in recursive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Unused hashes. Under any of
the matching modes, returns this value if one or more of the
known hashes was not matched by any of the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Unmatched inputs. Under any of
the matching modes, returns this value if one or more of the
input values did not match any of the known hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 User error, such as trying to
do both positive and negative matching at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">128 Internal error, such as
memory corruption or uncaught cycle. All internal errors
should be reported to the developer! See the section
&quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
hashdeep was written by Jesse Kornblum,
research@jessekornblum.com, and Simson Garfinkel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN ISSUES <br>
Using the -r flag cannot be used to recursively process all
files of a given extension in a directory. This is a
feature, not a bug. If you need to do this, use the find(1)
com&acirc; <br>
mand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will fail if you
attempt to compare 2^64 or more input files against a set of
known files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>

jeopardizes the forensic integrity of this program could
have serious consequences on people&rsquo;s lives. When
submitting a bug <br>
report, please include a description of the problem, how you
