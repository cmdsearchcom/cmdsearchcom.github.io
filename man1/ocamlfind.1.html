<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
This command looks packages up, sorts them optionally, and
prints attributes of them. If the option -recursive (short:
-r) is not specified, exactly the packages given on the <br>
command line are looked up; if -recursive is present, the
packages and all their ancestors, or if -descendants (short:
-d) is present, too, all their descendants are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package lookup and the selection
of the attributes of the packages can be modified by
specifying predicates; without a -predicates option the
empty set of predicates is used. <br>
Note that even the lookup is influenced by the set of actual
predicates as the &quot;requires&quot; variables may be
conditional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is printed about a package
depends on the specified format; there are a number of
options that modify the format. Some formats denote sets of
values (such as -format %a), in <br>
which case multiple output records are printed for every
package. (It is even possible to specify formats denoting
the Cartesian product of sets, such as -format %a%o, but
this <br>
does not make sense.) Before the first output record the
prefix is printed, and the suffix after the last record.
Between two records the separator is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-predicates p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the set of actual
predicates. The argument p is a list of predicate names
separated by commas and/or whitespace. If multiple
-predicates options are given, the <br>
union of all specified sets is effectively used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-format f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the format to the string f.
Characters preceded by a percent sign are interpreted as
placeholders; all other characters mean themselves. The
defined placeholders <br>
are listed below. The default format is &quot;%d&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-long-format or -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the format such that all
relevant variables are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i-format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as -format &quot;-I
%d&quot;, i.e. directory options for ocamlc are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l-format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as -format &quot;-ccopt
-L%d&quot;, i.e. directory options for the linker backend
are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a-format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as -format &quot;%a&quot;,
i.e. archive file names are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o-format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as -format &quot;%o&quot;,
i.e. linker options are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p-format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Same as -format &quot;%p&quot;,
i.e. package names are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prefix p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the prefix that is printed
before the first output record to the given string. The
default prefix is the empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-suffix s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the suffix that is printed
after the last output record to the given string. The
default suffix is the empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-separator s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the separator that is
printed between output records to the given string. The
default separator is a linefeed character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-recursive or -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not only the packages given on
the command line are queried but also all ancestors or
descendants. If the option -descendants is specified, too,
the descendants are <br>
printed, otherwise the ancestors. The packages are
topologically sorted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-descendants -d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of the ancestors the
descendants of the given packages are queried. This option
implies -recursive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Placeholders meaningful in the
-format option <br>
%%</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replaced by a single percent
sign</p>

directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replaced by the package
description</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replaced by the version
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replaced by the archive
filename. If there is more than one archive, a separate
output record is printed for every archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Replaced by the list of archive
filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
These subcommands are drivers for the compilers with the
same names, i.e. &quot;ocamlfind ocamlc&quot; is a driver
for &quot;ocamlc&quot;, and so on. The subcommands
understand all documented <br>
options of the compilers (here called standard-options), but
also a few more options. If these subcommands are invoked
only with standard options, they behave as if the
underly&acirc; <br>
ing compiler had been called directly. The extra options
modify this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internally, these subcommands
transform the given list of options and file arguments into
an invocation of the driven compiler. This transformation
only adds options and files, <br>
and the relative order of the options and files passed
directly is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are -package options,
additional directory search specifiers will be included
(&quot;-I&quot;, and &quot;-ccopt -I&quot;), such that files
of all named packages and all ancestors can be <br>
found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -linkpkg option causes that
the packages listed in the -package options and all
necessary ancestors are linked in. This means that the
archive files implementing the packages <br>
are inserted into the list of file arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the package database is
queried a set of predicates is needed. Most predicates are
set automatically, see below, but additional predicates can
be given by a -predicates <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a -syntax option,
the drivers assume that a preprocessor is to be used. In
this case, the preprocessor command is built first in a
preprocessor stage, and this com&acirc; <br>
mand is passed to the compiler using the -pp option. The set
of predicates in the preprocessor stage is different from
the set in the compiler/linker stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for compiling and
linking <br>
Here, only the additional options not interpreted by the
compiler but by the driver itself, and options with
additional effects are explained. Some options are only
meaningful <br>
for the preprocessor call, and are explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-package package-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds the listed package names to
the set of included packages. The package names may be
separated by commas and/or whitespace. In the transformed
command, for every <br>
package of the set of included packages and for any ancestor
a directory search option is inserted after the already
given options. This means that &quot;-I&quot; and
&quot;-ccopt -I&quot; <br>
options are added for every package directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linkpkg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes that in the transformed
command all archives of the packages specified by -packages
and all their ancestors are added to the file arguments.
More precisely, these <br>
archives are inserted before the first given file argument.
Furthermore, &quot;-ccopt -L&quot; options for all package
directories, and the linker options of the selected
pack&acirc; <br>
ages are added, too. Note that the archives are inserted in
topological order while the linker options are added in
reverse toplogical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-predicates pred-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds the given predicates to the
set of actual predicates. The predicates must be separated
by commas and/or whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dontlink package-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option modifies the
behaviour of -linkpkg. Packages specified here and all
ancestors are not linked in. Again the packages are
separated by commas and/or white&acirc; <br>
space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dllpath-pkg
package-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For these packages -dllpath
options are added to the compiler command. This may be
useful when the ld.conf file is not properly configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dllpath-all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all linked packages -dllpath
options are added to the compiler command. This may be
useful when the ld.conf file is not properly configured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-passopt arg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument arg is passed
directly to the underlying compiler. This is needed to
specify undocumented compiler options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-passrest arg...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All following arguments arg...
are passed directly to the underlying compiler. This is
needed to specify undocumented compiler options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This standard option is
interpreted by the driver, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-thread</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This standard option causes that
the predicate &quot;mt&quot; is added to the set of actual
predicates. If POSIX threads are available, the predicate
&quot;mt_posix&quot; is selected, too. <br>
If only VM threads are available, the predicate
&quot;mt_vm&quot; is included into the set, and the compiler
switch is changed into -vmthread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the presence of the
&quot;mt&quot; predicate triggers special fixup of the
dependency graph (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vmthread</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This standard option causes that
the predicates &quot;mt&quot; and &quot;mt_vm&quot; are
added to the set of actual predicates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the presence of the
&quot;mt&quot; predicate triggers special fixup of the
dependency graph (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This standard option of
&quot;ocamlopt&quot; causes that the predicate
&quot;gprof&quot; is added to the set of actual
predicates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for preprocessing <br>
The options relevant for the preprocessor are the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-package package-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These packages are considered
while looking up the preprocessor arguments. (It does not
cause problems that the same -package option is used for
this purpose, because <br>
the set of predicates is different.) It is recommended to
mention at least camlp4 here if the preprocessor is going to
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syntax pred-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These predicates are assumed to
be true in addition to the standard preprocessor predicates.
See below for a list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppopt camlp4-arg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This argument is passed to the
camlp4 call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Predicates for compiling and
linking <br>
byte</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;byte&quot; predicate
means that one of the bytecode compilers is used. It is
automatically included into the predicate set if the
&quot;ocamlc&quot;, &quot;ocamlcp&quot;, or
&quot;ocamlmktop&quot; com&acirc; <br>
piler is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">native</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;native&quot; predicate
means that the native compiler is used. It is automatically
included into the predicate set if the &quot;ocamlopt&quot;
compiler is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toploop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;toploop&quot;
predicate means that the toploop is available in the linked
program. This predicate is only set when the toploop is
actually being executed, not when the <br>
toploop is created (this changed in version 1.0.4 of
findlib).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">create_toploop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This predicate means that a
toploop is being created (using ocamlmktop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;mt&quot; predicate
means that the program is multi-threaded. It is
automatically included into the predicate set if the -thread
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mt_posix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;mt_posix&quot;
predicate means that in the case &quot;mt&quot; is set, too,
the POSIX libraries are used to implement threads.
&quot;mt_posix&quot; is automatically included into the
predi&acirc; <br>
cate set if the variable &quot;type_of_threads&quot; in the
META description of the &quot;threads&quot; package has the
value &quot;posix&quot;. This is normally the case if
&quot;findlib&quot; is configured for <br>
POSIX threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mt_vm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;mt_vm&quot; predicate
means that in the case &quot;mt&quot; is set, too, the VM
thread emulation is used to implement multi-threading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gprof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;gprof&quot; predicate
means that in the case &quot;native&quot; is set, too, the
program is compiled for profiling. It is automatically
included into the predicate set if &quot;ocamlopt&quot; <br>
is used and the -p option is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autolink</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;autolink&quot;
predicate means that ocamlc is able to perform automatic
linking. It is automatically included into the predicate set
if ocamlc knows automatic linking <br>
(from version 3.00), but it is not set if the -noautolink
option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This predicate is set if there
is a -syntax option. It is set both for the preprocessor and
the compiler/linker stage, and it can be used to find out
whether the pre&acirc; <br>
processor is enabled or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Predicates for preprocessing
<br>
preprocessor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This predicate is always set
while looking up the preprocessor arguments. It can be used
to distinguish between the preprocessor stage and the
compiler/linker stage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syntax</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This predicate is set if there
is a -syntax option. It is set both for the preprocessor and
the compiler/linker stage, and it can be used to find out
whether the pre&acirc; <br>
processor is enabled or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">camlp4o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the reserved predicate
for the standard O&rsquo;Caml syntax. It can be used in the
-syntax predicate list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">camlp4r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the reserved predicate
for the revised O&rsquo;Caml syntax. It can be used in the
-syntax predicate list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special behaviour of
&rsquo;ocamlmktop&rsquo; <br>
As there is a special module Topfind that supports loading
of packages in scripts, the &quot;ocamlmktop&quot;
subcommand can add initialization code for this module. This
extra code is <br>
linked into the executable if &quot;findlib&quot; is in the
set of effectively linked packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fixup of the dependency graph
for multi-threading <br>
For a number of reasons the presence of the &quot;mt&quot;
predicate triggers that (1) the package &quot;threads&quot;
is added to the list of required packages and (2) the
package &quot;threads&quot; becomes <br>
prerequisite of all other packages (except of itself and a
few hardcoded exceptions). The effect is that the options
-thread and -vmthread automatically select the
&quot;threads&quot; <br>
package, and that &quot;threads&quot; is inserted at the
right position in the package list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended file naming <br>
At a number of places one can not only refer to files by
absolute or relative path names, but also by extended names.
These have two major forms: &quot;+name&quot; refers to the
subdirec&acirc; <br>
tory name of the standard library directory, and
&quot;@name&quot; refers to the package directory of the
package name. Both forms can be continued by a path, e.g.
&quot;@netstring/net&acirc; <br>
string_top.cma&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use extended names: (1)
With -I options, (2) as normal file arguments of the
compiler, (3) in the &quot;archive&quot; property of
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to set the names of the
compiler executables <br>
Normally, the O&rsquo;Caml bytecode compiler can be called
under the name ocamlc. However, this is not always true;
sometimes a different name is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can instruct ocamlfind to
call executables with other names than ocamlc, ocamlopt,
ocamlmktop, and ocamlcp. If present, the environment
variable OCAMLFIND_COMMANDS is inter&acirc; <br>
preted as a mapping from the standard names to the actual
names of the executables. It must have the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">standardname1=actualname1
standardname2=actualname2 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: You may set
OCAMLFIND_COMMANDS as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">OCAMLFIND_COMMANDS=&rsquo;ocamlc=ocamlc-3.00
ocamlopt=ocamlopt-3.00&rsquo; <br>
export OCAMLFIND_COMMANDS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can change
the configuration file findlib.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
This command is a driver for the tool ocamldep of the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-package package-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packages named here are only

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
This driver calls the ocamlbrowser with package options.
With -package, the specified packages are included into the
search path of the browser, and the modules of these
packages <br>
become visible (in addition to the standard library). The
option -all causes that all packages are selected that are
managed by findlib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As for other drivers, the
options -passopt and -passrest can be used to pass arguments
directly to the ocamlbrowser program.</p>

file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
This subcommand is a driver for ocamldoc. It undestands all
options ocamldoc supports plus the mentioned findlib
options. Basically, the -package options are translated into
-I <br>
options, and the selected syntax options are translated into
camlp4 options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
Here, only the additional options not interpreted by
ocamldep but by the driver itself, and options with
additional effects are explained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-package package-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds the listed package names to
the set of included packages. The package names may be
separated by commas and/or whitespace. In the transformed
command, for every <br>
package of the set of included packages and for any ancestor
a directory search option is inserted after the already
given options. This means that &quot;-I&quot; options are
<br>
added for every package directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-predicates pred-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds the given predicates to the
set of actual predicates. The predicates must be separated
by commas and/or whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-syntax pred-name-list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The predicates that are in
effect during the look-up of the preprocessor options. At
least, either camlp4o (selecting the normal syntax), or
camlp4r (selecting the revised <br>
syntax) should be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ppopt camlp4-arg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An option that is passed through
to the camlp4 call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE &rsquo;install&rsquo;
SUBCOMMAND <br>
Synopsis <br>
ocamlfind install [ -destdir directory ] <br>
[ -metadir directory ] <br>
[ -ldconf path ] <br>
[ -dont-add-directory-directive ] <br>
[ -patch-version string ] <br>
[ -patch-rmpkg name ] <br>
[ -patch-archives ] <br>
[ -dll ] [ -nodll ] [ -optional ] [ -add ] <br>
package_name file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
This subcommand installs a new package either at the default
location (see the variable destdir of findlib.conf), or in
the directory specified by the -destdir option. This means
<br>
that a new package directory is created and that the files
on the command line are copied to this directory. It is
required that a META file is one of the files copied to the
<br>
target directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that package directories
should be flat (no subdirectories). Existing packages are
never overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to have a
separate directory for all the META files. If you want that,
you have either to set the variable metadir of findlib.conf,
or to specify the -metadir <br>
option. In this case, the file called META is copied to the
specified directory and renamed to META.p (where p is the
package name), while all the other files are copied to the
<br>
package directory as usual. Furthermore, the META file is
modified such that the directory variable contains the path
of the package directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option
-dont-add-directory-directive prevents the installer from
adding a directory variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are files ending in the
suffixes .so or .dll, the package directory will be added to
the DLL configuration file ld.conf, such that the dynamic
loader can find the DLL. <br>
The location of this file can be overriden by the -ldconf
option. To turn this feature off, use &quot;-ldconf
ignore&quot;; this causes that the ld.conf file is not
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if there is a stublibs
directory in site-lib, the DLLs are not installed in the
package directory, but in this directory that is shared by
all packages that are <br>
installed at the same location. In this case, the
configuration file ld.conf is not modified, so you do not
need to say &quot;-ldconf ignore&quot; if you prefer this
style of installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options -dll and -nodll can
be used to control exactly which files are considered as
DLLs and which not. By default, the mentioned suffix rule is
in effect: files ending in <br>
&quot;.so&quot; (Unix) or &quot;.dll&quot; (Windows) are
DLLs. The switch -dll changes this, and all following files
are considered as DLLs, regardless of their suffix. The
switch -nodll expresses <br>
that the following files are not DLLs, even if they have a
DLL-like suffix. For example, in the following call the
files f1 and f2 are handled by the suffix rule; f3 and f4
are <br>
DLLs anyway; and f5 and f6 are not DLLs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ocamlfind install p f1 f2 -dll
f3 f4 -nodll f5 f6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The switch -optional declares
that all following files are optional, i.e. the command will
not fail if files do not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -patch options may be used
to change the contents of the META files while it is being
installed. The option -patch-version changes the contents of
the top-level &quot;version&quot; <br>
variable. The option -patch-rmpkg removes the given
subpackage. The option -patch-archives is experimental, in
particular it removes all non-existing files from
&quot;archive&quot; vari&acirc; <br>
ables, and even whole subpackages if the archives are
missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The effect of -add is to add
further files to an already installed packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE &rsquo;remove&rsquo;
SUBCOMMAND <br>
Synopsis <br>
ocamlfind remove [ -destdir directory ] <br>
[ -metadir directory ] <br>
[ -ldconf path ] <br>
package_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The package will removed if it is installed at the default
location (see the variable destdir of findlib.conf). If the
package resides at a different location, it will not be <br>
removed by default; however, you can pass an alternate
directory for packages by the -destdir option. (This must be
the same directory as specified at installation time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that package directories
should be flat (no subdirectories); this subcommand cannot
remove deep package directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a separate directory
for META files, you must either configure this directory by
the metadir variable of findlib.conf, or by specifying the
-metadir option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command does not fail if the
package and/or the META file cannot be located. You will get
a warning only in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the package directory is
mentioned in the ld.conf configuration file for DLLs, it
will be tried to remove this entry from the file. The
location of this file can be overriden <br>
by the -ldconf option. To turn this feature off, use
&quot;-ldconf ignore&quot;; this causes that the ld.conf
file is not modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a stublibs
directory, it is checked whether the package owns any of the
files in this directory, and the owned files will be
deleted.</p>
