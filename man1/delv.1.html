[query...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
delv (Domain Entity Lookup &amp; Validation) is a tool for
sending DNS queries and validating the results, using the
the same internal resolver and validator logic as named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delv will send to a specified
name server all queries needed to fetch and validate the
requested data; this includes the original requested query,
subsequent queries to follow <br>
CNAME or DNAME chains, and queries for DNSKEY, DS and DLV
records to establish a chain of trust for DNSSEC validation.
It does not perform iterative resolution, but simulates the
<br>
behavior of a name server configured for DNSSEC validating
and forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, responses are
validated using built-in DNSSEC trust anchors for the root
zone (&quot;.&quot;) and for the ISC DNSSEC lookaside
validation zone (&quot;dlv.isc.org&quot;). Records returned
<br>
by delv are either fully validated or were not signed. If
validation fails, an explanation of the failure is included
in the output; the validation process can be traced in <br>
detail. Because delv does not rely on an external server to
carry out validation, it can be used to check the validity
of DNS responses in environments where local name servers
<br>
may not be trustworthy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless it is told to query a
specific name server, delv will try each of the servers
listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server addresses
are found, delv will send queries <br>
to the localhost addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for
IPv6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When no command line arguments
or options are given, delv will perform an NS query for
&quot;.&quot; (the root zone).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMPLE USAGE <br>
A typical invocation of delv looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delv @server name type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server <br>
is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This
can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6
address in colon-delimited notation. When the <br>
supplied server argument is a hostname, delv resolves that
name before querying that name server (note, however, that
this initial lookup is not validated by DNSSEC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no server argument is
provided, delv consults /etc/resolv.conf; if an address is
found there, it queries the name server at that address. If
either of the -4 or -6 options <br>
are in use, then only addresses for the corresponding
transport will be tried. If no usable addresses are found,
delv will send queries to the localhost addresses (127.0.0.1
<br>
for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name <br>
is the domain name to be looked up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type <br>
indicates what type of query is required &acirc; ANY, A, MX,
etc. type can be any valid query type. If no type argument
is supplied, delv will perform a lookup for an A record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a anchor-file <br>
Specifies a file from which to read DNSSEC trust anchors.
The default is /etc/bind.keys, which is included with BIND 9
and contains trust anchors for the root zone (&quot;.&quot;)
and <br>
for the ISC DNSSEC lookaside validation zone
(&quot;dlv.isc.org&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys that do not match the root
or DLV trust-anchor names are ignored; these key names can
be overridden using the +dlv=NAME or +root=NAME options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When reading the trust
anchor file, delv treats managed-keys statements and
trusted-keys statements identically. That is, for a managed
key, it is the initial key that <br>
is trusted; RFC 5011 key management is not supported. delv
will not consult the managed-keys database maintained by
named. This means that if either of the keys in <br>
/etc/bind.keys is revoked and rolled over, it will be
necessary to update /etc/bind.keys to use DNSSEC validation
in delv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b address <br>
Sets the source IP address of the query to address. This
must be a valid address on one of the host&rsquo;s network
interfaces or &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; or &quot;::&quot;. An
optional source port may be <br>
specified by appending &quot;#&lt;port&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c class <br>
Sets the query class for the requested data. Currently, only
class &quot;IN&quot; is supported in delv and any other
value is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d level <br>
Set the systemwide debug level to level. The allowed range
is from 0 to 99. The default is 0 (no debugging). Debugging
traces from delv become more verbose as the debug level <br>
increases. See the +mtrace, +rtrace, and +vtrace options
below for additional debugging details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
Display the delv help usage output and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
Insecure mode. This disables internal DNSSEC validation.
(Note, however, this does not set the CD bit on upstream
queries. If the server being queried is performing DNSSEC
<br>
validation, then it will not return invalid data; this can
cause delv to time out. When it is necessary to examine
invalid data to debug a DNSSEC problem, use dig +cd.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m <br>
Enables memory usage debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port# <br>
Specifies a destination port to use for queries instead of
the standard DNS port number 53. This option would be used
with a name server that has been configured to listen <br>
for queries on a non-standard port number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q name <br>
Sets the query name to name. While the query name can be
specified without using the -q, it is sometimes necessary to
disambiguate names from types or classes (for example, <br>
when looking up the name &quot;ns&quot;, which could be
misinterpreted as the type NS, or &quot;ch&quot;, which
could be misinterpreted as class CH).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t type <br>
Sets the query type to type, which can be any valid query
type supported in BIND 9 except for zone transfer types AXFR
and IXFR. As with -q, this is useful to distinguish <br>
query name type or class when they are ambiguous. it is
sometimes necessary to disambiguate names from types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default query type is
&quot;A&quot;, unless the -x option is supplied to indicate
a reverse lookup, in which case it is &quot;PTR&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Print the delv version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x addr <br>
Performs a reverse lookup, mapping an addresses to a name.
addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a
colon-delimited IPv6 address. When -x is used, there is <br>
no need to provide the name or type arguments. delv
automatically performs a lookup for a name like
11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type to PTR.
IPv6 addresses <br>
are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA
domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 <br>
Forces delv to only use IPv4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 <br>
Forces delv to only use IPv6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUERY OPTIONS <br>
delv provides a number of query options which affect the way
results are displayed, and in some cases the way lookups are
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each query option is identified
by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+). Some keywords set
or reset an option. These may be preceded by the string no
to negate the meaning of <br>
that keyword. Other keywords assign values to options like
the timeout interval. They have the form +keyword=value. The
query options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]cdflag <br>
Controls whether to set the CD (checking disabled) bit in
queries sent by delv. This may be useful when
troubleshooting DNSSEC problems from behind a validating
resolver. A <br>
validating resolver will block invalid responses, making it
difficult to retrieve them for analysis. Setting the CD flag
on queries will cause the resolver to return invalid <br>
responses, which delv can then validate internally and
report the errors in detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]class <br>
Controls whether to display the CLASS when printing a
record. The default is to display the CLASS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]ttl <br>
Controls whether to display the TTL when printing a record.
The default is to display the TTL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]rtrace <br>
Toggle resolver fetch logging. This reports the name and
type of each query sent by delv in the process of carrying
out the resolution and validation process: this includes
<br>
including the original query and all subsequent queries to
follow CNAMEs and to establish a chain of trust for DNSSEC
validation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the debug level to 1 in the &quot;resolver&quot; logging
category. Setting the systemwide debug level to 1 using the
-d option will product the same <br>
output (but will affect other logging categories as
well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]mtrace <br>
Toggle message logging. This produces a detailed dump of the
responses received by delv in the process of carrying out
the resolution and validation process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the debug level to 10 for the the &quot;packets&quot; module
of the &quot;resolver&quot; logging category. Setting the
systemwide debug level to 10 using the -d <br>
option will produce the same output (but will affect other
logging categories as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]vtrace <br>
Toggle validation logging. This shows the internal process
of the validator as it determines whether an answer is
validly signed, unsigned, or invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is equivalent to setting
the debug level to 3 for the the &quot;validator&quot;
module of the &quot;dnssec&quot; logging category. Setting
the systemwide debug level to 3 using the -d <br>
option will produce the same output (but will affect other
logging categories as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]short <br>
Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the answer
in a verbose form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]comments <br>
Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The
default is to print comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]rrcomments <br>
Toggle the display of per-record comments in the output (for
example, human-readable key information about DNSKEY
records). The default is to print per-record comments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]crypto <br>
Toggle the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC
records. The contents of these field are unnecessary to
debug most DNSSEC validation failures and removing them
makes it <br>
easier to see the common failures. The default is to display
the fields. When omitted they are replaced by the string
&quot;[omitted]&quot; or in the DNSKEY case the key id is
<br>
displayed as the replacement, e.g. &quot;[ key id = value
]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]trust <br>
Controls whether to display the trust level when printing a
record. The default is to display the trust level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]split[=W] <br>
Split long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource
records into chunks of W characters (where W is rounded up
to the nearest multiple of 4). +nosplit or +split=0 causes
<br>
fields not to be split at all. The default is 56 characters,
or 44 characters when multiline mode is active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]all <br>
Set or clear the display options +[no]comments,
+[no]rrcomments, and +[no]trust as a group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]multiline <br>
Print long records (such as RRSIG, DNSKEY, and SOA records)
in a verbose multi-line format with human-readable comments.
The default is to print each record on a single line, <br>
to facilitate machine parsing of the delv output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]dnssec <br>
Indicates whether to display RRSIG records in the delv
output. The default is to do so. Note that (unlike in dig)
this does not control whether to request DNSSEC records or
<br>
whether to validate them. DNSSEC records are always
requested, and validation will always occur unless
suppressed by the use of -i or +noroot and +nodlv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]root[=ROOT] <br>
Indicates whether to perform conventional (non-lookaside)
DNSSEC validation, and if so, specifies the name of a trust
anchor. The default is to validate using a trust anchor <br>
of &quot;.&quot; (the root zone), for which there is a
built-in key. If specifying a different trust anchor, then
-a must be used to specify a file containing the key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+[no]dlv[=DLV] <br>
Indicates whether to perform DNSSEC lookaside validation,
and if so, specifies the name of the DLV trust anchor. The
default is to perform lookaside validation using a trust
<br>
anchor of &quot;dlv.isc.org&quot;, for which there is a
built-in key. If specifying a different name, then -a must
be used to specify a file containing the DLV key.</p>
