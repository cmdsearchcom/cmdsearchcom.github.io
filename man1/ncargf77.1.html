<p>NCARGF77(1NCARG) NCAR GRAPHICS NCARGF77(1NCARG)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncargf77 - Command for compiling Fortran code that uses the
NCAR Graphics low-level utilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncargf77 [-ngmath] [-smooth] [-quick] [-super] [-agupwrtx]
[-ncarbd] [-ngmathbd] [-ictrans] [-noX11] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncargf77 is a script that invokes the FORTRAN 77
compiler/linker with the proper NCAR Graphics LLU (low-level
utility) libraries. Arguments presented above are associated
with <br>
NCAR Graphics. All other arguments and options are identical
to the f77 command on your particular machine; arguments
that include quoted strings may have to be enclosed in
sin&acirc; <br>
gle quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: ncargf77 cannot be used to
compile NCAR Graphics Fortran programs that call the HLUs
(high-level utilities). You must use nhlf77 instead. See the
nhlf77 man page for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to run ncargf77, you
must have your NCARG_ROOT environment variable set to the
directory pathname where the NCAR Graphics libraries,
binaries, and include files were <br>
installed. If you are not sure what NCARG_ROOT should be set
to, please check with your system administrator or the site
representative for NCAR Graphics. If the NCAR Graphics <br>
libraries, binaries, and include files were not installed
under one root directory, then you will need to set the
environment variables NCARG_LIB, NCARG_BIN, and
NCARG_INCLUDE <br>
instead. Please see &quot;man ncargintro&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, on some systems, if
you supply your own binary libraries in addition to the ones
automatically referenced by ncargf77, all the libraries must
have been created in a <br>
similar fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngmath <br>
Links in the NCAR Graphics ngmath library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smooth <br>
Link in the &quot;smooth&quot; objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quick Link in the
&quot;quick&quot; objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-super Link in the
&quot;super&quot; objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agupwrtx <br>
Link in the &quot;agupwrtx&quot; library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ictrans <br>
When ncargf77 is invoked with the this option, the resulting
executable will, upon invocation, send its metafile output
to the translator ictrans. The environment variable <br>
GRAPHCAP must be set to a valid graphics output device
whenever the executable is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncarbd <br>
Use this option for compilers that appear to be having
trouble initializing blockdata variables. It will cause a
small subroutine to be linked in that helps force the <br>
loading of blockdata initialization routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngmathbd <br>
Just like with the -ncarbd option, use this option for
compilers that appear to be having trouble initializing
Ngmath-related blockdata variables. It will cause a small
<br>
subroutine to be linked in that helps force the loading of
Ngmath blockdata initialization routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this option doesn&rsquo;t
need to be specified separately if you are already including
the -ncarbd and -ngmath options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noX11 Do not link in the X
library when linking the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ncargf77 will load
the X11 library when linking your Fortran program. This is
because the GKS library now has an X11 driver. If you try
running ncargf77 and <br>
the compiler complains that it cannot find the library for
X11, then try running ncargf77 -L/xxx/yyy/zzz program.f
where /xxx/yyy/zzz is the path leading to your X11 <br>
library. If you do not have the X11 library, or else you
just don&rsquo;t want it to be loaded, you can use the
-noX11 option.</p>
