<p>BEEP(1) General Commands Manual BEEP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
beep - beep the pc speaker any number of ways</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
beep [--verbose | --debug] [-e device | --device device] [-f
N] [-l N] [-r N] [-d N] [-D N] [-s] [-c]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep [ OPTIONS ] [-n] [--new] [
OPTIONS ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep [-h] [--help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep [-v] [-V] [--version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
beep allows the user to control the pc-speaker with
precision, allowing different sounds to indicate different
events. While it can be run quite happily on the command
line, <br>
it&rsquo;s intended place of residence is within shell/perl
scripts, notifying the user when something interesting
occurs. Of course, it has no notion of what&rsquo;s
interesting, but it&rsquo;s <br>
real good at that notifying part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options have default values,
meaning that just typing &rsquo;beep&rsquo; will work. If an
option is specified more than once on the command line,
subsequent options override their pre&acirc; <br>
decessors. So &rsquo;beep -f 200 -f 300&rsquo; will beep at
300Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--verbose, --debug <br>
enable debug output. This option prints a line like the
following before each beep:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[DEBUG] 5 times 200 ms beeps
(100 delay between, 0 delay after) @ 1000.00 Hz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e device, --device device <br>
use device as event device. If the switch isn&rsquo;t used,
/dev/tty0 and /dev/vc/0 are tried in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f N beep at N Hz, where 0 &lt;
N &lt; 20000. As a general ballpark, the regular terminal
beep is around 750Hz. N is not, incidentally, restricted to
whole numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l N beep for N
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r N specify the number of
repetitions (defaults to 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d N, -D N <br>
specify a delay of N milliseconds between repetitions. Use
of -d specifies that this delay should only occur between
beeps, that is, it should not occur after the last <br>
repetition. -D indicates that the delay should occur after
every repetition, including the last. Normally, -d is what
you want, but if, for example, you are stringing <br>
several beep commands together to play the star wars anthem,
you may want control over every delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --new <br>
this option allows you to break the command line up into
specifying multiple beeps. Each time this option is used,
beep starts treating all further arguments as though <br>
they were for a new beep. So for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep -f 1000 -n -f 2000 -n -f
1500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would produce a sequence of
three beeps, the first with a frequency of 1000Hz (and
otherwise default values), then a second beep with a
frequency of 2000Hz (again, with <br>
things like delay and reps being set to their defaults),
then a third beep, at 1500Hz. This is different from
specifying a -r value, since -r repeats the same beep
multi&acirc; <br>
ple times, whereas -n allows you to specify different beeps.
After a -n, the new beep is created with all the default
values, and any of these can be specified without <br>
altering values for preceding (or later) beeps. See the
EXAMPLES section if this managed to confuse you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, -c these options put beep
into input-processing mode. -s tells beep to read from
stdin, and beep after each newline, and -c tells it to do so
after every character. In both <br>
cases, the program will also echo the input back out to
stdout, which makes it easy to slip beep into a
text-processing pipeline, see the EXAMPLES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
display usage info and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, -V, --version <br>
display version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
At its simplest (yet still effective)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more interesting standalone
setup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep -f 300.7 -r 2 -d 100 -l
400</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As part of a log-watching
pipeline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tail -f /var/log/xferlog | grep
--line-buffered passwd | beep -f 1000 -r 5 -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using -c mode, I recommend
using a short -D, and a shorter -l, so that the beeps
don&rsquo;t blur together. Something like this will get you
a cheesy 1970&rsquo;s style beep-as-you- <br>
type-each-letter effect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cat file | beep -c -f 400 -D 50
-l 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A highly contrived example of
-n/--new usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep -f 1000 -r 2 -n -r 5 -l 10
--new</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce first two 1000Hz
beeps, then 5 beeps at the default tone, but only 10ms long
each, followed by a third beep using all the default
settings (since none are <br>
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IOCTL WACKINESS <br>
Some users will encounter a situation where beep dies with a
complaint from ioctl(). The reason for this, as Peter Tirsek
was nice enough to point out to me, stems from how the <br>
kernel handles beep&rsquo;s attempt to poke at (for
non-programmers: ioctl is a sort of catch-all function that
lets you poke at things that have no other predefined
poking-at mecha&acirc; <br>
nism) the tty, which is how it beeps. The short story is,
the kernel checks that either:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- you are the superuser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- you own the current tty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What this means is that root can
always make beep work (to the best of my knowledge!), and
that any local user can make beep work, BUT a non-root
remote user cannot use beep in <br>
it&rsquo;s natural state. What&rsquo;s worse, an xterm, or
other x-session counts, as far as the kernel is concerned,
as &rsquo;remote&rsquo;, so beep won&rsquo;t work from a
non-privileged xterm either. I <br>
had originally chalked this up to a bug, but there&rsquo;s
actually nothing I can do about it, and it really is a Good
Thing that the kernel does things this way. There is also a
<br>
solution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default beep is not installed
with the suid bit set, because that would just be zany. On
the other hand, if you do make it suid root, all your
problems with beep bailing on <br>
ioctl calls will magically vanish, which is pleasant, and
the only reason not to is that any suid program is a
potential security hole. Conveniently, beep is very short,
so <br>
auditing it is pretty straightforward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decide for yourself, of course,
but it looks safe to me - there&rsquo;s only one buffer and
fgets doesn&rsquo;t let it overflow, there&rsquo;s only one
file opening, and while there is a potential <br>
race condition there, it&rsquo;s with /dev/console. If
someone can exploit this race by replacing /dev/console,
you&rsquo;ve got bigger problems. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So the quick, only, and likely
safe solution if beep is not beeping when you want it to is
(as root):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># chmod 4755 /usr/bin/beep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(or wherever you put it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The one snag is that this will
give any little nitwit the ability to run beep successfully
- make sure this is what you want. If it isn&rsquo;t, a
slightly more complex fix would be <br>
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># chgrp beep /usr/bin/beep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># chmod 4750 /usr/bin/beep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then add only beep-worthy
users to the &rsquo;beep&rsquo; group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FREQUENCY TABLE <br>
Several people have asked for some basic help translating
music notes to frequencies. There are a lot of music notes,
and several tables online will give you translations, but
<br>
here are approximate numbers for the octave of middle C, to
get you started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note Frequency <br>
C 261.6 <br>
C# 277.2 <br>
D 293.7 <br>
D# 311.1 <br>
E 329.6 <br>
F 349.2 <br>
F# 370.0 <br>
G 392.0 <br>
G# 415.3 <br>
A 440.0 <br>
A# 466.2 <br>
B 493.9 <br>
C 523.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
None that I&rsquo;m aware of, though see the IOCTL WACKINESS
section.</p>
