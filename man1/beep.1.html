<b>beep</b> allows the user to control the pc-speaker with precision, allowing
  different sounds to indicate different events. While it can be run quite
  happily on the command line, it's intended place of residence is within
  shell/perl scripts, notifying the user when something interesting occurs. Of
  course, it has no notion of what's interesting, but it's real good at that
  notifying part.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All options have default values, meaning that just typing ' <b>beep</b>' will
  work. If an option is specified more than once on the command line, subsequent
  options override their predecessors. So ' <b>beep</b> -f 200 -f 300' will beep
  at 300Hz.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b> N, <b>-D</b> N</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">specify a delay of N milliseconds between repetitions. Use
      of -d specifies that this delay should only occur <i>between</i> beeps,
      that is, it should not occur after the last repetition. -D indicates that
      the delay should occur after every repetition, including the last.
      Normally, -d is what you want, but if, for example, you are stringing
      several <b>beep</b> commands together to play the star wars anthem, you
      may want control over every delay.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b>, <b>--new</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">this option allows you to break the command line up into
      specifying multiple beeps. Each time this option is used, beep starts
      treating all further arguments as though they were for a new beep. So for
      example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>beep</b> -f 1000 -n -f 2000 -n -f 1500
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    would produce a sequence of three beeps, the first with a frequency of
      1000Hz (and otherwise default values), then a second beep with a frequency
      of 2000Hz (again, with things like delay and reps being set to their
      defaults), then a third beep, at 1500Hz. This is different from specifying
      a -r value, since -r repeats the same beep multiple times, whereas -n
      allows you to specify different beeps. After a -n, the new beep is created
      with all the default values, and any of these can be specified without
      altering values for preceding (or later) beeps. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b>
      section if this managed to confuse you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">these options put <b>beep</b> into input-processing mode.
      -s tells <b>beep</b> to read from stdin, and beep after each newline, and
      -c tells it to do so after every character. In both cases, the program
      will also echo the input back out to stdout, which makes it easy to slip
      <b>beep</b> into a text-processing pipeline, see the <b>EXAMPLES</b>
      section.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IOCTL_WACKINESS"><a class="selflink" href="#IOCTL_WACKINESS">IOCTL
  WACKINESS</a></h1>
Some users will encounter a situation where beep dies with a complaint from
  ioctl(). The reason for this, as Peter Tirsek was nice enough to point out to
  me, stems from how the kernel handles beep's attempt to poke at (for
  non-programmers: ioctl is a sort of catch-all function that lets you poke at
  things that have no other predefined poking-at mechanism) the tty, which is
  how it beeps. The short story is, the kernel checks that either:
<div class="Pp"></div>
- you are the superuser
<div class="Pp"></div>
- you own the current tty
<div class="Pp"></div>
What this means is that root can always make beep work (to the best of my
  knowledge!), and that any local user can make beep work, BUT a non-root remote
  user cannot use beep in it's natural state. What's worse, an xterm, or other
  x-session counts, as far as the kernel is concerned, as 'remote', so beep
  won't work from a non-privileged xterm either. I had originally chalked this
  up to a bug, but there's actually nothing I can do about it, and it really is
  a Good Thing that the kernel does things this way. There is also a solution.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default beep is not installed with the suid bit set, because that would just
  be zany. On the other hand, if you do make it suid root, all your problems
  with beep bailing on ioctl calls will magically vanish, which is pleasant, and
  the only reason not to is that any suid program is a potential security hole.
  Conveniently, beep is very short, so auditing it is pretty straightforward.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Decide for yourself, of course, but it looks safe to me - there's only one
  buffer and fgets doesn't let it overflow, there's only one file opening, and
  while there is a potential race condition there, it's with /dev/console. If
  someone can exploit this race by replacing /dev/console, you've got bigger
  problems. :)
<div class="Pp"></div>
So the quick, only, and likely safe solution if beep is not beeping when you
  want it to is (as root):
<div class="Pp"></div>
# chmod 4755 /usr/bin/beep
<div class="Pp"></div>
(or wherever you put it)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The one snag is that this will give any little nitwit the ability to run beep
  successfully - make sure this is what you want. If it isn't, a slightly more
  complex fix would be something like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
# chgrp beep /usr/bin/beep
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
# chmod 4750 /usr/bin/beep
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then add only beep-worthy users to the 'beep' group.

  frequencies. There are a lot of music notes, and several tables online will
  give you translations, but here are <i>approximate</i> numbers for the octave
  of middle C, to get you started.
