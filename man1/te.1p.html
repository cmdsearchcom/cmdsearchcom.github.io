<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
te (table editor) - front-end that simplifies editing
tab-delimited text tables</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
te file1 [ file2 ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program makes it easier to edit tab-delimited ASCII
tables, such as are used with Interchange (see
icdevgroup.org), and can be exported from many popular
spreadsheet and <br>
database applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It converts tab-delimited ASCII
files that have one record per line into temporary files
with one field per line, each line beginning with the field
name. It then sends each file <br>
to your favorite text editor. After you exit your editor, it
checks to see if you changed anything in the file, and if
so, it converts the data back to the tab-delimited format
<br>
with one record per line, and replaces the original
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line of each input
file must contain the field names, tab-delimited, that apply
for that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing is pretty
straightforward when you see it in action. The rules
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Empty lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Comment lines (beginning with
&quot;#&quot;) are ignored at the beginning of the file, and
terminate a record in the middle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The fields in the first record
are used in all subsequent records, and the order in which
they are specified are the order in which the columns will
be written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o To delete a column, delete its
line in the first record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o To change which order the
columns are in, re-order the first record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o To add a column, add it to the
first record (and as many subsequent records as you
wish).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you&rsquo;re using
the &quot;extended&quot; option (-e), you can&rsquo;t add
new columns, because they can&rsquo;t be distinguished from
the extended fields that go into the serialized <br>
hash. You&rsquo;d need to do that in a separate pass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If you delete a column, you do
not need to delete it from every record; any instances of
that field in records after the first will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Any space left after the field
name and colon (like &quot;fieldname:&quot;) will be
included as part of the field. Any tabs you put in the field
data itself will be converted to spaces <br>
(as they would corrupt the table otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A record can be deleted by
removing all its fields. A new record can be added by
inserting a new block of all fields at a record
boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If any errors are encountered,
such as non-existent field names or lines that don&rsquo;t
follow the prescribed format, processing aborts immediately
and the original file is left <br>
untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can edit several files in
succession by naming each on the command line. The editor
will be called for each one independently. If you start
editing many files and decide you <br>
want to stop, add a line &quot;#DONE&quot; anywhere in the
temporary file and save it. The current file will be
processed and saved, but the rest will be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As is customary with many Unix
applications, you can set the environment variables VISUAL
or EDITOR to point to your favorite text editor. If neither
of those is set, my favorite <br>
editor, vi(1) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options will also be read from
environment variable TE_OPTIONS if it is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
2008-04-12 02:33:40</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CHANGELOG <br>
2001-04-26. Initial release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2001-05-04. Make temporary file
in working directory instead of using POSIX::tmpnam. Keep
ownership and permissions of original file. Fixed bug that
caused fields with number &quot;0&quot; <br>
to be output as empty strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2001-05-06. Fix problem with how
temporary file names were generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2001-07-31. Check for VISUAL
environment variable, and handle editor options there or in
EDITOR if given. Take advantage of Digest::MD5&rsquo;s
native file reading instead of doing it <br>
ourselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2001-10-03. Added gvim support
by forcing foreground option -f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2002-07-23. Remove line endings
whether CR, LF, or CRLF, instead of using running
Perl&rsquo;s platform-specific chomp. If preserving a
trailing solitary CR in the last field of a line <br>
is important, you&rsquo;ll want to change this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2002-08-30. Add option -s for
starting value support (really only vi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">te -s os28004 &lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jumps to first occurrence of
&quot;os28004&quot; in &lt;file&gt;. Option -i ignores case
in the search. (By Mike Heins.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2002-09-02. Add option -f to
handle files without field names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2002-09-03. Add option -n to
number rows in comments. Allow setting of persistent options
in environment variable TE_OPTIONS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2004-06-07. Fixed bug that
misinterpreted file as having no data rows when last line of
file was empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2005-08-29. Added ability to
delete, re-order, or add columns by placing them in the
first record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2005-11-15. Added support for
extended columns containing Perl serialized hashes with the
-e option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2008-04-11. Added option -o to
write output to a file and exit, never invoking an editor.
