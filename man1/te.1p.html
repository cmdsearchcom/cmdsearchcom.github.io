This program makes it easier to edit tab-delimited ASCII tables, such as are
  used with Interchange (see icdevgroup.org), and can be exported from many
  popular spreadsheet and database applications.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It converts tab-delimited ASCII files that have one record per line into
  temporary files with one field per line, each line beginning with the field
  name. It then sends each file to your favorite text editor. After you exit
  your editor, it checks to see if you changed anything in the file, and if so,
  it converts the data back to the tab-delimited format with one record per
  line, and replaces the original file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first line of each input file must contain the field names, tab-delimited,
  that apply for that file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Editing is pretty straightforward when you see it in action. The rules are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Empty lines are ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Comment lines (beginning with &quot;#&quot;) are ignored at
      the beginning of the file, and terminate a record in the middle.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The fields in the first record are used in all subsequent
      records, and the order in which they are specified are the order in which
      the columns will be written.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To delete a column, delete its line in the first
    record.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To change which order the columns are in, re-order the
      first record.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To add a column, add it to the first record (and as many
      subsequent records as you wish).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that if you're using the &quot;extended&quot; option (-e), you can't
      add new columns, because they can't be distinguished from the extended
      fields that go into the serialized hash. You'd need to do that in a
      separate pass.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you delete a column, you do not need to delete it from
      every record; any instances of that field in records after the first will
      be ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Any space left after the field name and colon (like
      &quot;fieldname:&quot;) will be included as part of the field. Any tabs
      you put in the field data itself will be converted to spaces (as they
      would corrupt the table otherwise).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A record can be deleted by removing all its fields. A new
      record can be added by inserting a new block of all fields at a record
      boundary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">o</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If any errors are encountered, such as non-existent field
      names or lines that don't follow the prescribed format, processing aborts
      immediately and the original file is left untouched.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can edit several files in succession by naming each on the command line. The
  editor will be called for each one independently. If you start editing many
  files and decide you want to stop, add a line &quot;#DONE&quot; anywhere in
  the temporary file and save it. The current file will be processed and saved,
  but the rest will be skipped.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As is customary with many Unix applications, you can set the environment
  variables VISUAL or EDITOR to point to your favorite text editor. If neither
  of those is set, my favorite editor, <b>vi</b>(1) is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options will also be read from environment variable TE_OPTIONS if it is set.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CHANGELOG"><a class="selflink" href="#CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a></h1>
2001-04-26. Initial release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2001-05-04. Make temporary file in working directory instead of using
  POSIX::tmpnam. Keep ownership and permissions of original file. Fixed bug that
  caused fields with number &quot;0&quot; to be output as empty strings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2001-05-06. Fix problem with how temporary file names were generated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2001-07-31. Check for VISUAL environment variable, and handle editor options
  there or in EDITOR if given. Take advantage of Digest::MD5's native file
  reading instead of doing it ourselves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2001-10-03. Added gvim support by forcing foreground option -f.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2002-07-23. Remove line endings whether CR, LF, or CRLF, instead of using
  running Perl's platform-specific chomp. If preserving a trailing solitary CR
  in the last field of a line is important, you'll want to change this behavior.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2002-08-30. Add option -s for starting value support (really only vi).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        te -s os28004 &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Jumps to first occurrence of &quot;os28004&quot; in &lt;file&gt;. Option -i
  ignores case in the search. (By Mike Heins.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
2002-09-02. Add option -f to handle files without field names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2002-09-03. Add option -n to number rows in comments. Allow setting of
  persistent options in environment variable TE_OPTIONS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2004-06-07. Fixed bug that misinterpreted file as having no data rows when last
  line of file was empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2005-08-29. Added ability to delete, re-order, or add columns by placing them in
  the first record.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2005-11-15. Added support for extended columns containing Perl serialized hashes
  with the -e option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
2008-04-11. Added option -o to write output to a file and exit, never invoking
  an editor. By Greg Sabino Mullane.</div>
