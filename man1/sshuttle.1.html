<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sshuttle - sshuttle documentation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sshuttle [options] [-r [username@]sshserver[:port]]
&lt;subnets ...&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sshuttle allows you to create a VPN connection from your
machine to any remote server that you can connect to via
ssh, as long as that server has python 2.3 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To work, you must have root
access on the local machine, but you can have a normal
account on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s valid to run sshuttle
more than once simultaneously on a single client machine,
connecting to a different server every time, so you can be
on more than one VPN at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If run on a router, sshuttle can
forward traffic for your entire subnet to the VPN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
subnets <br>
A list of subnets to route over the VPN, in the form
a.b.c.d[/width][port[-port]]. Valid examples are 1.2.3.4 (a
single IP address), 1.2.3.4/32 (equivalent to 1.2.3.4), <br>
1.2.3.0/24 (a 24-bit subnet, ie. with a 255.255.255.0
netmask), and 0/0 (&rsquo;just route everything through the
VPN&rsquo;). Any of the previous examples are also valid if
you <br>
append a port or a port range, so 1.2.3.4:8000 will only
tunnel traffic that has as the destination port 8000 of
1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.0/24:8000-9000 will tunnel traffic going
<br>
to any port between 8000 and 9000 (inclusive) for all IPs in
the 1.2.3.0/24 subnet. It is also possible to use a name in
which case the first IP it resolves to during <br>
startup will be routed over the VPN. Valid examples are
example.com, example.com:8000 and example.com:8000-9000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--method [auto|nat|tproxy|pf]
<br>
Which firewall method should sshuttle use? For auto,
sshuttle attempts to guess the appropriate method depending
on what it can find in PATH. The default value is auto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --listen=[ip:]port <br>
Use this ip address and port number as the transparent proxy
port. By default sshuttle finds an available port
automatically and listens on IP 127.0.0.1 (localhost), so
<br>
you don&rsquo;t need to override it, and connections are
only proxied from the local machine, not from outside
machines. If you want to accept connections from other
machines <br>
on your network (ie. to run sshuttle on a router) try
enabling IP Forwarding in your kernel, then using --listen
0.0.0.0:0. You can use any name resolving to an IP <br>
address of the machine running sshuttle, e.g. --listen
localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the tproxy and pf methods
this can be an IPv6 address. Use this option twice if
required, to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --auto-hosts <br>
Scan for remote hostnames and update the local /etc/hosts
file with matching entries for as long as the VPN is open.
This is nicer than changing your system&rsquo;s DNS <br>
(/etc/resolv.conf) settings, for several reasons. First,
hostnames are added without domain names attached, so you
can ssh thatserver without worrying if your local <br>
domain matches the remote one. Second, if you sshuttle into
more than one VPN at a time, it&rsquo;s impossible to use
more than one DNS server at once anyway, but sshuttle
cor&acirc; <br>
rectly merges /etc/hosts entries between all running copies.
Third, if you&rsquo;re only routing a few subnets over the
VPN, you probably would prefer to keep using your local <br>
DNS server for everything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --auto-nets <br>
In addition to the subnets provided on the command line, ask
the server which subnets it thinks we should route, and
route those automatically. The suggestions are taken <br>
automatically from the server&rsquo;s routing table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dns Capture local DNS requests
and forward to the remote DNS server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--python <br>
Specify the name/path of the remote python interpreter. The
default is just python, which means to use the default
python interpreter on the remote system&rsquo;s PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r,
--remote=[username@]sshserver[:port] <br>
The remote hostname and optional username and ssh port
number to use for connecting to the remote server. For
example, example.com, testuser@example.com, <br>
testuser@example.com:2222, or example.com:2244.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --exclude=subnet <br>
Explicitly exclude this subnet from forwarding. The format
of this option is the same as the &lt;subnets&gt; option. To
exclude more than one subnet, specify the -x option <br>
more than once. You can say something like 0/0 -x 1.2.3.0/24
to forward everything except the local subnet over the VPN,
for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --exclude-from=file <br>
Exclude the subnets specified in a file, one subnet per
line. Useful when you have lots of subnets to exclude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Print more information about the session. This option can be
used more than once for increased verbosity. By default,
sshuttle prints only error messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --ssh-cmd <br>
The command to use to connect to the remote server. The
default is just ssh. Use this if your ssh client is in a
non-standard location or you want to provide extra <br>
options to the ssh command, for example, -e &rsquo;ssh
-v&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--seed-hosts <br>
A comma-separated list of hostnames to use to initialize the
--auto-hosts scan algorithm. --auto-hosts does things like
poll local SMB servers for lists of local host&acirc; <br>
names, but can speed things up if you use this option to
give it a few names to start from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used without
--auto-hosts, then the listed hostnames will be scanned and
added, but no further hostnames will be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-latency-control <br>
Sacrifice latency to improve bandwidth benchmarks. ssh uses
really big socket buffers, which can overload the connection
if you start doing large file transfers, thus mak&acirc;
<br>
ing all your other sessions inside the same tunnel go
slowly. Normally, sshuttle tries to avoid this problem using
a &quot;fullness check&quot; that allows only a certain
amount of <br>
outstanding data to be buffered at a time. But on
high-bandwidth links, this can leave a lot of your bandwidth
underutilized. It also makes sshuttle seem slow in
band&acirc; <br>
width benchmarks (benchmarks rarely test ping latency, which
is what sshuttle is trying to control). This option disables
the latency control feature, maximizing band&acirc; <br>
width usage. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --daemon <br>
Automatically fork into the background after connecting to
the remote server. Implies --syslog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--syslog <br>
after connecting, send all log messages to the syslog(3)
service instead of stderr. This is implicit if you use
--daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile=pidfilename <br>
when using --daemon, save sshuttle&rsquo;s pid to
pidfilename. The default is sshuttle.pid in the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-ipv6 <br>
If using tproxy or pf methods, this will disable IPv6
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--firewall <br>
(internal use only) run the firewall manager. This is the
only part of sshuttle that must run as root. If you start
sshuttle as a non-root user, it will automatically <br>
run sudo or su to start the firewall manager, but the core
of sshuttle still runs as a normal user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--hostwatch <br>
(internal use only) run the hostwatch daemon. This process
runs on the server side and collects hostnames for the
--auto-hosts option. Using this option by itself makes <br>
it a lot easier to debug and test the --auto-hosts
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Test locally by proxying all local connections, without
using ssh:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ sshuttle -v 0/0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
When it starts, sshuttle creates an ssh session to the
server specified by the -r option. If -r is omitted, it will
start both its client and server locally, which is sometimes
<br>
useful for testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After connecting to the remote
server, sshuttle uploads its (python) source code to the
remote end and executes it there. Thus, you don&rsquo;t need
to install sshuttle on the remote <br>
server, and there are never sshuttle version conflicts
between client and server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike most VPNs, sshuttle
forwards sessions, not packets. That is, it uses kernel
transparent proxying (iptables REDIRECT rules on Linux) to
capture outgoing TCP sessions, then <br>
creates entirely separate TCP sessions out to the original
destination at the other end of the tunnel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packet-level forwarding (eg.
using the tun/tap devices on Linux) seems elegant at first,
but it results in several problems, notably the &rsquo;tcp
over tcp&rsquo; problem. The tcp protocol <br>
depends fundamentally on packets being dropped in order to
implement its congestion control agorithm; if you pass tcp
packets through a tcp-based tunnel (such as ssh), the inner
<br>
tcp packets will never be dropped, and so the inner tcp
stream&rsquo;s congestion control will be completely broken,
and performance will be terrible. Thus, packet-based VPNs
(such as <br>
IPsec and openvpn) cannot use tcp-based encrypted streams
like ssh or ssl, and have to implement their own encryption
from scratch, which is very complex and error prone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshuttle&rsquo;s simplicity
comes from the fact that it can safely use the existing ssh
encrypted tunnel without incurring a performance penalty. It
does this by letting the <br>
client-side kernel manage the incoming tcp stream, and the
server-side kernel manage the outgoing tcp stream; there is
no need for congestion control to be shared between the two
<br>
separate streams, so a tcp-based tunnel is fine.</p>
