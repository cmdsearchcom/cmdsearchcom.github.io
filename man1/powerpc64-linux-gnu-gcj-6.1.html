<p>GCJ(1) GNU GCJ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gcj - Ahead-of-time compiler for the Java language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gcj [-Idir...] [-d dir...] <br>
[--CLASSPATH=path] [--classpath=path] <br>
[-foption...] [--encoding=name] <br>
[--main=classname] [-Dname[=value]...] <br>
[-C] [--resource resource-name] [-d directory] <br>
[-Wwarn...] <br>
sourcefile...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
As gcj is just another front end to gcc, it supports many of
the same options as gcc. This manual only documents the
options specific to gcj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Input and output files <br>
A gcj command is like a gcc command, in that it consists of
a number of options and file names. The following kinds of
input file names are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.java <br>
Java source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.class <br>
Java bytecode files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.zip <br>
file.jar <br>
An archive containing one or more &quot;.class&quot; files,
all of which are compiled. The archive may be compressed.
Files in an archive which don&rsquo;t end with .class are
treated as <br>
resource files; they are compiled into the resulting object
file as core: URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
A file containing a whitespace-separated list of input file
names. (Currently, these must all be &quot;.java&quot;
source files, but that may change.) Each named file is
compiled, <br>
just as if it had been on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">library.a <br>
library.so <br>
-llibname <br>
Libraries to use when linking. See the gcc manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify more than one
input file on the gcj command line, in which case they will
all be compiled. If you specify a &quot;-o FILENAME&quot;
option, all the input files will be <br>
compiled together, producing a single output file, named
FILENAME. This is allowed even when using &quot;-S&quot; or
&quot;-c&quot;, but not when using &quot;-C&quot; or
&quot;--resource&quot;. (This is an extension <br>
beyond the what plain gcc allows.) (If more than one input
file is specified, all must currently be &quot;.java&quot;
files, though we hope to fix this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Options <br>
gcj has options to control where it looks to find files it
needs. For instance, gcj might need to load a class that is
referenced by the file it has been asked to compile. Like
<br>
other compilers for the Java language, gcj has a notion of a
class path. There are several options and environment
variables which can be used to manipulate the class path.
<br>
When gcj looks for a given class, it searches the class path
looking for matching .class or .java file. gcj comes with a
built-in class path which points at the installed <br>
libgcj.jar, a file which contains all the standard
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the text below, a directory
or path component can refer either to an actual directory on
the filesystem, or to a .zip or .jar file, which gcj will
search as if it is a <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Idir <br>
All directories specified by &quot;-I&quot; are kept in
order and prepended to the class path constructed from all
the other options. Unless compatibility with tools like
&quot;javac&quot; is <br>
important, we recommend always using &quot;-I&quot; instead
of the other options for manipulating the class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--classpath=path <br>
This sets the class path to path, a colon-separated list of
paths (on Windows-based systems, a semicolon-separate list
of paths). This does not override the builtin
(&quot;boot&quot;) <br>
search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--CLASSPATH=path <br>
Deprecated synonym for &quot;--classpath&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bootclasspath=path <br>
Where to find the standard builtin classes, such as
&quot;java.lang.String&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extdirs=path <br>
For each directory in the path, place the contents of that
directory at the end of the class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSPATH <br>
This is an environment variable which holds a list of
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final class path is
constructed like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* First come all directories
specified via &quot;-I&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If --classpath is specified,
its value is appended. Otherwise, if the
&quot;CLASSPATH&quot; environment variable is specified,
then its value is appended. Otherwise, the current <br>
directory (&quot;.&quot;) is appended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If &quot;--bootclasspath&quot;
was specified, append its value. Otherwise, append the
built-in system directory, libgcj.jar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Finally, if
&quot;--extdirs&quot; was specified, append the contents of
the specified directories at the end of the class path.
Otherwise, append the contents of the built-in extdirs <br>
at &quot;$(prefix)/share/java/ext&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The classfile built by gcj for
the class &quot;java.lang.Object&quot; (and placed in
&quot;libgcj.jar&quot;) contains a special zero length
attribute &quot;gnu.gcj.gcj-compiled&quot;. The compiler
looks for <br>
this attribute when loading &quot;java.lang.Object&quot; and
will report an error if it isn&rsquo;t found, unless it
compiles to bytecode (the option
&quot;-fforce-classes-archive-check&quot; can be used <br>
to override this behavior in this particular case.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fforce-classes-archive-check
<br>
This forces the compiler to always check for the special
zero length attribute &quot;gnu.gcj.gcj-compiled&quot; in
&quot;java.lang.Object&quot; and issue an error if it
isn&rsquo;t found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fsource=VERSION <br>
This option is used to choose the source version accepted by
gcj. The default is 1.5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encodings <br>
The Java programming language uses Unicode throughout. In an
effort to integrate well with other locales, gcj allows
.java files to be written using almost any encoding. gcj
<br>
knows how to convert these encodings into its internal
encoding at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the
&quot;--encoding=NAME&quot; option to specify an encoding
(of a particular character set) to use for source files. If
this is not specified, the default encoding comes <br>
from your current locale. If your host system has
insufficient locale support, then gcj assumes the default
encoding to be the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To implement
&quot;--encoding&quot;, gcj simply uses the host
platform&rsquo;s &quot;iconv&quot; conversion routine. This
means that in practice gcj is limited by the capabilities of
the host platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names allowed for the
argument &quot;--encoding&quot; vary from platform to
platform (since they are not standardized anywhere).
However, gcj implements the encoding named UTF-8 <br>
internally, so if you choose to use this for your source
files you can be assured that it will work on every
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings <br>
gcj implements several warnings. As with other generic gcc
warnings, if an option of the form &quot;-Wfoo&quot; enables
a warning, then &quot;-Wno-foo&quot; will disable it. Here
we&rsquo;ve chosen to <br>
document the form of the warning which will have an effect
-- the default being the opposite of what is listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wredundant-modifiers <br>
With this flag, gcj will warn about redundant modifiers. For
instance, it will warn if an interface method is declared
&quot;public&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wextraneous-semicolon <br>
This causes gcj to warn about empty statements. Empty
statements have been deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-out-of-date <br>
This option will cause gcj not to warn when a source file is
newer than its matching class file. By default gcj will warn
about this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wno-deprecated <br>
Warn if a deprecated class, method, or field is referred
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wunused <br>
This is the same as gcc&rsquo;s &quot;-Wunused&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wall <br>
This is the same as &quot;-Wredundant-modifiers
-Wextraneous-semicolon -Wunused&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linking <br>
To turn a Java application into an executable program, you
need to link it with the needed libraries, just as for C or
C++. The linker by default looks for a global function <br>
named &quot;main&quot;. Since Java does not have global
functions, and a collection of Java classes may have more
than one class with a &quot;main&quot; method, you need to
let the linker know <br>
which of those &quot;main&quot; methods it should invoke
when starting the application. You can do that in any of
these ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Specify the class containing
the desired &quot;main&quot; method when you link the
application, using the &quot;--main&quot; flag, described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Link the Java package(s) into
a shared library (dll) rather than an executable. Then
invoke the application using the &quot;gij&quot; program,
making sure that &quot;gij&quot; can find the <br>
libraries it needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Link the Java packages(s) with
the flag &quot;-lgij&quot;, which links in the
&quot;main&quot; routine from the &quot;gij&quot; command.
This allows you to select the class whose &quot;main&quot;
method you want <br>
to run when you run the application. You can also use other
&quot;gij&quot; flags, such as &quot;-D&quot; flags to set
properties. Using the &quot;-lgij&quot; library (rather than
the &quot;gij&quot; program of <br>
the previous mechanism) has some advantages: it is
compatible with static linking, and does not require
configuring or installing libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These &quot;gij&quot; options
relate to linking an executable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--main=CLASSNAME <br>
This option is used when linking to specify the name of the
class whose &quot;main&quot; method should be invoked when
the resulting executable is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname[=value] <br>
This option can only be used with &quot;--main&quot;. It
defines a system property named name with value value. If
value is not specified then it defaults to the empty string.
These <br>
system properties are initialized at the program&rsquo;s
startup and can be retrieved at runtime using the
&quot;java.lang.System.getProperty&quot; method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lgij <br>
Create an application whose command-line processing is that
of the &quot;gij&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is an alternative to
using &quot;--main&quot;; you cannot use both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-static-libgcj <br>
This option causes linking to be done against a static
version of the libgcj runtime library. This option is only
available if corresponding linker support exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: Static linking of
libgcj may cause essential parts of libgcj to be omitted.
Some parts of libgcj use reflection to load classes at
runtime. Since the linker does <br>
not see these references at link time, it can omit the
referred to classes. The result is usually (but not always)
a &quot;ClassNotFoundException&quot; being thrown at
runtime. <br>
Caution must be used when using this option. For more
details see:
&lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Statically%20linking%20libgcj&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Code Generation <br>
In addition to the many gcc options controlling code
generation, gcj has several options specific to itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C This option is used to tell
gcj to generate bytecode (.class files) rather than object
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resource resource-name <br>
This option is used to tell gcj to compile the contents of a
given file to object code so it may be accessed at runtime
with the core protocol handler as core:/resource-name. <br>
Note that resource-name is the name of the resource as found
at runtime; for instance, it could be used in a call to
&quot;ResourceBundle.getBundle&quot;. The actual file name
to be <br>
compiled this way must be specified separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ftarget=VERSION <br>
This can be used with -C to choose the version of bytecode
emitted by gcj. The default is 1.5. When not generating
bytecode, this option has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d directory <br>
When used with &quot;-C&quot;, this causes all generated
.class files to be put in the appropriate subdirectory of
directory. By default they will be put in subdirectories of
the <br>
current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-bounds-check <br>
By default, gcj generates code which checks the bounds of
all array indexing operations. With this option, these
checks are omitted, which can improve performance for code
<br>
that uses arrays extensively. Note that this can result in
unpredictable behavior if the code in question actually does
violate array bounds constraints. It is safe to use <br>
this option if you are sure that your code will never throw
an &quot;ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-store-check <br>
Don&rsquo;t generate array store checks. When storing
objects into arrays, a runtime check is normally generated
in order to ensure that the object is assignment compatible
with <br>
the component type of the array (which may not be known at
compile-time). With this option, these checks are omitted.
This can improve performance for code which stores <br>
objects into arrays frequently. It is safe to use this
option if you are sure your code will never throw an
&quot;ArrayStoreException&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fjni <br>
With gcj there are two options for writing native methods:
CNI and JNI. By default gcj assumes you are using CNI. If
you are compiling a class with native methods, and <br>
these methods are implemented using JNI, then you must use
&quot;-fjni&quot;. This option causes gcj to generate stubs
which will invoke the underlying JNI methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-assert <br>
Don&rsquo;t recognize the &quot;assert&quot; keyword. This
is for compatibility with older versions of the language
specification.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization
<br>
When the optimization level is greater or equal to
&quot;-O2&quot;, gcj will try to optimize the way calls into
the runtime are made to initialize static classes upon their
first use <br>
(this optimization isn&rsquo;t carried out if &quot;-C&quot;
was specified.) When compiling to native code,
&quot;-fno-optimize-static-class-initialization&quot; will
turn this optimization off, <br>
regardless of the optimization level in use.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-assertions[=class-or-package]
<br>
Don&rsquo;t include code for checking assertions in the
compiled code. If &quot;=class-or-package&quot; is missing
disables assertion code generation for all classes, unless
overridden by a <br>
more specific &quot;--enable-assertions&quot; flag. If
class-or-package is a class name, only disables generating
assertion checks within the named class or its inner
classes. If <br>
class-or-package is a package name, disables generating
assertion checks within the named package or a
subpackage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, assertions are
enabled when generating class files or when not optimizing,
and disabled when generating optimized binaries.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-assertions[=class-or-package]
<br>
Generates code to check assertions. The option is perhaps
misnamed, as you still need to turn on assertion checking at
run-time, and we don&rsquo;t support any easy way to do <br>
that. So this flag isn&rsquo;t very useful yet, except to
partially override &quot;--disable-assertions&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-findirect-dispatch <br>
gcj has a special binary compatibility ABI, which is enabled
by the &quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot; option. In this mode,
the code generated by gcj honors the binary compatibility
<br>
guarantees in the Java Language Specification, and the
resulting object files do not need to be directly linked
against their dependencies. Instead, all dependencies are
<br>
looked up at runtime. This allows free mixing of interpreted
and compiled code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, at present,
&quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot; can only be used when
compiling .class files. It will not work when compiling from
source. CNI also does not yet work with the <br>
binary compatibility ABI. These restrictions will be lifted
in some future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you compile CNI code
with the standard ABI, you can call it from code built with
the binary compatibility ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbootstrap-classes <br>
This option can be use to tell &quot;libgcj&quot; that the
compiled classes should be loaded by the bootstrap loader,
not the system class loader. By default, if you compile a
class <br>
and link it into an executable, it will be treated as if it
was loaded using the system class loader. This is
convenient, as it means that things like
&quot;Class.forName()&quot; will <br>
search CLASSPATH to find the desired class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-freduced-reflection <br>
This option causes the code generated by gcj to contain a
reduced amount of the class meta-data used to support
runtime reflection. The cost of this savings is the loss of
<br>
the ability to use certain reflection capabilities of the
standard Java runtime environment. When set all meta-data
except for that which is needed to obtain correct runtime
<br>
semantics is eliminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For code that does not use
reflection (i.e. serialization, RMI, CORBA or call methods
in the &quot;java.lang.reflect&quot; package),
&quot;-freduced-reflection&quot; will result in proper <br>
operation with a savings in executable code size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JNI (&quot;-fjni&quot;) and the
binary compatibility ABI (&quot;-findirect-dispatch&quot;)
do not work properly without full reflection meta-data.
Because of this, it is an error to use these <br>
options with &quot;-freduced-reflection&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution: If there is no
reflection meta-data, code that uses a
&quot;SecurityManager&quot; may not work properly. Also
calling &quot;Class.forName()&quot; may fail if the calling
method has no <br>
reflection meta-data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configure-time Options <br>
Some gcj code generations options affect the resulting ABI,
and so can only be meaningfully given when
&quot;libgcj&quot;, the runtime package, is configured.
&quot;libgcj&quot; puts the <br>
appropriate options from this group into a spec file which
is read by gcj. These options are listed here for
completeness; if you are using &quot;libgcj&quot; then you
won&rsquo;t want to touch <br>
these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-boehm-gc <br>
This enables the use of the Boehm GC bitmap marking code. In
particular this causes gcj to put an object marking
descriptor into each vtable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fhash-synchronization <br>
By default, synchronization data (the data used for
&quot;synchronize&quot;, &quot;wait&quot;, and
&quot;notify&quot;) is pointed to by a word in each object.
With this option gcj assumes that this <br>
information is stored in a hash table and not in the object
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-divide-subroutine <br>
On some systems, a library routine is called to perform
integer division. This is required to get exception handling
correct when dividing by zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fcheck-references <br>
On some systems it&rsquo;s necessary to insert inline checks
whenever accessing an object via a reference. On other
systems you won&rsquo;t need this because null pointer
accesses are <br>
caught automatically by the processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fuse-atomic-builtins <br>
On some systems, GCC can generate code for built-in atomic
operations. Use this option to force gcj to use these
builtins when compiling Java code. Where this capability is
<br>
present it should be automatically detected, so you
won&rsquo;t usually need to use this option.</p>
