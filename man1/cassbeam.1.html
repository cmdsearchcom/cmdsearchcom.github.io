<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cassbeam - Cassbeam is a Cassegrain antenna ray tracer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cassbeam input_file [key=value ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cassbeam is a program for Cassegrain antenna modelling. It
computes several properties of the antenna including gain,
zenith system temperature, and the beam, in full
polariza&acirc; <br>
tion. All calculations are done in the transmit sense and
use reciprocity to relate to the equivalent receiving
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cassbeam is a non-interactive
command line program that takes all of its input from the
command line. Note that this does not preclude someone at a
later date from making a <br>
graphical or web front end. There is one required argument
when running cassbeam - the input filename. Additional
arguments can supplement the parameters of the input file.
<br>
These arguments are passed in the same key=value as required
in the input file except whitespace is not allowed around
the equal sign. If a parameter appears both in the input
<br>
file and the command line, then the value on the command
line supercedes the value on the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILE <br>
The main input file consists of a series of lines of the
form key=value. Only one such entry is allowed per line. The
equal sign is optional. The input files allow comments to
<br>
be placed within the file. All comments begin with %. This
character and any that follow it on a given line are ignored
by cassbeam. Depending on key, the value may be one of <br>
five types: string, integer, double, vector, none. A string
is a sequence of non-whitespace characters not surrounded by
quotes of any kind. A double value is a number that can <br>
have a fractional part. A vector is a comma-separated list
of doubles. The &lsquo;none&rsquo; type expects no value.
Below is a list of the allowed keys and the type of value
expected. <br>
If the range of legal values is restricted, the legal range
will be contained within brackets. Note that legal values do
not imply a physical system that will generate
meaning&acirc; <br>
ful results! For the vector type, if a certain number of
values are needed, they will be indicated in parentheses. A
required parameter will be indicated with a &lsquo;*&rsquo;.
It is <br>
important to realize that the secondary optical surface
(i.e., the subreflector) is defined based on the input
geometry. Thus changing the feed placement will change the
geome&acirc; <br>
try of the subreflector! To change parameters of the
telescope without affecting the shape of the subreflector,
set the pathology parameters. Note that the order of the
parame&acirc; <br>
ters does not matter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Antenna geometry parameters <br>
feed_x The x value of the phase center of the feed. If no
value is provided, 0 is assumed. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feed_y The y value of the phase
center of the feed. If no value is provided, 0 is assumed.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feed_z The z value of the phase
center of the feed. If no value is provided, 0 is assumed.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geom This string points to a
disk file containing the primary optical surface geometry.
This file is a three column ascii text file, each containing
space separated values for <br>
r, z, and dz/dr for the antenna. There is no limit (other
than your computer&rsquo;s memory) to the number of lines in
this file. It is assumed (but not checked!) that the <br>
values of r start at 0 and are equally spaced. The radius,
R, of the primary is given by the value of r in the last
row. Columns 1 and 2 are in meters, and column 3 is <br>
dimensionless. [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hole_radius <br>
The radius (in meters) of an unpanelled area at the center
of the primary. If omitted, no hole will be made. [double,
&gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">legapex <br>
The z value where the legs (struts) intersect each other.
Note that the legs might terminate before reaching this
point. The default value is 1.2*sub_h. [double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">legfoot <br>
The r value where the legs (struts) intersect the primary
surface. The default value is half the antenna radius.
[double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">legwidth <br>
The effective width of the legs, used to compute blockage.
Note that currently a positive value indicates four equally
spaced legs with one leg along the x axis. If the <br>
value is negative, its absolute value is used in the
blockage calculations, but the legs are rotated
45&Acirc;&deg;. If this parameter is not set, or if it is
set to 0, then no legs <br>
will be generated. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name An optional name given to
the antenna. If the name is
&lsquo;&lsquo;VLBA&rsquo;&rsquo;, then the true strut
geometry for the VLBA antennas is used rather than
equispaced struts. [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">roughness <br>
The RSS surface roughness in meters. This number represents
the combined surface error for the primary and secondary. If
no roughness is provided, the default value of 0 <br>
is used. [double, &gt;= 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub_h This value is the z value
of the intersection of the subreflector with the z axis.
[double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Feed pattern parameters <br>
Note that either both feedtaper and feedangle or feedpattern
must be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feedangle <br>
Sets the reference angle for the feed taper. [double, &gt;
0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feedpattern <br>
The name of the file containing the pattern of the feed.
This file contains two space-separated columns of numbers:
the angle in degrees and the taper in dB. The first <br>
angle must equal 0, and the angles must be uniformly spaced.
[string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feedpatternscale <br>
The factor by which to scale the pattern defined in
feedpattern. [double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">feedtaper <br>
This parameter sets the taper (in dB) of the feed at an
angle feedangle from the feed axis to 10^-feedtaper/10.
[double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pathology parameters <br>
None of the following operations change the shape of the
subreflector - its geometry is calculated before their
application. Note that displacements of either the feed or
the <br>
subreflector result in a rotation of the feed that corrects
for the mispointing caused by the translations. Rotations of
the feed act in addition to this correction. Composited <br>
rotations (i.e., setting rsub_x and rsub_y are both
provided), the operations on the object being rotated
proceed in reverse alphabetical order (z rotation before y
rotation; y <br>
rotation before x rotation) regardless of the order that the
parameters are received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dfeed_x <br>
Displacement of the feed along the x axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dfeed_y <br>
Displacement of the feed along the y axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dfeed_z <br>
Displacement of the feed along the z axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsub_x Displacement of the
subreflector along the x axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsub_y Displacement of the
subreflector along the y axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dsub_z Displacement of the
subreflector along the z axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">focus Displacement of the feed
along the feed axis. A positive value moves the feed closer
to the subreflector. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rfeed_x <br>
Rotation of the feed in degrees about the x axis. A positive
value will rotate from the z axis through the y axis.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rfeed_y <br>
Rotation of the feed in degrees about the y axis. A positive
value will rotate from the x axis through the z axis.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rfeed_z <br>
Rotation of the feed in degrees about the z axis. A positive
value will rotate from the y axis through the x axis.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsub_x Rotation of the
subreflector in degrees about the x axis. A positive value
will rotate from the z axis through the y axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsub_y Rotation of the
subreflector in degrees about the y axis. A positive value
will rotate from the x axis through the z axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsub_z Rotation of the
subreflector in degrees about the z axis. A positive value
will rotate from the y axis through the x axis. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subrotpoint <br>
Defines the point about which the rotation of the
subreflector is performed. The contents of the vector depend
on the number of elements are provided: either only the z
<br>
value, or the x and y values, or the x, y, and z values.
[vector (1 or 2 or 3)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operating condition parameters
<br>
compute <br>
A string to tell what output to produce. The string can be
&lsquo;all&rsquo;, &lsquo;none&rsquo;, or a string
containing flag characters. The default value is
&lsquo;all&rsquo;, meaning produce all possi&acirc; <br>
ble output. &lsquo;none&rsquo; will produce only messages on
the screen and no output files. The characters of the
general string mean the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Save the aperture images;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j Save the Jones matrices in a
table;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Save the parameters;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Save the polarized beams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the string is case
insensitive. [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diffeff <br>
A user supplied diffraction efficiency. If none is provided,
an internal algorithm that is not very good is used. This
needs to be upgraded! [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">freq The frequency in GHz at
which the calculation will be run. [double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gridsize <br>
Specifies a fixed grid size. If odd, the next even number
will be used. This option overrides any setting of oversamp
and is the preferred method of setting the grid <br>
size. Setting it to a value less than 32 will result in a
grid size of 32. [integer, &gt;= 32]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">leggroundscatter <br>
The fraction of power that scatters off the struts toward
the ground. The default value is 0.2. [double, &gt;= 0,
&lt;= 1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">misceff <br>
A factor of the efficiency calculation that contains
&lsquo;&lsquo;everything else&rsquo;&rsquo;. The user is
responsible for choosing a realistic value for this. A
default of 1 (i.e., 100%) is <br>
assumed if this parameter is not provided. [double, &gt;= 0,
&lt;= 1]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">out The prefix for all output
files. The default is cassbeam. A dot will always separate
the prefix from any trailing characters. [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oversamp <br>
One way of specifying the grid size. This option will make
the grid on the primary fine enough to accommodate
4*oversamp*R/lambda points. The default is 1. Note that <br>
vastly &lsquo;&lsquo;undersampling&rsquo;&rsquo; is fine as
the field is never calculated anywhere between the feed and
the aperture plane. Normally blockage calculations and
constancy of the <br>
illumination will dictate the required sampling. See
gridsize for an alternate way of specifying the grid. This
parameter is ignored if gridsize is set. [double, &gt;
0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pixelsperbeam <br>
This is the approximate number of pixels that the core of
the beam will occupy in the output images. [int, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tground <br>
The temperature in Kelvin of the ground. The default value
is 290. [double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trec The equivalent temperature
of the receiver. This adds into the system temperature. The
default value is 50. [double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tsky The temperature in Kelvin
of the sky. The default value is 3 for frequencies over 1
GHz, and 3 * 10^-2.5 nu for frequencies below 1 GHz.
[double, &gt; 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Up to 12 output files are generated depending on which
compute options were selected at run time. These files are
listed below. The letter in brackets in the section headings
<br>
indicate which option is used to enable this file to be
written. All output files begin with the value of the input
parameter out. Currently all output images are in PGM
for&acirc; <br>
mat, which is a very simple greyscale image format supported
by most unix-based image viewers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aperture images [a] <br>
Three images are generated that allow the aperture field to
be examined qualitatively. If quantitative numbers are
needed, the source code should be modified to export the
illu&acirc; <br>
mination parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">out.illumamp.pgm <br>
Raster image showing the amplitude of the illumination
pattern of the primary. No blockage is done at this point.
The scale is linear in flux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">out.illumphase.pgm <br>
Raster image showing the net phase (pathlength multiplied by
wave vector) at each point on the primary. A phase gradient
is removed. Portions of the image that corre&acirc; <br>
spond to zero flux have an arbitrary phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">out.illumblock.pgm <br>
Raster image showing the blocked portion of the aperture.
White means that this part of the dish is experiences either
plane wave blockage from the sky or spherical wave <br>
blockage from the feed, and thus does not contribute to the
gain of the antenna.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jones matrix file [j] <br>
The Jones matrix file, out.jones.dat contains the Jones
matrix (see Hamaker et al. 1996 for details) corresponding
to the effect of the antenna on the incoming radiation as a
<br>
function of position on the sky. The file is organized as an
eight column ascii. The first row corresponds to the point
on the image with smallest l and m. The rastering then <br>
proceeds first with increasing l, and then with increasing
m. There are a total of n^2 rows, where n is the smallest
odd number greater than or equal to the gridsize used. The
<br>
matrices are rastered on a sine-projected coordinate system
tangent to the sky at the beam center, which corresponds to
row number (n^2+1)/2. At the beam center the pixel scale
<br>
is given by the output parameter beampixelscale, which is
stored in the output file out.params described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameter file [p] <br>
The parameter file, out.params is an output file in the same
format as the input file, containing all of the input
parameters that were specified (even if on the command line)
as <br>
well as many output values. They are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aeff The effective area of the
antenna [m^2]. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aeff_Tsys <br>
The effective area of the antenna divided by the system
temperature [m^2/K]. [double]</p>

The scale of the generated beam images [deg/pixel].
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blockeff <br>
The blockage efficiency. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diffeff <br>
The diffraction efficiency. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwhm_l The full width at half
max of the beam in the l direction. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fwhm_m The full width at half
max of the beam in the m direction. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gain The gain G of the antenna.

The phase efficiency. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">point_l <br>
The l component of the pointing offset from the z axis
measured in the image plane. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">point_m <br>
The m component of the pointing offset from the z axis
measured in the image plane. [double]</p>

The spillover efficiency. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subspilleff <br>
The subreflector spillover efficiency. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">surfeff <br>
The surface efficiency. [double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">totaleff <br>
The total efficiency calculated for the antenna.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tsys The system temperature.
[double]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">version <br>
The software version number. [string]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polarized beam images [s] <br>
With the s option, cassbeam will produce 7 images of the
beam showing in the four Stokes parameters the response to
an unpolarized source as a function of the position of the
<br>
source on the sky. This information is derived from the
Jones matrices which are saved in out.jones.dat. These
images are meant for qualitative inspection. The Jones
matrices <br>
contain the formal output.</p>
