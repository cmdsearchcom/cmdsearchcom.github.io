<p>DELTA(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
DELTA(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
delta &acirc; make a delta (change) to an SCCS file
(DEVELOPMENT)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
delta [&acirc;nps] [&acirc;g list] [&acirc;m mrlist]
[&acirc;r SID] [&acirc;y[comment]] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The delta utility shall be used to permanently introduce
into the named SCCS files changes that were made to the
files retrieved by get (called the g-files, or generated
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The delta utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except that the &acirc;y option has an optional
option-argu&acirc; <br>
ment. This optional option-argument shall not be presented
as a separate argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;r SID Uniquely identify
which delta is to be made to the SCCS file. The use of this
option shall be necessary only if two or more outstanding
get commands for editing (get <br>
&acirc;e) on the same SCCS file were done by the same person
(login name). The SID value specified with the &acirc;r
option can be either the SID specified on the get command
line <br>
or the SID to be made as reported by the get utility; see
get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;s Suppress the report to
standard output of the activity associated with each file.
See the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n Specify retention of
the edited g-file (normally removed at completion of delta
processing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;g list Specify a list
(see get for the definition of list) of deltas that shall be
ignored when the file is accessed at the change level (SID)
created by this delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;m mrlist Specify a
modification request (MR) number that the application shall
supply as the reason for creating the new delta. This shall
be used if the SCCS file has the v <br>
flag set; see admin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &acirc;m is not used and
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; is not specified as a file argument,
and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt described
in the STDOUT section shall be written to <br>
standard output before the standard input is read; if the
standard input is not a terminal, no prompt shall be
issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MRs in a list shall be separated
by &lt;blank&gt; characters or escaped &lt;newline&gt;
characters. An unescaped &lt;newline&gt; shall terminate the
MR list. The escape character is <br>
&lt;backslash&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the v flag has a value, it
shall be taken to be the name of a program which validates
the correctness of the MR numbers. If a non-zero exit status
is returned from <br>
the MR number validation program, the delta utility shall
terminate. (It is assumed that the MR numbers were not all
valid.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;y[comment] <br>
Describe the reason for making the delta. The comment shall
be an arbitrary group of lines that would meet the
definition of a text file. Implementations shall support
<br>
comments from zero to 512 bytes and may support longer
values. A null string (specified as either &acirc;y,
&acirc;y&quot;&quot;, or in response to a prompt for a
comment) shall be consid&acirc; <br>
ered a valid comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &acirc;y is not specified and
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo; is not specified as a file argument,
and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt described
in the STDOUT section shall be written to <br>
standard output before the standard input is read; if the
standard input is not a terminal, no prompt shall be issued.
An unescaped &lt;newline&gt; shall terminate the com&acirc;
<br>
ment text. The escape character is &lt;backslash&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;y option shall be
required if the file operand is specified as
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;p Write (to standard
output) the SCCS file differences before and after the delta
is applied in diff format; see diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of an existing
SCCS file or a directory. If file is a directory, the delta
utility shall behave as though each file in the directory
were specified as a <br>
named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component of
the pathname does not begin with s.) and unreadable files
shall be silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If exactly one file operand
appears, and it is &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the standard input
shall be read; each line of the standard input shall be
taken to be the name of an SCCS file to <br>
be processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall be
silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input shall be a text file used only in the
following cases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* To read an mrlist or a comment
(see the &acirc;m and &acirc;y options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A file operand shall be
specified as &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;. In this case, the
&acirc;y option must be used to specify the comment, and if
the SCCS file has the v flag set, the &acirc;m option must
also <br>
be used to specify the MR list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
Input files shall be text files whose data is to be included
in the SCCS files. If the first character of any line of an
input file is &lt;SOH&gt; in the POSIX locale, the results
are <br>
unspecified. If this file contains more than 99999 lines,
the number of lines recorded in the header for this file
shall be 99999 for this delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of delta:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error, and informative messages written to
stan&acirc; <br>
dard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TZ Determine the timezone in
which the time and date are written in the SCCS file. If the
TZ variable is unset or NULL, an unspecified system default
timezone is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
If SIGINT is caught, temporary files shall be cleaned up and
delta shall exit with a non-zero exit code. The standard
action shall be taken for all other signals; see Section
<br>
1.4, Utility Description Defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The standard output shall be used only for the following
messages in the POSIX locale:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Prompts (see the &acirc;m and
&acirc;y options) in the following formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;MRs? &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;comments? &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MR prompt, if written, shall
always precede the comments prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A report of each file&rsquo;s
activities (unless the &acirc;s option is specified) in the
following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s1d inserted1d deleted1d
unchanged0, &lt;New SID&gt;, <br>
&lt;number of lines inserted&gt;, &lt;number of lines
deleted&gt;, <br>
&lt;number of lines unchanged&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
Any SCCS files updated shall be files of an unspecified
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
System Date and Time <br>
When a delta is added to an SCCS file, the system date and
time shall be recorded for the new delta. If a get is
performed using an SCCS file with a date recorded apparently
in <br>
the future, the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Problems can arise if the system date and time have been
modified (for example, put forward and then back again, or
unsynchronized clocks across a network) and can also arise
<br>
when different values of the TZ environment variable are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Problems of a similar nature can
also arise for the operation of the get utility, which
records the date and time in the file body.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
