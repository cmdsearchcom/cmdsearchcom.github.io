<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamdice - slice a Netpbm image into many horizontally and/or
vertically</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
$ pamdice myimage.ppm -outstem=myimage_part -width=10
-height=8 <br>
$ pamundice myimage_part_%1d_%1a.ppm -across=10 -down=8
&gt;myimage.ppm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pamdice myimage.ppm
-outstem=myimage_part -height=12 -voverlap=9</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-height=height]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-hoverlap=hoverlap]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the minimum unique
abbreviation of the options. You can use two hyphens instead
of one. You can separate an option name from its value with
white space instead of <br>
an equals sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamdice reads a PAM, PBM, PGM,
or PPM image as input and splits it horizontally and/or
vertically into equal size pieces and writes them into
separate files as the same kind of <br>
image. You can optionally make the pieces overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -outstem option for
information on naming of the output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -width and -height options
determine the size of the output pieces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamundice can rejoin the images.
For finer control, you can also use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmcat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One use for this is to make
pieces that take less computer resources than the whole
image to process. For example, you might have an image so
large that an image editor can&rsquo;t <br>
read it all into memory or processes it very slowly. With
pamdice, you can split it into smaller pieces, edit one at a
time, and then reassemble them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another use for this is to print
a large image in small printer-sized pieces that you can
glue together. ppmglobe does a similar thing; it lets you
glue the pieces together into <br>
a sphere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to cut pieces from
an image individually, not in a regular grid, use
pamcut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-outstem=filenamestem <br>
This option determines the names of the output files. Each
output file is named filenamestem_y_x.type where
filenamestem is the value of the -outstem option, x and y
are <br>
the horizontal and vertical locations, respectively, in the
input image of the output image, zero being the leftmost and
top, and type is .pbm, .pgm, .ppm, or .pam, <br>
depending on the type of image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-width=width <br>
gives the width in pixels of the output images. The
rightmost pieces are smaller than this if the input image is
not a multiple of width pixels wide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-height=height <br>
gives the height in pixels of the output images. The bottom
pieces are smaller than this if the input image is not a
multiple of height pixels high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hoverlap=hoverlap <br>
gives the horizontal overlap in pixels between output
images. Each image in a row will overlap the previous one by
hoverlap pixels. By default, there is no overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-voverlap=voverlap <br>
gives the vertical overlap in pixels between output images.
Each row of images will overlap the previous row by voverlap
pixels. By default, there is no overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.23 (July 2004).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print information about the processing to Standard
Error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamdice was new in Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.29 (August
2005), there was a limit of 100 slices in each
direction.</p>
