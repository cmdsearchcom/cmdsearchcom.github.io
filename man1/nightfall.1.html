<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nightfall - binary star astronomy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nightfall -h <br>
nightfall -U [more options] [mass_ratio inclination
primary_size secondary_size primary_temperature
secondary_temperature] <br>
nightfall [-G] [-A] [more options] mass_ratio inclination

nightfall [-G | -U] [-A] [more options] -C file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nightfall is an interactive astronomy program for fun,
education and science. It can generate animated views of
eclipsing (or non-eclipsing) binary stars, compute light
curves <br>
and radial velocity curves, and determine best-fit models
for observational data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the simplest case, nightfall
computes the light curve for a binary star system with some
given mass_ratio (mass of secondary star/mass of primary
star), inclination (0 = <br>
plane-on view, 90 = edge-on view of the orbital plane),
stellar sizes primary_size,secondary_size (dimensionless, in
the range 0 - 1.3), and stellar temperatures
primary_tempera&acirc; <br>
ture,secondary_temperature (in Kelvin), and writes the light
curve to a file NightfallCurve.dat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nightfall is able to show many
non-trivial, and sometimes spectacular, physical effecs in
binary stars, as it uses a detailed physical model rather
than simply assuming the stars <br>
to be spherical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for
nightfall is distributed only in DVI and HTML format, as it
is quite big, and thus not very well suited to the
&rsquo;man&rsquo; page format. It includes some <br>
discussion of binary stars (at a popular science level,
hopefully) that you may find helpful in understanding what
the program does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print a usage message on standard output and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Run in interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C file <br>
Use binary star parameters from a configuration file instead
of giving them on the command line. Sample configuration
files are in share/nightfall/cfg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G[P|S|1|2] <br>
Plot a graph of the lightcurve after its computation (P|S -
zoom on primary/secondary eclipse, 1|2 - plot 1/2
orbits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Generate an animated view of
the binary star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V[v|i|c|a] <br>
Visualize the geometry of the binary star system (v - view
of the stars, i - image of the potential, c - contour plot
of the potential, a - all of them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Send plot to a postscript
file. If the postscript file exists, it will be
overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B[U|B|V|I|R|J|H|K|u|v|b|y|1|2]
<br>
Select the filter/bandpass for which the lightcurve should
be plotted. U-K range from ultraviolett to infrared, best
match to the human eye is V. u-y are narrow-band <br>
filters. 1|2 will select radial velocity curves instead of a
light curve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fP/-fS value <br>
By default, nightfall assumes synchroneous rotation, which
means that the stars are rotating with the orbital period,
and thus show each other always the same &rsquo;side&rsquo;.
<br>
With this option, you can set the ratio of stellar rotation
frequency to orbital frequency to some value different from
one, seperately for the primary P and the secondary <br>
S.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e eccentricity
periastron_length <br>
By default, nightfall assumes the orbit to be circular. With
this option, you can set the eccentricity of the orbit (0 is
circular, maximum is less than 1), and the peri&acirc; <br>
astron length, which is the point of closest approach of the
two stars in their orbit (0 - 360 degree).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sP/-sS longitude latitude
radius dimfactor <br>
Place a spot on the primary (P) or secondary (S). The spot
parameters are the location of the spot
(longitude,latitude), its radius, and the dimfactor by which
the tem&acirc; <br>
perature is reduced (or increased) within the spot area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tP/-tM/-tD value <br>
Set the absolute value for the orbital period P (in days),
the total mass M (in units of solar masses), and/or the
orbital separation D (in solar radii) of the system. Any
<br>
two of these are independent, the third is then calculated
from Kepler&rsquo;s laws (i.e., you should set only two of
these).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
Read in observational data from a data file. Sample data
files are in share/nightfall/data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D[vwb] <br>
Diagnostic output (v - verbose, w - warnings, b - status
messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The definition of primary/secondary is inverse to the usual
convention in astronomy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, the size of a star in
a binary system is limited by the orbital separation of the
two stars. Instead of having to calculate the maximum useful
stellar size herself, <br>
the user simply gives the desired stellar size as a fraction
(0.001-1.3) of the maximum polar radius of the star (which
is calculated by the program). In the output file
Night&acirc; <br>
fallCurve.dat, you will then find the &rsquo;real&rsquo;
size of the star(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no absolute values for total
mass and orbital period/separation are given, the program
will use some default values (mass = two solar masses,
orbital separation = distance <br>
earth-sun). In this case, sizes/masses/velocities given in
absolute units (e.g. kg, m, m/s, solar masses/radii) are
fictuous only - they would be valid only for a system with
<br>
the assumed default values of total mass and orbital
separation.</p>
