BeakerLib - infrastructure - mounting, backup and service
helpers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
BeakerLib functions providing checking and mounting NFS
shares, backing up and restoring files and controlling
running services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS <br>
Mounting <br>
rlMount</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create mount point (if
neccessary) and mount a NFS share.</p>

was successful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlCheckMount</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check either if a directory is a
mountpoint, if it is a mountpoint to a specific server, or
if it is a mountpoint to a specific export on a specific
server and if it uses <br>
specific mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlCheckMount [-o MOUNT_OPTS]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With one parameter, returns 0
when specified directory exists and is a mountpoint. With
two parameters, returns 0 when specific directory exists, is
a mountpoint and an export <br>
from specific server is mounted there. With three
parameters, returns 0 if a specific shared directory is
mounted on a given server on a given mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -o option is provided,
returns 0 if the mountpoint uses all the given options, 2
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlAssertMount</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assertion making sure that given
directory is a mount point, if it is a mountpoint to a

parameters, returns 0 if a specific shared directory is
mounted on a given server on a given mountpoint. Asserts
PASS when the <br>
condition is true.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -o option is provided,
asserts PASS if the above conditions are met and the
mountpoint uses all the given options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlHash, rlUnhash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hashes/Unhashes given
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlHash [--decode] [--algorithm

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--decode <br>
Unhash given string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--algorithm <br>
Use given hash algorithm. Currently supported algorithms:
<br>
base64 <br>
base64_ - this is standard base64 where &rsquo;=&rsquo; is
replaced by &rsquo;_&rsquo; <br>
hex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to hex. Default
algorithm can be override using global variable
rlHashAlgorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
Get the string from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRING <br>
String to be hashed/unhashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns 0 if success.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example with --clean:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hash=rlHash &quot;text&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backup and Restore <br>
rlFileBackup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a backup of files or
directories (recursive). Can be used multiple times to add
more files to backup. Backing up an already backed up file
overwrites the original backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlFileBackup [--clean]
[--namespace name] [--missing-ok|--no-missing-ok] file
[file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use &quot;rlRun&quot;
for asserting the result but keep in mind meaning of exit
codes, especialy exit code 8, if using without --clean
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean <br>
If this option is provided (have to be first option of the
command), then file/dir backuped using this command
(provided in next options) will be (recursively) removed
before <br>
we will restore it. This option implies --missing-ok, this
can be overridden by --no-missing-ok.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--namespace name <br>
Specifies the namespace to use. Namespaces can be used to
separate backups and their restoration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--missing-ok <br>
Do not raise an error in case of missing file to backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-missing-ok <br>
Do raise an error in case of missing file to backup. This is
useful with --clean. This behaviour can be globally set by
global variable <br>
BEAKERLIB_FILEBACKUP_MISSING_OK=false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file <br>
Files and/or directories to be backed up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns 0 if the backup was
successful. Returns 1 if parsing of parameters was not
successful. Returns 2 if no files specification was
provided. Returns 3 if BEAKERLIB_DIR <br>
variable is not set, e.g. rlJournalStart was not executed.
Returns 4 if creating of main backup destination directories
was not successful. Returns 5 if creating of file <br>
specific backup destination directories was not successful.
Returns 6 if the copy of backed up files was not successful.
Returns 7 if attributes of backedup files were not <br>
successfuly copied. Returns 8 if backed up files does not
exist. This can be suppressed based on other options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example with --clean:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch cleandir/aaa <br>
rlRun &quot;rlFileBackup --clean cleandir/&quot; <br>
touch cleandir/bbb <br>
ls cleandir/ <br>
aaa bbb <br>
rlRun &quot;rlFileRestore&quot; <br>
ls cleandir/ <br>
aaa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlFileRestore</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restore backed up files to their
original location. &quot;rlFileRestore&quot; does not remove
new files appearing after backup has been made. If you
don&rsquo;t want to leave anything behind <br>
just remove the whole original tree before running
&quot;rlFileRestore&quot;, or see &quot;--clean&quot; option
of &quot;rlFileBackup&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlFileRestore [--namespace
name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use &quot;rlRun&quot;
for asserting the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--namespace name <br>
Specifies the namespace to use. Namespaces can be used to
separate backups and their restoration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns 0 if backup dir is found
and files are restored successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return code bits meaning XXXXX
<br>
||||| <br>
||||_ error parsing parameters <br>
|||__ could not find backup directory <br>
||___ files cleanup failed <br>
|____ files restore failed <br>
_____ no files were restored nor cleaned</p>

start/stop system services with the possibility to restore
them to their original state after testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlServiceStart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the given
&quot;service&quot; is running with fresh configuration.
(Start it if it is stopped and restart if it is already
running.) In addition, when called for the first time, <br>
the current state is saved so that the &quot;service&quot;
can be restored to its original state when testing is
finished, see &quot;rlServiceRestore&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the given
&quot;service&quot; is stopped. Stop it if it is running and
do nothing when it is already stopped. In addition, when

start/stop system sockets with the possibility to restore
them to their original state after testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlSocketStart</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure the given
&quot;socket&quot; is running. (Start it if stopped, leave

called).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning !!! Xinetd process [even
though it might have been used] is NOT restored. It is
recommended to call rlServiceRestore xinetd as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlSocketRestore socket
[socket...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">socket <br>
Name of the socket(s) to restore to original state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns number of sockets which
failed to get back to their original state; thus zero is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cleanup management <br>
Cleanup management works with a so-called cleanup buffer,
which is a temporary representation of what should be run at
cleanup time, and a final cleanup script (executable), <br>
which is generated from this buffer and wraps it using
BeakerLib essentials (journal initialization, cleanup phase,
...). The cleanup script must always be updated on an atomic
<br>
basis (filesystem-wise) to allow an asynchronous execution
by a third party (ie. test watcher).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The test watcher usage is
mandatory for the cleanup management system to work properly
as it is the test watcher that executes the actual cleanup
script. Limited, catastrophe- <br>
avoiding mechanism is in place even when the test is not run
in test watcher, but that should be seen as a backup and
such situation is to be avoided whenever possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cleanup script shares all
environment (variables, exported or not, and functions) with
the test itself - the cleanup append/prepend functions
&quot;sample&quot; or &quot;snapshot&quot; the <br>
environment at the time of their call, IOW any changes to
the test environment are synchronized to the cleanup script
only upon calling append/prepend. When the append/prepend
<br>
functions are called within a function which has local
variables, these will appear as global in the cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the cleanup script
receives $PWD from the test, its working dir is set to the
initial test execution dir even if $PWD contains something
else. It is impossible to use <br>
relative paths inside cleanup reliably - certain parts of
the cleanup might have been added under different current
directories (CWDs). Therefore always use absolute paths in
<br>
append/prepend cleanup or make sure you never
&rsquo;cd&rsquo; elsewhere (ie. to a TmpDir).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlCleanupAppend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Appends a string to the cleanup
buffer and recreates the cleanup script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlCleanupAppend string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns 0 if the operation was
successful, 1 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlCleanupPrepend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prepends a string to the cleanup
buffer and recreates the cleanup script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rlCleanupPrepend string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Returns 0 if the operation was
successful, 1 otherwise.</p>
