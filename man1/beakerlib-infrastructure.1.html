  BEAKERLIB_DIR variable is not set, e.g. rlJournalStart was not executed.
  Returns 4 if creating of main backup destination directories was not
  successful. Returns 5 if creating of file specific backup destination
  directories was not successful. Returns 6 if the copy of backed up files was
  not successful. Returns 7 if attributes of backedup files were not successfuly
  copied. Returns 8 if backed up files does not exist. This can be suppressed
  based on other options.

Restore backed up files to their original location. &quot;rlFileRestore&quot;
  does not remove new files appearing after backup has been made. If you don't
  want to leave anything behind just remove the whole original tree before
  running &quot;rlFileRestore&quot;, or see &quot;--clean&quot; option of
  &quot;rlFileBackup&quot;.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cleanup_management"><a class="selflink" href="#Cleanup_management">Cleanup
  management</a></h2>
Cleanup management works with a so-called cleanup buffer, which is a temporary
  representation of what should be run at cleanup time, and a final cleanup
  script (executable), which is generated from this buffer and wraps it using
  BeakerLib essentials (journal initialization, cleanup phase, ...). The cleanup
  script must always be updated on an atomic basis (filesystem-wise) to allow an
  asynchronous execution by a third party (ie. test watcher).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The test watcher usage is mandatory for the cleanup management system to work
  properly as it is the test watcher that executes the actual cleanup script.
  Limited, catastrophe-avoiding mechanism is in place even when the test is not
  run in test watcher, but that should be seen as a backup and such situation is
  to be avoided whenever possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The cleanup script shares all environment (variables, exported or not, and
  functions) with the test itself - the cleanup append/prepend functions
  &quot;sample&quot; or &quot;snapshot&quot; the environment at the time of
  their call, IOW any changes to the test environment are synchronized to the
  cleanup script only upon calling append/prepend. When the append/prepend
  functions are called within a function which has local variables, these will
  appear as global in the cleanup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the cleanup script receives $PWD from the test, its working dir is set to
  the initial test execution dir even if $PWD contains something else. It is
  impossible to use relative paths inside cleanup reliably - certain parts of
  the cleanup might have been added under different current directories (CWDs).
  Therefore always use absolute paths in append/prepend cleanup or make sure you
  never 'cd' elsewhere (ie. to a TmpDir).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>rlCleanupAppend</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Appends a string to the cleanup buffer and recreates the cleanup script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    rlCleanupAppend string
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Returns 0 if the operation was successful, 1 otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>rlCleanupPrepend</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prepends a string to the cleanup buffer and recreates the cleanup script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    rlCleanupPrepend string
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Returns 0 if the operation was successful, 1 otherwise.
