<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
paxtar &acirc; tape archiver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
paxtar {crtux}[014578AabefHhJjLmNOoPRSpqsvwXZz]
[blocking-factor | archive | replstr] [-C directory] [-I
file] [file ...] <br>
paxtar {-crtux} [-014578AaeHhJjLmNOoPpqRSvwXZz] [-b
blocking-factor] [-C directory] [-f archive] [-I file] [-M
flag] [-s replstr] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The paxtar command creates, adds files to, or extracts files
from an archive file in &acirc;tar&acirc; format. A tar
archive is often stored on a magnetic tape, but can be
stored equally well <br>
on a floppy, CD-ROM, or in a regular disk file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first (legacy) form, all
option flags except for -C and -I must be contained within
the first argument to paxtar and must not be prefixed by a
hyphen (&acirc;-&acirc;). Option argu&acirc; <br>
ments, if any, are processed as subsequent arguments to
paxtar and are processed in the order in which their
corresponding option flags have been presented on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second and preferred
form, option flags may be given in any order and are
immediately followed by their corresponding option argument
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One of the following flags must
be present:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Create new archive, or
overwrite an existing archive, adding the specified files to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Append the named new files to
existing archive. Note that this will only work on media on
which an end-of-file mark can be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t List contents of archive. If
any files are named on the command line, only those files
will be listed. The file arguments may be specified as glob
patterns (see glob(3) <br>
for more information), in which case paxtar will list all
archive members that match each pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Alias for -r.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Extract files from archive.
If any files are named on the command line, only those files
will be extracted from the archive. The file arguments may
be specified as glob <br>
patterns (see glob(3) for more information), in which case
paxtar will extract all archive members that match each
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one copy of a file
exists in the archive, later copies will overwrite earlier
copies during extraction. The file mode and modification
time are preserved if <br>
possible. The file mode is subject to modification by the
umask(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the flags
mentioned above, any of the following flags may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Write Unix Archiver libraries
instead of tape archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Guess the compression utility
based on the archive filename. Inability to guess will
result in quietly not using any compression. This option
only exists for semi-compat&acirc; <br>
ibility with GNU tar; it is strongly recommended to archive
to stdout and pipe into an external compression utility with
appropriate arguments instead:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tar -cf - foo | xz -2e
&gt;foo.txz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocking-factor <br>
Set blocking factor to use for the archive. paxtar uses
512-byte blocks. The default is 20, the maximum is 126.
Archives with a blocking factor larger than 63 violate <br>
the POSIX standard and will not be portable to all
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C directory <br>
This is a positional argument which sets the working
directory for the following files. When extracting, files
will be extracted into the specified directory; when
creat&acirc; <br>
ing, the specified files will be matched from the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Stop after the first
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f archive <br>
Filename where the archive is stored. Defaults to /dev/rst0.
If set to hyphen (&acirc;-&acirc;) standard output is used.
See also the TAPE environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Follow symlinks given on the
command line only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Follow symbolic links as if
they were normal files or directories. In extract mode this
means that a directory entry in the archive will not
overwrite an existing symbolic <br>
link, but rather what the link ultimately points to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
This is a positional argument which reads the names of files
to archive or extract from the given file, one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J Use the xz utility to
compress the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Use the bzip2 utility to
compress the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L Synonym for the -h
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M flag <br>
Configure the archive normaliser. flag is either a numeric
value compatible to strtonum(3) which is directly stored in
the flags word, or one of the following values, <br>
optionally prefixed with &acirc;no-&acirc; to turn them
off:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inodes 0x0001: Serialise inodes,
zero device info. <br>
(cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc) <br>
links 0x0002: Store content of hard links only once. <br>
(cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc) <br>
mtime 0x0004: Zero out the file modification time. <br>
(ar, cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc, ustar) <br>
uidgid 0x0008: Set owner to 0:0 (root:wheel). <br>
(ar, cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc, ustar) <br>
verb 0x0010: Debug this option. <br>
debug 0x0020: Debug file header storage. <br>
lncp 0x0040: Extract hard links by copy if link fails. <br>
numid 0x0080: Use only numeric uid and gid values. <br>
(ustar) <br>
gslash 0x0100: Append a slash after directory names. <br>
(ustar) <br>
set 0x0003: Keep ownership and mtime intact. <br>
dist 0x008B: Clean everything except mtime. <br>
norm 0x008F: Clean everything. <br>
root 0x0089: Clean owner and device information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating an archive and
verbosely listing output, these normalisation operations are
not reflected in the output, because they are made only
after the output has been <br>
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only implemented
for the ar, cpio, sv4cpio, sv4crc, and ustar file format
writing routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Do not preserve modification
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Same as -M numid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O If reading, extract files to
standard output. <br>
If writing, write old-style (non-POSIX) archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o If writing, write old-style
(non-POSIX) archives. Don&rsquo;t write directory
information that the older (V7) style tar is unable to
decode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P For security reasons, paxtar
skips pathnames containing dotdot (&acirc;..&acirc;)
components and strips leading slashes (&acirc;/&acirc;) from
pathnames by default; this option disables that be&acirc;
<br>
haviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Preserve user and group ID as
well as file mode regardless of the current umask(2). The
setuid and setgid bits are only preserved if the user and
group ID could be pre&acirc; <br>
served. Only meaningful in conjunction with the -x flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Select the first archive
member that matches each file operand. No more than one
archive member is matched for each file. When members of
type directory are matched, the <br>
file hierarchy rooted at that directory is also matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Write SysVR4 CPIO files
instead of tar or POSIX ustar files. Serialise inode
numbers, zero out device information. The file content of
hard links is stored only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Write SysVR4 CPIO files with
CRC instead of tar or POSIX ustar files. Serialise inode
numbers, zero out device information. The file content of
hard links is stored only <br>
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s replstr <br>
Modify the archive member names according to the
substitution expression replstr, using the syntax of the
ed(1) utility regular expressions. file arguments may be
given to <br>
restrict the list of archive members to those specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of these regular
expressions is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/old/new/[gp]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As in ed(1), old is a basic
regular expression (see re_format(7)) and new can contain an
ampersand (&acirc;&amp;&acirc;), &acirc;0 (where n is a
digit) back-references, or subexpression match&acirc; <br>
ing. The old string may also contain newline characters. Any
non-null character can be used as a delimiter
(&acirc;/&acirc; is shown here). Multiple -s expressions can
be specified. <br>
The expressions are applied in the order they are specified
on the command line, terminating with the first successful
substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional trailing g
continues to apply the substitution expression to the
pathname substring, which starts with the first character
following the end of the last suc&acirc; <br>
cessful substitution. The first unsuccessful substitution
stops the operation of the g option. The optional trailing p
will cause the final result of a successful substi&acirc;
<br>
tution to be written to standard error in the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">original-pathname &gt;&gt;
new-pathname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File or archive member names
that substitute to the empty string are not selected and
will be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Interactively rename files.
This option causes paxtar to prompt the user for the
filename to use when storing or extracting files in an
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Do not cross mount points in
the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Use the compress(1) utility
to compress the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use the gzip(1) utility to
compress the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options [-014578] can be
used to select one of the compiled-in backup devices,
/dev/rstN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TMPDIR Path in which to store temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TAPE Default tape device to use
instead of /dev/rst0. If set to hyphen (&acirc;-&acirc;)
standard output is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/dev/rst0 default archive name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The paxtar utility exits with one of the following
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 All files were processed
successfully. <br>
1 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Create an archive on the default tape drive, containing the
files named bonvole and sekve:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ paxtar c bonvole sekve</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output a gzip(1) compressed
archive containing the files bonvole and sekve to a file
called foriru.tar.gz:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ paxtar zcf foriru.tar.gz
bonvole sekve</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosely create an archive,
called backup.tar.gz, of all files matching the shell
glob(3) function *.c:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ paxtar zcvf backup.tar.gz
*.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbosely list, but do not
extract, all files ending in .jpeg from a compressed archive
named backup.tar.gz. Note that the glob pattern has been
quoted to avoid expansion by the <br>
shell:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ paxtar tvzf backup.tar.gz
&rsquo;*.jpeg&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more detailed examples, see
pax(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Whenever paxtar cannot create a file or a link when
extracting an archive or cannot find a file while writing an
archive, or cannot preserve the user ID, group ID, file
mode, or <br>
access and modification times when the -p option is
specified, a diagnostic message is written to standard error
and a non-zero exit value will be returned, but processing
will <br>
continue. In the case where paxtar cannot create a link to a
file, unless -M lncp is given, paxtar will not create a
second copy of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the extraction of a file from
an archive is prematurely terminated by a signal or error,
paxtar may have only partially extracted the file the user
wanted. Additionally, the <br>
file modes of extracted files and directories may have
incorrect file bits, and the modification and access times
may be wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the creation of an archive is
prematurely terminated by a signal or error, paxtar may have
only partially created the archive, which may violate the
specific archive format <br>
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The flags -AaJjLMNRS are not portable to other
implementations of tar where they may have a different
meaning or not exist at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The pax file format is not yet supported.</p>
