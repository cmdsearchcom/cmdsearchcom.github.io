<p>X3270IF(1) General Commands Manual X3270IF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
x3270if - command interface to x3270, c3270 and s3270</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
x3270if [option]... [ action ] <br>
x3270if -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
x3270if provides an interface between scripts and the 3270
emulators x3270, c3270, and s3270.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x3270if operates in one of two
modes. In action mode, it passes a single action and
parameters to the emulator for execution. The result of the
action is written to standard <br>
output, along with the (optional) status of the emulator.
(The action is optional as well, so that x3270if can just
reports the emulator status.) In iterative mode, it forms a
<br>
continuous conduit between a script and the emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The action takes the form:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">action-name(param[,param]...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parentheses are manatory,
and usually must be quoted when x3270if is called from a
shell script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any param contains a space or
comma, it must be surrounded by double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s field <br>
Causes x3270if to write to stdout the value of one of the
emulator status fields. Field is an integer in the range 0
through 11. The value 0 is a no-op and is used only <br>
to return exit status indicating the state of the emulator.
The indices 1-11 and meanings of each field are documented
on the x3270-script(1) manual page. If an action <br>
is specified as well, the status field is written after the
output of the action, separated by a newline. The -s option
is mutually exclusive with the -S and -i options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Causes x3270if to write to
stdout the value of all of the emulator status fields. If an
action is specified as well, the status fields are written
after the output of the <br>
action, separated by a newline. The -S option is mutually
exclusive with the -s and -i options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Puts x3270if in iterative
mode. Data from x3270if&rsquo;s standard input is copied to
the emulator&rsquo;s script input; data from the
emulator&rsquo;s script output is copied to x3270if&rsquo;s
<br>
standard output. The -i option is mutually exclusive with
the -s and -S options. x3270if runs until it detects
end-of-file on its standard input or on the output from <br>
the emulator. (This mode exists primarily to give expect(1)
a process to run, on systems which do not support
bidirectional pipes.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p process-id <br>
Causes x3270if to use a Unix-domain socket to connect to the
emulator, rather than pipe file descriptors given in
environment variables. The emulator must have been <br>
started with the -socket option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t port <br>
Causes x3270if to use a TCP socket to connect to the
emulator, rather than pipe file descriptors given in
environment variables. The emulator must have been started
with <br>
the -scriptport option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Turns on verbose debug
messages, showing on stderr the literal data that is passed
between the emulator and x3270if.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
In action mode, if the requested action succeeds, x3270if
exits with status 0. If the action fails, x3270if exits with
status 1. In iterative mode, x3270if exits with status 0
<br>
when it encounters end-of-file. If there is an operational
error within x3270if itself, such as a command-line syntax
error, missing environment variable, or an unexpectedly <br>
closed pipe, x3270if exits with status 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
When a script is run as a child process of one of the
emulators via the Script action, the emulator passes
information about how to control it in environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Unix, the emulator process
creates a pair of pipes for communication with the child
script process. The values of the file descriptors for these
pipes are encoded as text in <br>
two environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X3270OUTPUT <br>
Output from the emulator, input to the child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X3270INPUT <br>
Input to the emulator, output from the child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Windows, or when a Unix
emulator is started with the -scriptport option, the
emulator will pass the port number encoded as text in the
X3270PORT environment variable. x3270if <br>
will use that value as if it had been passed to it via the
-t option. X3270PORT takes precedence over X3270OUTPUT and
X3270INPUT.</p>
