<b>x3270if</b> provides an interface between scripts and the 3270 emulators
  <i>x3270</i>, <i>c3270</i>, and <i>s3270</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>x3270if</b> operates in one of two modes. In <b>action mode</b>, it passes a
  single action and parameters to the emulator for execution. The result of the
  action is written to standard output, along with the (optional) status of the
  emulator. (The action is optional as well, so that <b>x3270if</b> can just
  reports the emulator status.) In <b>iterative mode</b>, it forms a continuous
  conduit between a script and the emulator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>action</i> takes the form:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>action-name</i>(<i>param</i>[,<i>param</i>]...)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The parentheses are manatory, and usually must be quoted when <b>x3270if</b> is
  called from a shell script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If any <i>param</i> contains a space or comma, it must be surrounded by double
  quotes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b> <i>field</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>x3270if</b> to write to stdout the value of one
      of the emulator status fields. <i>Field</i> is an integer in the range 0
      through 11. The value 0 is a no-op and is used only to return exit status
      indicating the state of the emulator. The indices 1-11 and meanings of
      each field are documented on the <i>x3270-script</i>(1) manual page. If an
      <i>action</i> is specified as well, the status field is written after the
      output of the action, separated by a newline. The <b>-s</b> option is
      mutually exclusive with the <b>-S</b> and <b>-i</b> options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-S</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Causes <b>x3270if</b> to write to stdout the value of all
      of the emulator status fields. If an <i>action</i> is specified as well,
      the status fields are written after the output of the action, separated by
      a newline. The <b>-S</b> option is mutually exclusive with the <b>-s</b>

      data from the emulator's script output is copied to <b>x3270if</b>'s
      standard output. The <b>-i</b> option is mutually exclusive with the
      <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b> options. <b>x3270if</b> runs until it detects
      end-of-file on its standard input or on the output from the emulator.
      (This mode exists primarily to give <i>expect</i>(1) a process to run, on
      systems which do not support bidirectional pipes.)</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
In action mode, if the requested <i>action</i> succeeds, <b>x3270if</b> exits
  with status 0. If the action fails, <b>x3270if</b> exits with status 1. In
  iterative mode, <b>x3270if</b> exits with status 0 when it encounters
  end-of-file. If there is an operational error within <b>x3270if</b> itself,
  such as a command-line syntax error, missing environment variable, or an
  unexpectedly closed pipe, <b>x3270if</b> exits with status 2.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
When a script is run as a child process of one of the emulators via the
  <b>Script</b> action, the emulator passes information about how to control it
  in environment variables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Unix, the emulator process creates a pair of pipes for communication with the
  child script process. The values of the file descriptors for these pipes are
  encoded as text in two environment variables:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>X3270OUTPUT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Output from the emulator, input to the child process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>X3270INPUT</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Input to the emulator, output from the child process.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On Windows, or when a Unix emulator is started with the <b>-scriptport</b>
  option, the emulator will pass the port number encoded as text in the
  <b>X3270PORT</b> environment variable. <i>x3270if</i> will use that value as
  if it had been passed to it via the <b>-t</b> option. <b>X3270PORT</b> takes
  precedence over <b>X3270OUTPUT</b> and <b>X3270INPUT</b>.
