<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-worktree - Manage multiple working trees</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git worktree add [-f] [--detach] [--checkout] [-b
&lt;new-branch&gt;] &lt;path&gt; [&lt;branch&gt;] <br>
git worktree list [--porcelain] <br>
git worktree lock [--reason &lt;string&gt;] &lt;worktree&gt;
<br>
git worktree prune [-n] [-v] [--expire &lt;expire&gt;] <br>
git worktree unlock &lt;worktree&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Manage multiple working trees attached to the same
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A git repository can support
multiple working trees, allowing you to check out more than
one branch at a time. With git worktree add a new working
tree is associated with the <br>
repository. This new working tree is called a &quot;linked
working tree&quot; as opposed to the &quot;main working
tree&quot; prepared by &quot;git init&quot; or &quot;git
clone&quot;. A repository has one main working <br>
tree (if it&acirc;s not a bare repository) and zero or more
linked working trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are done with a linked
working tree you can simply delete it. The working
tree&acirc;s administrative files in the repository (see
&quot;DETAILS&quot; below) will eventually be removed <br>
automatically (see gc.worktreePruneExpire in git-config(1)),
or you can run git worktree prune in the main or any linked
working tree to clean up any stale administrative files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you move a linked working
tree, you need to manually update the administrative files
so that they do not get pruned automatically. See section
&quot;DETAILS&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a linked working tree is
stored on a portable device or network share which is not
always mounted, you can prevent its administrative files
from being pruned by issuing the <br>
git worktree lock command, optionally specifying --reason to
explain why the working tree is locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;branch&gt;] <br>
Create &lt;path&gt; and checkout &lt;branch&gt; into it. The
new working directory is linked to the current repository,
sharing everything except working directory specific files
such as <br>
HEAD, index, etc. - may also be specified as &lt;branch&gt;;
it is synonymous with @{-1}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lt;branch&gt; is omitted and
neither -b nor -B nor --detached used, then, as a
convenience, a new branch based at HEAD is created
automatically, as if -b $(basename &lt;path&gt;) was <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list <br>
List details of each worktree. The main worktree is listed
first, followed by each of the linked worktrees. The output
details include if the worktree is bare, the revision <br>
currently checked out, and the branch currently checked out
(or detached HEAD if none).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock <br>
If a working tree is on a portable device or network share
which is not always mounted, lock it to prevent its
administrative files from being pruned automatically. This
also <br>
prevents it from being moved or deleted. Optionally, specify
a reason for the lock with --reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prune <br>
Prune working tree information in $GIT_DIR/worktrees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlock <br>
Unlock a working tree, allowing it to be pruned, moved or
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f, --force <br>
By default, add refuses to create a new working tree when
&lt;branch&gt; is already checked out by another working
tree. This option overrides that safeguard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;new-branch&gt;, -B
&lt;new-branch&gt; <br>
With add, create a new branch named &lt;new-branch&gt;
starting at &lt;branch&gt;, and check out &lt;new-branch&gt;
into the new working tree. If &lt;branch&gt; is omitted, it
defaults to HEAD. By <br>
default, -b refuses to create a new branch if it already
exists. -B overrides this safeguard, resetting
&lt;new-branch&gt; to &lt;branch&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detach <br>
With add, detach HEAD in the new working tree. See
&quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot; in git-checkout(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--[no-]checkout <br>
By default, add checks out &lt;branch&gt;, however,
--no-checkout can be used to suppress checkout in order to
make customizations, such as configuring sparse-checkout.
See &quot;Sparse <br>
checkout&quot; in git-read-tree(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
With prune, do not remove anything; just report what it
would remove.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--porcelain <br>
With list, output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts.
This format will remain stable across Git versions and
regardless of user configuration. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
With prune, report all removals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--expire &lt;time&gt; <br>
With prune, only expire unused working trees older than
&lt;time&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reason &lt;string&gt; <br>
With lock, an explanation why the working tree is
locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;worktree&gt; <br>
Working trees can be identified by path, either relative or
absolute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the last path components in
the working tree&acirc;s path is unique among working trees,
it can be used to identify worktrees. For example if you
only have two working trees, at <br>
&quot;/abc/def/ghi&quot; and &quot;/abc/def/ggg&quot;, then
&quot;ghi&quot; or &quot;def/ghi&quot; is enough to point to
the former working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETAILS <br>
Each linked working tree has a private sub-directory in the
repository&acirc;s $GIT_DIR/worktrees directory. The private
sub-directory&acirc;s name is usually the base name of the
linked <br>
working tree&acirc;s path, possibly appended with a number
to make it unique. For example, when
$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git the command git worktree add
/path/other/test-next next creates <br>
the linked working tree in /path/other/test-next and also
creates a $GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next directory (or
$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1 if test-next is already
taken).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within a linked working tree,
$GIT_DIR is set to point to this private directory (e.g.
/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next in the example) and
$GIT_COMMON_DIR is set to point <br>
back to the main working tree&acirc;s $GIT_DIR (e.g.
/path/main/.git). These settings are made in a .git file
located at the top directory of the linked working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Path resolution via git
rev-parse --git-path uses either $GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR
depending on the path. For example, in the linked working
tree git rev-parse --git-path HEAD <br>
returns /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD (not
/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD or /path/main/.git/HEAD)
while git rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/master uses <br>
$GIT_COMMON_DIR and returns
/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master, since refs are shared
across all working trees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See gitrepository-layout(5) for
more information. The rule of thumb is do not make any
assumption about whether a path belongs to $GIT_DIR or
$GIT_COMMON_DIR when you need to <br>
directly access something inside $GIT_DIR. Use git rev-parse
--git-path to get the final path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you move a linked working
tree, you need to update the gitdir file in the
entry&acirc;s directory. For example, if a linked working
tree is moved to /newpath/test-next and its .git <br>
file points to /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next, then
update /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir to
reference /newpath/test-next instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To prevent a $GIT_DIR/worktrees
entry from being pruned (which can be useful in some
situations, such as when the entry&acirc;s working tree is
stored on a portable device), use the <br>
git worktree lock command, which adds a file named locked to
the entry&acirc;s directory. The file contains the reason in
plain text. For example, if a linked working tree&acirc;s
.git file <br>
points to /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next then a file
named /path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked will
prevent the test-next entry from being pruned. See
gitrepository- <br>
layout(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIST OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
The worktree list command has two output formats. The
default format shows the details on a single line with
columns. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S git worktree list <br>
/path/to/bare-source (bare) <br>
/path/to/linked-worktree abcd1234 [master] <br>
/path/to/other-linked-worktree 1234abc (detached HEAD)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Porcelain Format <br>
The porcelain format has a line per attribute. Attributes
are listed with a label and value separated by a single
space. Boolean attributes (like bare and detached) are
listed as <br>
a label only, and are only present if and only if the value
is true. An empty line indicates the end of a worktree. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S git worktree list --porcelain
<br>
worktree /path/to/bare-source <br>
bare</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">worktree
/path/to/linked-worktree <br>
HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234 <br>
branch refs/heads/master</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">worktree
/path/to/other-linked-worktree <br>
HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a <br>
detached</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss
comes in and demands that you fix something immediately. You
might typically use git-stash(1) to store your changes <br>
away temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a
state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and
other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&acirc;t
want to <br>
risk disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary
linked working tree to make the emergency fix, remove it
when done, and then resume your earlier refactoring
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree add -b
emergency-fix ../temp master <br>
$ pushd ../temp <br>
# ... hack hack hack ... <br>
$ git commit -a -m &rsquo;emergency fix for boss&rsquo; <br>
$ popd <br>
$ rm -rf ../temp <br>
$ git worktree prune</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Multiple checkout in general is still experimental, and the
support for submodules is incomplete. It is NOT recommended
to make multiple checkouts of a superproject.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git-worktree could provide more
automation for tasks currently performed manually, such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; remove to remove
a linked working tree and its administrative files (and warn
if the working tree is dirty)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mv to move or
rename a working tree and update its administrative
files</p>
