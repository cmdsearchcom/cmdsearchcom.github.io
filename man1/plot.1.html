<p>PLOT(1) GNU Plotting Utilities PLOT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
plot - translate GNU metafiles to other graphics formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
plot [ options ] [ files ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
plot translates files in GNU metafile format to other
graphics formats, or displays them on an X Window System
display. GNU metafile format is a device-independent format
for <br>
the storage of graphic data. It is the default output format
of the programs graph(1), pic2plot(1), tek2plot(1), and
plotfont(1), and is further documented in plot(5), since it
<br>
is an enhanced version of the traditional plot(5) format
found on non-GNU systems. It can also be produced by the GNU
libplot 2-D graphics export library (see plot(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is specified
with the -T option. The possible output formats and display
types are the same as those supported by graph(1),
plotfont(1), pic2plot(1), and <br>
tek2plot(1). If an output file is produced, it is written to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and file names may be
interspersed on the command line, but the options are
processed before the file names are read. If -- is seen, it
is interpreted as the end of the <br>
options. If no file names are specified, or the file name -
is encountered, the standard input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
General Options <br>
-T type <br>
--output-format type <br>
Select type as the output format. It may be &quot;X&quot;,
&quot;png&quot;, &quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;,
&quot;svg&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;,
&quot;cgm&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;pcl&quot;,
&quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, or
&quot;meta&quot; (the default). These <br>
refer respectively to the X Window System, PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) format, portable anymap format
(PBM/PGM/PPM), a pseudo-GIF format that does not use LZW
encod&acirc; <br>
ing, the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format, the
format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript or Encapsulated
Postscript (EPS) that can be edited with idraw(1), <br>
CGM format (by default, confirming to the WebCGM profile),
the format used by the xfig(1) drawing editor, the
Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer language, the Hewlett-Packard
<br>
Graphics Language, ReGIS graphics format (which can be
displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or by a VT330
or VT340 terminal), Tektronix format (which can be
dis&acirc; <br>
played by the xterm(1) terminal emulator), and
device-independent GNU metafile format itself. Unless type
is &quot;X&quot;, an output file is produced and written to
standard out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Omitting the -T option is
equivalent to specifying -T meta. Translating from metafile
format to itself is occasionally useful, since there are two
versions of metafile <br>
format (see the -O option below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A listing of the fonts available
in any specified output format may be obtained with the
--help-fonts option (see below). If a requested font is
unavailable, a default <br>
font will be substituted. The default font is
&quot;Helvetica&quot; for &quot;X&quot;, &quot;svg&quot;,
&quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;, and
&quot;fig&quot;, &quot;Univers&quot; for &quot;pcl&quot;,
and &quot;HersheySerif&quot; for &quot;png&quot;,
&quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;, <br>
&quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, and
&quot;meta&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p n <br>
--page-number n <br>
Output only page number n, within the metafile or sequence
of metafiles that is being translated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metafiles may consist of one or
more pages, numbered beginning with 1. Also, each page may
contain multiple &lsquo;frames&rsquo;. plot -T X, plot -T
regis, and plot -T tek, which <br>
plot in real time, will separate successive frames by screen
erasures. plot -T png, plot -T pnm, plot -T gif, plot -T
svg, plot -T ai, plot -T ps, plot -T cgm, plot -T <br>
fig, plot -T pcl, and plot -T hpgl, which do not plot in
real time, will output only the last frame of any
multi-frame page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behavior, if -p is
not used, is to output all pages. For example, plot -T X
displays each page in its own X window. If the -T png, -T
pnm, -T gif, -T ai, or <br>
-T fig option is used, the default behavior is to output
only the first nonempty page, since files in those output
formats contain only a single page of graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Metafiles produced by graph(1)
and plotfont(1) contain only a single page (page #1), which
consists of two frames: an empty frame to clear the display,
and a second frame <br>
that contains the graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--merge-pages <br>
Merge all displayed pages into a single page, and also merge
all &lsquo;frames&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is useful when
merging together single-page plots from different sources.
For example, it can be used to merge together plots obtained
from separate invoca&acirc; <br>
tions of graph(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bitmap-size bitmap_size <br>
Set the size of the graphics display in which the plot will
be drawn, in terms of pixels, to be bitmap_size. The default
is &quot;570x570&quot;. This is relevant only to plot -T
<br>
X, plot -T png, plot -T pnm, and plot -T gif, all of which
produce bitmaps. If you choose a rectangular (non-square)
window size, the fonts in the plot will be scaled an&acirc;
<br>
isotropically, i.e., by different factors in the horizontal
and vertical directions. For plot -T X, this requires an
X11R6 display. Any font that cannot be scaled in <br>
this way will be replaced by a default scalable font, such
as the vector font &quot;HersheySerif&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
BITMAPSIZE can equally well be used to specify the window
size. For backward compatibility, the X resource
Xplot.geometry may be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emulate-color option <br>
If option is yes, replace each color in the output by an
appropriate shade of gray. This is seldom useful, except
when using plot -T pcl to prepare output for a PCL 5 <br>
device. (Many monochrome PCL 5 devices, such as monochrome
LaserJets, do a poor job of emulating color on their own.)
You may equally well request color emulation by <br>
setting the environment variable EMULATE_COLOR to
&quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-line-length
max_line_length <br>
Set the maximum number of points that a polygonal line may
contain, before it is flushed out, to be max_line_length. If
this flushing occurs, the polygonal line will be <br>
split into two or more sub-lines, though the splitting
should not be noticeable. The default value of
max_line_length is 500.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for splitting long
polygonal lines is that some display devices (e.g., old
Postscript printers and pen HP-GL plotters) have limited
buffer sizes. The environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable MAX_LINE_LENGTH can also be used to specify
the maximum line length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--page-size pagesize <br>
Set the size of the page on which the plot will be
positioned. This is relevant only to plot -T svg, plot -T
ai, plot -T ps, plot -T cgm, plot -T fig, plot -T pcl, and
<br>
plot -T hpgl. The default is &quot;letter&quot;, which means
an 8.5 inch by 11 inch page. Any ISO page size in the range
&quot;a0&quot;...&quot;a4&quot; or ANSI page size in the
range &quot;a&quot;...&quot;e&quot; may <br>
be specified (&quot;letter&quot; is an alias for
&quot;a&quot; and &quot;tabloid&quot; is an alias for
&quot;b&quot;). &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;ledger&quot; are
recognized page sizes also. The environment variable
PAGESIZE can <br>
equally well be used to specify the page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graphics display in which
the plot is drawn will, by default, be a square region that
occupies nearly the full width of the specified page. An
alternative size for <br>
the graphics display can be specified. For example, the page
size could be specified as
&quot;letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm&quot;. For all of the <br>
above except plot -T hpgl, the graphics display will, by
default, be centered on the page. For all of the above
except plot -T svg and plot -T cgm, the graphics display
<br>
may be repositioned manually, by specifying the location of
its lower left corner, relative to the lower left corner of
the page. For example, the page size could be <br>
specified as &quot;letter,xorigin=2in,yorigin=3in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm&quot;. It is also
possible to specify an offset vector. For example, the page
size could be <br>
specified as &quot;letter,xoffset=1in&quot;, or
&quot;letter,xoffset=1in,yoffset=1.2in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,yoffset=-1cm&quot;. In SVG format and WebCGM format
it is possible to specify the size of the <br>
graphics display, but not its position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rotation angle <br>
Rotate the graphics display by angle degrees. Recognized
values are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;, &quot;180&quot;,
and &quot;270&quot;. &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are
equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;,
respectively. The envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable ROTATION can also be used to specify a
rotation angle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameter Initialization Options
<br>
The following options set the initial values of drawing
parameters. However, all of these may be overridden by
directives in a metafile. In fact, these options are useful
pri&acirc; <br>
marily when plotting old metafiles in the traditional
(pre-GNU) plot(5) format, which did not support such
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bg-color name <br>
Set the color initially used for the background to be name.
This is relevant only to plot -T X, plot -T png, plot -T
pnm, plot -T gif, plot -T svg, plot -T cgm, and plot <br>
-T regis. An unrecognized name sets the color to the
default, which is &quot;white&quot;. The environment
variable BG_COLOR can equally well be used to specify the
background <br>
color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -T png or -T gif option
is used, a transparent PNG file or a transparent pseudo-GIF,
respectively, may be produced by setting the
TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment <br>
variable to the name of the background color. If the -T svg
or -T cgm option is used, an output file without a
background may be produced by setting the background color
<br>
to &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f size <br>
--font-size size <br>
Set the size of the font initially used for rendering text,
as a fraction of the width of the graphics display, to be
size. The default is 0.0525.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F name <br>
--font-name name <br>
Set the font initially used for text to be name. Font names
are case-insensitive. If the specified font is not
available, the default font will be used. Which fonts are
<br>
available, and the default font, depend on which -T option
is specified (see above). A list of available fonts can be
obtained with the --help-fonts option (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W line_width <br>
--line-width line_width <br>
Set the initial width of lines, as a fraction of the width
of the display, to be line_width. A negative value means
that a default value should be used. This value is <br>
format-dependent. The interpretation of zero line width is
also format-dependent (in some output formats, a zero-width
line is the thinnest line that can be drawn; in <br>
others, a zero-width line is invisible).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pen-color name <br>
Set the initial pen color to be name. An unrecognized name
sets the pen color to the default, which is
&quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Metafile Output <br>
The following option is relevant only if the -T option is
omitted or if -T meta is used. In this case the output of
plot, like the input, will be in GNU graphics metafile
for&acirc; <br>
mat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O <br>
--portable-output <br>
Output the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile
format, rather than the binary version (the default). The
format of the binary version is machine-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Backward
Compatibility <br>
By default, plot assumes that its input file(s) are in
either the binary version or the portable version of GNU
metafile format. You may specify that the input is, instead,
in <br>
the traditional Unix (pre-GNU) graphics metafile format,
which is documented in plot(5). The traditional graphics
metafile format was produced by pre-GNU versions of
graph(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--high-byte-first-input <br>
Input file(s) are assumed to be in the binary, &lsquo;high
byte first&rsquo; version of traditional metafile format.
This variant is uncommon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l <br>
--low-byte-first-input <br>
Input file(s) are assumed to be in the binary, &lsquo;low
byte first&rsquo; version of traditional metafile format.
This variant is the most common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
--ascii-input <br>
Input file(s) are assumed to be in the ASCII
(human-readable) variant of traditional metafile format. On
some older Unix systems, this variant was produced by
plottoa(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informational Options <br>
--help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-fonts <br>
Print a table of available fonts, and exit. The table will
depend on which output format is specified with the -T
option. plot -T X, plot -T svg, plot -T ai, plot -T ps, <br>
plot -T cgm, and plot -T fig each support the 35 standard
Postscript fonts. plot -T svg, plot -T pcl, and plot -T hpgl
support the 45 standard PCL 5 fonts, and the latter <br>
two support a number of Hewlett-Packard vector fonts. All
seven support a set of 22 Hershey vector fonts, as do plot
-T png, plot -T pnm, plot -T gif, plot -T regis, and <br>
plot -T tek. plot without a -T option in principle supports
any of these fonts, since its output must be translated to
other formats by a further invocation of plot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The plotfont(1) utility may be
used to obtain a character map of any supported font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-fonts <br>
Like --help-fonts, but lists the fonts in a single column to
facilitate piping to other programs. If no output format is
specified with the -T option, the full set of <br>
supported fonts is listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number of plot and the plotting utilities
package, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variables BITMAPSIZE, PAGESIZE, BG_COLOR,
EMULATE_COLOR, MAX_LINE_LENGTH and ROTATION serve as backups
for the options --bitmap-size, --page-size, --bg-color, <br>
--emulate-color, --max-line-length, and --rotation,
respectively. The remaining environment variables are
specific to individual output formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T X, which pops up a
window on an X Window System display and draws graphics in
it, checks the DISPLAY environment variable. Its value
determines the display that will be <br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T png and plot -T gif,
which produce output in PNG format and pseudo-GIF format
respectively, are affected by the INTERLACE environment
variable. If its value is &quot;yes&quot;, <br>
the output will be interlaced. Also, if the
TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is set to the name of
a color, that color will be treated as transparent in the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T pnm, which produces
output in portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format, is affected
by the PNM_PORTABLE environment variable. If its value is
&quot;yes&quot;, the output will be in a <br>
human-readable format rather than binary (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T cgm, which produces
output in CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format, is
affected by the CGM_MAX_VERSION and CGM_ENCODING environment
variables. By default, it produces <br>
a binary-encoded version of CGM version 3 format. For
backward compatibility, the version number may be reduced by
setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.
Irrespective of ver&acirc; <br>
sion, the output CGM file will use the human-readable clear
text encoding if CGM_ENCODING is set to
&quot;clear_text&quot;. However, only binary-encoded CGM
files conform to the WebCGM <br>
profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T pcl, which produces PCL
5 output for Hewlett-Packard printers and plotters, is
affected by the environment variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS. It
should be set to &quot;yes&quot; when <br>
producing PCL 5 output for a color printer or other color
device. This will ensure accurate color reproduction by
giving the output device complete freedom in assigning
colors, <br>
internally, to its &quot;logical pens&quot;. If it is
&quot;no&quot; then the device will use a fixed set of
colored pens, and will emulate other colors by shading. The
default is &quot;no&quot; because <br>
monochrome PCL 5 devices, which are much more common than
colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T hpgl, which produces
Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language output, is affected by
several environment variables. The most important is
HPGL_VERSION, which may be set to &quot;1&quot;, <br>
&quot;1.5&quot;, or &quot;2&quot; (the default).
&quot;1&quot; means that the output should be generic HP-GL,
&quot;1.5&quot; means that the output should be suitable for
the HP7550A graphics plotter and the HP758x, <br>
HP7595A and HP7596A drafting plotters (HP-GL with some
HP-GL/2 extensions), and &quot;2&quot; means that the output
should be modern HP-GL/2. If the version is &quot;1&quot; or
&quot;1.5&quot; then the only <br>
available fonts will be vector fonts, and all lines will be
drawn with a default width (the -W option will not work).
Additionally, if the version is &quot;1&quot; then the
filling of <br>
arbitrary curves with solid color will not be supported
(circles and rectangles aligned with the coordinate axes may
be filled, though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The position of the plot -T hpgl
graphics display on the page can be rotated 90 degrees
counterclockwise by setting the HPGL_ROTATE environment
variable to &quot;yes&quot;. This is not <br>
the same as the rotation obtained with the --rotation
option, since it both rotates the graphics display and
repositions its lower left corner toward another corner of
the page. <br>
Besides &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, recognized
values for HPGL_ROTATE are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;,
&quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;. &quot;no&quot; and
&quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and
&quot;90&quot;, respectively. &quot;180&quot; and
&quot;270&quot; are sup&acirc; <br>
ported only if HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, plot -T hpgl will
draw with a fixed set of pens. Which pens are present may be
specified by setting the HPGL_PENS environment variable. If
HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1&quot;, the <br>
default value of HPGL_PENS is &quot;1=black&quot;; if
HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1.5&quot; or &quot;2&quot;, the
default value of HPGL_PENS is
&quot;1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan&quot;.
The format <br>
should be self-explanatory. By setting HPGL_PENS you may
specify a color for any pen in the range #1...#31. All color
names recognized by the X Window System may be used. Pen
<br>
#1 must always be present, though it need not be black. Any
other pen in the range #1...#31 may be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot;
then plot -T hpgl will also be affected by the environment
variable HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS. If its value is
&quot;yes&quot;, then plot -T hpgl will not be restricted to
<br>
the palette specified in HPGL_PENS: it will assign colors to
&quot;logical pens&quot; in the range #1...#31, as needed.
The default value is &quot;no&quot; because other than color
LaserJet print&acirc; <br>
ers and DesignJet plotters, not many HP-GL/2 devices allow
the assignment of colors to logical pens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opaque filling and the drawing
of visible white lines are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is
&quot;2&quot; and the environment variable HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE
is &quot;yes&quot; (the default). If its <br>
value is &quot;no&quot; then white lines (if any), which are
normally drawn with pen #0, will not be drawn. This feature
is to accommodate older HP-GL/2 devices. HP-GL/2 pen
plotters, <br>
for example, do not support opacity or the use of pen #0 to
draw visible white lines. Some older HP-GL/2 devices may, in
fact, malfunction if asked to draw opaque objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plot -T tek, which produces
output for a Tektronix terminal or emulator, checks the TERM
environment variable. If the value of TERM is a string
beginning with &quot;xterm&quot;, &quot;nxterm&quot;, <br>
or &quot;kterm&quot;, it is taken as a sign that plot is
running in an X Window System VT100 terminal emulator: a
copy of xterm(1), nxterm(1), or kterm(1). Before drawing
graphics, plot <br>
-T tek will emit an escape sequence that causes the terminal
emulator&rsquo;s auxiliary Tektronix window, which is
normally hidden, to pop up. After the graphics are drawn, an
escape <br>
sequence that returns control to the original VT100 window
will be emitted. The Tektronix window will remain on the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of TERM is a string
beginning with &quot;kermit&quot;, &quot;ansi.sys&quot;, or
&quot;nansi.sys&quot;, it is taken as a sign that plot is
running in the VT100 terminal emulator provided by the <br>
MS-DOS version of kermit(1). Before drawing graphics, plot
-T tek will emit an escape sequence that switches the
terminal emulator to Tektronix mode. Also, some of the
Tek&acirc; <br>
tronix control codes emitted by plot -T tek will be
kermit-specific. There will be a limited amount of color
support, which is not normally the case (the 16
&lsquo;ansi.sys&rsquo; colors <br>
will be supported). After drawing graphics, plot -T tek will
emit an escape sequence that returns the emulator to VT100
mode. The key sequence &lsquo;ALT minus&rsquo; can be
employed manu&acirc; <br>
ally within kermit to switch between the two modes.</p>
