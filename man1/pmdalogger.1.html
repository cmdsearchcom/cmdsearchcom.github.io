<p>PMDALOGGER(1) General Commands Manual PMDALOGGER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdalogger - log file performance metrics domain agent
(PMDA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger/pmdalogger [-d domain] [-l logfile]
[-m memory] [-s interval] [-U username] [configfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdalogger is a configurable log file monitoring Performance
Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA). It can be seen as analogous to
the -f option to tail(1) and converts each new log line <br>
into a performance event. It was the first PMDA to make
extensive use of event metrics, which can be consumed by
client tools like pmevent(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The logger PMDA exports both
event-style metrics reflecting timestamped event records for
text logged to a file (or set of files or output from a
process), as well as the more <br>
orthodox sample-style metrics such as event counts and
throughput size values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PMDA is configured via a
configfile which contains one line for each source of events
(file or process). This file is setup by the Install script
described in the later sec&acirc; <br>
tion on &lsquo;&lsquo;INSTALLATION&rsquo;&rsquo; of the
PMDA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdalogger command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named logger.log is written in the
current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdalogger is started,
i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If <br>
the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Limit the physical memory
used by the PMDA to buffer event records to maxsize bytes.
As log events arrive at the PMDA, they must be buffered
until individual client tools <br>
request the next batch since their previous batch of events.
The default maximum is 2 megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Sets the polling interval for
detecting newly arrived log lines. Mirrors the same option
from the tail(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the unprivileged
&quot;pcp&quot; account in current versions of PCP, but in
older versions the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) <br>
was used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
If you want access to the names, help text and values for
the logger performance metrics, do the following as
root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger <br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is an interactive
installation process which prompts for each log file path to
be monitored (or command to be run), a metric instance name
to identify it, and whether access <br>
should be restricted (refer to the -x option to pmevent(1)
for further details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo the
installation, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger <br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdalogger is launched by
pmcd(1) and should never be executed directly. The Install
and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is
installed or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>
command line options used to launch pmdalogger <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger/logger.conf <br>
default configuration file for the logger metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger/help <br>
default help text file for the logger metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger/Install <br>
installation script for the pmdalogger agent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger/Remove <br>
undo installation script for the pmdalogger agent <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/logger.log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdalogger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
