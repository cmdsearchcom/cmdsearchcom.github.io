autoexpect watches you interacting with another program and creates an Expect
  script that reproduces your interactions. For straightline scripts, autoexpect
  saves substantial time over writing scripts by hand. Even if you are an Expect
  expert, you will find it convenient to use autoexpect to automate the more
  mindless parts of interactions. It is much easier to cut/paste hunks of
  autoexpect scripts together than to write them from scratch. And if you are a
  beginner, you may be able to get away with learning nothing more about Expect
  than how to call autoexpect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The simplest way to use autoexpect is to call it from the command line with no
  arguments. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	% autoexpect
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, autoexpect spawns a shell for you. Given a program name and
  arguments, autoexpect spawns that program. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	% autoexpect ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Once your spawned program is running, interact normally. When you have exited
  the shell (or program that you specified), autoexpect will create a new script
  for you. By default, autoexpect writes the new script to
  &quot;script.exp&quot;. You can override this with the -f flag followed by a
  new script name.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following example runs &quot;ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov&quot; and stores the
  resulting Expect script in the file &quot;nist&quot;.
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	% autoexpect -f nist ftp ftp.cme.nist.gov
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
It is important to understand that autoexpect does not guarantee a working
  script because it necessarily has to guess about certain things - and
  occasionally it guesses wrong. However, it is usually very easy to identify
  and fix these problems. The typical problems are:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Timing. A surprisingly large number of programs (rn, ksh,
      zsh, telnet, etc.) and devices (e.g., modems) ignore keystrokes that
      arrive &quot;too quickly&quot; after prompts. If you find your new script
      hanging up at one spot, try adding a short sleep just before the previous
      send.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can force this behavior throughout by overriding the variable
      &quot;force_conservative&quot; near the beginning of the generated script.
      This &quot;conservative&quot; mode makes autoexpect automatically pause
      briefly (one tenth of a second) before sending each character. This
      pacifies every program I know of.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This conservative mode is useful if you just want to quickly reassure
      yourself that the problem is a timing one (or if you really don't care
      about how fast the script runs). This same mode can be forced before
      script generation by using the -c flag.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Fortunately, these timing spots are rare. For example, telnet ignores
      characters only after entering its escape sequence. Modems only ignore
      characters immediately after connecting to them for the first time. A few
      programs exhibit this behavior all the time but typically have a switch to
      disable it. For example, rn's -T flag disables this behavior.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following example starts autoexpect in conservative mode.
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -c
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    The -C flag defines a key to toggle conservative mode. The following example
      starts autoexpect (in non-conservative mode) with ^L as the toggle. (Note
      that the ^L is entered literally - i.e., enter a real control-L).
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -C ^L
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    The following example starts autoexpect in conservative mode with ^L as the
      toggle.
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -c -C ^L
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Echoing. Many program echo characters. For example, if you
      type &quot;more&quot; to a shell, what autoexpect actually sees is:
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	you typed 'm',
	computer typed 'm',
	you typed 'o',
	computer typed 'o',
	you typed 'r',
	computer typed 'r',
	...
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Without specific knowledge of the program, it is impossible to know if you
      are waiting to see each character echoed before typing the next. If
      autoexpect sees characters being echoed, it assumes that it can send them
      all as a group rather than interleaving them the way they originally
      appeared. This makes the script more pleasant to read. However, it could
      conceivably be incorrect if you really had to wait to see each character
      echoed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Change. Autoexpect records every character from the
      interaction in the script. This is desirable because it gives you the
      ability to make judgements about what is important and what can be
      replaced with a pattern match.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    On the other hand, if you use commands whose output differs from run to run,
      the generated scripts are not going to be correct. For example, the
      &quot;date&quot; command always produces different output. So using the
      date command while running autoexpect is a sure way to produce a script
      that will require editing in order for it to work.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The -p flag puts autoexpect into &quot;prompt mode&quot;. In this mode,
      autoexpect will only look for the the last line of program output - which
      is usually the prompt. This handles the date problem (see above) and most
      others.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The following example starts autoexpect in prompt mode.
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -p
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    The -P flag defines a key to toggle prompt mode. The following example
      starts autoexpect (in non-prompt mode) with ^P as the toggle. Note that
      the ^P is entered literally - i.e., enter a real control-P.
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -P ^P
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
    The following example starts autoexpect in prompt mode with ^P as the
      toggle.
    <pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -p -P ^P
<div class="Pp"></div>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OTHER_FLAGS"><a class="selflink" href="#OTHER_FLAGS">OTHER
  FLAGS</a></h1>
The <b>-quiet</b> flag disables informational messages produced by autoexpect.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-Q</b> flag names a quote character which can be used to enter characters
  that autoexpect would otherwise consume because they are used as toggles.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following example shows a number of flags with quote used to provide a way
  of entering the toggles literally.
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	autoexpect -P ^P -C ^L -Q ^Q
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STYLE"><a class="selflink" href="#STYLE">STYLE</a></h1>
I don't know if there is a &quot;style&quot; for Expect programs but autoexpect
  should definitely not be held up as any model of style. For example,
  autoexpect uses features of Expect that are intended specifically for
  computer-generated scripting. So don't try to faithfully write scripts that
  appear as if they were generated by autoexpect. This is not useful.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On the other hand, autoexpect scripts do show some worthwhile things. For
  example, you can see how any string must be quoted in order to use it in a Tcl
  script simply by running the strings through autoexpect.
