<i>YTalk 3.3.0</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
YTalk is in essence a multi-user chat program. It works almost exactly like the
  UNIX talk program and even communicates with the same talk daemon(s), but
  YTalk allows for multiple connections.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <i>username</i> field may be formatted in several different ways:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	name - some user on your machine
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	name@host - some user on a different machine
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	name#tty - some user on a particular terminal
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	name#tty@host - some user on a particular tty on a
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
				 different machine
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	name@host#tty - same as &quot;name#tty@host&quot;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	aliasname - an alias defined in your .ytalkrc
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can specify multiple user names on the command line, ie:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	ytalk george fred@hissun.edu marc@grumpy.cc
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-s</b> option starts your YTalk window in a shell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-Y</b> option requires a capital Y or N as an answer to any yes/no
  question.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-E</b> option requires you to press escape once before answering a yes/no
  question (for people who type looking at the keyboard).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-i</b> option disables the auto-invite port (meaning you won't see
  &quot;talk to blah@blah.com&quot;, but your talk daemon will beep you
  instead).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-q</b> option causes YTalk to prompt you before quitting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> option prints the program version and exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-h</b> option specifies the name or address of the local machine; this is
  useful on multi-homed machines, or virtual hosts, to specify which network
  interface to use for communication.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each user on the command line, YTalk will attempt to connect to the talk
  daemon on the specified user's host and determine if that user has left an
  invitation for you to call. If not, YTalk leaves an invitation for him and
  tells his talk daemon to send an announcement to his screen. There is no
  dedicated YTalk daemon. Right now, YTalk is able to communicate with BOTH
  existing versions of UNIX talk daemons. For any particular host, YTalk will
  attempt to communicate with a talk daemon the caller's host also supports. If
  the two hosts have no daemon in common, then UNIX talk will not function at
  all, but a connection is possible through (and only through) YTalk.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a connection has been established between two users, they can chat back and
  forth to their hearts' content. The connection is terminated when one of them
  hits control-C or selects quit off the main menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
YTalk is perfectly compatible with UNIX talk and they can even converse with
  each other without any problems. However, many of the features of YTalk can
  only operate when you are connected to a user who is also using YTalk. For the
  rest of this document, it will be assumed that all connected users are using
  YTalk, unless otherwise stated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you specified more than one user on the YTalk command line, then YTalk will
  process and add each user to the conversation as they respond to your
  invitation. As each new user enters the conversation, the screen is further
  subdivided into smaller and smaller windows, one for each connected user.
  Right now, the number of connected users is limited by the number of lines on
  your terminal (or window), for each connected user needs at least three lines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As each new user is added to the conversation, YTalk will transmit information
  about that user to all other connected YTalk users so that their screens will
  also subdivide and incorporate the new user. If the new user is using UNIX
  talk, then information about him will NOT be transmitted, for his screen would
  be unable to accept multiple connections. I have given brief thought to
  allowing at least the output of UNIX talk users to be transmitted to all
  connected YTalk users, but I have not written any code to do so. Note that
  even though UNIX talk cannot handle multiple connections, it is still possible
  for YTalk to handle multiple UNIX &quot;talk&quot; connections. For example,
  george (using YTalk) could communicate with fred and joe (both using UNIX
  talk), but fred and joe would be unaware of each other. The best way to
  understand the limitations that UNIX &quot;talk&quot; places on YTalk is to
  test various connections between the two and see how things work.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ESCAPE_MENU"><a class="selflink" href="#ESCAPE_MENU">ESCAPE
  MENU</a></h1>
Whenever you are using YTalk, you can hit the <i>ESCAPE</i> key to bring up a
  menu which at this moment has these options:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 a: add a user
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 d: delete a user
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 k: kill all unconnected
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 o: options
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 r: rering all
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 s: shell
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 u: user list
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 w: output user to file
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 q: quit
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;a&quot;, you are given the opportunity to type the name
  of any user you wish to include into the conversation. Again, YTalk will
  accept an invitation from that user if an invitation exists, or will leave an
  invitation and ring the given user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;d&quot;, you can select the name of a connection to
  terminate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;k&quot;, you can make YTalk forget all pending
  (waiting) connections.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;o&quot;, you can view and/or modify any of the YTalk
  options. See the OPTIONS section below for a list of YTalk options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;r&quot;, all users that have not yet responded to your
  talk invitation will be re-rung.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;s&quot;, you can invoke a shell in your YTalk window.
  All other users will see what happens in your shell. YTalk will automatically
  resize your window down to the size of the smallest window you are connected
  to, in order to ensure that all users always see the same thing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;u&quot; option displays a list of connected and unconnected users, as
  well as their window sizes and what version of talk software they are running.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By choosing option &quot;w&quot;, you can select any connected user and type the
  name of a file, and all further output from that user will be dumped to the
  specified file. The file, if it exists, will be OVERWRITTEN. By choosing
  &quot;w&quot; and the same user again, further output to the file will be
  terminated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Oh, one other thing: when user A attempts to ytalk to user B, but user B is
  already ytalking with user C, user A's YTalk program will realize that user B
  is already using YTalk, and will communicate with user B's YTalk program
  directly in order to initialize the conversation. User B will see a nice
  windowed message like:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	Do you wish to talk with user A?
<div class="Pp"></div>
and he will be prompted for a yes/no answer. This, in my opinion, is much
  preferable to blitting the announcement message and messing up user B's
  screen. The command-line option &quot;-i&quot; turns this off.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RUNTIME_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RUNTIME_OPTIONS">RUNTIME
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
When you select Options off of the main menu, you are given the opportunity to
  edit the YTalk options. The current options are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	s: turn scrolling [off/on]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	w: turn word-wrap [off/on]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	i: turn auto-import [off/on]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	v: turn auto-invite [off/on]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	r: turn reringing [off/on]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	p: [don't] prompt before rerings
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
	q: [don't] prompt before quitting
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>scrolling</i> is turned on, then a user's window will scroll when he
  reaches the bottom, instead of wrapping back around to the top.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>word-wrap</i> is turned on, then any word which would overextend the right
  margin will be automatically moved to the next line on your screen.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>auto-import</i> is turned on, then YTalk will assume that you wish to talk
  to any users which connect to other YTalk users which are connected to you.
  That last sentence does make sense; try again. YTalk will add these users to
  your session automatically, without asking you for verification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>auto-invite</i> is turned on, then YTalk will automatically accept any
  connection requested by another user and add them to your session. You will
  not be asked for verification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>rering</i> is turned on, then YTalk will re-ring any user who does not
  respond to your invitation within 30 seconds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>prompt-rering</i> is turned on, then YTalk will ask you before re-ringing
  a user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>prompt-quit</i> is turned on, then YTalk will wait for keyboard input
  before quitting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any of these options can be set to your preference in your .ytalkrc file, as
  described below.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="YTALK_STARTUP_FILE"><a class="selflink" href="#YTALK_STARTUP_FILE">YTALK
  STARTUP FILE</a></h1>
If your home directory contains a file named &quot;.ytalkrc&quot; then YTalk
  will read this file while starting up. All YTalk runtime options, as well as
  some startup options, can be set in this file.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SETTING BOOLEAN OPTIONS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Boolean options can be pre-set with the following syntax:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	turn <i>option</i> [off | on]
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>option</i> is one of <i>scrolling ,</i> <i>word-wrap ,</i>
  <i>auto-import ,</i> <i>auto-invite ,</i> <i>rering ,</i> <i>prompt-rering
  ,</i> <i>prompt-quit ,</i> <i>caps ,</i> <i>escape-yesno ,</i> <i>noinvite
  ,</i> <i>ignorebreak ,</i> or <i>beeps .</i> Setting these options works just
  like described above. For example, one could enable word-wrap with the line:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	turn word-wrap on
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ALIASES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can setup aliases so you don't have to type the full address of the user you
  want to ring. There are three types of aliases:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>alias <i>aliasname</i>@ <i>username</i>@</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Replaces <i>aliasname</i>@<i>host</i> with
      <i>username</i>@<i>host</i> for every host. The '@' at the end of
      <i>username@</i> is not required.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>alias @<i>aliashost</i> @<i>realhost</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Replaces <i>user</i>@<i>aliashost</i> with
      <i>user</i>@<i>realhost</i> for every user. The '@' at the beginning of @
      <i>realhost</i> is not required.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>alias <i>aliasname</i> <i>user</i>@<i>host</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Replaces <i>aliasname</i> with <i>user</i>@<i>host</i>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SELECTING INTERFACES AND VIRTUAL HOSTS</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
On machines with multiple IP addresses (multiple interfaces, or virtual hosts),
  you can choose the default address to use for communication with YTalk, using
  the <b>localhost</b> command in your .ytalkrc file. The syntax is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>localhost <i>hostname-or-IP-address</i></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SETTING RE-ADDRESS MODES</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of readdressing is to allow YTalk connections across point-to-point
  network gateways where the local machines know themselves by a different
  address (and typically hostname) than the remote machines. The basic syntax of
  a readdress command is this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	readdress <i>from-address</i> <i>to-address</i> <i>domain</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>readdress</i> statement simply makes a claim that the machine(s) in
  <i>domain</i> communicate with the machine(s) at <i>from-address</i> by
  sending a packet to <i>to-address .</i> Since most users have no use for this
  whatsoever, I'll describe it only briefly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
THIS IS NOT ROUTING. For example, my machine at home is connected via PPP to the
  network at my office. My machine at home thinks its ethernet address is
  192.188.253.1 and its hostname is &quot;talisman.com&quot;. The network at my
  office has the address 192.67.141.0. When I'm connected via PPP, my home
  machine is placed into the office network as address 192.67.141.9 with
  hostname &quot;talisman.austin.eds.com&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
YTalk needs to know that if it is running on domain 192.67.141.0 and receives
  packets from 192.188.253.1 that it should respond to 192.67.141.9, not
  192.188.253.1. right? right. okay, okay, okay. I put this line into my
  .ytalkrc on both ends:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	readdress talisman talisman.austin.eds.com 192.67.141.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
On my home end, this translates to:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	readdress 192.188.253.1 192.67.141.9 192.67.141.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
which tells my home machine to advertise itself as &quot;192.67.141.9&quot;
  instead of &quot;192.188.253.1&quot; when YTalk-ing to machines on the network
  &quot;192.67.141.0&quot;. On the office end, the readdress command translates
  to:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	readdress 192.67.141.9 192.67.141.9 192.67.141.0
<div class="Pp"></div>
which the office machines basically ignore.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that, in this case, the problem could also have been solved by telling the
  home YTalk to use the 192.67.141.0 interface, when doing YTalk requests across
  the PPP link.
