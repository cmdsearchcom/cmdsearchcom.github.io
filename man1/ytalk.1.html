<p>YTalk(1) General Commands Manual YTalk(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ytalk - A multi-user chat program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ytalk [-s] [-Y] [-E] [-i] [-q] [-v] [-h hostname_or_ip]
username...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
YTalk 3.3.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YTalk is in essence a multi-user
chat program. It works almost exactly like the UNIX talk
program and even communicates with the same talk daemon(s),
but YTalk allows for multi&acirc; <br>
ple connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The username field may be
formatted in several different ways: <br>
name - some user on your machine <br>
name@host - some user on a different machine <br>
name#tty - some user on a particular terminal <br>
name#tty@host - some user on a particular tty on a <br>
different machine <br>
name@host#tty - same as &quot;name#tty@host&quot; <br>
aliasname - an alias defined in your .ytalkrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify multiple user
names on the command line, ie:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ytalk george fred@hissun.edu
marc@grumpy.cc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option starts your YTalk
window in a shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Y option requires a capital
Y or N as an answer to any yes/no question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -E option requires you to
press escape once before answering a yes/no question (for
people who type looking at the keyboard).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -i option disables the
auto-invite port (meaning you won&rsquo;t see &quot;talk to
blah@blah.com&quot;, but your talk daemon will beep you
instead).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -q option causes YTalk to
prompt you before quitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option prints the program
version and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -h option specifies the name
or address of the local machine; this is useful on
multi-homed machines, or virtual hosts, to specify which
network interface to use for communi&acirc; <br>
cation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each user on the command
line, YTalk will attempt to connect to the talk daemon on
the specified user&rsquo;s host and determine if that user
has left an invitation for you to <br>
call. If not, YTalk leaves an invitation for him and tells
his talk daemon to send an announcement to his screen. There
is no dedicated YTalk daemon. Right now, YTalk is able <br>
to communicate with BOTH existing versions of UNIX talk
daemons. For any particular host, YTalk will attempt to
communicate with a talk daemon the caller&rsquo;s host also
supports. <br>
If the two hosts have no daemon in common, then UNIX talk
will not function at all, but a connection is possible
through (and only through) YTalk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a connection has been
established between two users, they can chat back and forth
to their hearts&rsquo; content. The connection is terminated
when one of them hits control-C or <br>
selects quit off the main menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YTalk is perfectly compatible
with UNIX talk and they can even converse with each other
without any problems. However, many of the features of YTalk
can only operate when you <br>
are connected to a user who is also using YTalk. For the
rest of this document, it will be assumed that all connected
users are using YTalk, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specified more than one
user on the YTalk command line, then YTalk will process and
add each user to the conversation as they respond to your
invitation. As each new user <br>
enters the conversation, the screen is further subdivided
into smaller and smaller windows, one for each connected
user. Right now, the number of connected users is limited by
<br>
the number of lines on your terminal (or window), for each
connected user needs at least three lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As each new user is added to the
conversation, YTalk will transmit information about that
user to all other connected YTalk users so that their
screens will also subdivide and <br>
incorporate the new user. If the new user is using UNIX
talk, then information about him will NOT be transmitted,
for his screen would be unable to accept multiple
connections. <br>
I have given brief thought to allowing at least the output
of UNIX talk users to be transmitted to all connected YTalk
users, but I have not written any code to do so. Note that
<br>
even though UNIX talk cannot handle multiple connections, it
is still possible for YTalk to handle multiple UNIX
&quot;talk&quot; connections. For example, george (using
YTalk) could com&acirc; <br>
municate with fred and joe (both using UNIX talk), but fred
and joe would be unaware of each other. The best way to
understand the limitations that UNIX &quot;talk&quot; places
on YTalk <br>
is to test various connections between the two and see how
things work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCAPE MENU <br>
Whenever you are using YTalk, you can hit the ESCAPE key to
bring up a menu which at this moment has these options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a: add a user <br>
d: delete a user <br>
k: kill all unconnected <br>
o: options <br>
r: rering all <br>
s: shell <br>
u: user list <br>
w: output user to file <br>
q: quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;a&quot;, you are given the opportunity to type the
name of any user you wish to include into the conversation.
Again, YTalk will accept an invitation from that <br>
user if an invitation exists, or will leave an invitation
and ring the given user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;d&quot;, you can select the name of a connection to
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;k&quot;, you can make YTalk forget all pending
(waiting) connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;o&quot;, you can view and/or modify any of the YTalk
options. See the OPTIONS section below for a list of YTalk
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;r&quot;, all users that have not yet responded to your
talk invitation will be re-rung.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;s&quot;, you can invoke a shell in your YTalk window.
All other users will see what happens in your shell. YTalk
will automatically resize your window down to <br>
the size of the smallest window you are connected to, in
order to ensure that all users always see the same
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;u&quot; option
displays a list of connected and unconnected users, as well
as their window sizes and what version of talk software they
are running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By choosing option
&quot;w&quot;, you can select any connected user and type
the name of a file, and all further output from that user
will be dumped to the specified file. The file, if <br>
it exists, will be OVERWRITTEN. By choosing &quot;w&quot;
and the same user again, further output to the file will be
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Oh, one other thing: when user A
attempts to ytalk to user B, but user B is already ytalking
with user C, user A&rsquo;s YTalk program will realize that
user B is already using YTalk, <br>
and will communicate with user B&rsquo;s YTalk program
directly in order to initialize the conversation. User B
will see a nice windowed message like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do you wish to talk with user
A?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and he will be prompted for a
yes/no answer. This, in my opinion, is much preferable to
blitting the announcement message and messing up user
B&rsquo;s screen. The command-line option <br>
&quot;-i&quot; turns this off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME OPTIONS <br>
When you select Options off of the main menu, you are given
the opportunity to edit the YTalk options. The current
options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s: turn scrolling [off/on] <br>
w: turn word-wrap [off/on] <br>
i: turn auto-import [off/on] <br>
v: turn auto-invite [off/on] <br>
r: turn reringing [off/on] <br>
p: [don&rsquo;t] prompt before rerings <br>
q: [don&rsquo;t] prompt before quitting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If scrolling is turned on, then
a user&rsquo;s window will scroll when he reaches the
bottom, instead of wrapping back around to the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If word-wrap is turned on, then
any word which would overextend the right margin will be
automatically moved to the next line on your screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If auto-import is turned on,
then YTalk will assume that you wish to talk to any users
which connect to other YTalk users which are connected to
you. That last sentence does <br>
make sense; try again. YTalk will add these users to your
session automatically, without asking you for
verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If auto-invite is turned on,
then YTalk will automatically accept any connection
requested by another user and add them to your session. You
will not be asked for verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If rering is turned on, then
YTalk will re-ring any user who does not respond to your
invitation within 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If prompt-rering is turned on,
then YTalk will ask you before re-ringing a user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If prompt-quit is turned on,
then YTalk will wait for keyboard input before quitting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any of these options can be set
to your preference in your .ytalkrc file, as described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YTALK STARTUP FILE <br>
If your home directory contains a file named
&quot;.ytalkrc&quot; then YTalk will read this file while
starting up. All YTalk runtime options, as well as some
startup options, can be set <br>
in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING BOOLEAN OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean options can be pre-set
with the following syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">turn option [off | on]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where option is one of scrolling
, word-wrap , auto-import , auto-invite , rering ,
prompt-rering , prompt-quit , caps , escape-yesno , noinvite
, ignorebreak , or beeps . Set&acirc; <br>
ting these options works just like described above. For
example, one could enable word-wrap with the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">turn word-wrap on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALIASES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can setup aliases so you
don&rsquo;t have to type the full address of the user you
want to ring. There are three types of aliases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias aliasname@ username@ <br>
Replaces aliasname@host with username@host for every host.
The &rsquo;@&rsquo; at the end of username@ is not
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias @aliashost @realhost <br>
Replaces user@aliashost with user@realhost for every user.
The &rsquo;@&rsquo; at the beginning of @realhost is not
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias aliasname user@host <br>
Replaces aliasname with user@host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTING INTERFACES AND VIRTUAL
HOSTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On machines with multiple IP
addresses (multiple interfaces, or virtual hosts), you can
choose the default address to use for communication with
YTalk, using the localhost com&acirc; <br>
mand in your .ytalkrc file. The syntax is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">localhost
hostname-or-IP-address</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING RE-ADDRESS MODES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of readdressing is
to allow YTalk connections across point-to-point network
gateways where the local machines know themselves by a
different address (and typically <br>
hostname) than the remote machines. The basic syntax of a
readdress command is this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdress from-address
to-address domain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The readdress statement simply
makes a claim that the machine(s) in domain communicate with
the machine(s) at from-address by sending a packet to
to-address . Since most users <br>
have no use for this whatsoever, I&rsquo;ll describe it only
briefly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THIS IS NOT ROUTING. For
example, my machine at home is connected via PPP to the
network at my office. My machine at home thinks its ethernet
address is 192.188.253.1 and its <br>
hostname is &quot;talisman.com&quot;. The network at my
office has the address 192.67.141.0. When I&rsquo;m
connected via PPP, my home machine is placed into the office
network as address <br>
192.67.141.9 with hostname
&quot;talisman.austin.eds.com&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YTalk needs to know that if it
is running on domain 192.67.141.0 and receives packets from
192.188.253.1 that it should respond to 192.67.141.9, not
192.188.253.1. right? <br>
right. okay, okay, okay. I put this line into my .ytalkrc on
both ends:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdress talisman
talisman.austin.eds.com 192.67.141.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On my home end, this translates
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdress 192.188.253.1
192.67.141.9 192.67.141.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which tells my home machine to
advertise itself as &quot;192.67.141.9&quot; instead of
&quot;192.188.253.1&quot; when YTalk-ing to machines on the
network &quot;192.67.141.0&quot;. On the office end, the
<br>
readdress command translates to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">readdress 192.67.141.9
192.67.141.9 192.67.141.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which the office machines
basically ignore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, in this case, the
problem could also have been solved by telling the home
YTalk to use the 192.67.141.0 interface, when doing YTalk
requests across the PPP link.</p>
