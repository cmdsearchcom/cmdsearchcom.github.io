A GRASS GIS Database is simply a set of directories and files with certain
  structure which GRASS GIS works efficiently with. Location is a directory with
  data related to one geographic location or a project. All data within one
  Location has the same cartographic projection. A Location contains Mapsets and
  each Mapset contains data related to a specific task, user or a smaller
  project. Within each Location, a mandatory PERMANENT Mapset exists which can
  contain commonly used data within a Location such as base maps. PERMANENT
  Mapset also contains metadata related to Location such as projection. When
  GRASS GIS is started it connects to a Database, Location and Mapset specified
  by the user.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GRASS_GIS_Database"><a class="selflink" href="#GRASS_GIS_Database">GRASS
  GIS Database</a></h2>
All data for GRASS GIS must be in GRASS GIS Database which is a directory
  (visible on the disk) containing subdirectories which are GRASS Locations.
  User can have one or more of Databases on the disk. Typically users have one
  directory called grassdata in their home directory. In multi-user environment
  users often have a grassdata directory mounted as a network directory (network
  file system). For teams, a centralized GRASS DATABASE would be defined in a
  shared network file system (e.g. NFS).
<div class="Pp"></div>
GRASS GIS Databases can be safely copied or moved as any other directories.
  Don&#x2019;t be confused with (relational) databases which are used in GRASS
  GIS to hold attribute data and might be part of the GRASS GIS Database. From
  user point of view, GRASS GIS Database with all its data in it is similar to,
  e.g. PostGIS, database, as it stores all information inside in a specific
  format and is accessible by specific tools. GRASS GIS Databases is in GRASS
  GIS often called GISDBASE or DATABASE.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GRASS_Locations"><a class="selflink" href="#GRASS_Locations">GRASS
  Locations</a></h2>
Location is a directory which contains GRASS Mapsets which are its
  subdirectories. All data in one Location have the same projection (coordinate
  system, datum). Each Location must contain Mapset called PERMANENT. Typically,
  a Location contains all data related to one project or a geographic area
  (geographic location or region). Alternatively, Location can simply contain
  all data in a given projection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GRASS Locations can be safely copied or moved as any other directories.
  Compressed Location is usually what GRASS users exchange between each other
  when they want to share a lot of data. For example, GRASS GIS sample data are
  provided as Locations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Don&#x2019;t be confused with location as a place (file or directory) in a file
  system. The word location in GRASS Location refers to a location or area on
  Earth (or whatever is applicable). Users and programmers familiar with
  relational databases such as PostgreSQL can view Location as an individual
  database inside the system or a storage area which would be equivalent to
  GRASS GIS Database. Mapsets in a Locations are like namespaces or schemas
  inside a database.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GRASS_Mapsets"><a class="selflink" href="#GRASS_Mapsets">GRASS
  Mapsets</a></h2>
Mapsets contains the actual data, mostly geospatial data, referred to as maps in
  GRASS GIS. Mapsets are a tool for organizing maps in a transparent way as well
  as a tool for isolating different tasks to prevent data loss.
<div class="Pp"></div>
GRASS GIS is always connected to one particular Mapset. GRASS GIS modules can
  create, modify, change, or delete a data only in the current Mapset. By
  default, only the data from the current Mapset and PERMANENT Mapset are
  visible. Using <i>g.mapsets</i> module or in GUI other Mapsets can be made
  visible and seamlessly accessible. All data are available for reading when
  Mapset is specified explicitly, for example to access map streets in Mapset
  new_highway user can use streets@new_highway. For maps which are in the
  current or PERMAENT Mapsets or Mapsets sets as visible (accessible), there is
  no need to use @mapset syntax.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mapsets are used to store maps related to one project, smaller project, specific
  task, issue or subregions. In multi-user environment, when a team works
  together on one project, Mapsets support simultaneous access of several users
  to the maps stored within the same Location. Besides access to his or her own
  Mapset, each user can also read maps in PERMANENT Mapsent and in other
  users&#x2019; Mapsets when set. However, each user can modify or remove only
  the maps in his or her own Mapset.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Besides the geospatial data, Mapset holds additional data such as color tables
  (managed e.g. by <i>r.colors</i>) and the current computational
  region&#x2019;s extent and resolution stored in a file called WIND and managed
  by <i>g.region</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mapsets can be copied and moved as directories, however only when it is clear
  that the projections of both Locations (as reported by <i>g.proj</i>) match
  each other. Since this is sometimes hard to to establish, it is recommended to
  use <i>r.proj</i> or <i>v.proj</i> to reproject the data. The files and
  directories should not be moved or modified directly, but only using GRASS GIS
  tools.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_role_of_the_PERMANENT_Mapset"><a class="selflink" href="#The_role_of_the_PERMANENT_Mapset">The
  role of the PERMANENT Mapset</a></h2>
When creating a new Location, GRASS GIS automatically creates a special Mapset
  called PERMANENT where the core data for the Location are stored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the maps in PERMANENT Mapset are visible from all the other Mapsets, it
  can be used to store the base maps (base cartography), data common to all
  projects or needed for different analyses done is separate Mapsets.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In multi-user environment, data in the PERMANENT Mapset can only be added,
  modified or removed by the owner of the PERMANENT Mapset; however, they can be
  accessed, analyzed, and copied into their own Mapset by the other users. The
  PERMANENT Mapset is useful for providing general spatial data (e.g. an
  elevation model), accessible but write-protected to all users who are working
  in the same Location as the database owner. To manipulate or add data to
  PERMANENT, the owner can start GRASS GIS and choose the relevant Location and
  the PERMANENT Mapset.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PERMANENT Mapset also contains the DEFAULT_WIND file which holds the default
  computational region&#x2019;s extent and resolution values for the Location
  (which all Mapsets will inherit when they are created). Users have the option
  of switching back to the default region at any time.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Importing,_exporting_and_linking_data"><a class="selflink" href="#Importing,_exporting_and_linking_data">Importing,
  exporting and linking data</a></h2>
GRASS GIS works only with data which are imported into a GRASS Database, so all
  data needs to be imported, e.g. by <i>r.in.gdal</i> or highly convenient
  <i>r.import</i>, before the actual analysis. Data in GRASS Datable can be
  exported using for example <i>r.in.gdal</i> in case of raster maps.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For cases when import is not desirable, an option to link external data exists.
  Projection of the linked data must match the Location&#x2019;s projection
  otherwise the external data cannot be linked. (Linking data in different
  projection is not allowed as it would require on-the-fly reprojection which
  could cause inconsistencies in the data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, module <i>r.external</i> links external raster data, so that the
  data are accessible in GRASS Database as standard raster maps. Similarly for
  newly created maps, <i>r.external.out</i> setups a format and directory where
  the actual data will be stored, however in GRASS Database the data will be
  created as standard maps.

GRASS GIS can be started with given Database, Location and Mapset from the
  command line. For example, the following will start in a given Mapset with
  only command line interface:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
grass72 -text ~/grassdata/mylocation/mymapset
</pre>
And the following will create the given Location with projection given by the
  EPSG code and it will start the default interface (GUI or command line):
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
grass72 -c EPSG:5514:3 ~/grassdata/mylocation
</pre>
See <i>grass</i> command manual for more details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Creating_a_New_Location_with_the_Location_Wizard"><a class="selflink" href="#Creating_a_New_Location_with_the_Location_Wizard">Creating
  a New Location with the Location Wizard</a></h2>
The wxGUI graphical user interface provides a graphical <i>Location Wizard</i>
  which lets you easily create a new Location for your own data. You will be
  guided through a series of dialogues to browse and select predefined
  projections or to define custom projections.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most convenient way of using <i>Location Wizard</i> is creating new Location
  based on a georeferenced file, such as Shapefile or GeoTIFF, or by selecting
  the corresponding EPSG projection code. In case of using georeferenced file,
  you are asked whether the data itself should be imported into the new
  Location. The default region is then set to match imported map.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After defining a new Location, wxGUI starts automatically. If data were already
  imported, you can add them into the Layer Manager now and display them. More
  data can be imported into the Location, e.g. using import options in the
  <i>File</i> menu in <i>Layer Manager</i> or <i>r.import</i>.
