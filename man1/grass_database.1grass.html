<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS Database <br>
A GRASS GIS Database is simply a set of directories and
files with certain structure which GRASS GIS works
efficiently with. Location is a directory with data related
to one <br>
geographic location or a project. All data within one
Location has the same cartographic projection. A Location
contains Mapsets and each Mapset contains data related to a
spe&acirc; <br>
cific task, user or a smaller project. Within each Location,
a mandatory PERMANENT Mapset exists which can contain
commonly used data within a Location such as base maps.
PER&acirc; <br>
MANENT Mapset also contains metadata related to Location
such as projection. When GRASS GIS is started it connects to
a Database, Location and Mapset specified by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fig. 1: GRASS GIS Database
structure as visible to the user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS Database <br>
All data for GRASS GIS must be in GRASS GIS Database which
is a directory (visible on the disk) containing
subdirectories which are GRASS Locations. User can have one
or more of <br>
Databases on the disk. Typically users have one directory
called grassdata in their home directory. In multi-user
environment users often have a grassdata directory mounted
as a <br>
network directory (network file system). For teams, a
centralized GRASS DATABASE would be defined in a shared
network file system (e.g. NFS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS Databases can be
safely copied or moved as any other directories. Don&acirc;t
be confused with (relational) databases which are used in
GRASS GIS to hold attribute data and <br>
might be part of the GRASS GIS Database. From user point of
view, GRASS GIS Database with all its data in it is similar
to, e.g. PostGIS, database, as it stores all information
<br>
inside in a specific format and is accessible by specific
tools. GRASS GIS Databases is in GRASS GIS often called
GISDBASE or DATABASE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS Locations <br>
Location is a directory which contains GRASS Mapsets which
are its subdirectories. All data in one Location have the
same projection (coordinate system, datum). Each Location
<br>
must contain Mapset called PERMANENT. Typically, a Location
contains all data related to one project or a geographic
area (geographic location or region). Alternatively,
Loca&acirc; <br>
tion can simply contain all data in a given projection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS Locations can be safely
copied or moved as any other directories. Compressed
Location is usually what GRASS users exchange between each
other when they want to share a lot <br>
of data. For example, GRASS GIS sample data are provided as
Locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&acirc;t be confused with
location as a place (file or directory) in a file system.
The word location in GRASS Location refers to a location or
area on Earth (or whatever is appli&acirc; <br>
cable). Users and programmers familiar with relational
databases such as PostgreSQL can view Location as an
individual database inside the system or a storage area
which would <br>
be equivalent to GRASS GIS Database. Mapsets in a Locations
are like namespaces or schemas inside a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS Mapsets <br>
Mapsets contains the actual data, mostly geospatial data,
referred to as maps in GRASS GIS. Mapsets are a tool for
organizing maps in a transparent way as well as a tool for
<br>
isolating different tasks to prevent data loss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRASS GIS is always connected to
one particular Mapset. GRASS GIS modules can create, modify,
change, or delete a data only in the current Mapset. By
default, only the data <br>
from the current Mapset and PERMANENT Mapset are visible.
Using g.mapsets module or in GUI other Mapsets can be made
visible and seamlessly accessible. All data are available
<br>
for reading when Mapset is specified explicitly, for example
to access map streets in Mapset new_highway user can use
streets@new_highway. For maps which are in the current or
<br>
PERMAENT Mapsets or Mapsets sets as visible (accessible),
there is no need to use @mapset syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mapsets are used to store maps
related to one project, smaller project, specific task,
issue or subregions. In multi-user environment, when a team
works together on one project, <br>
Mapsets support simultaneous access of several users to the
maps stored within the same Location. Besides access to his
or her own Mapset, each user can also read maps in
PERMA&acirc; <br>
NENT Mapsent and in other users&acirc; Mapsets when set.
However, each user can modify or remove only the maps in his
or her own Mapset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides the geospatial data,
Mapset holds additional data such as color tables (managed
e.g. by r.colors) and the current computational
region&acirc;s extent and resolution stored in a <br>
file called WIND and managed by g.region.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mapsets can be copied and moved
as directories, however only when it is clear that the
projections of both Locations (as reported by g.proj) match
each other. Since this is some&acirc; <br>
times hard to to establish, it is recommended to use r.proj
or v.proj to reproject the data. The files and directories
should not be moved or modified directly, but only using
<br>
GRASS GIS tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The role of the PERMANENT Mapset
<br>
When creating a new Location, GRASS GIS automatically
creates a special Mapset called PERMANENT where the core
data for the Location are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the maps in PERMANENT
Mapset are visible from all the other Mapsets, it can be
used to store the base maps (base cartography), data common
to all projects or needed for <br>
different analyses done is separate Mapsets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In multi-user environment, data
in the PERMANENT Mapset can only be added, modified or
removed by the owner of the PERMANENT Mapset; however, they
can be accessed, analyzed, and <br>
copied into their own Mapset by the other users. The
PERMANENT Mapset is useful for providing general spatial
data (e.g. an elevation model), accessible but
write-protected to <br>
all users who are working in the same Location as the
database owner. To manipulate or add data to PERMANENT, the
owner can start GRASS GIS and choose the relevant Location
and <br>
the PERMANENT Mapset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PERMANENT Mapset also
contains the DEFAULT_WIND file which holds the default
computational region&acirc;s extent and resolution values
for the Location (which all Mapsets will <br>
inherit when they are created). Users have the option of
switching back to the default region at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing, exporting and linking
data <br>
GRASS GIS works only with data which are imported into a
GRASS Database, so all data needs to be imported, e.g. by
r.in.gdal or highly convenient r.import, before the actual
<br>
analysis. Data in GRASS Datable can be exported using for
example r.in.gdal in case of raster maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For cases when import is not
desirable, an option to link external data exists.
Projection of the linked data must match the
Location&acirc;s projection otherwise the external data <br>
cannot be linked. (Linking data in different projection is
not allowed as it would require on-the-fly reprojection
which could cause inconsistencies in the data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, module r.external
links external raster data, so that the data are accessible
in GRASS Database as standard raster maps. Similarly for
newly created maps, r.exter&acirc; <br>
nal.out setups a format and directory where the actual data
will be stored, however in GRASS Database the data will be
created as standard maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting GRASS GIS using GUI
<br>
After launching GRASS GIS, the startup window will open
(Fig. 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fig. 2: GRASS GIS startup window
The startup windows provides these functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Selecting the GRASS GIS
Database directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Selecting the Location (e.g. a
project or area). See the Location Wizard (4) for creating
new Locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Selecting the Mapset (a
subproject or task). Creating a new Mapset requires only
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 The Location Wizard for
creating new Locations based for example, on existing
georeferenced file or EPDS code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Start GRASS GIS once you have
selected an existing Location and Mapset or defined a new
one. The graphical user interface wxGUI will open and
provide you with a menu sys&acirc; <br>
tem, map visualization tool, digitizer, and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting GRASS GIS using command
line <br>
GRASS GIS can be started with given Database, Location and
Mapset from the command line. For example, the following
will start in a given Mapset with only command line
interface: <br>
grass72 -text ~/grassdata/mylocation/mymapset <br>
And the following will create the given Location with
projection given by the EPSG code and it will start the
default interface (GUI or command line): <br>
grass72 -c EPSG:5514:3 ~/grassdata/mylocation <br>
See grass command manual for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating a New Location with the
Location Wizard <br>
The wxGUI graphical user interface provides a graphical
Location Wizard which lets you easily create a new Location
for your own data. You will be guided through a series of
dia&acirc; <br>
logues to browse and select predefined projections or to
define custom projections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most convenient way of using
Location Wizard is creating new Location based on a
georeferenced file, such as Shapefile or GeoTIFF, or by
selecting the corresponding EPSG pro&acirc; <br>
jection code. In case of using georeferenced file, you are
asked whether the data itself should be imported into the
new Location. The default region is then set to match <br>
imported map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After defining a new Location,
wxGUI starts automatically. If data were already imported,
you can add them into the Layer Manager now and display
them. More data can be <br>
imported into the Location, e.g. using import options in the
File menu in Layer Manager or r.import.</p>
