<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xa - 6502/R65C02/65816 cross-assembler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xa [OPTION]... FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xa is a multi-pass cross-assembler for the 8-bit processors
in the 6502 series (such as the 6502, 65C02, 6504, 6507,
6510, 7501, 8500, 8501 and 8502), the Rockwell R65C02, and
<br>
the 16-bit 65816 processor. For a description of syntax, see
ASSEMBLER SYNTAX further in this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Use old filename behaviour
(overrides -o, -e and -l). This option is now
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C No CMOS opcodes (default is
to allow R65C02 opcodes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W No 65816 opcodes
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Allow 65816 opcodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Show lines with block
open/close (see PSEUDO-OPS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Produce o65 object files
instead of executable files (no linking performed); files
may contain undefined references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Set output filename. The default is a.o65; use the special
filename - to output to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e filename <br>
Set errorlog filename, default is none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename <br>
Set labellist filename, default is none. This is the symbol
table and can be used by disassemblers such as dxa(1) to
reconstruct source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Add cross-reference list to
labellist (requires -l).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Allow colons to appear in
comments; for MASM compatibility. This does not affect colon
interpretation elsewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Start assembler in relocating
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Llabel <br>
Defines label as an absolute (but undefined) label even when
linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b? addr <br>
Set segment base for segment ? to address addr. ? should be
t, d, b or z for text, data, bss or zero segments,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A addr <br>
Make text segment start at an address such that when the
file starts at address addr, relocation is not necessary.
Overrides -bt; other segments still have to be taken <br>
care of with -b.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Suppress list of exported
globals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DDEF=TEXT <br>
Define a preprocessor macro on the command line (see
PREPROCESSOR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I dir Add directory dir to the
include path (before XAINPUT; see ENVIRONMENT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O charset <br>
Define the output charset for character strings. Currently
supported are ASCII (default), PETSCII (Commodore ASCII),
PETSCREEN (Commodore screen codes) and HIGH (set high <br>
bit on all characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p? Set the alternative
preprocessor character to ?. This is useful when you wish to
use cpp(1) and the built-in preprocessor at the same time
(see PREPROCESSOR). Characters <br>
may need to be quoted for your shell (example:
-p&rsquo;~&rsquo; ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Show summary of
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version of program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASSEMBLER SYNTAX <br>
An introduction to 6502 assembly language programming and
mnemonics is beyond the scope of this manual page. We invite
you to investigate any number of the excellent books on the
<br>
subject; one useful title is &quot;Machine Language For
Beginners&quot; by Richard Mansfield (COMPUTE!), covering
the Atari, Commodore and Apple 8-bit systems, and is widely
available on <br>
the used market.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xa supports both the standard
NMOS 6502 opcodes as well as the Rockwell CMOS opcodes used
in the 65C02 (R65C02). With the -w option, xa will also
accept opcodes for the 65816. <br>
NMOS 6502 undocumented opcodes are intentionally not
supported, and should be entered manually using the .byte
pseudo-op (see PSEUDO-OPS). Due to conflicts between the
R65C02 <br>
and 65816 instruction sets and undocumented instructions on
the NMOS 6502, their use is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, xa accepts the
more-or-less standard 6502 assembler format as popularised
by MASM and TurboAssembler. Values and addresses can be
expressed either as literals, or as <br>
expressions; to wit,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">123 decimal value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$234 hexadecimal value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;123 octal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%010110 binary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* current value of the program
counter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ASCII value of any quoted
character is inserted directly into the program text
(example: &quot;A&quot; inserts the byte &quot;A&quot; into
the output stream); see also the PSEUDO-OPS section. <br>
This is affected by the currently selected character set, if
any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Labels define locations within
the program text, just as in other multi-pass assemblers. A
label is defined by anything that is not an opcode; for
example, a line such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label1 lda #0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defines label1 to be the current
location of the program counter (thus the address of the LDA
opcode). A label can be explicitly defined by assigning it
the value of an expres&acirc; <br>
sion, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label2 = $d000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which defines label2 to be the
address $d000, namely, the start of the VIC-II register
block on Commodore 64 computers. The program counter * is
considered to be a special kind <br>
of label, and can be assigned to with statements such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* = $c000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which sets the program counter
to decimal location 49152. With the exception of the program
counter, labels cannot be assigned multiple times. To
explicitly declare redefinition <br>
of a label, place a - (dash) before it, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-label2 = $d020</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which sets label2 to the
Commodore 64 border colour register. The scope of a label is
affected by the block it resides within (see PSEUDO-OPS for
block instructions). A label may <br>
also be hard-specified with the -L command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those instructions where the
accumulator is the implied argument (such as asl and lsr;
inc and dec on R65C02; etc.), the idiom of explicitly
specifying the accumulator with a <br>
is unnecessary as the proper form will be selected if there
is no explicit argument. In fact, for consistency with label
handing, if there is a label named a, this will actually
<br>
generate code referencing that label as a memory location
and not the accumulator. Otherwise, the assembler will
complain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Labels and opcodes may take
expressions as their arguments to allow computed values, and
may themselves reference other labels and/or the program
counter. An expression such as <br>
lab1+1 (which operates on the current value of label lab1
and increments it by one) may use the following operands,
given from highest to lowest priority:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* multiplication (priority
10)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/ integer division (priority
10)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ addition (priority 9)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- subtraction (9)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;&lt; shift left (8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;&gt; shift right (8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;= =&gt; greater than or
equal to (7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; greater than (7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;= =&lt; less than or equal
to (7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; less than (7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= equal to (6)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;&gt; &gt;&lt; does not equal
(6)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp; bitwise AND (5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ bitwise XOR (4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| bitwise OR (3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;&amp; logical AND (2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|| logical OR (1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parentheses are valid. When
redefining a label, combining arithmetic or bitwise
operators with the = (equals) operator such as += and so on
are valid, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-redeflabel += (label12/4)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, xa attempts to
ascertain the value of the operand and (when referring to a
memory location) use zero page, 16-bit or (for 65816) 24-bit
addressing where appropriate and <br>
where supported by the particular opcode. This generates
smaller and faster code, and is almost always
preferable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nevertheless, you can use these
prefix operators to force a particular rendering of the
operand. Those that generate an eight bit result can also be
used in 8-bit addressing <br>
modes, such as immediate and zero page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; low byte of expression,
e.g., lda #&lt;vector</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; high byte of expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! in situations where the
expression could be understood as either an absolute or zero
page value, do not attempt to optimize to a zero page
argument for those opcodes that <br>
support it (i.e., keep as 16 bit word)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ render as 24-bit quantity for
65816 (must specify -w command-line option). This is
required to specify any 24-bit quantity!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo; force further
optimization, even if the length of the instruction cannot
be reliably determined (see NOTES&rsquo;N&rsquo;BUGS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expressions can occur as
arguments to opcodes or within the preprocessor (see
PREPROCESSOR for syntax). For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lda label2+1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">takes the value at label2+1
(using our previous label&rsquo;s value, this would be
$d021), and will be assembled as $ad $21 $d0 to disk.
Similarly,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lda #&lt;label2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will take the lowest 8 bits of
label2 (i.e., $20), and assign them to the accumulator
(assembling the instruction as $a9 $20 to disk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are specified with a
semicolon (;), such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">;this is a comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They can also be specified in
the C language style, using /* */ and // which are
understood at the PREPROCESSOR level (q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the colon (:)
separates statements, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label4 lda #0:sta $d020</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label2: lda #2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(note the use of a colon for
specifying a label, similar to some other assemblers, which
xa also understands with or without the colon). This also
applies to semicolon comments, <br>
such that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; a comment:lda #0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is understood as a comment
followed by an opcode. To defeat this, use the -M command
line option to allow colons within comments. This does not
apply to /* */ and // comments, <br>
which are dealt with at the preprocessor level (q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSEUDO-OPS <br>
Pseudo-ops are false opcodes used by the assembler to denote
meta- or inlined commands. Like most assemblers, xa has a
rich set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.byt value1,value2,value3,...
<br>
Specifies a string of bytes to be directly placed into the
assembled object. The arguments may be expressions. Any
number of bytes can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.asc &quot;text1&quot;
,&quot;text2&quot;,... <br>
Specifies a character string which will be inserted into the
assembled object. Strings are understood according to the
currently specified character set; for example, if <br>
ASCII is specified, they will be rendered as ASCII, and if
PETSCII is specified, they will be translated into the
equivalent Commodore ASCII equivalent. Other non-standard
<br>
ASCIIs such as ATASCII for Atari computers should use the
ASCII equivalent characters; graphic and control characters
should be specified explicitly using .byt for the <br>
precise character you want. Note that when specifying the
argument of an opcode, .asc is not necessary; the quoted
character can simply be inserted (e.g., lda #&quot;A&quot;
), and <br>
is also affected by the current character set. Any number of
character strings can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.byt and .asc are synonymous, so
you can mix things such as .byt $43, 22, &quot;a character
string&quot; and get the expected result. The string is
subject to the current character set, <br>
but the remaining bytes are inserted wtihout
modification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.aasc &quot;text1&quot;
,&quot;text2&quot;,... <br>
Specifies a character string that is always rendered in true
ASCII regardless of the current character set. Like .asc, it
is synonymous with .byt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.word value1,value2,value3...
<br>
Specifies a string of 16-bit words to be placed into the
assembled object in 6502 little-endian format (that is,
low-byte/high-byte). The arguments may be expressions. Any
<br>
number of words can be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.dsb length,fillbyte <br>
Specifies a data block; a total of length repetitions of
fillbyte will be inserted into the assembled object. For
example, .dsb 5,$10 will insert five bytes, each being 16
<br>
decimal, into the object. The arguments may be
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.bin
offset,length,&quot;filename&quot; <br>
Inlines a binary file without further interpretation
specified by filename from offset offset to length length.
This allows you to insert data such as a previously
assem&acirc; <br>
bled object file or an image or other binary data structure,
inlined directly into this file&rsquo;s object. If length is
zero, then the length of filename, minus the offset, is <br>
used instead. The arguments may be expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.( Opens a new block for
scoping. Within a block, all labels defined are local to
that block and any sub-blocks, and go out of scope as soon
as the enclosing block is closed <br>
(i.e., lexically scoped). All labels defined outside of the
block are still visible within it. To explicitly declare a
global label within a block, precede the label with <br>
+ or precede it with &amp; to declare it within the previous
level only (or globally if you are only one level deep).
Sixteen levels of scoping are permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.) Closes a block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.as .al .xs .xl <br>
Only relevant in 65816 mode (with the -w option specified).
These pseudo-ops set what size accumulator and X/Y-register
should be used for future instructions; .as and .xs <br>
set 8-bit operands for the accumulator and index registers,
respectively, and .al and .xl set 16-bit operands. These
pseudo-ops on purpose do not automatically issue sep <br>
and rep instructions to set the specified width in the CPU;
set the processor bits as you need, or consider constructing
a macro. .al and .xl generate errors if -w is not <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following pseudo-ops apply
primarily to relocatable .o65 objects. A full discussion of
the relocatable format is beyond the scope of this manpage,
as it is currently a for&acirc; <br>
mat in flux. Documentation on the proposed v1.2 format is in
doc/fileformat.txt within the xa installation directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.text .data .bss .zero <br>
These pseudo-ops switch between the different segments,
.text being the actual code section, .data being the data
segment, .bss being uninitialized label space for
alloca&acirc; <br>
tion and .zero being uninitialized zero page space for
allocation. In .bss and .zero, only labels are evaluated.
These pseudo-ops are valid in relative and absolute
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.align value <br>
Aligns the current segment to a byte boundary (2, 4 or 256)
as specified by value (and places it in the header when
relative mode is enabled). Other values generate an <br>
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.fopt
type,value1,value2,value3,... <br>
Acts like .byt/.asc except that the values are embedded into
the object file as file options. The argument type is used
to specify the file option being referenced. A ta&acirc;
<br>
ble of these options is in the relocatable o65 file format
description. The remainder of the options are interpreted as
values to insert. Any number of values may be spec&acirc;
<br>
ified, and may also be strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREPROCESSOR <br>
xa implements a preprocessor very similar to that of the
C-language preprocessor cpp(1) and many oddiments apply to
both. For example, as in C, the use of /* */ for comment
<br>
delimiters is also supported in xa, and so are comments
using the double slash //. The preprocessor also supports
continuation lines, i.e., lines ending with a backslash (;
<br>
the following line is then appended to it as if there were
no dividing newline. This too is handled at the preprocessor
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For reasons of memory and
complexity, the full breadth of the cpp(1) syntax is not
fully supported. In particular, macro definitions may not be
forward-defined (i.e., a macro <br>
definition can only reference a previously defined macro
definition), except for macro functions, where recursive
evaluation is supported; e.g., to #define WW AA , AA must
have <br>
already been defined. Certain other directives are not
supported, nor are most standard pre-defined macros, and
there are other limits on evaluation and line length.
Because the <br>
maintainers of xa recognize that some files will require
more complicated preparsing than the built-in preprocessor
can supply, the preprocessor will accept cpp(1)-style <br>
line/filename/flags output. When these lines are seen in the
input file, xa will treat them as cc would, except that
flags are ignored. xa does not accept files on standard <br>
input for parsing reasons, so you should dump your cpp(1)
output to an intermediate temporary file, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc -E test.s &gt; test.xa <br>
xa test.xa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No special arguments need to be
passed to xa; the presence of cpp(1) output is detected
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that passing your file
through cpp(1) may interfere with xa&rsquo;s own
preprocessor directives. In this case, to mask directives
from cpp(1), use the -p option to specify an <br>
alternative character instead of #, such as the tilde (e.g.,
-p&rsquo;~&rsquo; ). With this option and argument
specified, then instead of #include, for example, you can
also use ~include, <br>
in addition to #include (which will also still be accepted
by the xa preprocessor, assuming any survive cpp(1)). Any
character can be used, although frankly pathologic choices
<br>
may lead to amusing and frustrating glitches during parsing.
You can also use this option to defer preprocessor
directives that cpp(1) may interpret too early until the
file <br>
actually gets to xa itself for processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following preprocessor
directives are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#include &quot;filename&quot;
<br>
Inserts the contents of file filename at this position. If
the file is not found, it is searched using paths specified
by the -I command line option or the environment <br>
variable XAINPUT (q.v.). When inserted, the file will also
be parsed for preprocessor directives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#echo comment <br>
Inserts comment comment into the errorlog file, specified
with the -e command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#print expression <br>
Computes the value of expression expression and prints it
into the errorlog file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define DEFINE text <br>
Equates macro DEFINE with text text such that wherever
DEFINE appears in the assembly source, text is substituted
in its place (just like cpp(1) would do). In addition, <br>
#define can specify macro functions like cpp(1) such that a
directive like #define mult(a,b) ((a)*(b)) would generate
the expected result wherever an expression of the <br>
form mult(a,b) appears in the source. This can also be
specified on the command line with the -D option. The
arguments of a macro function may be recursively evaluated,
<br>
unlike other #defines; the preprocessor will attempt to
re-evaluate any argument refencing another preprocessor
definition up to ten times before complaining.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following directives are
conditionals. If the conditional is not satisfied, then the
source code between the directive and its terminating #endif
are expunged and not assem&acirc; <br>
bled. Up to fifteen levels of nesting are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#endif Closes a conditional
block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#else Implements alternate path
for a conditional block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifdef DEFINE <br>
True only if macro DEFINE is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifndef DEFINE <br>
The opposite; true only if macro DEFINE has not been
previously defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#if expression <br>
True if expression expression evaluates to non-zero.
expression may reference other macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#iflused label <br>
True if label label has been used (but not necessarily
instantiated with a value). This works on labels, not
macros!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#ifldef label <br>
True if label label is defined and assigned with a value.
This works on labels, not macros!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unclosed conditional blocks at
the end of included files generate warnings; unclosed
conditional blocks at the end of assembly generate an
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#iflused and #ifldef are useful
for building up a library based on labels. For example, you
might use something like this in your library&rsquo;s
code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#iflused label <br>
#ifldef label <br>
#echo label already defined, library function label cannot
be inserted <br>
#else <br>
label /* your code */ <br>
#endif <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
xa utilises the following environment variables, if they
exist:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAINPUT <br>
Include file path; components should be separated by
&lsquo;,&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAOUTPUT <br>
Output file path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES&rsquo;N&rsquo;BUGS <br>
The R65C02 instructions ina (often rendered inc a) and dea
(dec a) must be rendered as bare inc and dec instructions
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 65816 instructions mvn and
mvp use two eight bit parameters, the only instructions in
the entire instruction set to do so. Older versions of xa
took a single 16-bit absolute <br>
value. Since 2.3.7, the standard syntax is now accepted and
the old syntax is deprecated (a warning will be
generated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Forward-defined labels -- that
is, labels that are defined after the current instruction is
processed -- cannot be optimized into zero page instructions
even if the label does <br>
end up being defined as a zero page location, because the
assembler does not know the value of the label in advance
during the first pass when the length of an instruction is
<br>
computed. On the second pass, a warning will be issued when
an instruction that could have been optimized can&rsquo;t be
because of this limitation. (Obviously, this does not apply
to <br>
branching or jumping instructions because they&rsquo;re not
optimizable anyhow, and those instructions that can only
take an 8-bit parameter will always be casted to an 8-bit
quan&acirc; <br>
tity.) If the label cannot otherwise be defined ahead of the
instruction, the backtick prefix &lsquo; may be used to
force further optimization no matter where the label is
defined as <br>
long as the instruction supports it. Indiscriminately
forcing the issue can be fraught with peril, however, and is
not recommended; to discourage this, the assembler will
com&acirc; <br>
plain about its use in addressing mode situations where no
ambiguity exists, such as indirect indexed, branching and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, as a further consequence
of the way optimization is managed, we repeat that all
24-bit quantities and labels that reference a 24-bit
quantity in 65816 mode, anteriorly <br>
declared or otherwise, MUST be prepended with the @ prefix.
Otherwise, the assembler will attempt to optimize to 16
bits, which may be undesirable.</p>
