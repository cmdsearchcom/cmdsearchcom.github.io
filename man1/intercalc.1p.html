<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
intercalc - CLC-INTERCAL desk calculator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
intercalc [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
intercalc is a simple desk calculator, allowing the user to
enter INTERCAL statements (to see what they do) and
expressions (to see what value they produce); it uses an
<br>
interpreter object from CLC-INTERCAL to provide immediate
feedback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The desk calculator accepts
several options, some of which are documented here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Interface Options <br>
-X / --graphic <br>
Enters X-based graphical user interface. Requires Perl-GTK.
This is the default if Perl-GTK is installed, the
environment variable $DISPLAY is set and the opening of the
X <br>
display succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c / --curses <br>
Enters full screen, curses-based interface. This is the
default if the X based interface cannot be started, the
environment variable $TERM is set and the terminal name is
<br>
known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--line <br>
Enters the line-mode user interface. This is the default if
the X based and the curses based interfaces do not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode, the program
executes each line from standard input according to the
current mode and language, and prints results to standard
output. A line starting with a <br>
backspark is interpreted as a command to the calculator. Use
backspark-g to GIVE UP (you&rsquo;ll need to do it twice),
or backspark-h to display the ehm, help page. Things which
<br>
are available via menu entries on the Curses and X
interfaces are also available via the backspark. For now,
you can refer to the source code for a list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command-line editing and command
history is provided by the readline library. Command
completion works if the underlying compiler supports it (the
compilers provided with the <br>
distributions do).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--batch <br>
Avoids entering interactive mode. This is the default if the
standard input and output are not connected to a terminal
and the X based interface cannot be started. This mode <br>
is very similar to the line mode except that command-line
editing and command history are not implemented. Backspark
escapes work just the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-itype / --interface=type <br>
Selects the user interface type. Currently, only X, Curses,
Line and None are defined, but more can be installed as
compiler plug-ins. If the interface selected is None, <br>
intercalc will work in batch mode. In addition, an empty
string will reinstate the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source language and compilation
options <br>
--bug=number <br>
Selects a different probability for the compiler bug. The
compiler bug is implemented by initialising the
compiler&rsquo;s state with the required probability: when a
statement is <br>
compiled (usually at runtime), a &quot;BUG&quot; instruction
is emitted with the required probability. The default is
1%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ubug=number <br>
Selects a probability for the unexplainable compiler bug.
This is the compiler bug which occurs when the probability
of a (explainable) compiler bug is zero. Only wimps <br>
would use this option. The default is 0.01%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ipath / --include=path <br>
Adds a directory before the standard search path for
compiler objects and source code. If a file is accessible
from the current directory, it is never searched in any
include <br>
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is repeated, the
given paths will be searched in the order given, followed by
the standard paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llanguage / --language=language
<br>
Selects the language to use when interpreting user input.
This should correspond to the name of a compiler, which is
an INTERCAL object which was originally built by iacc. <br>
Only the expression and statement parsers are used, so it is
possible to test incomplete compilers by loading them into
intercalc even if they don&rsquo;t work with sick. The <br>
default is obtained from the sickrc option
.INTERCALC.LANGUAGE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ooption ---option=option <br>
Adds a language option. For example, --o3 selects base 3
calculation, and --owimp selects wimp mode. If no options
are provided, and the default language was taken from the
<br>
sickrc file, the default options are taken from the sickrc
file. Note that if an option or a language is specified on
the command line, the sickrc defaults are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike previous versions of
intercalc, this version checks that the options make sense
in the context of the calculator; for example trying to load
a compiler as an option <br>
will cause an error, but a compiler extension will be
OK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmode / --mode=mode <br>
Select operation mode. Currently, the only valid modes are
full, expr and one. See &quot;Operating Modes&quot;. If this
is not specified, the default is taken from the sickrc
option <br>
..INTERCALC.MODE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Misc Options <br>
-rname / --rcfile=name <br>
Executes commands from file name before starting to accept
input. This option can be repeated, to execute more than one
file. If it is not specified, the standard library, <br>
the current directory, and the current user&rsquo;s home
directory are searched for files with name system.sickrc or
.sickrc, which are then executed. The order for this search
is: <br>
specified library (--include), system library, home
directory, current directory. This is different from the
search order used when looking for objects or source code.
If a <br>
directory contains both .sickrc and system.sickrc, the
system.sickrc is executed first, followed by .sickrc. Also
note that if the current directory or the home directory
<br>
appear in the search path and contain one of these files,
they will be executed twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If filenames are explicitely
specified, they must be fully qualified: the search path is
not used to find them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nouserrc <br>
Prevents loading a user rcfile (.sickrc); also limits
loading of system.sickrc to the first one found. This option
is normally only used when testing the installation, to <br>
prevent interference from previous versions of
CLC-INTERCAL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operating Modes <br>
The calculator can operate in the following modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">full Fully functional INTERCAL
interpreter. <br>
The calculator can parse and execute any statement or
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statements are compiled as a
one-statement program, and executed; any register value etc.
will be preserved between statements, so entering a list of
statements is <br>
equivalent to running a program in which all these
statements are executed in sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important to note that
some statements will not execute in the normal manner. For
example, a COME FROM will be parsed but have no effect,
unless it is something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) PLEASE COME FROM (1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which causes the calculator to
hang. On the other hand, an ABSTAIN FROM or a REINSTATE will
work as expected, as will CREATE and DESTROY. A GIVE UP does
not cause the <br>
calculator to terminate. One final difference is that
comments are not parsed, and therefore you get a
&quot;Syntax Error&quot; from the calculator rather than a
splat *000 from the <br>
INTERCAL interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For expressions, the calculator
READs OUT the expression&rsquo;s result. Any side effects
will be remembered, so if the expression contains overloads
they will remain to haunt <br>
the calculator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr INTERCAL expression
interpreter <br>
The calculator can only parse expressions or assignments. In
either case, the calculated values are READ OUT; assignments
will also store the value to the destination, while <br>
expressions will then discard the result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">oic The One Instruction
Calculator. <br>
This is something we&rsquo;ve made up one early morning
while discussing desk calculators (as one does). It is not
INTERCAL at all, in fact it is inspired from the One <br>
Instruction Set Computer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calculator has a number of
memories (default 100 - these can be changed by appending a
number to the operating mode, for example oic10 will use a
10-memory calculator). <br>
These memories are identified by the letter m followed by a
number; in the default 100-memory version, the first two
digits after m are the memory, and any subsequent digit <br>
forms part of the next operand. At the start, all memories
are initialised to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since there is only one
operation, there is no need to specify it, so an
&quot;operation&quot; is a sequence of three operands and a
result. The result must be a memory, while each <br>
operand can be a number or a memory, with the limitation
that consecutive numbers are acceptable only if the parser
can determine where one ends and the next one starts. So
<br>
for example &quot;1-0&quot; is two numeric operands, 1 and
-0 (aka 0); &quot;1.2.3&quot; is also two operands, 1.2 and
3; &quot;12&quot; is a single operand, even if you intended
it to be two operands, 1 <br>
and 2, and even if you put spaces: &quot;1 2&quot; is still
interpreted as the single operand 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation performed is the
difference between the first two operands, divided by the
third. For example, the three operations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 m01 2 M01 <br>
1 m02 1 m02 <br>
m1 .5 m2 m03</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will produce results m01=3.5
((7-0)/2); m02=1 ((1-0)/1); m03=3 ((3.5-.5)/1). and will
produce the following output if the calculator is running in
batch mode:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m01 3.5 (7 - m01) / 2 <br>
m02 1 (1 - m02) / 1 <br>
m03 3 (m01 - .5) / m02</p>

finding the &quot;help&quot; menu or key (X and Curses) or
backspark escape (Line and None).</p>
