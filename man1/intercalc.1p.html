<b>intercalc</b> [options]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>intercalc</b> is a simple desk calculator, allowing the user to enter
  INTERCAL statements (to see what they do) and expressions (to see what value
  they produce); it uses an interpreter object from CLC-INTERCAL to provide
  immediate feedback.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The desk calculator accepts several options, some of which are documented here.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="User_Interface_Options"><a class="selflink" href="#User_Interface_Options">User
  Interface Options</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-X</b> / <b>--graphic</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enters X-based graphical user interface. Requires Perl-GTK.
      This is the default if Perl-GTK is installed, the environment variable
      <i></i> <i>$DISPLAY</i><i></i> is set and the opening of the X display
      succeeds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b> / <b>--curses</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enters full screen, curses-based interface. This is the
      default if the X based interface cannot be started, the environment
      variable <i></i><i>$TERM</i><i></i> is set and the terminal name is
    known.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--line</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enters the line-mode user interface. This is the default if
      the X based and the curses based interfaces do not work.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In this mode, the program executes each line from standard input according
      to the current mode and language, and prints results to standard output. A
      line starting with a backspark is interpreted as a command to the
      calculator. Use backspark-g to GIVE UP (you'll need to do it twice), or
      backspark-h to display the ehm, help page. Things which are available via
      menu entries on the Curses and X interfaces are also available via the
      backspark. For now, you can refer to the source code for a list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Command-line editing and command history is provided by the readline
      library. Command completion works if the underlying compiler supports it
      (the compilers provided with the distributions do).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--batch</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Avoids entering interactive mode. This is the default if
      the standard input and output are not connected to a terminal and the X
      based interface cannot be started. This mode is very similar to the line
      mode except that command-line editing and command history are not
      implemented. Backspark escapes work just the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b><i>type</i> / <b>--interface</b>=<i>type</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Selects the user interface <i>type</i>. Currently, only
      <i>X</i>, <i>Curses</i>, <i>Line</i> and <i>None</i> are defined, but more
      can be installed as compiler plug-ins. If the interface selected is
      <i>None</i>, <b>intercalc</b> will work in batch mode. In addition, an
      empty string will reinstate the default behaviour.</dd>
</dl>

  language and compilation options</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--bug</b>=<i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Selects a different probability for the compiler bug. The
      compiler bug is implemented by initialising the compiler's state with the
      required probability: when a statement is compiled (usually at runtime), a
      &quot;BUG&quot; instruction is emitted with the required probability. The
      default is 1%.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--ubug</b>=<i>number</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Selects a probability for the unexplainable compiler bug.
      This is the compiler bug which occurs when the probability of a
      (explainable) compiler bug is zero. Only wimps would use this option. The
      default is 0.01%.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-I</b><i>path</i> / <b>--include</b>=<i>path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Adds a directory before the standard search path for
      compiler objects and source code. If a file is accessible from the current
      directory, it is never searched in any include path.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If this option is repeated, the given paths will be searched in the order
      given, followed by the standard paths.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b><i>language</i> /
    <b>--language</b>=<i>language</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Selects the language to use when interpreting user input.
      This should correspond to the name of a compiler, which is an INTERCAL
      object which was originally built by <i>iacc</i>. Only the expression and
      statement parsers are used, so it is possible to test incomplete compilers
      by loading them into <i>intercalc</i> even if they don't work with
      <i>sick</i>. The default is obtained from the <i>sickrc</i> option
      <i>.INTERCALC.LANGUAGE</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">-<b>-o</b><i>option</i> -<b>--option</b>=<i>option</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Adds a language option. For example, -<b>-o</b><i>3</i>
      selects base 3 calculation, and - <b>-o</b><i>wimp</i> selects wimp mode.
      If no options are provided, and the default language was taken from the
      <i>sickrc</i> file, the default options are taken from the <i>sickrc</i>
      file. Note that if an option or a language is specified on the command
      line, the <i>sickrc</i> defaults are ignored.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unlike previous versions of <i>intercalc</i>, this version checks that the
      options make sense in the context of the calculator; for example trying to
      load a compiler as an option will cause an error, but a compiler extension
      will be OK.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b><i>mode</i> / <b>--mode</b>=<i>mode</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select operation mode. Currently, the only valid modes are
      <i>full</i>, <i>expr</i> and <i>one</i>. See &quot;Operating Modes&quot;.
      If this is not specified, the default is taken from the <i>sickrc</i>
      option <i>..INTERCALC.MODE</i>.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Executes commands from file <i>name</i> before starting to
      accept input. This option can be repeated, to execute more than one file.
      If it is not specified, the standard library, the current directory, and
      the current user's home directory are searched for files with name
      <i>system.sickrc</i> or <i>.sickrc</i>, which are then executed. The order
      for this search is: specified library ( <b>--include</b>), system library,
      home directory, current directory. This is different from the search order
      used when looking for objects or source code. If a directory contains both
      <i>.sickrc</i> and <i>system.sickrc</i>, the <i>system.sickrc</i> is
      executed first, followed by <i>.sickrc</i>. Also note that if the current
      directory or the home directory appear in the search path and contain one
      of these files, they will be executed twice.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If filenames are explicitely specified, they must be fully qualified: the
      search path is not used to find them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--nouserrc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Prevents loading a user rcfile (.sickrc); also limits
      loading of system.sickrc to the first one found. This option is normally
      only used when testing the installation, to prevent interference from
      previous versions of CLC-INTERCAL.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Operating_Modes"><a class="selflink" href="#Operating_Modes">Operating
  Modes</a></h1>
The calculator can operate in the following modes:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">full Fully functional INTERCAL interpreter.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The calculator can parse and execute any statement or
      expression.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Statements are compiled as a one-statement program, and executed; any
      register value etc. will be preserved between statements, so entering a
      list of statements is equivalent to running a program in which all these
      statements are executed in sequence.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is important to note that some statements will not execute in the normal
      manner. For example, a COME FROM will be parsed but have no effect, unless
      it is something like:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    (1) PLEASE COME FROM (1)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which causes the calculator to hang. On the other hand, an ABSTAIN FROM or a
      REINSTATE will work as expected, as will CREATE and DESTROY. A GIVE UP
      does not cause the calculator to terminate. One final difference is that
      comments are not parsed, and therefore you get a &quot;Syntax Error&quot;
      from the calculator rather than a splat *000 from the INTERCAL
      interpreter.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For expressions, the calculator READs OUT the expression's result. Any side
      effects will be remembered, so if the expression contains overloads they
      will remain to haunt the calculator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">expr INTERCAL expression interpreter</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The calculator can only parse expressions or assignments.
      In either case, the calculated values are READ OUT; assignments will also
      store the value to the destination, while expressions will then discard
      the result.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">oic The <b>O</b>ne <b>I</b>nstruction
    <b>C</b>alculator.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is something we've made up one early morning while
      discussing desk calculators (as one does). It is not INTERCAL at all, in
      fact it is inspired from the One Instruction Set Computer.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The calculator has a number of memories (default 100 - these can be changed
      by appending a number to the operating mode, for example <i>oic10</i> will
      use a 10-memory calculator). These memories are identified by the letter
      <b>m</b> followed by a number; in the default 100-memory version, the
      first two digits after <b>m</b> are the memory, and any subsequent digit
      forms part of the next operand. At the start, all memories are initialised
      to 0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since there is only one operation, there is no need to specify it, so an
      &quot;operation&quot; is a sequence of three operands and a result. The
      result must be a memory, while each operand can be a number or a memory,
      with the limitation that consecutive numbers are acceptable only if the
      parser can determine where one ends and the next one starts. So for
      example &quot;1-0&quot; is two numeric operands, 1 and -0 (aka 0);
      &quot;1.2.3&quot; is also two operands, 1.2 and 3; &quot;12&quot; is a
      single operand, even if you intended it to be two operands, 1 and 2, and
      even if you put spaces: &quot;1 2&quot; is still interpreted as the single
      operand 12.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The operation performed is the difference between the first two operands,
      divided by the third. For example, the three operations:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    7 m01 2 M01
    1 m02 1 m02
    m1 .5 m2 m03
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    will produce results m01=3.5 ((7-0)/2); m02=1 ((1-0)/1); m03=3 ((3.5-.5)/1).
      and will produce the following output if the calculator is running in
      batch mode:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    m01                  3.5     (7 - m01) / 2
    m02                    1     (1 - m02) / 1
    m03                    3     (m01 - .5) / m02
    </pre>
  </dd>
