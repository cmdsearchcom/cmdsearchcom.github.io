<p>FIG2PS(1) Conversion from XFig to PS/EPS/PDF
FIG2PS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fig2ps, fig2eps,fig2pdf - Convert xfig files in ps|pdf,
processing all the text marked as special with LaTeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fig2ps [-h|--help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2ps [ options ] file1.fig
[file2.fig ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2pdf [ options ] file1.fig
[file2.fig ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fig2ps converts figures produced by XFig into postscript or
PDF, processing the text with LaTeX. It takes advantage of
the pstex and pstext_t export formats of fig2dev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2ps converts successively all
the files given as arguments. It&rsquo;s behaviour is
governed by quite a few options. In all the options, the =
sign is optional, so that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2ps --bbox=dvips file.fig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2ps --bbox dvips file.fig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To convert file.fig to PS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2ps file.fig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert it to PDF:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2pdf file.fig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2ps --pdf file.fig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the XFig file you want to
convert to PDF contains included images, you might want to
try:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fig2pdf --manual-ps2pdf
file.fig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--gv, --nogv <br>
If on, fig2ps runs gv on every file just after they are
produced. On by default if fig2ps thinks it is talking to a
terminal (ie not from a pipe). You might want to switch <br>
that off when processing lots of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xpdf <br>
Views produced files with xpdf rather than gv. Obviously,
that won&rsquo;t be really useful if you are producing PS
files, you&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--viewer=command <br>
Runs command rather than gv on the produced files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep <br>
Tells fig2ps to keep the temporary directory in which
temporary files are created. Useful for debugging. If this
option is on, fig2ps prints the name of the directory when
it <br>
has finished its job, so you know where to look.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--packages=pack1,pack2,... <br>
Sets the package list to be used to pack1,pack2,.... Resets
any package given by the --add command-line option. For more
information about packages, see the section PREAMBLE <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add=pack1,pack2,... <br>
Adds pack1,pack2,... to the existing list of packages. See
the section PREAMBLE below. This option is cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bbox=dvips|gs|a,b,c,d <br>
Chooses the method to determine the bounding box of the
files. See the section BOUNDING BOX below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--input=file <br>
Uses file as a template for the LaTeX file. More information
about that can be found in the section PREAMBLE below. This
option was written for a private use, though you can <br>
of course profit from it. However, most of the times, what
you really want is --add=file. file will be looked for using
kpsewhich.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pdf, --nopdf <br>
Whether the final output of fig2ps will be PDF or
postscript. This option is automatically when called as
fig2pdf. Note that in any case, fig2ps has to go through
Postscript <br>
output to produce a PDF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--eps <br>
Change the output default extension from .ps to .eps. This
is on by default when the program is called as fig2eps. It
has no other effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--manual-ps2pdf <br>
When producing PDF files, fig2ps uses epstopdf to perform
the conversion. This may lead to bad quality output with
embedded pictures. The use of this option disables PDF
pro&acirc; <br>
duction by epstopdf and lets ps2pdf produce the final output
PDF (but after tweaking the PS file using epstopdf). In
general, this produces much better results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ps2pdf-options <br>
When --manual-ps2pdf does not produce output of decent
quality, you can use this option to manually feed options to
ps2pdf. The use of this option implies --manual-ps2pdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keepps <br>
When producing a PDF file, asks fig2ps to keep the
intermediary Postscript file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--forcespecial, --noforcespecial
<br>
fig2ps only processes with LaTeX text which is marked as
special in the Fig file. When this option is on, all text is
treated as if it was marked with the special flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dvips=string <br>
Passes string as options for dvips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fig2dev=string <br>
Passes string as options for fig2dev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preamble=string <br>
Adds string in the preamble of the LaTeX file g i n {
generated, just before the dnt} stanza. Effects are
cumulative. o c u m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Prints the version of fig2ps and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
Many of the command-line options can be set in either the
system-wide (in /etc) or the user configuration file (in the
user&rsquo;s home directory). Some more details can be
configured <br>
in the configuration files. Global configuration is
overridden by users&rsquo; configuration which in turn is
overridden by the command line options. Here is a list of
the variables <br>
you can define:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PACKAGES=pack1,pack2... <br>
Defines the basic list of packages. See the PREAMBLE
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADD=pack1,pack2 <br>
Has the same effect as the --add command-line option. Does
not make too much sense in the global configuration file,
but you might want to use it in a personal one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOC_CLASS=class <br>
Sets the document class used by LaTeX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOC_OPTIONS=Ioptions <br>
Sets the options for the document class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORCE_SPECIAL=0|1 <br>
Sets the default for option --forcespecial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GV=0|1 <br>
Sets the default for option --gv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GV=file <br>
Has the same effect as the --input command-line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREAMBLE=string <br>
Identical to the --preamble option, with the slight
difference that the in configuration files, it is not
cumulative: the last assignment seen is the only taken into
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEEP_PS=0|1 <br>
Sets the default for option --keepps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREAMBLE <br>
The preamble of the LaTeX file is built as such:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* if a --input file is
specified, it will be used directly with a input statement.
A ocumentclass statement will be added if the input file
does not contain any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* else, a preamble is made based
on the values of DOC_CLASS, DOC_OPTIONS, and PACKAGES (the
latter is overridden by the --packages command-line option).
See below for the format <br>
of the package variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then, the packages specified
using the ADD variable and the --add command-line options
are added to the preamble, followed by the geometry package
that deals with setting the <br>
size of the output (tweaked for fig2ps&rsquo;s purposes) and
finally the contents of the PREAMBLE variable and the
--preamble command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --packages and --add
options, and the corresponding variables, take a comma
separated list of packages. Options for the packages can be
specified in two ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[option]package <br>
in which you can only specify one option;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option1:option2:...:package <br>
in which you can specify an arbitrary number of options, as
long as you don&rsquo;t need a comma inside an option.
Should the need arise, use --preamble.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOUNDING BOX <br>
One of the delicate jobs of fig2ps is to set the bounding
box of the produced file, that is the rectangle that holds
the figure. There are basically three ways for fig2ps to get
<br>
them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvips <br>
In this mode, fig2ps runs dvips with the -E option. It works
reasonably fine most of the time, but it will produce
incorrect results if you have rotated text near the edge of
<br>
the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gs Asks gs to tell the bounding
box of the figure. It used to produce systematically perfect
results, but the quality has degraded somehow recently. It
still works in most of <br>
the cases, and that is why it is the default. It fails on
very large pictures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a,b,c,d <br>
Specify your bounding box by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The benefits of using the last
two methods is that fig2ps tells you how big the picture is
(in centimeters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/fig2ps/fig2ps.rc, $HOME/.fig2ps.rc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The examples/ directory in the
source tarball contains some examples. Check fig2ps on them
to see if it works fine, but keep in mind that fig2ps will
choke on examples/Large- <br>
example.fig !</p>
