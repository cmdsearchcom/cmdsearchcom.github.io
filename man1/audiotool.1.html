<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Audiotool is used to copy, manipulate, and examine the
contents of audio files. These audio files may be raw
headerless audio data or audio stored in common data files
such as <br>
.wav or .au files. In the near future audiotool will also
support packetized audio files such as .mp3 and .ogg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-append <br>
appends the content of other audio files into an existing
audio file. The offset to save within the existing file may
be specified. If nessisary the content of the spec&acirc;
<br>
ified files will be re-encoded in the codec of the file
being appended to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-build Build a brand new audio
file from scratch and then copy content from existing audio
files into it. The encoding of the new audio file will
either be based on the file <br>
extension, the audio file that is being copied into it, or
by specifying the encoding format directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chart This is used to generate
an energy chart profile of the audio file frame by frame. A
* indicates solid audio content, a ^ indicates what might be
a lead or trailer sec&acirc; <br>
tion of partial content, and a . indicates relative silence.
Soon a autotrim option will be added to audiotool to remove
silent frames.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-codecs <br>
List all active codec objects. If you have plugins which are
loaded that creates codec objects which match a built-in
codec, the plugin will be selected first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-info The info command gives you
basic information on the audio file, including what format
it is stored as, what codec the audio data is encoded in,
how much data is in the <br>
file, what the bit rate used is, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-notation <br>
Notation can be used to either set or display the annotation
stored in audio files which support annotations, such as .au
and .wav files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-play Plays the content of the
audio file to the default system audio device (soundcard).
Play is supported on w32 and posix systems that support oss
audio. Future work will <br>
expand to additional platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-plugins <br>
This simply returns the path to the plugins directory. All
plugins are loaded with Audio::init(). Plugins are not
supported when building with static linkage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strip Strips out all silent
frames from an audio file. Silent frames are those which
fall below a threashold and that have no peak impulse above
the threashold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trim Removes leading and
trailing &quot;silence&quot; from a file. The -padding
option may be used to add additional silent frames at the
end of the file after it has been trimed, as <br>
this may be needed for files that will later be used to join
together phrases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
At this time audiotool does not perform and ccaudio does not
support sample rate conversion. Appending and building from
files which are encoded at different sample rates could <br>
have ammusing results.</p>
