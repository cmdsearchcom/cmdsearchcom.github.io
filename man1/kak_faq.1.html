<p>KAK_FAQ(1) faq KAK_FAQ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
faq - a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to pronounce the name of the
project and what does it mean ? <br>
The name of the project is pronounced &quot;Kak-oon&quot;,
and is a word taken from a New Caledonian dialect based on
french. It means a hard blow, usually a punch, but generally
refers to <br>
a blow into which which all of one&acirc;s strength
went.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Is there going to be a Windows
port of Kakoune ? <br>
As many features provided by UNIX systems would be missing,
or if anything much less efficient on a Windows system, the
incentive to porting the project to this operating system
<br>
is pretty low.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, you can get pretty
decent performance by using Kakoune on Cygwin (which is
officially supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can you get rid of the boost
dependency and just use std::regex ? <br>
The boost-regex library provides use with several features
that are heavily relied upon across several core scripts,
and a few of them are not available in the standard <br>
std::regex implementations. Therefore, until the standard
catches up with boost in terms of features, the latter will
remain a hard -mandatory- dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kakoune is very slow on big
files, what can I do about it ? <br>
The default build mode (set in the Makefile of the src
directory of the project) is &quot;debug&quot;, which makes
it convenient to track issues but also affects performance.
To disable <br>
the debug mode, recompile the project by setting the debug
variable in src/Makefile to no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if your distribution
provides a &quot;kakoune&quot; package, the program should
already be built in non-debug mode (if you still experience
slowness, please report the issue on <br>
the bug tracker).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I use Kakoune as a pager ?
<br>
Kakoune can be used as a pager, either by setting the EDITOR
environment variable to kak, or by writing data directly to
its standard input using a shell pipeline. However, since
<br>
the program relies on several heavy dynamic libraries (boost
being one of them), it will be slightly less practical than
other regular pagers (such as less or more) which have a
<br>
minimal amount of runtime dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Are there any non-console based
frontends available ? <br>
No graphical frontend is currently officially maintained,
you can however try experimental community-developed
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why are colors misrendered in my
Kakoune clients ? <br>
The most probable cause for that is a very widespread
practice that consists in setting the TERM environment
variable in the shell&acirc;s configuration file. This
variable should be <br>
set by the terminal emulator, and not overridden with an
arbitrary value, otherwise it might interfere with general
UI rendering on the terminal&acirc;s window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you&acirc;re using
tmux, the proper -official- way to get Kakoune to work is to
add the following line to your tmux configuration file: set
-sg default-terminal <br>
screen-256color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How do I automatically indent
code, as Vim does with = ? <br>
As Kakoune doesn&acirc;t parse the contents of the buffers,
there is no builtin equivalent for this Vim feature. Use a
formatter/prettifier dedicated to the language you&acirc;re
using with <br>
the help of the | key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: %|indent&lt;ret&gt; to
indent an entire buffer with C code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that some languages have a
default formatter set, which you can use with the :format
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can Kakoune automatically
complete the parameters of my functions ? <br>
As mentioned in the above question about Vim&acirc;s = key,
Kakoune does not parse the contents of a buffer by itself,
which makes it impossible for the editor to propose
candidates <br>
upon completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, support for such a
feature can be achieved through the use of a dedicated tool,
as is the case with clang and C code: you can use the
clang-enable-autocomplete and <br>
clang-complete builtin commands whenever editing a C/C++
file, and completion will work on function parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the same features are
available for python buffers, with the jedi script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why aren&acirc;t widely known
command line shortcuts such as &lt;c-w&gt; or &lt;c-u&gt;
available in Kakoune ? <br>
Despite their widespread availability in multiple tools,
those shortcuts do not fit the paradigm that Kakoune
implements, which is based on selections first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you can easily declare
key mappings in your configuration file to be able to use
those control-based shortcuts in insert mode (c.f. the
&quot;map&quot; command in the &quot;commands&quot; <br>
documentation page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How can I explore the filesystem
the way Vim&acirc;s NerdTree does ? <br>
The builtin file completion engine used when opening a file
for editing (using the :edit command and letting the
suggestions popup in the menu beneath) is much more
convenient <br>
than Vim&acirc;s, which should suit basic needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you need an actual
explorer to interact with the editor, you can create a
Kakoune script that will spawn the tool in question, which
should in return send an &quot;edit&quot; <br>
command followed by the path of the file you selected to the
current Kakoune session (e.g. echo &quot;eval -client
$kak_client edit /path/to/file&quot; | kak -p
$kak_session).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Why aren&acirc;t there other
scopes similar to %sh{} e.g. python ? <br>
Supporting custom scopes would add hard dependencies to the
project, which is too much of an drawback when balanced
against the low cost of using an interpreter in a regular
<br>
shell scope (e.g. %sh{ python -c &quot;...&quot; }). The
shell scope allows users to spawn any interpreter they want,
for a minimal cost in terms of performance, it is therefore
the reason <br>
why it&acirc;s the only one available by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I disable auto-indentation
completely ? <br>
All the indentation hooks are conventionally named
&lt;lang&gt;-indent, which allows us to use the
disabled_hooks variable to disable indentation globally with
the following command: <br>
set global disabled_hooks &rsquo;.+-indent&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I disable syntax
highlighting completely ? <br>
Similarly to the indentation hooks, the name format followed
by the highlighting hooks is &lt;lang&gt;-highlight. You can
thus disable syntax highlighting using the following
command: <br>
set global disabled_hooks &rsquo;.+-highlight&rsquo;</p>
