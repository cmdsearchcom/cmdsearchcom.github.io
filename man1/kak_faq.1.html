  to pronounce the name of the project and what does it mean ?</a></h2>
The name of the project is pronounced &quot;Kak-oon&quot;, and is a word taken
  from a New Caledonian dialect based on french. It means a hard blow, usually a
  punch, but generally refers to a blow into which which all of one&#x2019;s
  strength went.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Is_there_going_to_be_a_Windows_port_of_Kakoune_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Is_there_going_to_be_a_Windows_port_of_Kakoune_?">Is
  there going to be a Windows port of Kakoune ?</a></h2>
As many features provided by UNIX systems would be missing, or if anything much
  less efficient on a Windows system, the incentive to porting the project to
  this operating system is pretty low.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Moreover, you can get pretty decent performance by using Kakoune on Cygwin
  (which is officially supported).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_you_get_rid_of_the_boost_dependency_and_just_use_std::regex_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_you_get_rid_of_the_boost_dependency_and_just_use_std::regex_?">Can
  you get rid of the boost dependency and just use std::regex ?</a></h2>
The boost-regex library provides use with several features that are heavily
  relied upon across several core scripts, and a few of them are not available
  in the standard std::regex implementations. Therefore, until the standard
  catches up with boost in terms of features, the latter will remain a hard
  -mandatory- dependency.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Kakoune_is_very_slow_on_big_files,_what_can_I_do_about_it_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Kakoune_is_very_slow_on_big_files,_what_can_I_do_about_it_?">Kakoune
  is very slow on big files, what can I do about it ?</a></h2>
The default build mode (set in the Makefile of the src directory of the project)
  is &quot;debug&quot;, which makes it convenient to track issues but also
  affects performance. To disable the debug mode, recompile the project by
  setting the debug variable in src/Makefile to no.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that if your distribution provides a &quot;kakoune&quot; package, the
  program should already be built in non-debug mode (if you still experience
  slowness, please report the issue on the bug tracker).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_I_use_Kakoune_as_a_pager_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_I_use_Kakoune_as_a_pager_?">Can
  I use Kakoune as a pager ?</a></h2>
Kakoune can be used as a pager, either by setting the EDITOR environment
  variable to kak, or by writing data directly to its standard input using a
  shell pipeline. However, since the program relies on several heavy dynamic
  libraries (boost being one of them), it will be slightly less practical than
  other regular pagers (such as less or more) which have a minimal amount of
  runtime dependencies.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Are_there_any_non-console_based_frontends_available_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Are_there_any_non-console_based_frontends_available_?">Are
  there any non-console based frontends available ?</a></h2>
No graphical frontend is currently officially maintained, you can however try
  experimental community-developed ones.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_are_colors_misrendered_in_my_Kakoune_clients_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_are_colors_misrendered_in_my_Kakoune_clients_?">Why
  are colors misrendered in my Kakoune clients ?</a></h2>
The most probable cause for that is a very widespread practice that consists in
  setting the TERM environment variable in the shell&#x2019;s configuration
  file. This variable should be set by the terminal emulator, and not overridden
  with an arbitrary value, otherwise it might interfere with general UI
  rendering on the terminal&#x2019;s window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that if you&#x2019;re using tmux, the proper -official- way to get Kakoune
  to work is to add the following line to your tmux configuration file: set -sg
  default-terminal screen-256color
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_automatically_indent_code,_as_Vim_does_with_=_?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_automatically_indent_code,_as_Vim_does_with_=_?">How
  do I automatically indent code, as Vim does with = ?</a></h2>
As Kakoune doesn&#x2019;t parse the contents of the buffers, there is no builtin
  equivalent for this Vim feature. Use a formatter/prettifier dedicated to the
  language you&#x2019;re using with the help of the | key.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Example: %|indent&lt;ret&gt; to indent an entire buffer with C code.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that some languages have a default formatter set, which you can use with
  the :format command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_Kakoune_automatically_complete_the_parameters_of_my_functions_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_Kakoune_automatically_complete_the_parameters_of_my_functions_?">Can
  Kakoune automatically complete the parameters of my functions ?</a></h2>
As mentioned in the above question about Vim&#x2019;s = key, Kakoune does not
  parse the contents of a buffer by itself, which makes it impossible for the
  editor to propose candidates upon completion.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, support for such a feature can be achieved through the use of a
  dedicated tool, as is the case with clang and C code: you can use the
  clang-enable-autocomplete and clang-complete builtin commands whenever editing
  a C/C++ file, and completion will work on function parameters.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the same features are available for python buffers, with the jedi
  script.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_aren&#x2019;t_widely_known_command_line_shortcuts_such_as_&lt;c-w&gt;_or_&lt;c-u&gt;_available_in_Kakoune_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_aren&#x2019;t_widely_known_command_line_shortcuts_such_as_&lt;c-w&gt;_or_&lt;c-u&gt;_available_in_Kakoune_?">Why
  aren&#x2019;t widely known command line shortcuts such as &lt;c-w&gt; or
  &lt;c-u&gt; available in Kakoune ?</a></h2>
Despite their widespread availability in multiple tools, those shortcuts do not
  fit the paradigm that Kakoune implements, which is based on selections first.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, you can easily declare key mappings in your configuration file to be
  able to use those control-based shortcuts in insert mode (c.f. the
  &quot;map&quot; command in the &quot;commands&quot; documentation page).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_can_I_explore_the_filesystem_the_way_Vim&#x2019;s_NerdTree_does_?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_can_I_explore_the_filesystem_the_way_Vim&#x2019;s_NerdTree_does_?">How
  can I explore the filesystem the way Vim&#x2019;s NerdTree does ?</a></h2>
The builtin file completion engine used when opening a file for editing (using
  the :edit command and letting the suggestions popup in the menu beneath) is
  much more convenient than Vim&#x2019;s, which should suit basic needs.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, if you need an actual explorer to interact with the editor, you can
  create a Kakoune script that will spawn the tool in question, which should in
  return send an &quot;edit&quot; command followed by the path of the file you
  selected to the current Kakoune session (e.g. echo &quot;eval -client
  $kak_client edit /path/to/file&quot; | kak -p $kak_session).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Why_aren&#x2019;t_there_other_scopes_similar_to_%sh{}_e.g._python_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Why_aren&#x2019;t_there_other_scopes_similar_to_%sh{}_e.g._python_?">Why
  aren&#x2019;t there other scopes similar to %sh{} e.g. python ?</a></h2>
Supporting custom scopes would add hard dependencies to the project, which is
  too much of an drawback when balanced against the low cost of using an
  interpreter in a regular shell scope (e.g. %sh{ python -c &quot;...&quot; }).
  The shell scope allows users to spawn any interpreter they want, for a minimal
  cost in terms of performance, it is therefore the reason why it&#x2019;s the
  only one available by default.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_I_disable_auto-indentation_completely_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_I_disable_auto-indentation_completely_?">Can
  I disable auto-indentation completely ?</a></h2>
All the indentation hooks are conventionally named &lt;lang&gt;-indent, which
  allows us to use the disabled_hooks variable to disable indentation globally
  with the following command: set global disabled_hooks '.+-indent'
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Can_I_disable_syntax_highlighting_completely_?"><a class="selflink" href="#Can_I_disable_syntax_highlighting_completely_?">Can
  I disable syntax highlighting completely ?</a></h2>
Similarly to the indentation hooks, the name format followed by the highlighting
  hooks is &lt;lang&gt;-highlight. You can thus disable syntax highlighting
  using the following command: set global disabled_hooks '.+-highlight'</div>
