<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pnmtotiffcmyk - convert a Netpbm image into a CMYK encoded
TIFF file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pnmtotiffcmyk [-none|-packbits|-lzw] [-predictor n]
[-msb2lsb|-lsb2msb] [-rowsperstrip n] [-lowdotrange n]
[-highdotrange n] [-knor&acirc; <br>
mal|-konly|-kremove] [[-default] [-theta deg] [-gamma n]
[-gammap n] |-negative]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmtotiffcmykreads a PNM image
as input and produces a CMYK encoded TIFF file as output. It
optionally modifies the color balance and black level, and
modifies removal of CMY <br>
from under K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The order of most options is not important, but options for
particular conversion algorithms must appear after the
algorithm is selected (-default,-negative). If you
don&rsquo;t <br>
select an algorithm, pnmtotiffcmyk assumes -default and the
appropriate options (-theta,-gamma,-gammap) can appear
anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-none,-packbits,-lzw,-predictor
<br>
Tiff files can be compressed. By default, pnmtotiffcmyk uses
LZW decompression, but (apparently) some readers cannot read
this, so you may want to select a different algorithm <br>
(-none,-packbits). For LZW compression, a -predictor value
of 2 forces horizontal differencing of scanlines before
encoding; a value of 1 forces no differencing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msb2lsb,-lsb2msb <br>
These options control fill order (default is -msb2lsb).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rowsperstrip <br>
This sets the number of rows in an image strip (data in the
Tiff files generated by this program is stored in strips -
each strip is compressed individually). The default gives
<br>
a strip size of no more than 8 kb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lowdotrange,-highdotrange <br>
These options set tag values that may be useful for
printers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-knormal,-kremove,-konly <br>
These options control the calculation of the CMYK ink
levels. They are useful only for testing and debugging the
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kremove sets the black (K)
levels to zero while leaving the other ink levels as they
would be if the black level were normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-konly sets all inks to the
normal black value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default,-negative <br>
These options control what ink levels pnmtotiffcmyk uses to
represent each input color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-negative selects a simple
algorithm that generates a color negative. None of the
following options apply to this algorithm. The algorithm is
included as an example in the <br>
source code to help implementors of other conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-default is not necessary,
unless you have to countermand a -negative on the same
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default conversion from RGB
to CMYK is as follows: The basic values of the 3 pigments
are C = 1-R, M = 1-G, Y = 1-B. From this, pnmtotiffcmyk
chooses a black (K) level which <br>
is the minimum of those three. It then replaces that much of
the 3 pigments with the black. I.e. it subtracts K from each
of the basic C, M, and Y values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options below modify this
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-theta deg <br>
-theta provides a simple correction for any color bias that
may occur in the printed image because, in practice, inks do
not exactly complement the primary colors. It rotates <br>
the colors (before black replacement) by deg degrees in the
color wheel. Unless you are trying to produce unusual
effects you will need to use small values. Try generating
<br>
three images at -10, 0 (the default) and 10 degrees and see
which has the best color balance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gamma n <br>
-gamma applies a gamma correction to the black (K) value
described above. Specifically, instead of calculating the K
value as min(C,M,Y), pnmtotiffcmyk raises that value
(nor&acirc; <br>
malised to the range 0 to 1) to the nth power. In practice,
this means that a value greater than 1 makes the image
lighter and a value less than 1 makes the image darker. The
<br>
range of allowed values is 0.1 to 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gammap n <br>
This option controls the black replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify -gammap,
pnmtotiffcmyk uses the specified gamma value in computing
how much ink to remove from the 3 pigments, but still uses
the regular gamma value (-gamma <br>
option) to generate the actual amount of black ink with
which to replace it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values of n from 0.01 to 10 are
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, it may be best to
only subtract black from the colored inks in the very
darkest regions. In that case, n should be a large value,
such as 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special case, if n is -1,
pnmtotiffcmyk does not remove any pigment (but still adds
the black ink). This means dark areas are even darker.
Furthermore, when printed, dark <br>
areas contain a lot of ink which can make high contrast
areas, like lettering, appear fuzzy. It&rsquo;s hard to see
what the utility of this is.</p>
