<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xpans: the XPA Name Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xpans [-h] [-e] [-k sec] [-p port] [-l log] [-s security
log] [-P n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h print help message <br>
-e exit when there are no more XPA connections <br>
-k send keepalive messages every n sec <br>
-l log data base entries to specified file <br>
-p listen for connections on specified port <br>
-s log security info for each connection to specified file
<br>
-P accept proxy requests (P=1) using separate thread (P=2)
<br>
--version display version and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xpans name server is an XPA-enabled program that is used
to manage the names and ports of XPA access points. It is
started automatically when an XPA access point is <br>
registered. You can access the name server using xpaget to
get a list of registered access points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xpans name server provides a
crucial link between XPA clients and servers. When an XPA
server defines an access point using XPANew(), XPACmdNew(),
or XPAInfoNew(), the name <br>
of the access point is registered in the name service, along
with connection information. The name server then matches
class:name templates passed to it by XPA clients with <br>
these registered entries, so that the clients can
communicate with the appropriate servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The socket connection between an
XPA-enabled program and xpans is kept open until the former
exits (or explicitly closes the connection). Apparently,
some Internet equipment <br>
(e.g. DSL modems) can cause such a connection to time-out
after a period of inactivity. To prevent this from
happening, you can use the -k [sec] switch to send a short
keep-alive <br>
message to each open connection after the specified time
delay. (Note that this application level use of keep-alive
is necessary only if you are serving XPA-enabled clients
over <br>
the Internet and have to deal with long-term connections
involving DSL or similar equipment. XPA uses the ordinary
socket-level keep-alive, which works for all other cases.)
NB <br>
(12/2/2009): Out-of-band (URG) TCP data, used by xpans
keep-alive, is changed by some Cisco routers into in-band
data. Encountering such a router will break the keep-alive
<br>
function and may break your XPA server as well. Proceed with
caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xpans program will be
started automatically (assuming it can be found in the
user&rsquo;s path) when the first XPA access point is
registered. It therefore need not be started <br>
explicitly. However, when started automatically, the -e
switch is used, so that the name server will exit when there
are no more XPA access points registered. If you wish to
<br>
keep the name server running continually, simply start it
manually without the -e switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name server will keep a log
of registered access points if the -l [log] switch is used
on the command line (this is the case for automatic
start-up). The log contains enough <br>
name and connection information to allow you to re-register
all XPA access points in case the name server process is
terminated prematurely. For example, after the ds9 access
<br>
point is registered,the log will contain the entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add 838e2f67:1863 ds9 ds9 gs
eric</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If xpans is terminated but ds9
still is running, you can re-register both access points for
the ds9 process by running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaset -p 838e2f67:1863
-nsconnect</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that the ip:port
specifier is used with xpaset to bypass the need for
contacting the name server (which does not have the name
registered yet!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name server will keep a log
of security information if the -s [security log] switch is
used on the command line. For each accepted connection,
(including connections via the <br>
xpaget command), information will be logged about the host
issuing the command and the parameters passed into the
program. This is most useful when xpans is accepting
connections <br>
from untrusted machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an XPA access point is
removed by a server using XPAFree(), the access information
is removed from the name server. If an XPA-enabled process
is terminated, all names <br>
registered by that process will be removed automatically.
The log file is always updated to reflect the currently
registered access points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name server itself has an
XPA access point names xpans registered through which you
can find out information about currently registered access
points (assuming you have <br>
access to the name server; see XPA Access Control for more
information). For each registered access point, the
following information is returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class # class of the access
point <br>
name # name of the access point <br>
access # allowed access (g=xpaget,s=xpaset,i=xpainfo) <br>
id # socket access method (host:port for inet, file for
local/unix) <br>
user # user name of access point owner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to display all
currently registered access points, simply execute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpans</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Continuing the example of ds9
above, this will return:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS9 ds9 gs 838e2f67:1863
eric</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the same program has been
started with different XPA access names, you can look up
only names matching a specified template. For example,
assume that ds9 has been started up <br>
using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ds9 &amp; <br>
ds9 -title ds9-1-eric &amp; <br>
ds9 -title ds9-2-eric &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To lookup all ds9 access points
which end in &quot;.eric&quot; and which can be accessed
using xpaset, use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaget xpans
&quot;DS9:*.eric&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will return:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DS9 ds9-2-eric gs 838e29d3:42102
eric <br>
DS9 ds9-1-eric gs 838e29d3:42105 eric</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third argument &quot;*&quot;
requests all access points from all users. You also can
specify a specific user name and only access points
registered by that user will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name server uses the
XPA_METHOD environment variable to determine whether it
should listen for requests on INET or LOCAL sockets. Since
XPA access points also use this <br>
environment variable, the choice of socket method will be
consistent. Note that, when INET sockets are used, a local
server can be accessed from remote machines if the <br>
XPA_NSINET environment variable is set to point to the local
machine. See XPA Environment Variables for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An experimental feature of xpans
is its ability to act as a proxy to XPA servers behind
firewalls that want to communicate with external processes.
The basic idea is the <br>
following: an XPA server (call it &quot;foo&quot;) on host1,
possibly behind a firewall, makes a remote connection to a
proxy-enabled xpans program on host2 (specifying
host2&rsquo;s XPA <br>
method). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xpaset -p foo -remote
&rsquo;host2:28571&rsquo; + -proxy # on host1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this is done, host2 can use
xpaset, xpaget, and xpainfo calls to communicate with the
XPA server foo. All command communication is performed via
the xpans socket connection <br>
between foo on host1 and xpans on host2 (which was initiated
by foo from inside the firewall). Data communication is
similarly performed using a socket connection initiated on
<br>
host1 (usually with a port value two greater than the port
value of the main xpans socket connection). An xpaset or
xpaget call on host2 contacts xpans, which performs an <br>
XPASet() or XPAGet() call to foo, passing commands and data
back and forth between the two programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, proxy connections
are not allowed by xpans. If the -P switch is specified with
a value of 1, proxy connection are allowed, but all proxy
communication is performed in <br>
the same thread as xpans processing. If a value of 2 is
specified, the proxy processing is performed in a separate
thread (assuming pthreads are supported on your system).
<br>
Because xpa callback processing of any type can take a long
time and therefore can interfere with normal xpans
processing, threaded proxy connections (-P 2) are
recommended. <br>
When using proxy connections, it might also be useful to set
the XPA_IOCALLSXPA environment variable, so that multiple
proxy requests can be handled at the same time, instead of
<br>
serially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this proxy interface
to xpans is experimental. It is used to provide remote data
analysis capabilities on the Chandra-Ed system using ds9.

always, please contact us if you have problems or
