The xpans name server is an XPA-enabled program that is used to manage the names
  and ports of XPA access points. It is started automatically when an XPA access
  point is registered. You can access the name server using xpaget to get a list
  of registered access points.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>xpans</i> name server provides a crucial link between XPA clients and
  servers. When an XPA server defines an access point using <i>XPANew()</i>,
  <i>XPACmdNew()</i>, or <i>XPAInfoNew()</i>, the name of the access point is
  registered in the name service, along with connection information. The name
  server then matches class:name templates passed to it by XPA clients with
  these registered entries, so that the clients can communicate with the
  appropriate servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The socket connection between an XPA-enabled program and <i>xpans</i> is kept
  open until the former exits (or explicitly closes the connection). Apparently,
  some Internet equipment (e.g. DSL modems) can cause such a connection to
  time-out after a period of inactivity. To prevent this from happening, you can
  use the -k [sec] switch to send a short keep-alive message to each open
  connection after the specified time delay. (Note that this application level
  use of keep-alive is necessary only if you are serving XPA-enabled clients
  over the Internet and have to deal with long-term connections involving DSL or
  similar equipment. XPA uses the ordinary socket-level keep-alive, which works
  for all other cases.) NB (12/2/2009): Out-of-band (URG) TCP data, used by
  xpans keep-alive, is changed by some Cisco routers into in-band data.
  Encountering such a router will break the keep-alive function and may break
  your XPA server as well. Proceed with caution!
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>xpans</i> program will be started automatically (assuming it can be found
  in the user's path) when the first XPA access point is registered. It
  therefore need not be started explicitly. However, when started automatically,
  the <i>-e</i> switch is used, so that the name server will exit when there are
  no more XPA access points registered. If you wish to keep the name server
  running continually, simply start it manually without the <i>-e</i> switch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name server will keep a log of registered access points if the <i>-l
  [log]</i> switch is used on the command line (this is the case for automatic
  start-up). The log contains enough name and connection information to allow
  you to re-register all XPA access points in case the name server process is
  terminated prematurely. For example, after the ds9 access point is
  registered,the log will contain the entry:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  add 838e2f67:1863 ds9 ds9 gs eric
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <i>xpans</i> is terminated but ds9 still is running, you can re-register both
  access points for the ds9 process by running:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaset -p 838e2f67:1863 -nsconnect
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice that the ip:port specifier is used with <i>xpaset</i> to bypass the need
  for contacting the name server (which does not have the name registered yet!)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name server will keep a log of security information if the -s [security log]
  switch is used on the command line. For each accepted connection, (including
  connections via the <i>xpaget</i> command), information will be logged about
  the host issuing the command and the parameters passed into the program. This
  is most useful when <i>xpans</i> is accepting connections from untrusted
  machines.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When an XPA access point is removed by a server using
  <i></i><i>XPAFree()</i><i></i>, the access information is removed from the
  name server. If an XPA-enabled process is terminated, all names registered by
  that process will be removed automatically. The log file is always updated to
  reflect the currently registered access points.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name server itself has an XPA access point names <i>xpans</i> registered
  through which you can find out information about currently registered access
  points (assuming you have access to the name server; see XPA Access Control
  for more information). For each registered access point, the following
  information is returned:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  class         # class of the access point
  name          # name of the access point
  access        # allowed access (g=xpaget,s=xpaset,i=xpainfo)
  id            # socket access method (host:port for inet, file for local/unix)
  user          # user name of access point owner
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, to display all currently registered access points, simply execute:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpans
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Continuing the example of ds9 above, this will return:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  DS9 ds9 gs 838e2f67:1863 eric
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the same program has been started with different XPA access names, you can
  look up only names matching a specified template. For example, assume that ds9
  has been started up using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  ds9 &amp;
  ds9 -title ds9-1-eric &amp;
  ds9 -title ds9-2-eric &amp;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To lookup all ds9 access points which end in &quot;.eric&quot; and which can be
  accessed using <i>xpaset</i>, use:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaget xpans &quot;DS9:*.eric&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;*&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will return:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  DS9 ds9-2-eric gs 838e29d3:42102 eric
  DS9 ds9-1-eric gs 838e29d3:42105 eric
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The third argument &quot;*&quot; requests all access points from all users. You
  also can specify a specific user name and only access points registered by
  that user will be returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name server uses the <i>XPA_METHOD</i> environment variable to determine
  whether it should listen for requests on INET or LOCAL sockets. Since XPA
  access points also use this environment variable, the choice of socket method
  will be consistent. Note that, when INET sockets are used, a local server can
  be accessed from remote machines if the <i>XPA_NSINET</i> environment variable
  is set to point to the local machine. See XPA Environment Variables for more
  information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An experimental feature of xpans is its ability to act as a proxy to XPA servers
  behind firewalls that want to communicate with external processes. The basic
  idea is the following: an XPA server (call it &quot;foo&quot;) on host1,
  possibly behind a firewall, makes a remote connection to a proxy-enabled xpans
  program on host2 (specifying host2's XPA method). For example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  xpaset -p foo -remote 'host2:28571' + -proxy   # on host1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this is done, host2 can use xpaset, xpaget, and xpainfo calls to
  communicate with the XPA server foo. All command communication is performed
  via the xpans socket connection between foo on host1 and xpans on host2 (which
  was initiated by foo from inside the firewall). Data communication is
  similarly performed using a socket connection initiated on host1 (usually with
  a port value two greater than the port value of the main xpans socket
  connection). An xpaset or xpaget call on host2 contacts xpans, which performs
  an <i>XPASet()</i> or <i>XPAGet()</i> call to foo, passing commands and data
  back and forth between the two programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, proxy connections are not allowed by xpans. If the -P switch is
  specified with a value of 1, proxy connection are allowed, but all proxy
  communication is performed in the same thread as xpans processing. If a value
  of 2 is specified, the proxy processing is performed in a separate thread
  (assuming pthreads are supported on your system). Because xpa callback
  processing of any type can take a long time and therefore can interfere with
  normal xpans processing, threaded proxy connections (-P 2) are recommended.
  When using proxy connections, it might also be useful to set the
  XPA_IOCALLSXPA environment variable, so that multiple proxy requests can be
  handled at the same time, instead of serially.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this proxy interface to xpans is experimental. It is used to provide
  remote data analysis capabilities on the Chandra-Ed system using ds9. (See
  http://chandra-ed.cfa.harvard.edu and http://hea-www.harvard.edu/saord/ds9 for
  more details). As always, please contact us if you have problems or questions.
