When <b>btparse</b> parses a BibTeX entry, it initially stores the results in an
  abstract syntax tree (AST), in a form exactly mirroring the parsed data. For
  example, the entry
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   @Article{Jones:1997a,
     AuThOr = &quot;Bob   Jones&quot; # and # &quot;Jim Smith &quot;,
     TITLE = &quot;Feeding Habits of
              the Common Cockroach&quot;,
     JoUrNaL = j_ent,
     YEAR = 1997
   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would parse to an AST that could be represented as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   (entry,&quot;Article&quot;)
     (key,&quot;Jones:1997a&quot;)
     (field,&quot;AuThOr&quot;)
       (string,&quot;Bob   Jones&quot;)
       (macro,&quot;and&quot;)
       (string,&quot;Jim Smith &quot;)
     (field,&quot;TITLE&quot;)
       (string,&quot;Feeding Habits of               the Common Cockroach&quot;)
     (field,&quot;JoUrNaL&quot;)
       (macro,&quot;j_ent&quot;)
     (field,&quot;YEAR&quot;)
       (number,&quot;1997&quot;)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The advantage of this form is that all the important information in the entry is
  readily available by traversing the tree using the functions described in
  bt_traversal. This obvious problem is that the data is a little too raw to be
  immediately useful: entry types and field names are inconsistently
  capitalized, strings are full of unwanted whitespace, field values not reduced
  to single strings, and so forth.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of these problems are addressed by <b>btparse</b>'s post-processing
  functions, described here. Normally, you won't have to call these
  functions---the library does the Right Thing for you after parsing each entry,
  and you can customize what exactly the Right Thing is for your application.
  (For instance, you can tell it to expand macros, but not to concatenate
  substrings together.) However, it's conceivable that you might wish to move
  the post-processing into your own code and out of the library's control. More
  likely, you could have strings that come from something other than BibTeX
  files that you would like to have treated as BibTeX strings; for that
  situation, the post-processing functions are essential. Finally, you might
  just be curious about what exactly happens to your data after it's parsed. If
  so, you've come to the right place for excruciatingly detailed explanations.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<b>btparse</b> offers four points of entry to its post-processing code. Of
  these, probably only the first and last---for processing individual strings
  and whole entries---will be commonly used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Post-processing_entry_points"><a class="selflink" href="#Post-processing_entry_points">Post-processing
  entry points</a></h2>
To understand why four entry points are offered, an explanation of the sample
  AST shown above will help. First of all, the whole entry is represented by the
  &quot;(entry,&quot;Article&quot;)&quot; node; this node has the entry key and
  all its field/value pairs as children. Entry nodes are returned by
  &quot;bt_parse_entry()&quot; and &quot;bt_parse_entry_s()&quot; (see bt_input)
  as well as &quot;bt_next_entry()&quot; (which traverses a list of entries
  returned from &quot;bt_parse_file()&quot;---see bt_traversal). Whole entries
  may be post-processed with &quot;bt_postprocess_entry()&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may also need to post-process a single field, or just the value associated
  with it. (The difference is that processing the field can change the field
  name---e.g. to lowercase---in addition to the field value.) The
  &quot;(field,&quot;AuThOr&quot;)&quot; node above is an example of a field
  sub-AST, and &quot;(string,&quot;Bob Jones&quot;)&quot; is the first node in
  the list of simple values representing that field's value. (Recall that a
  field value is, in general, a list of simple values.) Field nodes are returned
  by &quot;bt_next_field()&quot;, value nodes by &quot;bt_next_value()&quot;.
  The former may be passed to &quot;bt_postprocess_field()&quot; for
  post-processing, the latter to &quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, individual strings may wander into your program from many places other
  than a <b>btparse</b> AST. For that reason,
  &quot;bt_postprocess_string()&quot; is available for post-processing arbitrary
  strings.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Post-processing_options"><a class="selflink" href="#Post-processing_options">Post-processing
  options</a></h2>
All of the post-processing routines have an &quot;options&quot; parameter, which
  you can use to fine-tune the post-processing. (This is just like the
  per-metatype string-processing options that you can set before parsing
  entries; see &quot;bt_set_stringopts()&quot; in bt_input.) Like elsewhere in
  the library, &quot;options&quot; is a bitmap constructed by or'ing together
  various predefined constants. These constants and their effects are documented
  in &quot;String processing option macros&quot; in btparse.

    <pre>
   void bt_postprocess_string (char * s,
                               btshort options)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Post-processes an individual string, &quot;s&quot;, which is modified in
      place. The only post-processing option that makes sense on individual
      strings is whether to collapse whitespace according to the BibTeX rules;
      thus, if &quot;options &amp; BTO_COLLAPSE&quot; is false, this function
      has no effect. (Although it makes a complete pass over the string anyways.
      This is for future expansion.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The exact rules for collapsing whitespace are simple: non-space whitespace
      characters (tabs and newlines mainly) are converted to space, any strings
      of more than one space within are collapsed to a single space, and any
      leading or trailing spaces are deleted. (Ensuring that all whitespace is
      spaces is actually done by <b>btparse</b>'s lexical scanner, so strings in
      <b>btparse</b> ASTs will never have whitespace apart from space. Likewise,
      any strings passed to <i>bt_postprocess_string()</i> should not contain
      non-space whitespace characters.)</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
   char * bt_postprocess_value (AST *   value,
                                btshort  options, 
                                boolean replace);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Post-processes a single field value, which is the head of a list of simple
      values as returned by &quot;bt_next_value()&quot;. All of the relevant
      string-processing options come into play here: conversion of numbers to
      strings (&quot;BTO_CONVERT&quot;), macro expansion
      (&quot;BTO_EXPAND&quot;), collapsing of whitespace
      (&quot;BTO_COLLAPSE&quot;), and string pasting (&quot;BTO_PASTE&quot;).
      Since pasting substrings together without first expanding macros and
      converting numbers would be nonsensical, attempting to do so is a fatal
      error.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If &quot;replace&quot; is true, then the list headed by &quot;value&quot;
      will be replaced by a list representing the processed value. That is, if
      string pasting is turned on (&quot;options &amp; BTO_PASTE&quot; is true),
      then this list will be collapsed to a single node containing the single
      string that results from pasting together all the substrings. If string
      pasting is not on, then each node in the list will be left intact, but
      will have its text replaced by processed text.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If &quot;replace&quot; is false, then a new string will be built on the fly
      and returned by the function. Note that if pasting is not on in this case,
      you will only get the last string in the list. (It doesn't really make a
      lot of sense to post-process a value without pasting unless you're
      replacing it with the new value, though.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Returns the string that resulted from processing the whole value, which only
      makes sense if pasting was on or there was only one value in the list. If
      a multiple-value list was processed without pasting, the last string in
      the list is returned (after processing).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Consider what might be done to the value of the &quot;author&quot; field in
      the above example, which is the concatenation of a string, a macro, and
      another string. Assume that the macro &quot;and&quot; expands to &quot;
      and &quot;, and that the variable &quot;value&quot; points to the sub-AST
      for this value. The original sub-AST corresponding to this value is
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   (string,&quot;Bob   Jones&quot;)
   (macro,&quot;and&quot;)
   (string,&quot;Jim Smith &quot;)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    To fully process this value in-place, you would call
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   bt_postprocess_value (value, BTO_FULL, TRUE);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (&quot;BTO_FULL&quot; is just the combination of all possible
      string-processing options:
      &quot;BTO_CONVERT|BTO_EXPAND|BTO_PASTE|BTO_COLLAPSE&quot;.) This would
      convert the value to a single-element list,
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   (string,&quot;Bob Jones and Jim Smith&quot;)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    and return the fully-processed string &quot;Bob Jones and Jim Smith&quot;.
      Note that the &quot;and&quot; macro has been expanded, interpolated
      between the two literal strings, everything pasted together, and finally
      whitespace collapsed. (Collapsing whitespace before concatenating the
      strings would be a bad idea.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Let's say you'd rather preserve the list nature of the value, while
      expanding macros and converting any numbers to strings. (This conversion
      is trivial: it just changes the type of the node from
      &quot;BTAST_NUMBER&quot; to &quot;BTAST_STRING&quot;. &quot;Number&quot;
      values are always stored as a string of digits, just as they appear in the
      file.) This would be done with the call
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   bt_postprocess_value
      (value, BTO_CONVERT|BTO_EXPAND|BTO_COLLAPSE,TRUE);
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which would change the list to
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
   (string,&quot;Bob Jones&quot;)
   (string,&quot;and&quot;)
   (string,&quot;Jim Smith&quot;)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that whitespace is collapsed here <i>before</i> any concatenation can
      be done; this is probably a bad idea. But you can do it if you wish. (If
      you get any ideas about cooking up your own value post-processing scheme
      by doing it in little steps like this, take a look at the source to
      &quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;; it should dissuade you from such a
      venture.)</dd>

    This is little more than a front-end to &quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;;
      the only difference is that you pass it a &quot;field&quot; AST node (eg.
      the &quot;(field,&quot;AuThOr&quot;)&quot; in the above example), and that
      it transforms the field name in addition to its value. In particular, the
      field name is forced to lowercase; this behaviour is (currently) not
      optional.

    Post-processes all values in an entry. If &quot;entry&quot; points to the

      the values are just what you'd expect: everything on the right-hand side
      of a field or macro &quot;assignment.&quot; You can also post-process
      comment and preamble entries, though. Comment entries are essentially one
      big string, so only whitespace collapsing makes sense on them. Preambles
      may have multiple strings pasted together, so all the string-processing
      options apply to them. (And there's nothing to prevent you from using
      macros in a preamble.)</dd>
