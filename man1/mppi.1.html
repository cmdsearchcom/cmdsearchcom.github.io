<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppinfo option [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppi option [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp remembers detailed
information about the files it scanned and/or built. For the
built files it remembers everything that was relevant, which
includes their dependencies. <br>
This information is stored in the .makepp subdirectory along
the file it pertains to. It has the form of key-value pairs.
In some cases the value will again be a list of <br>
associated pairs, typically the signature and the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both &quot;ENV_DEPS&quot; and
&quot;ENV_VALS&quot; get displayed, they are merged into a
two column table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both &quot;DEP_SIGS&quot; and
&quot;SORTED_DEPS&quot; get displayed, they are merged into
a two column table (in this order which gives a better
layout). Each dependency has a &quot;SIGNATURE&quot; which
<br>
is only &quot;timestamp,size&quot;, used only to check if
the file must be rescanned. For dangling symlinks, instead
of the linkee&rsquo;s signature, the link&rsquo;s own
signature is determined in <br>
this way, and a 0 prepended to mark this special case. The
interesting information is stored in some other key, for the
built in signatures as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;C_MD5_SUM&quot; for &quot;C&quot; or
&quot;c_compilation_md5&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;MD5_SUM&quot; for &quot;md5&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;SHARED_OBJECT&quot; for &quot;shared_object&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;V_MD5_SUM&quot; for
&quot;verilog_synthesis_md5&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;XML_MD5_SUM&quot; for &quot;xml&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;XML_SPACE_MD5_SUM&quot; for &quot;xml_space&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These signature lists are the
most frequent reason for rebuilding a file, so you might
like to check, whether the signature stored for a dependency
matches the current <br>
&quot;BUILD_SIGNATURE&quot; of that file. If the signatures
and everything else matches, that is the basis for getting a
file from (one of) your repositories or build cache if it is
found <br>
there. The details depend on the applicable build check
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will encounter two kinds of
signatures: simple ones consist of two comma separated
numbers, which are the timestamp in file system format
(seconds since 1970) and the size. <br>
For some files makepp will additionally have the relevant
smart signature which is a base64 encoded (letters, digits,
slash and plus) MD5 sum of the plain or digested file <br>
contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is partially a
makepp debug tool. The list of keys varies depending on
which scanner, build check and signature was used. To fully
understand the output, you may <br>
need to look at the source code. That said, there is also
some generally interesting information to be gotten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A filename <br>
--args-file=filename <br>
--arguments-file=filename <br>
Read the file and parse it as possibly quoted whitespace-
and/or newline-separated options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
--dates <br>
--decode-dates <br>
In the simple signatures prepend the 1st number, the raw
date-time, with its human readable form in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f <br>
--force <br>
Display info even when it is invalid because of inexistent
or modified file. In this case the key &quot;SIGNATURE&quot;
is replaced by &quot;invalidated_SIGNATURE&quot; and the
value indicates <br>
in parentheses that the file was deleted or what signature
the file now has.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? <br>
-h <br>
--help <br>
Print out a brief summary of the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k list <br>
--keys=list <br>
--keylist=list <br>
The list specifies one or more space separated Shell style
patterns (with [xyz], ?, *, {a,bc,def}). Remember to protect
these from your Shell by quoting. These are matched <br>
against the keys. Each pattern may be preceded with an
exclamation mark (&quot;!&quot;) or a caret (&quot;^&quot;)
to exclude the matched keys from those selected before
instead of adding them <br>
to the selection. If the first pattern starts with an
exclamation mark, it operates on all keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keys=&rsquo;COMMAND CWD&rsquo;
# How was this built and where (relative to file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want only filenames
(useful with &quot;-t|--traverse&quot;) select an inexistent
key like &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
--quiet <br>
Don&rsquo;t list file and key names. Repeat to also omit
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
--traverse <br>
Also output the same information for each file in
SORTED_DEPS (recursively if repeated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u <br>
--unremembered <br>
Traverse dependencies of the given files, but instead of
showing their info, from all the involved directories list
only those files not remembered for these targets. The <br>
idea here is to help you spot no longer needed files.
Somewhat surprisingly this will include the Makefiles from
those directories, because these are mostly not a <br>
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Giving this option twice will
also go to far away directories which are not output
relatively, like /usr/include.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Print out the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
General <br>
Each build check method documents how to see what they base
their decision on. Finding the paths of the dependencies is
the same in all cases, so it is shown here. If you build
<br>
to a different directory, finding the path of the inputs
requires a translation relative to CWD. E.g. either short or
long form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppinfo --keys=&rsquo;CWD
SORTED_DEPS&rsquo; obj/b.o <br>
mppi -k&rsquo;CWD SORTED_DEPS&rsquo; obj/b.o <br>
obj/b.o: <br>
CWD=../src <br>
SORTED_DEPS= <br>
b.c <br>
inc/b.h <br>
/usr/bin/gcc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CWD is the directory relative to
file, from where it was built. That directory is the one
from where all relative paths in SORTED_DEPS start. This
means that under the same <br>
directory we have inputs src/b.c and src/inc/b.h and an
output obj/b.o. From the viewpoint of b.o, the inputs are
../src/b.c and ../src/inc/b.h. It does not matter that we
gave <br>
a relative path for b.o, the information shown would be the
same, had we first changed to obj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for a rebuild <br>
In some cases makepp may be repeatedly rebuilding a
seemingly up to date file. If &quot;makepplog&quot; does not
help here, this command gives you the exact state of
affairs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppinfo --traverse somefile
<br>
mppi -t somefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this reproducibly happens,
issue this command before and after, and compare the
outputs. The things that differ are the reason of the
rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Proving Consistency <br>
Sometimes you will change your Makefiles and wonder if they
still do the same thing. Here&rsquo;s a command that tells
you exactly how makepp built somefile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppinfo --traverse --traverse
--keys=&rsquo;CWD COMMAND&rsquo; somefile <br>
mppi -ttk&rsquo;CWD SORTED_DEPS&rsquo; somefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will recursively traverse
over all dependencies of somefile and tell you in which
directory it issued which command. By running this after the
old and after the new build <br>
and comparing the outputs, you can see what changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The same works for testing a new
version of makepp, though some older versions would handle
whitespace in command continuation lines differently, and
there was a bug in sort <br>
order, which can make the files come out in a different
order. If this is the case for you, let the Shell assemble
the sorted arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppinfo --keys=&rsquo;CWD
COMMAND&rsquo; &lsquo;makeppinfo --traverse --traverse
--keys=none somefile|tr -d :|sort&lsquo; <br>
mppi -k&rsquo;CWD SORTED_DEPS&rsquo; &lsquo;mppi -ttknone
somefile|tr -d :|sort&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Makeppinfo looks at the following environment variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MAKEPPINFOFLAGS <br>
Any flags in this environment variable are interpreted as
command line options before any explicit options. Quotes are
interpreted like in makefiles.</p>
