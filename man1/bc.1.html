<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [ file ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers
with interactive execution of statements. There are some
similarities in the syntax to the C programming language. A
<br>
standard math library is available by command line option.
If requested, the math library is defined before processing
any files. bc starts by processing code from all the <br>
files listed on the command line in the order listed. After
all files have been processed, bc reads from the standard
input. All code is executed as it is read. (If a file <br>
contains a command to halt the processor, bc will never read
from the standard input.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version of bc contains
several extensions beyond traditional bc implementations and
the POSIX draft standard. Command line options can cause
these extensions to print a <br>
warning or to be rejected. This document describes the
language accepted by this processor. Extensions will be
identified as such.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Print the usage and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive <br>
Force interactive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --mathlib <br>
Define the standard math library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --warn <br>
Give warnings for extensions to POSIX bc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --standard <br>
Process exactly the POSIX bc language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Do not print the normal GNU bc welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Print the version number and copyright and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUMBERS <br>
The most basic element in bc is the number. Numbers are
arbitrary precision numbers. This precision is both in the
integer part and the fractional part. All numbers are
repre&acirc; <br>
sented internally in decimal and all computation is done in
decimal. (This version truncates results from divide and
multiply operations.) There are two attributes of numbers,
<br>
the length and the scale. The length is the total number of
significant decimal digits in a number and the scale is the
total number of decimal digits after the decimal point. <br>
For example: <br>
.000001 has a length of 6 and scale of 6. <br>
1935.000 has a length of 7 and a scale of 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES <br>
Numbers are stored in two types of variables, simple
variables and arrays. Both simple variables and array
variables are named. Names begin with a letter followed by
any number <br>
of letters, digits and underscores. All letters must be
lower case. (Full alpha-numeric names are an extension. In
POSIX bc all names are a single lower case letter.) The type
<br>
of variable is clear by the context because all array
variable names will be followed by brackets ([]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four special
variables, scale, ibase, obase, and last. scale defines how
some operations use digits after the decimal point. The
default value of scale is 0. ibase <br>
and obase define the conversion base for input and output
numbers. The default for both input and output is base 10.
last (an extension) is a variable that has the value of the
<br>
last printed number. These will be discussed in further
detail where appropriate. All of these variables may have
values assigned to them as well as used in expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMENTS <br>
Comments in bc start with the characters /* and end with the
characters */. Comments may start anywhere and appear as a
single space in the input. (This causes comments to <br>
delimit other input items. For example, a comment can not be
found in the middle of a variable name.) Comments include
any newlines (end of line) between the start and the end
<br>
of the comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To support the use of scripts
for bc, a single line comment has been added as an
extension. A single line comment starts at a # character and
continues to the next end of the <br>
line. The end of line character is not part of the comment
and is processed normally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXPRESSIONS <br>
The numbers are manipulated by expressions and statements.
Since the language was designed to be interactive,
statements and expressions are executed as soon as possible.
There <br>
is no &quot;main&quot; program. Instead, code is executed as
it is encountered. (Functions, discussed in detail later,
are defined when encountered.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple expression is just a
constant. bc converts constants into internal decimal
numbers using the current input base, specified by the
variable ibase. (There is an exception <br>
in functions.) The legal values of ibase are 2 through 16.
Assigning a value outside this range to ibase will result in
a value of 2 or 16. Input numbers may contain the
char&acirc; <br>
acters 0-9 and A-F. (Note: They must be capitals. Lower case
letters are variable names.) Single digit numbers always
have the value of the digit regardless of the value of <br>
ibase. (i.e. A = 10.) For multi-digit numbers, bc changes
all input digits greater or equal to ibase to the value of
ibase-1. This makes the number FFF always be the largest 3
<br>
digit number of the input base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full expressions are similar to
many other high level languages. Since there is only one
kind of number, there are no rules for mixing types.
Instead, there are rules on the <br>
scale of expressions. Every expression has a scale. This is
derived from the scale of original numbers, the operation
performed and in many cases, the value of the variable <br>
scale. Legal values of the variable scale are 0 to the
maximum number representable by a C integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following descriptions of
legal expressions, &quot;expr&quot; refers to a complete
expression and &quot;var&quot; refers to a simple or an
array variable. A simple variable is just a <br>
name <br>
and an array variable is specified as <br>
name[expr] <br>
Unless specifically mentioned the scale of the result is the
maximum scale of the expressions involved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- expr The result is the
negation of the expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">++ var The variable is
incremented by one and the new value is the result of the
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- var The variable is
decremented by one and the new value is the result of the
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">var ++ <br>
The result of the expression is the value of the variable
and then the variable is incremented by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">var -- The result of the
expression is the value of the variable and then the
variable is decremented by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr + expr <br>
The result of the expression is the sum of the two
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr - expr <br>
The result of the expression is the difference of the two
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr * expr <br>
The result of the expression is the product of the two
expressions. If a and b are the scales of the two
expressions, then the scale of the result is: <br>
min(a+b,max(scale,a,b))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr / expr <br>
The result of the expression is the quotient of the two
expressions. The scale of the result is the value of the
variable scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr % expr <br>
The result of the expression is the &quot;remainder&quot;
and it is computed in the following way. To compute a%b,
first a/b is computed to scale digits. That result is used
to <br>
compute a-(a/b)*b to the scale of the maximum of
scale+scale(b) and scale(a). If scale is set to zero and
both expressions are integers this expression is the integer
<br>
remainder function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr ^ expr <br>
The result of the expression is the value of the first
raised to the second. The second expression must be an
integer. (If the second expression is not an integer, a <br>
warning is generated and the expression is truncated to get
an integer value.) The scale of the result is scale if the
exponent is negative. If the exponent is positive <br>
the scale of the result is the minimum of the scale of the
first expression times the value of the exponent and the
maximum of scale and the scale of the first expression. <br>
(e.g. scale(a^b) = min(scale(a)*b, max( scale, scale(a))).)
It should be noted that expr^0 will always return the value
of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( expr ) <br>
This alters the standard precedence to force the evaluation
of the expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">var = expr <br>
The variable is assigned the value of the expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">var &lt;op&gt;= expr <br>
This is equivalent to &quot;var = var &lt;op&gt; expr&quot;
with the exception that the &quot;var&quot; part is
evaluated only once. This can make a difference if
&quot;var&quot; is an array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relational expressions are a
special kind of expression that always evaluate to 0 or 1, 0
if the relation is false and 1 if the relation is true.
These may appear in any legal <br>
expression. (POSIX bc requires that relational expressions
are used only in if, while, and for statements and that only
one relational test may be done in them.) The relational
<br>
operators are</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 &lt; expr2 <br>
The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly less than expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 &lt;= expr2 <br>
The result is 1 if expr1 is less than or equal to expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 &gt; expr2 <br>
The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly greater than expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 &gt;= expr2 <br>
The result is 1 if expr1 is greater than or equal to
expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 == expr2 <br>
The result is 1 if expr1 is equal to expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 != expr2 <br>
The result is 1 if expr1 is not equal to expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Boolean operations are also
legal. (POSIX bc does NOT have boolean operations). The
result of all boolean operations are 0 and 1 (for false and
true) as in relational expres&acirc; <br>
sions. The boolean operators are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!expr The result is 1 if expr is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr &amp;&amp; expr <br>
The result is 1 if both expressions are non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr || expr <br>
The result is 1 if either expression is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expression precedence is as
follows: (lowest to highest) <br>
|| operator, left associative <br>
&amp;&amp; operator, left associative <br>
! operator, nonassociative <br>
Relational operators, left associative <br>
Assignment operator, right associative <br>
+ and - operators, left associative <br>
*, / and % operators, left associative <br>
^ operator, right associative <br>
unary - operator, nonassociative <br>
++ and -- operators, nonassociative</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This precedence was chosen so
that POSIX compliant bc programs will run correctly. This
will cause the use of the relational and logical operators
to have some unusual behavior <br>
when used with assignment expressions. Consider the
expression: <br>
a = 3 &lt; 5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most C programmers would assume
this would assign the result of &quot;3 &lt; 5&quot; (the
value 1) to the variable &quot;a&quot;. What this does in bc
is assign the value 3 to the variable &quot;a&quot; and <br>
then compare 3 to 5. It is best to use parenthesis when
using relational and logical operators with the assignment
operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a few more special
expressions that are provided in bc. These have to do with
user defined functions and standard functions. They all
appear as &quot;name(parameters)&quot;. <br>
See the section on functions for user defined functions. The
standard functions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">length ( expression ) <br>
The value of the length function is the number of
significant digits in the expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read ( ) <br>
The read function (an extension) will read a number from the
standard input, regardless of where the function occurs.
Beware, this can cause problems with the mixing of <br>
data and program in the standard input. The best use for
this function is in a previously written program that needs
input from the user, but never allows program code to <br>
be input from the user. The value of the read function is
the number read from the standard input using the current
value of the variable ibase for the conversion base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scale ( expression ) <br>
The value of the scale function is the number of digits
after the decimal point in the expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sqrt ( expression ) <br>
The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the
expression. If the expression is negative, a run time error
is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATEMENTS <br>
Statements (as in most algebraic languages) provide the
sequencing of expression evaluation. In bc statements are
executed &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Execution happens
when a new&acirc; <br>
line in encountered and there is one or more complete
statements. Due to this immediate execution, newlines are
very important in bc. In fact, both a semicolon and a
newline are <br>
used as statement separators. An improperly placed newline
will cause a syntax error. Because newlines are statement
separators, it is possible to hide a newline by using the
<br>
backslash character. The sequence &quot;&lt;nl&gt;&quot;,
where &lt;nl&gt; is the newline appears to bc as whitespace
instead of a newline. A statement list is a series of
statements separated by <br>
semicolons and newlines. The following is a list of bc
statements and what they do: (Things enclosed in brackets
([]) are optional parts of the statement.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expression <br>
This statement does one of two things. If the expression
starts with &quot;&lt;variable&gt; &lt;assignment&gt;
...&quot;, it is considered to be an assignment statement.
If the expression is <br>
not an assignment statement, the expression is evaluated and
printed to the output. After the number is printed, a
newline is printed. For example, &quot;a=1&quot; is an
assign&acirc; <br>
ment statement and &quot;(a=1)&quot; is an expression that
has an embedded assignment. All numbers that are printed are
printed in the base specified by the variable obase. The
<br>
legal values for obase are 2 through BC_BASE_MAX. (See the
section LIMITS.) For bases 2 through 16, the usual method of
writing numbers is used. For bases greater than <br>
16, bc uses a multi-character digit method of printing the
numbers where each higher base digit is printed as a base 10
number. The multi-character digits are separated <br>
by spaces. Each digit contains the number of characters
required to represent the base ten value of
&quot;obase-1&quot;. Since numbers are of arbitrary
precision, some numbers may <br>
not be printable on a single output line. These long numbers
will be split across lines using the &quot; <br>
printed per line is 70. Due to the interactive nature of bc,
printing a number causes the side effect of assigning the
printed value to the special variable last. This <br>
allows the user to recover the last value printed without
having to retype the expression that printed the number.
Assigning to last is legal and will overwrite the last <br>
printed value with the assigned value. The newly assigned
value will remain until the next number is printed or
another value is assigned to last. (Some installations <br>
may allow the use of a single period (.) which is not part
of a number as a short hand notation for for last.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">string The string is printed to
the output. Strings start with a double quote character and
contain all characters until the next double quote
character. All characters are <br>
take literally, including any newline. No newline character
is printed after the string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print list <br>
The print statement (an extension) provides another method
of output. The &quot;list&quot; is a list of strings and
expressions separated by commas. Each string or expression
is <br>
printed in the order of the list. No terminating newline is
printed. Expressions are evaluated and their value is
printed and assigned to the variable last. Strings in <br>
the print statement are printed to the output and may
contain special characters. Special characters start with
the backslash character (. The special characters rec&acirc;
<br>
ognized by bc are &quot;a&quot; (alert or bell),
&quot;b&quot; (backspace), &quot;f&quot; (form feed),
&quot;n&quot; (newline), &quot;r&quot; (carriage return),
&quot;q&quot; (double quote), &quot;t&quot; (tab), and
&quot; <br>
other character following the backslash will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ statement_list } <br>
This is the compound statement. It allows multiple
statements to be grouped together for execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ( expression ) statement1
[else statement2] <br>
The if statement evaluates the expression and executes
statement1 or statement2 depending on the value of the
expression. If the expression is non-zero, statement1 is
<br>
executed. If statement2 is present and the value of the
expression is 0, then statement2 is executed. (The else
clause is an extension.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while ( expression ) statement
<br>
The while statement will execute the statement while the
expression is non-zero. It evaluates the expression before
each execution of the statement. Termination of the <br>
loop is caused by a zero expression value or the execution
of a break statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for ( [expression1] ;
[expression2] ; [expression3] ) statement <br>
The for statement controls repeated execution of the
statement. Expression1 is evaluated before the loop.
Expression2 is evaluated before each execution of the
state&acirc; <br>
ment. If it is non-zero, the statement is evaluated. If it
is zero, the loop is terminated. After each execution of the
statement, expression3 is evaluated before the <br>
reevaluation of expression2. If expression1 or expression3
are missing, nothing is evaluated at the point they would be
evaluated. If expression2 is missing, it is the <br>
same as substituting the value 1 for expression2. (The
optional expressions are an extension. POSIX bc requires all
three expressions.) The following is equivalent code <br>
for the for statement: <br>
expression1; <br>
while (expression2) { <br>
statement; <br>
expression3; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break This statement causes a
forced exit of the most recent enclosing while statement or
for statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue <br>
The continue statement (an extension) causes the most recent
enclosing for statement to start the next iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halt The halt statement (an
extension) is an executed statement that causes the bc
processor to quit only when it is executed. For example,
&quot;if (0 == 1) halt&quot; will not cause <br>
bc to terminate because the halt is not executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return Return the value 0 from a
function. (See the section on functions.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return ( expression ) <br>
Return the value of the expression from a function. (See the
section on functions.) As an extension, the parenthesis are
not required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSEUDO STATEMENTS <br>
These statements are not statements in the traditional
sense. They are not executed statements. Their function is
performed at &quot;compile&quot; time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">limits Print the local limits
enforced by the local version of bc. This is an
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit When the quit statement is
read, the bc processor is terminated, regardless of where
the quit statement is found. For example, &quot;if (0 == 1)
quit&quot; will cause bc to termi&acirc; <br>
nate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warranty <br>
Print a longer warranty notice. This is an extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUNCTIONS <br>
Functions provide a method of defining a computation that
can be executed later. Functions in bc always compute a
value and return it to the caller. Function definitions are
<br>
&quot;dynamic&quot; in the sense that a function is
undefined until a definition is encountered in the input.
That definition is then used until another definition
function for the same <br>
name is encountered. The new definition then replaces the
older definition. A function is defined as follows: <br>
define name ( parameters ) { newline <br>
auto_list statement_list } <br>
A function call is just an expression of the form
&quot;name(parameters)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameters are numbers or arrays
(an extension). In the function definition, zero or more
parameters are defined by listing their names separated by
commas. All parameters are <br>
call by value parameters. Arrays are specified in the
parameter definition by the notation &quot;name[]&quot;. In
the function call, actual parameters are full expressions
for number <br>
parameters. The same notation is used for passing arrays as
for defining array parameters. The named array is passed by
value to the function. Since function definitions are <br>
dynamic, parameter numbers and types are checked when a
function is called. Any mismatch in number or types of
parameters will cause a runtime error. A runtime error will
also <br>
occur for the call to an undefined function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The auto_list is an optional
list of variables that are for &quot;local&quot; use. The
syntax of the auto list (if present) is &quot;auto name, ...
;&quot;. (The semicolon is optional.) Each name <br>
is the name of an auto variable. Arrays may be specified by
using the same notation as used in parameters. These
variables have their values pushed onto a stack at the start
of <br>
the function. The variables are then initialized to zero and
used throughout the execution of the function. At function
exit, these variables are popped so that the original <br>
value (at the time of the function call) of these variables
are restored. The parameters are really auto variables that
are initialized to a value provided in the function call.
<br>
Auto variables are different than traditional local
variables because if function A calls function B, B may
access function A&rsquo;s auto variables by just using the
same name, unless <br>
function B has called them auto variables. Due to the fact
that auto variables and parameters are pushed onto a stack,
bc supports recursive functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The function body is a list of
bc statements. Again, statements are separated by semicolons
or newlines. Return statements cause the termination of a
function and the return of <br>
a value. There are two versions of the return statement. The
first form, &quot;return&quot;, returns the value 0 to the
calling expression. The second form, &quot;return (
expression )&quot;, <br>
computes the value of the expression and returns that value
to the calling expression. There is an implied &quot;return
(0)&quot; at the end of every function. This allows a
function to <br>
terminate and return 0 without an explicit return
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions also change the usage
of the variable ibase. All constants in the function body
will be converted using the value of ibase at the time of
the function call. Changes <br>
of ibase will be ignored during the execution of the
function except for the standard function read, which will
always use the current value of ibase for conversion of
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Several extensions have been
added to functions. First, the format of the definition has
been slightly relaxed. The standard requires the opening
brace be on the same line as <br>
the define keyword and all other parts must be on following
lines. This version of bc will allow any number of newlines
before and after the opening brace of the function. For <br>
example, the following definitions are legal. <br>
define d (n) { return (2*n); } <br>
define d (n) <br>
{ return (2*n); }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Functions may be defined as
void. A void funtion returns no value and thus may not be
used in any place that needs a value. A void function does
not produce any output when <br>
called by itself on an input line. The key word void is
placed between the key word define and the function name.
For example, consider the following session. <br>
define py (y) { print &quot;---&gt;&quot;, y,
&quot;&lt;---&quot;, &quot;0; } <br>
define void px (x) { print &quot;---&gt;&quot;, x,
&quot;&lt;---&quot;, &quot;0; } <br>
py(1) <br>
---&gt;1&lt;--- <br>
0 <br>
px(1) <br>
---&gt;1&lt;--- <br>
Since py is not a void function, the call of py(1) prints
the desired output and then prints a second line that is the
value of the function. Since the value of a function that
<br>
is not given an explicit return statement is zero, the zero
is printed. For px(1), no zero is printed because the
function is a void function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, call by variable for
arrays was added. To declare a call by variable array, the
declaration of the array parameter in the function
definition looks like &quot;*name[]&quot;. The <br>
call to the function remains the same as call by value
arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MATH LIBRARY <br>
If bc is invoked with the -l option, a math library is
preloaded and the default scale is set to 20. The math
functions will calculate their results to the scale set at
the <br>
time of their call. The math library defines the following
functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s (x) The sine of x, x is in
radians.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c (x) The cosine of x, x is in
radians.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a (x) The arctangent of x,
arctangent returns radians.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">READLINE AND LIBEDIT OPTIONS
<br>
GNU bc can be compiled (via a configure option) to use the
GNU readline input editor library or the BSD libedit
library. This allows the user to do editing of lines before
send&acirc; <br>
ing them to bc. It also allows for a history of previous
lines typed. When this option is selected, bc has one more
special variable. This special variable, history is the <br>
number of lines of history retained. For readline, a value
of -1 means that an unlimited number of history lines are
retained. Setting the value of history to a positive number
<br>
restricts the number of history lines to the number given.
The value of 0 disables the history feature. The default
value is 100. For more information, read the user manuals
<br>
for the GNU readline, history and BSD libedit libraries. One
can not enable both readline and libedit at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES <br>
This version of bc was implemented from the POSIX
P1003.2/D11 draft and contains several differences and
extensions relative to the draft and traditional
implementations. It is <br>
not implemented in the traditional way using dc(1). This
version is a single process which parses and runs a byte
code translation of the program. There is an
&quot;undocumented&quot; <br>
option (-c) that causes the program to output the byte code
to the standard output instead of running it. It was mainly
used for debugging the parser and preparing the math <br>
library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A major source of differences is
extensions, where a feature is extended to add more
functionality and additions, where new features are added.
The following is the list of dif&acirc; <br>
ferences and extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG environment <br>
This version does not conform to the POSIX standard in the
processing of the LANG environment variable and all
environment variables starting with LC_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">names Traditional and POSIX bc
have single letter names for functions, variables and
arrays. They have been extended to be multi-character names
that start with a letter and <br>
may contain letters, numbers and the underscore
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strings <br>
Strings are not allowed to contain NUL characters. POSIX
says all characters must be included in strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">last POSIX bc does not have a
last variable. Some implementations of bc use the period (.)
in a similar way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comparisons <br>
POSIX bc allows comparisons only in the if statement, the
while statement, and the second expression of the for
statement. Also, only one relational operation is allowed
<br>
in each of those statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if statement, else clause <br>
POSIX bc does not have an else clause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for statement <br>
POSIX bc requires all expressions to be present in the for
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;&amp;, ||, ! <br>
POSIX bc does not have the logical operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">read function <br>
POSIX bc does not have a read function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print statement <br>
POSIX bc does not have a print statement .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue statement <br>
POSIX bc does not have a continue statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">return statement <br>
POSIX bc requires parentheses around the return
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array parameters <br>
POSIX bc does not (currently) support array parameters in
full. The POSIX grammar allows for arrays in function
definitions, but does not provide a method to specify an
<br>
array as an actual parameter. (This is most likely an
oversight in the grammar.) Traditional implementations of bc
have only call by value array parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function format <br>
POSIX bc requires the opening brace on the same line as the
define key word and the auto statement on the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=+, =-, =*, =/, =%, =^ <br>
POSIX bc does not require these &quot;old style&quot;
assignment operators to be defined. This version may allow
these &quot;old style&quot; assignments. Use the limits
statement to see if <br>
the installed version supports them. If it does support the
&quot;old style&quot; assignment operators, the statement
&quot;a =- 1&quot; will decrement a by 1 instead of setting
a to the <br>
value -1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">spaces in numbers <br>
Other implementations of bc allow spaces in numbers. For
example, &quot;x=1 3&quot; would assign the value 13 to the
variable x. The same statement would cause a syntax error in
<br>
this version of bc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">errors and execution <br>
This implementation varies from other implementations in
terms of what code will be executed when syntax and other
errors are found in the program. If a syntax error is <br>
found in a function definition, error recovery tries to find
the beginning of a statement and continue to parse the
function. Once a syntax error is found in the func&acirc;
<br>
tion, the function will not be callable and becomes
undefined. Syntax errors in the interactive execution code
will invalidate the current execution block. The execution
<br>
block is terminated by an end of line that appears after a
complete sequence of statements. For example, <br>
a = 1 <br>
b = 2 <br>
has two execution blocks and <br>
{ a = 1 <br>
b = 2 } <br>
has one execution block. Any runtime error will terminate
the execution of the current execution block. A runtime
warning will not terminate the current execution block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interrupts <br>
During an interactive session, the SIGINT signal (usually
generated by the control-C character from the terminal) will
cause execution of the current execution block to be <br>
interrupted. It will display a &quot;runtime&quot; error
indicating which function was interrupted. After all runtime
structures have been cleaned up, a message will be printed
to <br>
notify the user that bc is ready for more input. All
previously defined functions remain defined and the value of
all non-auto variables are the value at the point of <br>
interruption. All auto variables and function parameters are
removed during the clean up process. During a
non-interactive session, the SIGINT signal will terminate
the <br>
entire run of bc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITS <br>
The following are the limits currently in place for this bc
processor. Some of them may have been changed by an
installation. Use the limits statement to see the actual
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BC_BASE_MAX <br>
The maximum output base is currently set at 999. The maximum
input base is 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BC_DIM_MAX <br>
This is currently an arbitrary limit of 65535 as
distributed. Your installation may be different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BC_SCALE_MAX <br>
The number of digits after the decimal point is limited to
INT_MAX digits. Also, the number of digits before the
decimal point is limited to INT_MAX digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BC_STRING_MAX <br>
The limit on the number of characters in a string is INT_MAX
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exponent <br>
The value of the exponent in the raise operation (^) is
limited to LONG_MAX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable names <br>
The current limit on the number of unique names is 32767 for
each of simple variables, arrays and functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables are processed by bc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIXLY_CORRECT <br>
This is the same as the -s option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BC_ENV_ARGS <br>
This is another mechanism to get arguments to bc. The format
is the same as the command line arguments. These arguments
are processed first, so any files listed in the <br>
environment arguments are processed before any command line
argument files. This allows the user to set up
&quot;standard&quot; options and files to be processed at
every invoca&acirc; <br>
tion of bc. The files in the environment variables would
typically contain function definitions for functions the
user wants defined every time bc is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BC_LINE_LENGTH <br>
This should be an integer specifying the number of
characters in an output line for numbers. This includes the
backslash and newline characters for long numbers. As an
<br>
extension, the value of zero disables the multi-line
feature. Any other value of this variable that is less than
3 sets the line length to 70.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
If any file on the command line can not be opened, bc will
report that the file is unavailable and terminate. Also,
there are compile and run time diagnostics that should be
<br>
self-explanatory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Error recovery is not very good yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Email bug reports to
bug-bc@gnu.org. Be sure to include the word
&lsquo;&lsquo;bc&rsquo;&rsquo; somewhere in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;Subject:&rsquo;&rsquo; field.</p>
