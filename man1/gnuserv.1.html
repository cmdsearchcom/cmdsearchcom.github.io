<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnuserv, gnuclient - Server and Clients for Emacs and
XEmacs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnuclient [-display display] [-q] [-v] [-l library] [-batch]
[-f function] [-eval form] [-h hostname] [-p port] [-r
remote-pathname] [[+line] file] ... <br>
gnudoit [-q] form <br>
gnuserv <br>
gnuattach Removed as of gnuserv 3.x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gnuclient allows the user to request a running Emacs or
XEmacs process to edit the named files or directories and/or
evaluate lisp forms. Depending on your environment, it can
<br>
be an X frame or a TTY frame. One typical use for this is
with a dialup connection to a machine on which an Emacs or
XEmacs process is currently running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnudoit is a shell script
frontend to &lsquo;&lsquo;gnuclient -batch -eval
form&rsquo;&rsquo;. Its use is deprecated. Try to get used
to calling gnuclient directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnuserv is the server program
that is set running by Emacs or XEmacs to handle all
incoming and outgoing requests. It is not usually invoked
directly, but is started from Emacs <br>
or XEmacs by loading the gnuserv package and evaluating the
Lisp form (gnuserv-start).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnuattach no longer exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
gnuclient supports as much of the command line options of
Emacs as makes sense in this context. In addition it adds a
few of its own. <br>
Options with long names can also be specified using a double
hyphen instead of a single one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display, --display
display <br>
If this option is given or the &lsquo;DISPLAY&rsquo;
environment variable is set then gnuclient will tell Emacs
to edit files in a frame on the specified X device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q This option informs gnuclient
to exit once connection has been made with the XEmacs
process. Normally gnuclient waits until all of the files on
the command line have <br>
been finished with (their buffers killed) by the XEmacs
process, and all the forms have been evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v When this option is specified
gnuclient will request for the specified files to be viewed
instead of edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l library <br>
Tell Emacs to load the specified library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-batch Tell Emacs not to open
any frames. Just load libraries and evaluate lisp code. If
no files to execute, functions to call or forms to eval are
given using the -l, -f, or <br>
-eval options, then forms to eval are read from STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f function, <br>
Make Emacs execute the lisp function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eval form <br>
Make Emacs execute the lisp form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h hostname <br>
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, this option
specifies the host machine which should be running gnuserv.
If this option is not specified then the value of the <br>
environment variable GNU_HOST is used if set. If no hostname
is specified, and the GNU_HOST variable is not set, an
internet connection will not be attempted. N.B.: <br>
gnuserv does NOT allow internet connections unless XAUTH
authentication is used or the GNU_SECURE variable has been
specified and points at a file listing all trusted <br>
hosts. (See SECURITY below.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that an internet address
may be specified instead of a hostname which can speed up
connections to the server by quite a bit, especially if the
client machine is run&acirc; <br>
ning YP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note also that a hostname of
unix can be used to specify that the connection to the
server should use a Unix-domain socket (if supported) rather
than an Internet-domain <br>
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port Used only with
Internet-domain sockets, this option specifies the service
port used to communicate between server and clients. If this
option is not specified, then the <br>
value of the environment variable GNU_PORT is used, if set,
otherwise a service called
&lsquo;&lsquo;gnuserv&rsquo;&rsquo; is looked up in the
services database. Finally, if no other value can <br>
be found for the port, then a default port is used which is
usually 21490 + uid. <br>
Note that since gnuserv doesn&rsquo;t allow command-line
options, the port for it will have to be specified via one
of the alternative methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r pathname <br>
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, the pathname
argument may be needed to inform Emacs how to reach the root
directory of a remote machine. gnuclient prepends this <br>
string to each path argument given. For example, if you were
trying to edit a file on a client machine called otter,
whose root directory was accessible from the server <br>
machine via the path /net/otter, then this argument should
be set to &rsquo;/net/otter&rsquo;. If this option is
omitted, then the value is taken from the environment
variable <br>
GNU_NODE, if set, or the empty string otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[+n] file <br>
This is the path of the file to be edited. If the file is a
directory, then the directory browsers dired or monkey are
usually invoked instead. The cursor is put at <br>
line number &rsquo;n&rsquo; if specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETUP <br>
gnuserv is packaged standardly with recent versions of
XEmacs. Therefore, you should be able to start the server
simply by evaluating the XEmacs Lisp form (gnuserv-start),
or <br>
equivalently by typing &lsquo;M-x gnuserv-start&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
The behavior of this suite of program is mostly controlled
on the lisp side in Emacs and its behavior can be customized
to a large extent. Type &lsquo;M-x customize-group RET
gnuserv <br>
RET&rsquo; for easy access. More documentation can be found
in the file &lsquo;gnuserv.el&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
gnuclient -q -f mh-smail <br>
gnuclient -h cuckoo -r /ange@otter: /tmp/* <br>
gnuclient ../src/listproc.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More examples and sample wrapper
scripts are provided in the etc/gnuserv directory of the
Emacs installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSV IPC <br>
SysV IPC is used to communicate between gnuclient and
gnuserv if the symbol SYSV_IPC is defined at the top of
gnuserv.h. This is incompatible with both Unix-domain and
Internet- <br>
domain socket communication as described below. A file
called /tmp/gsrv??? is created as a key for the message
queue, and if removed will cause the communication between
server <br>
and client to fail until the server is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIX-DOMAIN SOCKETS <br>
A Unix-domain socket is used to communicate between
gnuclient and gnuserv if the symbol UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS is
defined at the top of gnuserv.h. A file called <br>
/tmp/gsrvdir????/gsrv is created for communication. If the
symbol USE_TMPDIR is set at the top of gnuserv.h, $TMPDIR,
when set, is used instead of /tmp. If that file is <br>
deleted, or TMPDIR has different values for the server and
the client, communication between server and client will
fail. Only the user running gnuserv will be able to connect
<br>
to the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERNET-DOMAIN SOCKETS <br>
Internet-domain sockets are used to communicate between
gnuclient and gnuserv if the symbol INTERNET_DOMAIN_SOCKETS
is defined at the top of gnuserv.h. Both Internet-domain and
<br>
Unix-domain sockets can be used at the same time. If a
hostname is specified via -h or via the GNU_HOST environment
variable, gnuclient establish connections using an internet
<br>
domain socket. If not, a local connection is attempted via
either a unix-domain socket or SYSV IPC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
Using Internet-domain sockets, a more robust form of
security is needed that wasn&rsquo;t necessary with either
Unix-domain sockets or SysV IPC. Currently, two
authentication protocols <br>
are supported to provide this: MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 (based on
the X11 xauth(1) program) and a simple host-based access
control mechanism, hereafter called GNUSERV-1. The GNUSERV-1
<br>
protocol is always available, whereas support for
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 may or may not have been enabled (via a
#define at the top of gnuserv.h) at compile-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnuserv, using GNUSERV-1,
performs a limited form of access control at the machine
level. By default no internet-domain socket is opened. If
the variable GNU_SECURE can be found <br>
in gnuserv&rsquo;s environment, and it names a readable
filename, then this file is opened and assumed to be a list
of hosts, one per line, from which the server will allow
requests. <br>
Connections from any other host will be rejected. Even the
machine on which gnuserv is running is not permitted to make
connections via the internet socket unless its hostname is
<br>
explicitly specified in this file. Note that a host may be
either a numeric IP address or a hostname, and that any user
on an approved host may connect to your gnuserv and
exe&acirc; <br>
cute arbitrary elisp (e.g., delete all your files). If this
file contains a lot of hostnames then the server may take
quite a time to start up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
protocol is enabled, an internet socket is opened by
default. gnuserv will accept a connection from any host, and
will wait for a &quot;magic cookie&quot; <br>
(essentially, a password) to be presented by the client. If
the client doesn&rsquo;t present the cookie, or if the
cookie is wrong, the authentication of the client is
considered to <br>
have failed. At this point. gnuserv falls back to the
GNUSERV-1 protocol; If the client is calling from a host
listed in the GNU_SECURE file, the connection will be
accepted, <br>
otherwise it will be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
authentication <br>
When the gnuserv server is started, it looks for a cookie
defined for display 999 on the machine where it is running.
If the cookie is found, it will be stored for use as the
<br>
authentication cookie. These cookies are defined in an
authorization file (usually ~/.Xauthority) that is
manipulated by the X11 xauth(1) program. For example, a
machine <br>
&quot;kali&quot; which runs an emacs that invokes gnuserv
should respond as follows (at the shell prompt) when set up
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kali% xauth list <br>
GS65.SP.CS.CMU.EDU:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 11223344 <br>
KALI.FTM.CS.CMU.EDU:999 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the above case, the
authorization file defines two cookies. The second one,
defined for screen 999 on the server machine, is used for
gnuserv authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the client machine&rsquo;s
side, the authorization file must contain an identical line,
specifying the server&rsquo;s cookie. In other words, on a
machine &quot;foobar&quot; which wishes to <br>
connect to &quot;kali,&quot; the &lsquo;xauth list&rsquo;
output should contain the line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KALI.FTM.CS.CMU.EDU:999
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 1234</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create the cookie, you can
use a command like <br>
xauth add &lsquo;hostname&lsquo;:999 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
&lsquo;head -c512 /dev/urandom|md5sum&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on
authorization files, take a look at the xauth(1X11) man
page, or invoke xauth interactively (without any arguments)
and type &quot;help&quot; at the prompt. <br>
Remember that case in the name of the authorization protocol
(i.e.&lsquo;MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1&rsquo;) is significant!</p>
