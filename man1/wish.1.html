<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Wish</b> is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command language, the Tk
  toolkit, and a main program that reads commands from standard input or from a
  file. It creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands. If <b>wish</b>
  is invoked with arguments, then the first few arguments, ? <b>-encoding
  </b><i>name</i>? ?<i>fileName</i>? specify the name of a script file, and,
  optionally, the encoding of the text data stored in that script file. A value
  for <i>fileName</i> is recognized if the appropriate argument does not start
  with &#x201C;-&#x201D;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a <i>fileName</i>,
  then wish reads Tcl commands interactively from standard input. It will
  continue processing commands until all windows have been deleted or until
  end-of-file is reached on standard input. If there exists a file &#x201C;
  <b>.wishrc</b>&#x201D; in the home directory of the user, <b>wish</b>
  evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading the first command from
  standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If arguments to <b>wish</b> do specify a <i>fileName</i>, then <i>fileName</i>
  is treated as the name of a script file. <b>Wish</b> will evaluate the script
  in <i>fileName</i> (which presumably creates a user interface), then it will
  respond to events until all windows have been deleted. Commands will not be
  read from standard input. There is no automatic evaluation of &#x201C;
  <b>.wishrc</b>&#x201D; when the name of a script file is presented on the
  <b>wish</b> command line, but the script file can always <b>source</b> it if
  desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that on Windows, the <b>wish</b><i>version</i><b>.exe</b> program varies
  from the <b>tclsh</b><i>version</i><b>.exe</b> program in an additional
  important way: it does not connect to a standard Windows console and is
  instead a windowed program. Because of this, it additionally provides access
  to its own <b>console</b> command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTION_PROCESSING"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTION_PROCESSING">OPTION
  PROCESSING</a></h1>
<b>Wish</b> automatically processes all of the command-line options described in
  the <b>OPTIONS</b> summary above. Any other command-line arguments besides
  these are passed through to the application using the <b>argc</b> and
  <b>argv</b> variables described later.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="APPLICATION_NAME_AND_CLASS"><a class="selflink" href="#APPLICATION_NAME_AND_CLASS">APPLICATION
  NAME AND CLASS</a></h1>
The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as <b>send</b>
  commands, is taken from the <b>-name</b> option, if it is specified; otherwise
  it is taken from <i>fileName</i>, if it is specified, or from the command name
  by which <b>wish</b> was invoked. In the last two cases, if the name contains
  a &#x201C;/&#x201D; character, then only the characters after the last slash
  are used as the application name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as specifying
  options with a <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b> property or .Xdefaults file, is the
  same as its name except that the first letter is capitalized.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#VARIABLES">VARIABLES</a></h1>
<b>Wish</b> sets the following Tcl variables:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>argc</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Contains a count of the number of <i>arg</i> arguments (0
      if none), not including the options described above.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>argv</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <i>arg</i>
      arguments that follow a <b>--</b> option or do not match any of the
      options described in <b>OPTIONS</b> above, in order, or an empty string if
      there are no such arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>argv0</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Contains <i>fileName</i> if it was specified. Otherwise,
      contains the name by which <b>wish</b> was invoked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>geometry</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the <b>-geometry</b> option is specified, <b>wish</b>
      copies its value into this variable. If the variable still exists after
      <i>fileName</i> has been evaluated, <b>wish</b> uses the value of the
      variable in a <b>wm geometry</b> command to set the main window's
      geometry.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>tcl_interactive</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Contains 1 if <b>wish</b> is reading commands interactively
      ( <i>fileName</i> was not specified and standard input is a terminal-like
      device), 0 otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCRIPT_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#SCRIPT_FILES">SCRIPT
  FILES</a></h1>
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>#!/usr/local/bin/wish</b>
</pre>
</div>
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you mark it as
  executable. This assumes that <b>wish</b> has been installed in the default
  location in /usr/local/bin; if it is installed somewhere else then you will
  have to modify the above line to match. Many UNIX systems do not allow the
  <b>#!</b> line to exceed about 30 characters in length, so be sure that the
  <b>wish</b> executable can be accessed with a short file name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An even better approach is to start your script files with the following three
  lines:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<b>#!/bin/sh</b>
<b># the next line restarts using wish \</b>
<b>exec wish &quot;$0&quot; ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}</b>
</pre>
</div>
This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous paragraph.
  First, the location of the <b>wish</b> binary does not have to be hard-wired
  into the script: it can be anywhere in your shell search path. Second, it gets
  around the 30-character file name limit in the previous approach. Third, this
  approach will work even if <b>wish</b> is itself a shell script (this is done
  on some systems in order to handle multiple architectures or operating
  systems: the <b>wish</b> script selects one of several binaries to run). The
  three lines cause both <b>sh</b> and <b>wish</b> to process the script, but
  the <b>exec</b> is only executed by <b>sh</b>. <b>sh</b> processes the script
  first; it treats the second line as a comment and executes the third line. The
  <b>exec</b> statement cause the shell to stop processing and instead to start
  up <b>wish</b> to reprocess the entire script. When <b>wish</b> starts up, it
  treats all three lines as comments, since the backslash at the end of the
  second line causes the third line to be treated as part of the comment on the
  second line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of the medium,
  or by the character, &#x201C;\032&#x201D; (&#x201C;\u001a&#x201D;, control-Z).
  If this character is present in the file, the <b>wish</b> application will
  read text up to but not including the character. An application that requires
  this character in the file may encode it as &#x201C;\032&#x201D;,
  &#x201C;\x1a&#x201D;, or &#x201C;\u001a&#x201D;; or may generate it by use of
  commands such as <b>format</b> or <b>binary</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROMPTS"><a class="selflink" href="#PROMPTS">PROMPTS</a></h1>
When <b>wish</b> is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each command
  with &#x201C; <b>% </b>&#x201D;. You can change the prompt by setting the
  variables <b>tcl_prompt1</b> and <b>tcl_prompt2</b>. If variable
  <b>tcl_prompt1</b> exists then it must consist of a Tcl script to output a
  prompt; instead of outputting a prompt <b>wish</b> will evaluate the script in
  <b>tcl_prompt1</b>. The variable <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is used in a similar way
  when a newline is typed but the current command is not yet complete; if
  <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is not set then no prompt is output for incomplete
  commands.
