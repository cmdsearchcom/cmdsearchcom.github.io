<p>reptyr(1) General Commands Manual reptyr(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
reptyr - Reparent a running program to a new terminal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
reptyr PID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reptyr -l|-L [COMMAND
[ARGS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
reptyr is a utility for taking an existing running program
and attaching it to a new terminal. Started a long-running
process over ssh, but have to leave and don&rsquo;t want to
inter&acirc; <br>
rupt it? Just start a screen, use reptyr to grab it, and
then kill the ssh session and head on home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reptyr works by attaching to the
target program using ptrace(2), redirecting relevant file
descriptors, and changing the program&rsquo;s controlling
terminal (See tty(4)) It is this <br>
last detail that makes reptyr work much better than
alternatives such as retty(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After attaching a program, the
program will appear to be either backgrounded or suspended
to the shell it was launched from (depending on the shell).
For maximal safety you can <br>
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg; disown</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the old shell to remove the
association with the program, but reptyr will attempt to
ensure that the target program remains running even if you
close the shell without doing <br>
so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use an alternate mode of
attaching, &quot;TTY-stealing&quot;. In this mode, reptyr
will not ptrace(2) the target process, but will attempt to
discover the terminal emulator for that <br>
process&rsquo; pty, and steal the master end of the pty.
This mode is more reliable and flexible in many
circumstances (for instance, it can attach all processes on
a tty, <br>
rather than just a single process). However, as a downside,
children of sshd(8) cannot be attached via -T unless reptyr
is run as root. See
&acirc;&uml;https://blog.nelhage.com/2014/ <br>
08/new-reptyr-feature-tty-stealing/&acirc;&copy; for more
information about tty-stealing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, -L [COMMAND [ARGS]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of attaching to a new
process, create a new pty pair, proxy the master end to the
current terminal, and then print the name of the slave pty.
This can be passed to <br>
e.g. gdb&Acirc;&acute;s set inferior-tty option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an optional COMMAND and ARGS
are passed in conjunction with -l, that command will be
executed as a child of reptyr with the REPTYR_PTY
environment variable set to the <br>
name of the slave pty. If -L is used instead of -l, then fds
0-2 of the child will also be redirected to point to the
slave, and the child will be run in a fresh session <br>
with the slave as its controlling terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, reptyr will move any
file descriptors in the target that were connected to the
target&rsquo;s controlling terminal to point to the new
terminal. The -s option will <br>
cause reptyr to unconditionally attach file descriptors 0,
1, and 2 in the target, even if the target has no
controlling terminal or they are not connected to a
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the version of reptyr and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print a usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print verbose debug output while
running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
reptyr depends on the ptrace(2) system call to attach to the
remote program. On Ubuntu Maverick and higher, this ability
is disabled by default for security reasons. You can <br>
enable it temporarily by doing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># echo 0 &gt;
/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as root, or permanently by
editing the file /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf, which also
contains more information about this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When attaching to some curses programs, they will not redraw
the screen right away, and a ^L or similar will be needed to
force a redraw.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, after attaching to
certain programs, the old terminal will be left in an odd
state, and a clear or even reset may be required before the
old terminal is usable again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attaching to rtorrent (and
probably some other apps) doesn&rsquo;t work right (rtorrent
stops accepting input) (The problem is that rtorrent is
using epoll to poll stdin, and we don&rsquo;t <br>
update the internal reference that the epoll fd has to the
old tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attaching to a process with
children doesn&rsquo;t work right. This should be possible
to fix -- I just need to ptrace each child individually and
do the same games to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attaching a less(1) process
doesn&rsquo;t work if you have a .lessfilter file, as less
leaves around a zombie child in this case. This could be
worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs should be reported to the
author (see below) or via the issue tracker on GitHub.</p>
