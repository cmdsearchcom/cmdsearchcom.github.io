<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dirdiff is a graphical tool for displaying the differences
between directory trees (up to 5) and for merging changes
from one tree into another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At startup, dirdiff displays a
main window with a list of the files that are different
between the trees. Colored squares are used to indicate the
relative ages of the versions. <br>
Files are like leaves on a deciduous tree: the newest ones
are green, and then they turn yellow, orange, and red as
they get older. Missing files are black, and directories are
<br>
white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see the differences between
two versions of a file, double-click on the file name. By
default, the first and last versions are compared, but this
can be changed using the <br>
Diff menu in the main window. In the differences window,
there are checkboxes to the left of all the sections which
are different. You can use button 1 to select an individual
<br>
checkbox, or shift-button 1 or button 3 to select a whole
group. Selecting a line means that you are asking for that
change to be made when you update either of the files using
<br>
the Merge menu. The line will be removed if it is already
present or added if it is not present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To copy from one tree to
another, click on the file name and select the appropriate
copy operation from the Copy menu of the main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting Make patch from the
File menu of the main window produces a file describing the
changes between the files that can be applied by the patch
tool. You can edit the patch <br>
before saving, and may wish to add explanatory text,
instructions, or patch Prereq lines at the beginning. To
save the patch, enter a filename in the patch window
relative to <br>
the current directory, and choose Save. This will also close
the window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are sending out patches,
then the from directory should be the original version of
the source. Try to make sure that the two files have the
same number of leading direc&acirc; <br>
tories. See the patch(1) man page for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Dirdiff needs to be able to load the libfilecmp.so.0.0
shared library for the -r or -t flags to work.</p>
