<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
alsamixer - soundcard mixer for ALSA soundcard driver, with
ncurses interface</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
alsamixer [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
alsamixer is an ncurses mixer program for use with the ALSA
soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards with
multiple devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Help: show available flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --card &lt;card number or
identification&gt; <br>
Select the soundcard to use, if you have more than one.
Cards are numbered from 0 (the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --device &lt;device
identification&gt; <br>
Select the mixer device to control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --view &lt;mode&gt; <br>
Select the starting view mode, either playback, capture or
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --no-color <br>
Toggle the using of colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIXER VIEWS <br>
The top-left corner of alsamixer is the are to show some
basic information: the card name, the mixer chip name, the
current view mode and the currently selected mixer item.
When <br>
the mixer item is switched off, [Off] is displayed in its
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Volume bars are located below
the basic information area. You can scroll left/right when
all controls can&rsquo;t be put in a single screen. The name
of each control is shown in the <br>
bottom below the volume bars. The currently selected item is
drawn in red and/of emphasized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each mixer control with volume
capability shows a box and the current volume filled in that
box. The volume percentages are displayed below the volume
bar for left and right <br>
channels. For a mono control, only one value is shown
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a mixer control is turned
off, M (mute) appears below the volume bar. When it&rsquo;s
turned on, O in green appears instead. You can toggle the
switch via m key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a mixer control has capture
capability, the capture flag appears below the volume bar,
too. When the capture is turned off, ------- is shown.
CAPTURE in red appears when <br>
the capture switch is turned on. In addition, L and R
letters appear in left and right side to indicate that left
and the right channels are turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some controls have the
enumeration list, and don&rsquo;t show boxes but only texts
which indicate the currently active item. You can change the
item via up/down keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIEW MODES <br>
alsamixer has three view modes: playback, capture and all.
In the playback view, only the controls related with
playback are shown. Similarly, only the controls for capture
<br>
(recording) are shown in the capture view. The all view mode
shows all controls. The current view mode is displayed in
the top-left position together with the mixer name, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default view mode is the
playback view. You can change it via -V option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each view mode can be switched
via keyboard commands, too. See the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD COMMANDS <br>
alsamixer recognizes the following keyboard commands to
control the soundcard. Commands shown here in upper case can
also be given in lower case. To be reminded of these
key&acirc; <br>
strokes, hit the h key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Controls <br>
The Left and right arrow keys are used to select the channel
(or device, depending on your preferred terminology). You
can also use n (&quot;next&quot;) and p
(&quot;previous&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Up and Down Arrows control
the volume for the currently selected device. You can also
use + or - for the same purpose. Both the left and right
signals are affected. For inde&acirc; <br>
pendent left and right control, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The B or = key adjusts the
balance of volumes on left and right channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M toggles muting for the current
channel (both left and right). If the hardware supports it,
you can mute left and right independently by using , (or
&lt;) and . (or &gt;) respec&acirc; <br>
tively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPACE enables recording for the
current channel. If any other channels have recording
enabled, they will have their recording function disabled
first. This only works for valid <br>
input channels, of course.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L re-draws the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View Mode Controls <br>
Function keys are used to change view modes. You can switch
to the help mode and the proc info mode via F1 and F2 keys,
respectively. On terminals that can&rsquo;t use function
keys <br>
like gnome-terminal, ? and / keys can be used alternatively
for help and proc modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F3, F4 and F5 keys are used to
switch to playback, capture and all view mode, respectively.
TAB key toggles the current view mode circularly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick Volume Changes <br>
PageUp increases volume by 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PageDown decreases volume by
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End sets volume to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also control left &amp;
right levels for the current channel independently, as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Q | W | E ] -- turn UP [ left |
both | right ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Z | X | C ] -- turn DOWN [ left
| both | right ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the currently selected mixer
channel is not a stereo channel, then all UP keys will work
like W, and all DOWN keys will work like X.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number keys from 0 to 9 are
to change the absolute volume quickly. They correspond to 0
to 90% volume.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting the Sound Card <br>
You can select another sound card by pressing the F6 or S
keys. This will show a list of available sound cards to
choose from, and an entry to enter the mixer device name by
<br>
hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting <br>
Quit the program with ALT Q, or by hitting ESC. Please note
that you might need to hit ESC twice on some terminals since
it&rsquo;s regarded as a prefix key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VOLUME MAPPING <br>
In alsamixer, the volume is mapped to a value that is more
natural for a human ear. The mapping is designed so that the
position in the interval is proportional to the volume as
<br>
a human ear would perceive it, i.e. the position is the
cubic root of the linear sample multiplication factor. For
controls with a small range (24 dB or less), the mapping is
<br>
linear in the dB values so that each step has the same size
visually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only for controls without dB
information, a linear mapping of the hardware volume
register values is used (this is the same algorithm as used
in the old alsamixer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
amixer(1), aplay(1), arecord(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Some terminal emulators (e.g. nxterm) may not work quite
right with ncurses, but that&rsquo;s their own damn fault.
Plain old xterm seems to be fine.</p>
