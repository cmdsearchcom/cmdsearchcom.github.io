<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
'units' [<i>options</i>] [<i>from-unit</i> [<i>to-unit</i>]]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The 'units' program converts quantities expressed in various systems of
  measurement to their equivalents in other systems of measurement. Like many
  similar programs, it can handle multiplicative scale changes. It can also
  handle nonlinear conversions such as Fahrenheit to Celsius. See the examples
  below. The program can also perform conversions from and to sums of units,
  such as converting between meters and feet plus inches.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Beyond simple unit conversions, 'units' can be used as a general-purpose
  scientific calculator that keeps track of units in its calculations. You can
  form arbitrary complex mathematical expressions of dimensions including sums,
  products, quotients, powers, and even roots of dimensions. Thus you can ensure
  accuracy and dimensional consistency when working with long expressions that
  involve many different units that may combine in complex ways.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The units are defined in an external data file. You can use the extensive data
  file that comes with this program, or you can provide your own data file to
  suit your needs. You can also use your own data file to supplement the
  standard data file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Basic operation is simple: you enter the units that you want to convert
  <i>from</i> and the units that you want to convert <i>to</i>. You can use the
  program interactively with prompts, or you can use it from the command line.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INTERACTING_WITH_UNITS"><a class="selflink" href="#INTERACTING_WITH_UNITS">INTERACTING
  WITH <b><i>UNITS</i></b></a></h1>
To invoke units for interactive use, type ' <i>units</i>' at your shell prompt.
  The program will print something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
Currency exchange rates from 04/23/12 
2516 units, 85 prefixes, 65 nonlinear units
    
You have:
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the 'You have:' prompt, type the quantity and units that you are converting
  <i>from</i>. For example, if you want to convert ten meters to feet, type '
  <i>10 meters</i>'. Next, 'units' will print 'You want:'. You should type the
  units you want to convert <i>to</i>. To convert to feet, you would type '
  <i>feet</i>'. If the 'readline' library was compiled in then the tab key can
  be used to complete unit names. See <i>Readline Support</i> for more
  information about 'readline'. To quit the program press Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D under
  Unix. Under Windows press Ctrl-Z.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The answer will be displayed in two ways. The first line of output, which is
  marked with a '*' to indicate multiplication, gives the result of the
  conversion you have asked for. The second line of output, which is marked with
  a '/' to indicate division, gives the inverse of the conversion factor. If you
  convert 10 meters to feet, 'units' will print
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
    * 32.808399
    / 0.03048
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet. The second number gives
  the conversion in the opposite direction. In this case, it tells you that 1
  foot is equal to about 0.03 dekameters since the dekameter is 10 meters. It
  also tells you that 1/32.8 is about 0.03.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'units' program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a more convenient
  number. In the example above, for example, the inverse value is an exact
  conversion: a foot is exactly 0.03048 dekameters. But the number given the
  other direction is inexact.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: grains
You want: pounds
        * 0.00014285714
        / 7000
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 From the second line of the output you can immediately see that a grain is
  equal to a seven thousandth of a pound. This is not so obvious from the first
  line of the output. If you find the output format confusing, try using the
  '--verbose' option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: grain
You want: aeginamina
        grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
        grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you request a conversion between units that measure reciprocal dimensions,
  then 'units' will display the conversion results with an extra note indicating
  that reciprocal conversion has been done:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 6 ohms
You want: siemens
        reciprocal conversion
        * 0.16666667
        / 6
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the '--strict' option. As
  usual, use the '--verbose' option to get more comprehensible output:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: tex
You want: typp
        reciprocal conversion
        1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
        1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: 20 mph
You want: sec/mile
        reciprocal conversion
        1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
        1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you enter incompatible unit types, the 'units' program will print a message
  indicating that the units are not conformable and it will display the reduced
  form for each unit:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: ergs/hour
You want: fathoms kg^2 / day 
conformability error
        2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
        2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit, simply press
  <i>Enter</i> at the 'You want:' prompt. Here is an example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: jansky
You want: 
        Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output from 'units' indicates that the jansky is defined to be equal to a
  fluxunit which in turn is defined to be a certain combination of watts,
  meters, and hertz. The fully reduced (and in this case somewhat more cryptic)
  form appears on the far right.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations. These units
  include the radian and steradian. These units will be treated as equal to 1 in
  units conversions. Power is equal to torque times angular velocity. This
  conversion can only be performed if the radian is dimensionless.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
You want: watts
        * 227.77742
        / 0.0043902509
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Named dimensionless units are not treated as dimensionless in other contexts.
  They cannot be used as exponents so for example, 'meter^radian' is not
  allowed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want a list of options you can type ' <i>?</i>' at the 'You want:'
  prompt. The program will display a list of named units that are conformable
  with the unit that you entered at the 'You have:' prompt above. Conformable
  unit <i>combinations</i> will not appear on this list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typing ' <i>help</i>' at either prompt displays a short help message. You can
  also type ' <i>help</i>' followed by a unit name. This will invoke a pager on
  the units data base at the point where that unit is defined. You can read the
  definition and comments that may give more details or historical information
  about the unit. (You can generally quit out of the page by pressing 'q'.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Typing ' <i>search</i>' <i>text</i> will display a list of all of the units
  whose names contain <i>text</i> as a substring along with their definitions.
  This may help in the case where you aren't sure of the right unit name.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_UNITS_NON-INTERACTIVELY"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_UNITS_NON-INTERACTIVELY">USING
  <b><i>UNITS</i></b> NON-INTERACTIVELY</a></h1>
The 'units' program can perform units conversions non-interactively from the
  command line. To do this, type the command, type the original unit expression,
  and type the new units you want. If a units expression contains
  non-alphanumeric characters, you may need to protect it from interpretation by
  the shell using single or double quote characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
units &quot;2 liters&quot; quarts
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then 'units' will print
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
    * 2.1133764
    / 0.47317647
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and then exit. The output tells you that 2 liters is about 2.1 quarts, or
  alternatively that a quart is about 0.47 times 2 liters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the conversion is successful, then 'units' will return success (zero) to the
  calling environment. If you enter non-conformable units then 'units' will
  print a message giving the reduced form of each unit and it will return
  failure (nonzero) to the calling environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you invoke 'units' with only one argument, it will print out the definition
  of the specified unit. It will return failure if the unit is not defined and
  success if the unit is defined.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UNIT_DEFINITIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#UNIT_DEFINITIONS">UNIT
  DEFINITIONS</a></h1>
The conversion information is read from a units data file that is called
  'definitions.units' and is usually located in the '/usr/share/units'
  directory. If you invoke 'units' with the '-V' option, it will print the
  location of this file. The default file includes definitions for all familiar
  units, abbreviations and metric prefixes. It also includes many obscure or
  archaic units.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many constants of nature are defined, including these:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
pi          ratio of circumference to diameter
c           speed of light
e           charge on an electron
force       acceleration of gravity
mole        Avogadro's number
water       pressure per unit height of water
Hg          pressure per unit height of mercury
au          astronomical unit
k           Boltzman's constant
mu0         permeability of vacuum
epsilon0    permittivity of vacuum
G           Gravitational constant
mach        speed of sound
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard data file includes atomic masses for all of the elements and
  numerous other constants. Also included are the densities of various
  ingredients used in baking so that '2 cups flour_sifted' can be converted to
  'grams'. This is not an exhaustive list. Consult the units data file to see
  the complete list, or to see the definitions that are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'pound' is a unit of mass. To get force, multiply by the force conversion
  unit 'force' or use the shorthand 'lbf'. (Note that 'g' is already taken as
  the standard abbreviation for the gram.) The unit 'ounce' is also a unit of
  mass. The fluid ounce is 'fluidounce' or 'floz'. British capacity units that
  differ from their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial gallon, are
  prefixed with 'br'. Currency is prefixed with its country name:
  'belgiumfranc', 'britainpound'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When searching for a unit, if the specified string does not appear exactly as a
  unit name, then the 'units' program will try to remove a trailing 's', 'es'.
  Next units will replace a trailing 'ies' with 'y'. If that fails, 'units' will
  check for a prefix. The database includes all of the standard metric prefixes.
  Only one prefix is permitted per unit, so 'micromicrofarad' will fail.
  However, prefixes can appear alone with no unit following them, so
  'micro*microfarad' will work, as will 'micro microfarad'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To find out which units and prefixes are available, read the standard units data
  file, which is extensively annotated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="English_Customary_Units"><a class="selflink" href="#English_Customary_Units">English
  Customary Units</a></h2>
English customary units differ in various ways in different regions. In Britain
  a complex system of volume measurements featured different gallons for
  different materials such as a wine gallon and ale gallon that different by
  twenty percent. This complexity was swept away in 1824 by a reform that
  created an entirely new gallon, the British Imperial gallon defined as the
  volume occupied by ten pounds of water. Meanwhile in the USA the gallon is
  derived from the 1707 Winchester wine gallon, which is 231 cubic inches. These
  gallons differ by about twenty percent. By default if 'units' runs in the
  'en_GB' locale you will get the British volume measures. If it runs in the
  'en_US' locale you will get the US volume measures. In other locales the
  default values are the US definitions. If you wish to force different
  definitions then set the environment variable 'UNITS_ENGLISH' to either 'US'
  or 'GB' to set the desired definitions independent of the locale.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before 1959, the value of a yard (and other units of measure defined in terms of
  it) differed slightly among English-speaking countries. In 1959, Australia,
  Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Africa
  adopted the Canadian value of 1&#x00A0;yard = 0.9144&#x00A0;m (exactly), which
  was approximately halfway between the values used by the UK and the US; it had
  the additional advantage of making 1&#x00A0;inch = 2.54&#x00A0;cm (exactly).
  This new standard was termed the <i>International Yard</i>. Australia, Canada,
  and the UK then defined all customary lengths in terms of the International
  Yard (Australia did not define the furlong or rod); because many US land
  surveys were in terms of the pre-1959 units, the US continued to define
  customary surveyors' units (furlong, chain, rod, and link) in terms of the
  previous value for the foot, which was termed the <i>US survey foot</i>. The
  US defined a <i>US survey mile</i> as 5280 US survey feet, and defined a
  <i>statute mile</i> as a US survey mile. The US values for these units differ
  from the international values by about 2&#x00A0;ppm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'units' program uses the international values for these units; the US values
  can be obtained by using either the 'US' or the 'survey' prefix. In either
  case, the simple familiar relationships among the units are maintained, e.g.,
  1 'furlong' = 660 'ft', and 1 'USfurlong' = 660 'USft', though the metric
  equivalents differ slightly between the two cases. The 'US' prefix or the
  'survey' prefix can also be used to obtain the US survey mile and the value of
  the US yard prior to 1959, e.g., 'USmile' or 'surveymile' (but <i>not</i>
  'USsurveymile'). To get the US value of the statute mile, use either
  'USstatutemile' or 'USmile'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Except for distances that extend over hundreds of miles (such as in the US State
  Plane Coordinate System), the differences in the miles are usually
  insignificant:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 100 surveymile - 100 mile
You want: inch
        * 12.672025
        / 0.078913984
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The pre-1959 UK values for these units can be obtained with the prefix 'UK'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the US, the acre is officially defined in terms of the US survey foot, but
  'units' uses a definition based on the international foot. If you want the
  official US acre use 'USacre' and similarly use 'USacrefoot' for the official
  US version of that unit. The difference between these units is about 4 parts
  per million.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UNIT_EXPRESSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#UNIT_EXPRESSIONS">UNIT
  EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Operators"><a class="selflink" href="#Operators">Operators</a></h2>
You can enter more complicated units by combining units with operations such as
  powers, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and parentheses for
  grouping. You can use the customary symbols for these operators when 'units'
  is invoked with its default options. Additionally, 'units' supports some
  extensions, including high priority multiplication using a space, and a high
  priority numerical
<br/>
 division operator ('|') that can simplify some expressions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Powers of units can be specified using the '^' character as shown in the
  following example, or by simple concatenation of a unit and its exponent:
  'cm3' is equivalent to 'cm^3'; if the exponent is more than one digit, the '^'
  is required. An exponent like '2^3^2' is evaluated right to left as usual. The
  '^' operator has the second highest precedence. You can also use '**' as an
  exponent operator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: cm^3
You want: gallons
        * 0.00026417205
        / 3785.4118
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
You want: ft lbf  
        * 0.7296
        / 1.370614
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You multiply units using a space or an asterisk ('*'). The example above shows
  both forms. You can divide units using the slash ('/') or with 'per'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: furlongs per fortnight
You want: m/s  
        * 0.00016630986
        / 6012.8727
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a unit includes a prefix, exponent operators apply to the combination, so
  'centimeter^3' gives cubic centimeters. If you separate the prefix from the
  unit with any multiplication operator, such as 'centi meter^3', then the
  prefix is treated as a separate unit, so the exponent does not apply. The
  second example would be a hundredth of a cubic meter, not a centimeter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiplication using a space has a higher precedence than division using a slash
  and is evaluated left to right; in effect, the first '/' character marks the
  beginning of the denominator of a unit expression. This makes it simple to
  enter a quotient with several terms in the denominator: 'W / m^2 Hz'. If you
  multiply with '*' then you must group the terms in the denominator with
  parentheses: 'W / (m^2 * Hz)'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The higher precedence of the space operator may not always be advantageous. For
  example, 'm/s s/day' is equivalent to 'm / s s day' and has dimensions of
  length per time cubed. Similarly, '1/2 meter' refers to a unit of reciprocal
  length equivalent to 0.5/meter, perhaps not what you would intend if you
  entered that expression. The '*' operator is convenient for multiplying a
  sequence of quotients. With the '*' operator, the example above becomes 'm/s *
  s/day', which is equivalent to 'm/day'. Similarly, you could write '1/2 *
  meter' to get half a meter. Alternatively, parentheses can be used for
  grouping: you could write '(1/2) meter' to get half a meter. See
  <i>Complicated Unit Expressions</i> for an illustration of the various
  options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'units' program supports another option for numerical fractions. You can
  indicate division of <i>numbers</i> with the vertical bar ('|'), so if you
  wanted half a meter you could write '1|2 meter'. This operator has the highest
  precedence, so you can write the square root of two thirds '2|3^1|2'. You
  cannot use the vertical bar to indicate division of non-numerical units (e.g.,
  'm|s' results in an error message).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 1|2 inch
You want: cm
        * 1.27
        / 0.78740157
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use parentheses for grouping:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
You want: league
        * 0.00010356166

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sums_and_Differences_of_Units"><a class="selflink" href="#Sums_and_Differences_of_Units">Sums
  and Differences of Units</a></h2>
Outside of the SI, it is sometimes desirable to add values of different units.
  You may also wish to use 'units' as a calculator that keeps track of units.
  Sums of conformable units are written with the '+' character, and differences
  with the '-' character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
You want: seconds
        * 8612
        / 0.00011611705
    
You have: 12 ft + 3 in
You want: cm
        * 373.38
        / 0.0026782366
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
You want: btu
        * 2.5782804
        / 0.38785542
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The expressions that are added or subtracted must reduce to identical
  expressions in primitive units, or an error message will be displayed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12 printerspoint - 4 heredium
                                      ^
Illegal sum of non-conformable units
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As usual, the precedence for '+' and '-' is lower than that of the other
  operators. A fractional quantity such as 2&#x00A0;1/2 cups can be given as
  '(2+1|2) cups'; the parentheses are necessary because multiplication has
  higher precedence than addition. If you omit the parentheses, 'units' attempts
  to add '2' and '1|2 cups', and you get an error message:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 2+1|2 cups
                   ^
Illegal sum or difference of non-conformable units
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The expression could also be correctly written as '(2+1/2) cups'. If you write
  '2 1|2 cups' the space is interpreted as <i>multiplication</i> so the result
  is the same as '1 cup'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The '+' and '-' characters sometimes appears in exponents like '3.43e+8'. This
  leads to an ambiguity in an expression like '3e+2 yC'. The unit 'e' is a small
  unit of charge, so this can be regarded as equivalent to '(3e+2) yC' or '(3
  e)+(2 yC)'. This ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting '+' and '-' as
  part of an exponent if possible.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Numbers_as_Units"><a class="selflink" href="#Numbers_as_Units">Numbers
  as Units</a></h2>
For 'units', numbers are just another kind of unit. They can appear as many
  times as you like and in any order in a unit expression. For example, to find
  the volume of a box that is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft in steres, you could do the
  following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
You want: stere
        * 2.038813
        / 0.49048148
    
You have: $ 5 / yard
You want: cents / inch
        * 13.888889
        / 0.072
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the units conversion can
  precede the five. Be careful: 'units' will interpret '$5' with no space as
  equivalent to 'dollar^5'.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Built-in_Functions"><a class="selflink" href="#Built-in_Functions">Built-in
  Functions</a></h2>
Several built-in functions are provided: 'sin', 'cos', 'tan', 'ln', 'log',
  'log2', 'exp', 'acos', 'atan' and 'asin'. The 'sin', 'cos', and 'tan'
  functions require either a dimensionless argument or an argument with
  dimensions of angle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>

The other functions on the list require dimensionless arguments. The inverse

If you wish to take roots of units, you may use the 'sqrt' or 'cuberoot'
  functions. These functions require that the argument have the appropriate

The 'units' program is especially helpful in ensuring accuracy and dimensional
  consistency when converting lengthy unit expressions. For example, one form of
  the Darcy-Weisbach fluid-flow equation is
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Delta <i>P</i> = (8 / pi)^2 (rho <i>fLQ</i>^2) / <i>d</i>^5,</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where Delta <i>P</i> is the pressure drop, rho is the mass density, <i>f</i> is
  the (dimensionless) friction factor, <i>L</i> is the length of the pipe,
  <i>Q</i> is the volumetric flow rate, and <i>d</i> is the pipe diameter. It
  might be desired to have the equation in the form
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Delta <i>P</i> = A1 rho <i>fLQ</i>^2 / <i>d</i>^5</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
that accepted the user's normal units; for typical units used in the US, the
  required conversion could be something like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: (8/pi^2)(lbm/ft^3)ft(ft^3/s)^2(1/in^5)
You want: psi

</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The parentheses allow individual terms in the expression to be entered
  naturally, as they might be read from the formula. Alternatively, the
  multiplication could be done with the '*' rather than a space; then
  parentheses are needed only around 'ft^3/s' because of its exponent:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 8/pi^2 * lbm/ft^3 * ft * (ft^3/s)^2 /in^5
You want: psi
        * 43.533969
        / 0.022970568
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without parentheses, and using spaces for multiplication, the previous
  conversion would need to be entered as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Backwards_Compatibility:"><a class="selflink" href="#Backwards_Compatibility:">Backwards
  Compatibility:</a></h2>
'*' and '-' The original 'units' assigned multiplication a higher precedence
  than division using the slash. This differs from the usual precedence rules,
  which give multiplication and division equal precedence, and can be confusing
  for people who think of units as a calculator.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The star operator ('*') included in this 'units' program has, by default, the
  same precedence as division, and hence follows the usual precedence rules. For
  backwards compatibility you can invoke 'units' with the '--oldstar' option.
  Then '*' has a higher precedence than division, and the same precedence as
  multiplication using the space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Historically, the hyphen ('-') has been used in technical publications to
  indicate products of units, and the original 'units' program treated it as a
  multiplication operator. Because 'units' provides several other ways to obtain
  unit products, and because '-' is a subtraction operator in general algebraic
  expressions, 'units' treats the binary '-' as a subtraction operator by
  default. For backwards compatibility use the '--product' option, which causes
  'units' to treat the binary '-' operator as a product operator. When '-' is a
  multiplication operator it has the same precedence as multiplication with a
  space, giving it a higher precedence than division.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When '-' is used as a unary operator it negates its operand. Regardless of the
  'units' options, if '-' appears after '(' or after '+' then it will act as a
  negation operator. So you can always compute 20 degrees minus 12 minutes by
  entering '20 degrees + -12 arcmin'. You must use this construction when you
  define new units because you cannot know what options will be in force when
  your definition is processed.

Nonlinear units are represented using functional notation. They make possible
  nonlinear unit conversions such as temperature.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Temperature_Conversions"><a class="selflink" href="#Temperature_Conversions">Temperature
  Conversions</a></h2>
Conversions between temperatures are different from linear conversions between
  temperature <i>increments</i>&#x2014;see the example below. The absolute
  temperature conversions are handled by units starting with 'temp', and you
  must use functional notation. The temperature-increment conversions are done
  using units starting with 'deg' and they do not require functional notation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: tempF(45)
You want: tempC
        7.2222222
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: 45 degF
You want: degC
        * 25
        / 0.04
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Think of 'tempF( <i>x</i>)' not as a function but as a notation that indicates
  that <i>x</i> should have units of 'tempF' attached to it. See <i>Defining
  Nonlinear Units</i>. The first conversion shows that if it's 45 degrees
  Fahrenheit outside, it's 7.2 degrees Celsius. The second conversion indicates
  that a change of 45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to a change of 25 degrees
  Celsius. The conversion from 'tempF( <i>x</i>)' is to absolute temperature, so
  that
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: tempF(45)
You want: degR
        * 504.67
        / 0.0019814929
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
gives the same result as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: tempF(45)
You want: tempR
        * 504.67
        / 0.0019814929
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But if you convert 'tempF( <i>x</i>)' to 'degC', the output is probably not what
  you expect:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: tempF(45)
You want: degC
        * 280.37222
        / 0.0035666871
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The result is the temperature in K, because 'degC' is defined as 'K', the
  Kelvin. For consistent results, use the 'temp <i>X</i>' units when converting
  to a temperature rather than converting a temperature increment.

Some other examples of nonlinear units are numerous different ring sizes and
  wire gauges, the grit sizes used for abrasives, the decibel scale, shoe size,
  scales for the density of sugar (e.g. baume). The standard data file also
  supplies units for computing the area of a circle and the volume of a sphere.
  See the standard units data file for more details. Wire gauges with multiple
  zeroes are signified using negative numbers where two zeroes is '-1'.
  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms 'g00', 'g000', and so on that are
  defined in the standard units data file.

You can compute the area of a circle using the nonlinear unit, 'circlearea'. You
  can also do this using the circularinch or circleinch. The next example shows
  two ways to compute the area of a circle with a five inch radius and one way

  LISTS: CONVERSION TO SUMS OF UNITS</a></h1>
Outside of the SI, it is sometimes desirable to convert a single unit to a sum
  of units&#x2014;for example, feet to feet plus inches. The conversion
  <i>from</i> sums of units was described in <i>Sums and Differences of
  Units</i> and is a simple matter of adding the units with the '+' sign:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
You want: ft
        * 12.28125
        / 0.081424936
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although you can similarly write a sum of units to convert <i>to</i>, the result
  will not be the conversion to the units in the sum, but rather the conversion
  to the particular sum that you have entered:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28125 ft
You want: ft + in + 1|8 in
        * 11.228571
        / 0.089058524
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The unit expression given at the 'You want:' prompt is equivalent to asking for
  conversion to multiples of '1 ft + 1 in + 1|8 in', which is 1.09375 ft, so the
  conversion in the previous example is equivalent to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28125 ft
You want: 1.09375 ft
        * 11.228571
        / 0.089058524
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In converting to a sum of units like miles, feet and inches, you typically want
  the largest integral value for the first unit, followed by the largest
  integral value for the next, and the remainder converted to the last unit. You
  can do this conversion easily with 'units' using a special syntax for lists of
  units. You must list the desired units in order from largest to smallest,
  separated by the semicolon (';') character:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28125 ft
You want: ft;in;1|8 in
        12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The conversion always gives integer coefficients on the units in the list,
  except possibly the last unit when the conversion is not exact:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28126 ft
You want: ft;in;1|8 in
        12 ft + 3 in + 3.00096 * 1|8 in
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The order in which you list the units is important:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 3 kg
You want: oz;lb
        105 oz + 0.051367866 lb
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: 3 kg
You want: lb;oz
        6 lb + 9.8218858 oz
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Listing ounces before pounds produces a technically correct result, but not a
  very useful one. You must list the units in descending order of size in order
  to get the most useful result.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ending a unit list with the separator ';' has the same effect as repeating the
  last unit on the list, so 'ft;in;1|8 in;' is equivalent to 'ft;in;1|8 in;1|8
  in'. With the example above, this gives
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28126 ft
You want: ft;in;1|8 in;
        12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in + 0.00096 * 1|8 in
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
in effect separating the integer and fractional parts of the coefficient for the
  last unit. If you instead prefer to round the last coefficient to an integer
  you can do this with the '--round' ('-r') option. With the previous example,
  the result is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28126 ft
You want: ft;in;1|8 in
        12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in (rounded down to nearest 1|8 in)
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you use the '-r' option, repeating the last unit on the list has no effect
  (e.g., 'ft;in;1|8 in;1|8 in' is equivalent to 'ft;in;1|8 in'), and hence
  neither does ending a list with a ';'. With a single unit and the '-r' option,
  a terminal ';' <i>does</i> have an effect: it causes 'units' to treat the
  single unit as a list and produce a rounded value for the single unit. Without
  the extra ';', the '-r' option has no effect on single unit conversions. This
  example shows the ouput using the '-r' option:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28126 ft
You want: in
        * 147.37512
        / 0.0067854058
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: 12.28126 ft
You want: in;
        147 in (rounded down to nearest in)
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each unit that appears in the list must be conformable with the first unit on
  the list, and of course the listed units must also be comformable with the
  <i>You have</i> unit that you enter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: meter
You want: ft;kg
             ^
conformability error
        ft = 0.3048 m
        kg = 1 kg
<div class="Pp"></div>
You have: meter
You want: lb;oz
conformability error
        1 m
        0.45359237 kg
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the first case, 'units' reports the disagreement between units appearing on
  the list. In the second case, 'units' reports disagreement between the unit
  you entered and the desired conversion. This conformability error is based on
  the first unit on the unit list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other common candidates for conversion to sums of units are angles and time:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 23.437754 deg
You want; deg;arcmin;arcsec
    23 deg + 26 arcmin + 15.9144 arcsec
<div class="Pp"></div>

        7 hr + 13 min + 54.84 sec
</pre>

<div class="Pp"></div>
In North America, recipes for cooking typically measure ingredients by volume,
  and use units that are not always convenient multiples of each other. Suppose
  that you have a recipe for 6 and you wish to make a portion for 1. If the
  recipe calls for 2&#x00A0;1/2 cups of an ingredient, you might wish to know
  the measurements in terms of measuring devices you have available, you could
  use 'units' and enter
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: (2+1|2) cup / 6
You want: cup;1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup;tbsp;tsp;1|2 tsp;1|4 tsp
        1|3 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, if a unit in a list begins with fraction of the form 1| <i>x</i> and
  its multiplier is an integer, the fraction is given as the product of the
  multiplier and the numerator; for example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 12.28125 ft
You want: ft;in;1|8 in;
        12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In many cases, such as the example above, this is what is wanted, but sometimes
  it is not. For example, a cooking recipe for 6 might call for 5&#x00A0;1/4 cup
  of an ingredient, but you want a portion for 2, and your 1-cup measure is not
  available; you might try
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: (5+1|4) cup / 3
You want: 1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup
        3|2 cup + 1|4 cup
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This result might be fine for a baker who has a 1&#x00A0;1/2-cup measure (and
  recognizes the equivalence), but it may not be as useful to someone with more
  limited set of measures, who does want to do additional calculations, and only
  wants to know ``How many 1/2-cup measures to I need to add?'' After all,
  that's what was actually asked. With the '--show-factor' option, the factor
  will not be combined with a unity numerator, so that you get
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: (5+1|4) cup / 3
You want: 1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup
        3 * 1|2 cup + 1|4 cup
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A user-specified fractional unit with a numerator other than 1 is never
  overridden, however&#x2014;if a unit list specifies '3|4 cup;1|2 cup', a
  result equivalent to 1&#x00A0;1/2 cups will always be shown as '2 * 3|4 cup'
  whether or not the '--show-factor' option is given.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some applications for unit lists may be less obvious. Suppose that you have a
  postal scale and wish to ensure that it's accurate at 1&#x00A0;oz, but have
  only metric calibration weights. You might try
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 1 oz
You want: 100 g;50 g; 20 g;10 g;5 g;2 g;1 g;
        20 g + 5 g + 2 g + 1 g + 0.34952312 * 1 g
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might then place one each of the 20&#x00A0;g, 5&#x00A0;g, 2&#x00A0;g, and
  1&#x00A0;g weights on the scale and hope that it indicates close to
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: 20 g + 5 g + 2 g + 1 g
You want: oz;
        0.98767093 oz
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Appending ';' to 'oz' forces a one-line display that includes the unit; here the
  integer part of the result is zero, so it is not displayed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A unit list such as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
cup;1|2&#x00A0;cup;1|3&#x00A0;cup;1|4&#x00A0;cup;tbsp;tsp;1|2&#x00A0;tsp;1|4&#x00A0;tsp
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
can be tedious to enter. The 'units' program provides shorthand names for some
  common combinations:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
hms         hours, minutes, seconds                
dms         angle: degrees, minutes, seconds       
time        years, days, hours, minutes and seconds
usvol       US cooking volume: cups and smaller    
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using these shorthands, or <i>unit list aliases</i>, you can do the following
  conversions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: anomalisticyear 
You want: time
        1 year + 25 min + 3.4653216 sec
You have: 1|6 cup
You want: usvol
        2 tbsp + 2 tsp
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You cannot combine a unit list alias with other units: it must appear alone at
  the 'You want:' prompt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can display the definition of a unit list alias by entering it at the 'You
  have:' prompt:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>

</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you specify compact output with '--compact', '--terse' or '-t' and perform
  conversion to a unit list, 'units' lists the conversion factors for each unit
  in the list, separated by semicolons.

<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <i>from-unit</i> and <i>to-unit</i> are omitted, then the program will
  use interactive prompts to determine which conversions to perform. See
  <i>Interactive Use</i>. If both <i>from-unit</i> and <i>to-unit</i> are given,
  'units' will print the result of that single conversion and then exit. If only
  <i>from-unit</i> appears on the command line, 'units' will display the

  YOUR OWN DEFINITIONS</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Units_Data_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Units_Data_Files">Units
  Data Files</a></h2>
The units and prefixes that 'units' can convert are defined in the units data
  file, typically '/usr/share/units/definitions.units'. Although you can extend
  or modify this data file if you have appropriate user privileges, it's usually
  better to put extensions in separate files so that the definitions will be
  preserved when you update 'units'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can include additional data files in the units database using the '!include'
  command in the standard units data file. For example
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
!include    /usr/local/share/units/local.units
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
might be appropriate for a site-wide supplemental data file. The location of the
  '!include' statement in the standard units data file is important; later
  definitions replace earlier ones, so any definitions in an included file will
  override definitions before the '!include' statement in the standard units
  data file. With normal invocation, no warning is given about redefinitions; to
  ensure that you don't have an unintended redefinition, run 'units&#x00A0;-c'
  after making changes to any units data file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to add your own units in addition to or in place of standard or
  site-wide supplemental units data files, you can include them in the '.units'
  file in your home directory. If this file exists it is read after the standard
  units data file, so that any definitions in this file will replace definitions
  of the same units in the standard data file or in files included from the
  standard data file. This file will not be read if any units files are
  specified on the command line. (Under Windows the personal units file is named
  'unitdef.units'.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'units' program first tries to determine your home directory from the 'HOME'
  environment variable. On systems running Microsoft Windows, if 'HOME' does not
  exist, 'units' attempts to find your home directory from 'HOMEDRIVE' and
  'HOMEPATH'. Running 'units -V' will display the location and name of your
  personal units file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can specify an arbitrary file as your personal units data file with the
  'MYUNITSFILE' environment variable; if this variable exists, its value is used
  without searching your home directory.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Defining_New_Units_and_Prefixes"><a class="selflink" href="#Defining_New_Units_and_Prefixes">Defining
  New Units and Prefixes</a></h2>
A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.
  Comments start with a '#' character, which can appear anywhere in a line. The
  backslash character ('\') acts as a continuation character if it appears as
  the last character on a line, making it possible to spread definitions out
  over several lines if desired. A file can be included by giving the command
  '!include' followed by the file's name. The '!' must be the first character on
  the line. The file will be sought in the same directory as the parent file
  unless you give a full path. The name of the file to be included cannot
  contain the comment character '#'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unit names must not contain any of the operator characters '+', '-', '*', '/',
  '|', '^', ';', '~', the comment character '#', or parentheses. They cannot
  begin or end with an underscore ('_'), a comma (',') or a decimal point ('.').
  Names cannot begin with a digit, and if a name ends in a digit other than
  zero, the digit must be preceded by a string beginning with an underscore, and
  afterwards consisting only of digits, decimal points, or commas. For example,
  'foo_2', 'foo_2,1', or 'foo_3.14' would be valid names but 'foo2' or 'foo_a2'
  would be invalid. You could define nitrous oxide as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
N2O     nitrogen 2  + oxygen
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
but would need to define nitrogen dioxide as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
NO_2    nitrogen + oxygen 2
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Be careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads to
  the primitive units, which are marked with '!' characters. Dimensionless units
  are indicated by using the string '!dimensionless' for the unit definition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When adding new units, be sure to use the '-c' option to check that the new
  units reduce properly. If you create a loop in the units definitions, then
  'units' will hang when invoked with the '-c' option. You will need to use the
  '--check-verbose' option, which prints out each unit as it is checked. The
  program will still hang, but the last unit printed will be the unit that
  caused the infinite loop.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you define any units that contain '+' characters, carefully check them
  because the '-c' option will not catch non-conformable sums. Be careful with
  the '-' operator as well. When used as a binary operator, the '-' character
  can perform addition or multiplication depending on the options used to invoke
  'units'. To ensure consistent behavior use '-' only as a unary negation
  operator when writing units definitions. To multiply two units leave a space
  or use the '*' operator with care, recalling that it has two possible
  precedence values and may require parentheses to ensure consistent behavior.
  To compute the difference of 'foo' and 'bar' write 'foo+(-bar)' or even
  'foo+-bar'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an example of a short data file that defines some basic units:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
m       !               # The meter is a primitive unit
sec     !               # The second is a primitive unit
rad     !dimensionless  # A dimensionless primitive unit
micro-  1e-6            # Define a prefix
minute  60 sec          # A minute is 60 seconds
hour    60 min          # An hour is 60 minutes
inch    0.0254 m        # Inch defined in terms of meters
ft      12 inches       # The foot defined in terms of inches
mile    5280 ft         # And the mile
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A unit that ends with a '-' character is a prefix. If a prefix definition
  contains any '/' characters, be sure they are protected by parentheses. If you
  define 'half- 1/2' then 'halfmeter' would be equivalent to '1 / (2 meter)'.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Defining_Nonlinear_Units"><a class="selflink" href="#Defining_Nonlinear_Units">Defining
  Nonlinear Units</a></h2>
Some unit conversions of interest are nonlinear; for example, temperature
  conversions between the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales cannot be done by simply
  multiplying by conversion factors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you give a linear unit definition such as 'inch 2.54 cm' you are providing
  information that 'units' uses to convert values in inches into primitive units
  of meters. For nonlinear units, you give a functional definition that provides
  the same information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Nonlinear units are represented using a functional notation. It is best to
  regard this notation not as a function call but as a way of adding units to a
  number, much the same way that writing a linear unit name after a number adds
  units to that number. Internally, nonlinear units are defined by a pair of
  functions that convert to and from linear units in the data file, so that an
  eventual conversion to primitive units is possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
tempF(x) units=[1;K] (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; \
                     (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A nonlinear unit definition comprises a unit name, a dummy parameter name, two
  functions, and two corresponding units. The functions tell 'units' how to
  convert to and from the new unit. In order to produce valid results, the
  arguments of these functions need to have the correct dimensions. To
  facilitate error checking, you may optionally indicate units for these
  arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The definition begins with the unit name followed immediately (with no spaces)
  by a '(' character. In parentheses is the name of the parameter. Next is an
  optional specification of the units required by the functions in this
  definition. In the example above, the 'tempF' function requires an input
  argument conformable with '1'. For normal nonlinear units definitions the
  forward function will always take a dimensionless argument. The inverse
  function requires an input argument conformable with 'K'. In general the
  inverse function will need units that match the quantity measured by your
  nonlinear unit. The purpose of the expression in brackets to enable 'units' to
  perform error checking on function arguments, and also to assign units to
  range and domain specifications, which are described later.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next the function definitions appear. In the example above, the 'tempF' function
  is defined by
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This gives a rule for converting 'x' in the units 'tempF' to linear units of
  absolute temperature, which makes it possible to convert from tempF to other
  units.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to make conversions to Fahrenheit possible, you must give a rule for
  the inverse conversions. The inverse will be 'x(tempF)' and its definition
  appears after a ';' character. In our example, the inverse is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This inverse definition takes an absolute temperature as its argument and
  converts it to the Fahrenheit temperature. The inverse can be omitted by
  leaving out the ';' character, but then conversions to the unit will be
  impossible. If the inverse is omitted then the '--check' option will display a
  warning. It is up to you to calculate and enter the correct inverse function
  to obtain proper conversions. The '--check' option tests the inverse at one
  point and prints an error if it is not valid there, but this is not a
  guarantee that your inverse is correct.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you wish to make synonyms for nonlinear units, you still need to define both
  the forward and inverse functions. Inverse functions can be obtained using the
  '~' operator. So to create a synonym for 'tempF' you could write
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
fahrenheit(x) units=[1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may define a function whose range and domain do not cover all of the real
  numbers. In this case 'units' can handle errors better if you specify an
  appropriate range and domain. You specify the range and domain as shown below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
baume(d) units=[1;g/cm^3] domain=[0,130.5] range=[1,10] \
         (145/(145-d)) g/cm^3 ; (baume+-g/cm^3) 145 / baume
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example the domain is specified after the 'domain=' with the endpoints
  given in brackets. One of the end points can be omitted to get an interval
  that goes to infinity. So the range could be specified as nonnegative by
  writing 'range=[0,]'. Both the range and domain are optional and can appear
  independently and in any order along with the 'units' specification. The
  values in the range and domain are attached to the units given in the 'units'
  specification. If you don't specify the units then the parameter inputs are
  reduced to primitive units for the numeric comparison to the values you give
  in the range or domain. In this case you should only use 'range' or 'domain'
  if the endpoints are zero and infinity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Specifying the range and domain allows 'units' to perform better error checking
  and give more helpful error messages when you invoke nonlinear units
  conversions outside of their bounds. It also enables the '-c' option to find a
  point in the domain to use for its point check of your inverse definition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may occasionally wish to define a function that operates on units. This can
  be done using a nonlinear unit definition. For example, the definition below
  provides conversion between radius and the area of a circle. This definition
  requires a length as input and produces an area as output, as indicated by the
  'units=' specification. Specifying the range as the nonnegative numbers can
  prevent cryptic error messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
circlearea(r) units=[m;m^2] range=[0,]   pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sometimes you may be interested in a piecewise linear unit such as many wire
  gauges. Piecewise linear units can be defined by specifying conversions to
  linear units on a list of points. Conversion at other points will be done by
  linear interpolation. A partial definition of zinc gauge is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this example, 'zincgauge' is the name of the piecewise linear unit. The
  definition of such a unit is indicated by the embedded '[' character. After
  the bracket, you should indicate the units to be attached to the numbers in
  the table. No spaces can appear before the ']' character, so a definition like
  'foo[kg meters]' is illegal; instead write 'foo[kg*meters]'. The definition of
  the unit consists of a list of pairs optionally separated by commas. This list
  defines a function for converting from the piecewise linear unit to linear
  units. The first item in each pair is the function argument; the second item
  is the value of the function at that argument (in the units specified in
  brackets). In this example, we define 'zincgauge' at five points. For example,
  we set 'zincgauge(1)' equal to '0.002 in'. Definitions like this may be more
  readable if written using continuation characters as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
zincgauge[in] \
     1 0.002  \
    10 0.02   \
    15 0.04   \
    19 0.06   \
    23 0.1
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the preceding definition, the following conversion can be performed:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: zincgauge(10)
You want: in
    * 0.02
    / 50
You have: .01 inch
You want: zincgauge
    5
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you define a piecewise linear unit that is not strictly monotonic, then the
  inverse will not be well defined. If the inverse is requested for such a unit,
  'units' will return the smallest inverse. The '--check' option will print a
  warning if a non-monotonic piecewise linear unit is encountered.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Defining_Unit_List_Aliases"><a class="selflink" href="#Defining_Unit_List_Aliases">Defining
  Unit List Aliases</a></h2>
Unit list aliases are treated differently from unit definitions, because they
  are a data entry shorthand rather than a true definition for a new unit. A
  unit list alias definition begins with '!unitlist' and includes the alias and
  the definition; for example, the aliases included in the standard units data
  file are
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
!unitlist   hms     hr;min;sec
!unitlist   time    year;day;hr;min;sec
!unitlist   dms     deg;arcmin;arcsec
!unitlist   ftin    ft;in;1|8 in
!unitlist   usvol   cup;3|4 cup;2|3 cup;1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup;\
                    tbsp;tsp;1|2 tsp;1|4 tsp;1|8 tsp
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unit list aliases are only for unit lists, so the definition must include a ';'.
  Unit list aliases can never be combined with units or other unit list aliases,
  so the definition of 'time' shown above could <i>not</i> have been shortened
  to 'year;day;hms'. As usual, be sure to run 'units --check' to ensure that the
  units listed in unit list aliases are conformable.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NUMERIC_OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#NUMERIC_OUTPUT_FORMAT">NUMERIC
  OUTPUT FORMAT</a></h1>
By default, results of conversions are shown to eight significant figures; this
  can be changed with the '--exponential' and '--output-format' options. The
  former sets an exponential format (i.e., scientific notation) like that used
  in the original Unix 'units' program; the latter allows the format to be given
  as that of the printf function in the ANSI&#x00A0;C standard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format recognized with the '--output-format' option is a subset of that for
  printf(). Only a floating-point format of the form '%'[
  <i>flag</i>][<i>width</i>]['.'<i>precision</i>]<i>type</i> is allowed: it must
  begin with '%', and must end with a floating-point type specifier ('E' or 'e'
  for scientific notation, 'f' for fixed-point decimal, or 'G' or 'g' to specify
  the number of significant figures). The format specification may include one
  optional flag ('+', '-', '#', or a space), followed by an optional value for
  the minimum field width, and an optional precision specification that begins
  with a period (e.g., '.6'). In addition to the digits, the field width
  includes the decimal point, the exponent, and the sign if any of these are
  shown. A width specification is typically used with fixed-point decimal to
  have columns of numbers align at the decimal point; it normally is not useful
  with 'units'. Non-floating-point type specifiers make no sense for 'units',
  and are forbidden.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default format is '%.8g'; for greater precision, you could specify '-o
  %.15g'. The 'G' and 'g' formats use exponential format whenever the exponent
  would be less than -5, so the value 0.000013 displays as '1.3e-005'. If you
  prefer fixed-point display, you might specify '-o %.8f'; however, very small
  numbers may display very few significant figures, and for very small numbers,
  may show nothing but zeros.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the documentation for printf() for more detailed descriptions of the format
  specification.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOCALIZATION"><a class="selflink" href="#LOCALIZATION">LOCALIZATION</a></h1>
Some units have different values in different locations. The localization
  feature accommodates this by allowing a units data file to specify definitions
  that depend on the user's locale.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Locale"><a class="selflink" href="#Locale">Locale</a></h2>
A locale is a subset of a user's environment that indicates the user's language
  and country, and some attendant preferences, such as the formatting of dates.
  The 'units' program attempts to determine the locale from the POSIX setlocale
  function; if this cannot be done, 'units' examines the environment variables
  'LC_CTYPE' and 'LANG'. On POSIX systems, a locale is of the form
  <i>language</i>'_' <i>country</i>, where <i>language</i> is the two-character
  code from ISO 639-1 and <i>country</i> is the two-character code from ISO
  3166-1; <i>language</i> is lower case and <i>country</i> is upper case. For
  example, the POSIX locale for the United Kingdom is 'en_GB'.

On systems running Microsoft Windows, the value returned by setlocale() is
  different from that on POSIX systems; 'units' attempts to map the Windows
  value to a POSIX value by means of a table in the file 'locale.map' in the
  same directory, typically '/usr/local/share/units', as the default units data
  files. The file includes entries for many combinations of language and
  country, and can be extended to include other combinations. The 'locale.map'
  comprises two tab-separated columns; each entry is of the form
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
<i>Windows-locale</i>   <i>POSIX-locale</i>
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>POSIX-locale</i> is as described above, and <i>Windows-locale</i>
  typically spells out both the language and country. For example, the entry for
  the United States is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
English_United States   en_US
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can force 'units' to run in a desired locale by using the '-l' option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to create unit definitions for a particular locale you begin a block of
  definitions in a unit datafile with '!locale' followed by a locale name. The
  '!' must be the first character on the line. The 'units' program reads the
  following definitions only if the current locale matches. You end the block of
  localized units with '!endlocale'. Here is an example, which defines the
  British gallon.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
!locale en_GB
gallon       4.54609 liter
!endlocale
</pre>
<br/>

Sometimes the locale isn't sufficient to determine unit preferences. There could
  be regional preferences, or a company could have specific preferences. Though
  probably uncommon, such differences could arise with the choice of English
  customary units outside of English-speaking countries. To address this,
  'units' allows specifying definitions that depend on environment variable
  settings. The environment variables can be controled based on the current
  locale, or the user can set them to force a particular group of definitions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A conditional block of definitions in a units data file begins with either
  '!var' or '!varnot' following by an environment variable name and then a space
  separated list of values. The leading '!' must appear in the first column of a
  units data file, and the conditional block is terminated by '!endvar'.
  Definitions in blocks beginning with '!var' are executed only if the
  environment variable is exactly equal to one of the listed values. Definitions
  in blocks beginning with '!varnot' are executed only if the environment
  variable does <i>not</i> equal any of the list values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The inch has long been a customary measure of length in many places. The word
  comes from the latin <i>uncia</i> meaning ``one twelfth,'' referring to its
  relationship with the foot. By the 20th century, the inch was officially
  defined in English-speaking countries relative to the yard, but until 1959,
  the yard differed slightly among those countries. In France the customary
  inch, which was displaced in 1799 by the meter, had a different length based
  on a french foot. These customary definitions could be accomodated as follows:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
!var INCH_UNIT usa 
yard          3600|3937 m
!endvar
!var INCH_UNIT canada
yard          0.9144 meter
!endvar
!var INCH_UNIT uk
yard          0.91439841 meter
!endvar
!var INCH_UNIT canada uk usa
foot          1|3 yard
inch          1|12 foot
!endvar
!var INCH_UNIT france
foot          144|443.296 m
inch          1|12 foot
line          1|12 inch
!endvar
!varnot INCH_UNIT usa uk france canada
!message Unknown value for INCH_UNIT
!endvar
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When 'units' reads the above definitions it will check the environment variable
  'INCH_UNIT' and load only the definitions for the appropriate section. If
  'INCH_UNIT' is unset or is not set to one of the four values listed then
  'units' will run the last block. In this case that block uses the '!message'
  command to display a warning message. Alternatively that block could set
  default values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to create default values that are overridden by user settings the data
  file can use the '!set' command, which sets an environment variable <i>only if
  it is not already set</i>; these settings are only for the current 'units'
  invocation and do not persist. So if the example above were preceded by '!set
  INCH_UNIT france' then this would make 'france' the default value for
  'INCH_UNIT'. If the user had set the variable in the environment before
  invoking 'units', then 'units' would use the user's value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To link these settings to the user's locale you combine the '!set' command with
  the '!locale' command. If you wanted to combine the above example with
  suitable locales you could do by <i>preceding</i> the above definition with
  the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
!locale en_US
!set INCH_UNIT usa
!endlocale
!locale en_GB
!set INCH_UNIT uk
!endlocale
!locale en_CA
!set INCH_UNIT canada
!endlocale
!locale fr_FR
!set INCH_UNIT france
!endlocale
!set INCH_UNIT france
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These definitions set the overall default for 'INCH_UNIT' to 'france' and set
  default values for four locales appropriately. The overall default setting
  comes last so that it only applies when 'INCH_UNIT' was not set by one of the
  other commands or by the user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the variable given after '!var' or '!varnot' is undefined then 'units' prints
  an error message and ignores the definitions that follow. Use '!set' to create
  defaults to prevent this situation from arising. The '-c' option only checks
  the definitions that are active for the current environment and locale, so
  when adding new definitions take care to check that all cases give rise to a
  well defined set of definitions.

The 'units' program uses the following environment variables:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>HOME</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the location of your home directory; it is used
      by 'units' to find a personal units data file '.units'. On systems running
      Microsoft Windows, 'units' tries to determine your home directory from the
      'HOMEDRIVE' and 'HOMEPATH' environment variables if 'HOME' does not
    exist.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>LC_CTYPE, LANG</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Checked to determine the locale if 'units' cannot obtain it
      from the operating system. Sections of the standard units data file are
      specific to certain locales.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>MYUNITSFILE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies your personal units data file. If this variable
      exists, 'units' uses its value rather than searching your home directory
      for '.units'. The personal units file will not be loaded if any data files
      are given using the '-f' option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>PAGER</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the pager to use for help and for displaying the
      conformable units. The help function browses the units database and calls
      the pager using the '+n' <i>n</i> syntax for specifying a line number. The
      default pager is 'more'; 'PAGER' can be used to specify alternatives such
      as 'less', 'pg', 'emacs', or 'vi'.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>UNITS_ENGLISH</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set to either 'US' or 'GB' to choose United States or
      British volume definitions, overriding the default from your locale.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>UNITSFILE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies the units data file to use (instead of the
      default). You can only specify a single units data file using this
      environment variable. If units data files are given using the '-f' option,
      the file specified by 'UNITSFILE' will be not be loaded unless the '-f'
      option is given with the empty string
      ('units&#x00A0;-f&#x00A0;&quot;&quot;').</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UNICODE_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#UNICODE_SUPPORT">UNICODE

The standard units data file is written in Unicode using the UTF-8 encoding.
  Portions of the file that are not plain ASCII begin with '!utf8' and end with
  '!endutf8'. As usual, the '!' must appear as the first character on the line.
  If a line of a data file contains byte sequences that are invalid UTF-8 or
  non-printing UTF-8 then 'units' ignores the entire line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When 'units' runs it checks the locale to determine the character set. If UTF-8
  is listed, then 'units' reads the utf8 definitions. If any other character set
  is in use, then 'units' works in plain ASCII without support for extended
  characters.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="READLINE_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#READLINE_SUPPORT">READLINE
  SUPPORT</a></h1>
If the 'readline' package has been compiled in, then when 'units' is used
  interactively, numerous command line editing features are available. To check
  if your version of 'units' includes 'readline', invoke the program with the
  '--version' option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For complete information about 'readline', consult the documentation for the
  'readline' package. Without any configuration, 'units' will allow editing in
  the style of emacs. Of particular use with 'units' are the completion
  commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you type a few characters and then hit <i>ESC</i> followed by ' <i>?</i>'
  then 'units' will display a list of all the units that start with the
  characters typed. For example, if you type ' <i>metr</i>' and then request
  completion, you will see something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
<pre>
You have: metr
metre             metriccup         metrichorsepower  metrictenth
metretes          metricfifth       metricounce       metricton
metriccarat       metricgrain       metricquart       metricyarncount
You have: metr
</pre>
<br/>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is a unique way to complete a unitname, you can hit the <i>TAB</i> key
  and 'units' will provide the rest of the unit name. If 'units' beeps, it means
  that there is no unique completion. Pressing the <i>TAB</i> key a second time
  will print the list of all completions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UPDATING_CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_RATES"><a class="selflink" href="#UPDATING_CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_RATES">UPDATING
  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES</a></h1>
The units program includes currency exchange rates and prices for some precious
  metals in the database. Of course, these values change over time, sometimes
  very rapidly, and 'units' cannot provide real time values. To update the
  exchange rates run the 'units_cur', which rewrites the files containing the
  currency rates, typically '/usr/local/share/units/currency.units'. This
  program must be run with suitable permissions to write the file. To keep the
  rates updated automatically, it could be run by a cron job on a Unix-like
  system, or a similar scheduling program on a different system. Currency
  exchange rates are taken from Time Genie (http://www.timegenie.com) and
  precious metals pricing from Packetizer (www.packetizer.com). These sites
  update once per day, so there is no benefit in running the update script more
  often than daily. You can run 'units_cur' with a filename specified on the
  command line and it will write the data to that file. If you give '-' for the
  file it will write to standard output.
