<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Sun Grid Engine Checkpointing - the Sun Grid Engine
checkpointing mechanism and checkpointing support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Sun Grid Engine supports two levels of checkpointing: the
user level and a operating system provided transparent
level. User level checkpointing refers to applications,
which do <br>
their own checkpointing by writing restart files at certain
times or algorithmic steps and by properly processing these
restart files when restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transparent checkpointing has to
be provided by the operating system and is usually
integrated in the operating system kernel. An example for a
kernel integrated checkpointing <br>
facility is the Hibernator package from Softway for SGI IRIX
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checkpointing jobs need to be
identified to the Sun Grid Engine system by using the -ckpt
option of the qsub1() command. The argument to this flag
refers to a so called check&acirc; <br>
pointing environment, which defines the attributes of the
checkpointing method to be used (see checkpoint5() for
details). Checkpointing environments are setup by the
qconf1() <br>
options -ackpt, -dckpt, -mckpt and -sckpt. The qsub1()
option -c can be used to overwrite the when attribute for
the referenced checkpointing environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a queue is of the type
CHECKPOINTING, jobs need to have the checkpointing attribute
flagged (see the -ckpt option to qsub1()) to be permitted to
run in such a queue. As <br>
opposed to the behavior for regular batch jobs,
checkpointing jobs are aborted under conditions, for which
batch or interactive jobs are suspended or even stay
unaffected. These <br>
conditions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Explicit
suspension of the queue or job via qmod1() by the cluster
administration or a queue owner if the x occasion specifier
(see qsub1() -c and checkpoint5()) was assigned <br>
to the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A load average
value exceeding the suspend threshold as configured for the
corresponding queues (see queue_conf5().)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Shutdown of the
Sun Grid Engine execution daemon sge_execd8() being
responsible for the checkpointing job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After abortion, the jobs will
migrate to other queues unless they were submitted to one
specific queue by an explicit user request. The migration of
jobs leads to a dynamic load <br>
balancing. Note: The abortion of checkpointed jobs will free
all resources (memory, swap space) which the job occupies at
that time. This is opposed to the situation for sus&acirc;
<br>
pended regular jobs, which still cover swap space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
When a job migrates to a queue on another machine at present
no files are transferred automatically to that machine. This
means that all files which are used throughout the <br>
entire job including restart files, executables and scratch
files must be visible or transferred explicitly (e.g. at the
beginning of the job script).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are also some practical
limitations regarding use of disk space for transparently
checkpointing jobs. Checkpoints of a transparently
checkpointed application are usually <br>
stored in a checkpoint file or directory by the operating
system. The file or directory contains all the text, data,
and stack space for the process, along with some additional
<br>
control information. This means jobs which use a very large
virtual address space will generate very large checkpoint
files. Also the workstations on which the jobs will actually
<br>
execute may have little free disk space. Thus it is not
always possible to transfer a transparent checkpointing job
to a machine, even though that machine is idle. Since large
<br>
virtual memory jobs must wait for a machine that is both
idle, and has a sufficient amount of free disk space, such
jobs may suffer long turnaround times.</p>
