Sun Grid Engine Checkpointing - the Sun Grid Engine checkpointing mechanism and
  checkpointing support
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Sun Grid Engine supports two levels of checkpointing: the user level and a
  operating system provided transparent level. User level checkpointing refers
  to applications, which do their own checkpointing by writing restart files at
  certain times or algorithmic steps and by properly processing these restart
  files when restarted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Transparent checkpointing has to be provided by the operating system and is
  usually integrated in the operating system kernel. An example for a kernel
  integrated checkpointing facility is the Hibernator package from Softway for
  SGI IRIX platforms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Checkpointing jobs need to be identified to the Sun Grid Engine system by using
  the <i>-ckpt</i> option of the command. The argument to this flag refers to a
  so called checkpointing environment, which defines the attributes of the
  checkpointing method to be used (see for details). Checkpointing environments
  are setup by the options <i>-ackpt</i>, <i>-dckpt</i>, <i>-mckpt</i> and
  <i>-sckpt</i>. The option <i>-c</i> can be used to overwrite the <i>when</i>
  attribute for the referenced checkpointing environment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a queue is of the type CHECKPOINTING, jobs need to have the checkpointing
  attribute flagged (see the <b>-ckpt</b> option to to be permitted to run in
  such a queue. As opposed to the behavior for regular batch jobs, checkpointing
  jobs are aborted under conditions, for which batch or interactive jobs are
  suspended or even stay unaffected. These conditions are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Explicit suspension of the queue or job via by the cluster
      administration or a queue owner if the <i>x</i> occasion specifier (see
      <i>-c</i> and was assigned to the job.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A load average value exceeding the suspend threshold as
      configured for the corresponding queues (see</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Shutdown of the Sun Grid Engine execution daemon being
      responsible for the checkpointing job.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After abortion, the jobs will migrate to other queues unless they were submitted
  to one specific queue by an explicit user request. The migration of jobs leads
  to a dynamic load balancing. <b>Note:</b> The abortion of checkpointed jobs
  will free all resources (memory, swap space) which the job occupies at that
  time. This is opposed to the situation for suspended regular jobs, which still
  cover swap space.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESTRICTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</a></h1>
When a job migrates to a queue on another machine at present no files are
  transferred automatically to that machine. This means that all files which are
  used throughout the entire job including restart files, executables and
  scratch files must be visible or transferred explicitly (e.g. at the beginning
  of the job script).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are also some practical limitations regarding use of disk space for
  transparently checkpointing jobs. Checkpoints of a transparently checkpointed
  application are usually stored in a checkpoint file or directory by the
  operating system. The file or directory contains all the text, data, and stack
  space for the process, along with some additional control information. This
  means jobs which use a very large virtual address space will generate very
  large checkpoint files. Also the workstations on which the jobs will actually
  execute may have little free disk space. Thus it is not always possible to
  transfer a transparent checkpointing job to a machine, even though that
  machine is idle. Since large virtual memory jobs must wait for a machine that
  is both idle, and has a sufficient amount of free disk space, such jobs may
  suffer long turnaround times.
