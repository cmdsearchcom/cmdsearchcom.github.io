<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
getData - retrieves databases from the Internet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
getData [ --mirrordir &lt;path&gt; ] &lt;list of db
names&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getData --list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Bioinformatics has the intrinsic problem to bring the
biological data to the end user. Astronomers have the
equivalent problem and particle physicists, well, they haven
come up <br>
with (first) the web and (second) the computational grids to
address their problems. Debian helps with the programs but
will not provide such huge datasets that are even <br>
frequently updated - not even in volatile.debian.org. Most
bioinformatics researchers will not need too many of such
databases. And even more so will gladly continue in using
<br>
public services remotely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those who need a set of
databases on a regular basis, this script shall be a start
to automate the burden to download the data and update
indices and the like. The world has <br>
seen such magic before with the Lion Biosciences Prisma tool
(http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/4/389.pdf) but
how about something simpler (as a start) that at least <br>
gets close to what we desire and is Free. The aim must be to
address the needs of all (most) communities, not only of the
bioinformatics world. The seed was hence made with <br>
databases from astronomy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please contact the Debian-Med
community if you consider this program to be almost ready
for your needs and explain what still needs to be added.
Public databases that you managed <br>
to integrate with this system are also very warmly welcomed
as feedback.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--help <br>
this help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--man <br>
Present a more detailed description in form of a man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Say one or two words more than required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mirrordir &lt;path&gt; <br>
Specifies destination directory. The data will be mirrored
to the folder $mirrordir/$dbname/. Please be aware that this
mirrordir is nowhere stored. The directory can <br>
consequently be moved to arbitrary locations at any time, if
the users of the data are only informed about that
moving.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list <br>
Lists all databases that may be requested to be
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;list of db names&gt; <br>
Only those databases that are explicitly requested to be
downloaded will be downloaded. Such databases may require
considerable bandwidth, so please make sure you know you
<br>
are doing the right thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--post <br>
Perform only the unpacking/indexing, but do not
retrieve/update the databases. This option is considered
useful when adding a new database management system to the
system, <br>
e.g. after installing EMBOSS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source <br>
Perform only the unpacking/indexing, but do not
retrieve/update the databases. This option may be beneficial
when the site administator is aware of current analyses that
<br>
should not be disturbed by the indexing process but the
downloading from the net can already be started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--confd &lt;directory&gt; <br>
Allows for the specification of a directory in which
multiple files can be stored that will be read by getData
upon its invocation. These may add values to the global <br>
variable %toBeMirrored that specifies the databases and
their download scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--config &lt;system&gt; <br>
Preparation of the configuration file that would be reuired
for a particular system that deals with the database. The
configuration is printed to stdout and is expected to be
<br>
copied manually to the proper file or folder. One could
imagine this process to be automated, though this is not yet
implemented. Currently available is support for two <br>
systems:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">emboss This specifies the EMBOSS
suite of tools for bioinformatics (www.emboss.org) that is
also available as a Debian package. The configuration for
the Uniprot databases <br>
will allow the sequence retrieval with the seqret tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dre - ARC Grid Runtime
Environment <br>
Runtime environments (REs) are a concept of the ARC grid
middleware of which more can be learned on
http://www.nordugrid.org. A script is needed to indicate the
<br>
presence of a runtime environment. Here, the name of the
script is important, which is not definable by getData
though since it only writes to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, the configuration
was not yet be found to be modularised. It all needs to
happen within the getData script itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove &lt;list of dbnames&gt;
<br>
This command removes folders that store the data. In
principle this could be perfomed manually, though some
databases may have special requirements pre- or
post-removal, <br>
which can be specified individually for every database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFICATION OF DATABASES <br>
Databases for download and their post-processing are
specified at two different locations. One is the getData
script itself, the other are files stored in /etc/getData.d.
<br>
Either will define elements of a considerably large hash.
The key is the identifier which is also shown by the
&rsquo;getData --list&rsquo; directive. The value is a
reference to another <br>
hash, which assigns values to all the properties that a
database has for its download and post-processing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name - a human-readable
pretty-printed name or short description that makes clear to
the world what this database is about. <br>
A bad example is the mere assignment of &quot;DE405&quot;,
which few people understand. A better example is
&quot;Pfam-A : Manually curated protein families and
domains, only the seed is <br>
presented.&quot;. One could argue that one should have that
field renamed to &quot;description&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source - shell commands to
perform the initial download and subsequent updates <br>
Commonly the wget tool is used for download. The such
presented little script is executed underneath the mirrordir
directory. One simple example is &quot;wget --mirror <br>

ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/unix/unxp2[01]*.405&quot;.
With increasing proficiency in using wget, one is tempted to
substitute &quot;--mirror&quot; with &quot;--recursive <br>
--no-host-directories --no-directories --level 1
--no-parent&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">post-download - shell commands
to perform after the data has been downloaded. <br>
A simple (and unnecessary when used the right flags to wget)
example is the mere setting of a symbolic link:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;post-download&quot; =&gt;
&quot;ln -s ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/unix/unxp*.405
.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some more effort has been put
into TrEMBL for the merging of releases with subsequent
updates and the indexing for EMBOSS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;d=uncompressed; if [ ! -d
]; then mkdir ; fi; &quot; <br>
.&quot;rm -rf /trembl.dat; &quot; <br>
.&quot;(find ftp.ebi.ac.uk -name &rsquo;*.dat.gz&rsquo; |
xargs -r zcat ) &gt; /trembl.dat; &quot; <br>
.&quot;[ -x /usr/bin/dbxflat ] &quot; <br>
. &quot;&amp;&amp; cd &amp;&amp; &quot; <br>
. &quot;dbxflat -dbresource embl -dbname trembllocal
-idformat swiss -filenames=trembl.dat -fields id,acc
-auto&quot;,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dots are connecting strings
in Perl. This helps the readability of the code. When
writing these scripts, please be aware the newlines
don&rsquo;t separate the individual <br>
commands here. Semicolon are required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recommends - suggests a series
of packages to be present for the use of the database or the
performance of the indexing. <br>
This information is not used at the moment, also to render
this script more useful for other Linux distributions than
Debian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">getWgetOptions - private command
to get wget options <br>
This is used at download time by makefiles, is not intended
to be used interactively, and could be removed anytime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following will list the identifiers and the descriptions
of the first 4 databases that area available via getData on
your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./getData
--mirrordir=/local/databases/mirrored --list | head 4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To install any particular
database, only give its name as an argument. If the
installation is performed at another directory than the
default, then the --mirrordir needs again to <br>
be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./getData swiss.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To remove the database again,
give the script a hint with the --remove flag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./getData --remove swiss.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To perform the indexing only and
circumvent the download (attention, this is dangerous since
the index files will look newer than the database is),
do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./getData --post swiss.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special exception to these
extra scripts is the --config flag in that it takes a list
of extra arguments. Each shall denote a particular system
that this database may be of <br>
interest for. There are today two systems supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
We now need a mechanism with which packages can specify
hooks that shall be called upon an update of a database. But
we cannot assume that every indexing that can be performed
<br>
because of the installation of some package is also desired
by the user. How to configure this properly is left to be
decided.</p>
