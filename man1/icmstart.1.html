<p>icmstart(1) starts icmbuild program maintenance
icmstart(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
icmstart - A startup script for icmbuild program
maintenance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
icmstart [Options] top-dir [program|library]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Although icmake-scripts can be written from scratch for
handling program maintenance, often the required actions are
highly comparable. This observation resulted in the
construc&acirc; <br>
tion of two icmake-tools: icmstart(1), initializing a
directory for program development and icmbuild(1), handling
the actual program maintenance. Both come predefined with
<br>
icmake&acirc;s distribution, to initialize and maintain C++
programs (or, after minimal adaptation, C) programs). They
can also easily be tailored to other programming languages.
The <br>
icmstart script and icmbuild program can directly be called:
icmstart is an icmake script, for which the command-shell
calls icmake; icmbuild is a small C program that calls <br>
icmake to process the icmbuild script in (commonly)
/usr/lib/icmake.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This man-page covers the
icmstart script; refer to the icmbuild(1) man-page for
information about how icmbuild can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The icmstart script is a generic
script that can be used to initialize a directory with a
basic set of files that are commonly used when developing a
C++ or C program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Icmstart creates an initial
directory (here named &lsquo;top-dir&acirc;) and installs
the files CLASSES, VERSION and icmconf below top-dir. A
second argument &lsquo;program&acirc; or
&lsquo;library&acirc; may be <br>
specified as the default mode of operation of the
icmbuild(1) script, usually resulting in the addition of
additional skeleton source files. If the predefined set of
files <br>
doesn&acirc;t fit your needs, then the default set can
easily be tailored to your needs. The default set of
skeleton files is listed in the file
/etc/icmake/icmstart.rc. Refer to the <br>
icmstart.rc(7) man-page for information about how this file
is structured and how it can be adapted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After changing to the directory
created by icmstart icmbuild(1) may be used for program
maintenance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Icmstart supports the following options, which (when
specified) must be icmstart&acirc;s first arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -b <br>
Basic installation: the files VERSION, usage.cc and
version.cc are not installed, and the #define USE_VERSION
entry in icmconf is commented out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -c confpath <br>
Use the configuration files (icmstart.rc, AUTHOR, YEARS and
VERSION) if found in &lsquo;confpath&acirc; rather than in
~/.icmake and/or /etc/icmake/. Once a file is found it is
used <br>
allowing partial overrides of the default files provided by
icmake(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -d <br>
Do not execute any commands, but show the commands that
would have been executed on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -I <br>
Do not install files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -r Unconditionally replace
existing files. If -r is not provided icmstart will ask the
user to confirm that an existing file must be overwritten.
If a skeleton specifica&acirc; <br>
tion refers to a directory, the full directory and its
subdirectories will be replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o -s skeleton-path <br>
By default skeleton files are listed in the skeleton
resource file /usr/share/icmake/icmstart.rc. Alternatively,
the skeleton resource file may be specified by the ICM <br>
environment variable, which -in turn- may be overruled by
the path specified with the -s option. The skeleton path may
be specified as a full file-path or as a directory, <br>
in which case the skeleton resource file is assumed to be
icmstart.rc (see below at SKELETON FILES). Since icmstart
uses cp to install files, cp must be available when <br>
icmstart should install skeleton files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SKELETON FILES <br>
Skeleton resource files may contain comment (empty lines and
lines beginning with the hash-mark (#)) which is ignored,
and should otherwise contain specifications of resource s
<br>
to install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default resource
specification file is /etc/icmake/icmstart.rc,
containing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLASSES <br>
icmconf <br>
P main.cc <br>
P main.ih <br>
P usage.cc <br>
P version.cc <br>
P ? scanner <br>
P ? parser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file is overruled by
~/.icmake/icmstart.rc. The ~/.icmake directory (called
&lsquo;configuration directory&acirc; below) can be prepared
using the following system command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp -r /etc/icmake ~/.icmake</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directory can be provided
with skeleton files. Default skeleton files are commonly
found in /usr/share/icmake, and could be copied to the
configuration directory and <br>
referred to by the configuration directory&acirc;s file
icmstart.rc. See icmstart.rc(7) for details about how
skeleton files can be referred to icmstart.rc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
The configuration directory&acirc;s files icmstart.rc,
AUTHOR, YEARS and VERSION are recognized as skeleton files
and are, if available, processed by icmstart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c option was specified
configuration files found in the path specified at this
option are used. If not specified or if a file isn&acirc;t
found then the path ~/icmake is <br>
inspected. If a configuration file isn&acirc;t found in
~/icmake either, configuration files in /etc/icmake are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration files are
optional; if absent icmstart can still be used, but in
normal cases at least icmstart.rc is provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to icstart.rc
consider defining the files AUTHOR, VERSION, and YEARS in
the configuration directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If the file AUTHOR exists it
should have one line, defining the author of the program.
E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define AUTHOR &quot;Frank B.
Brokken &lt;f.b.brokken@rug.nl&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it does not exist icmstart
uses the default #define AUTHOR &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If the file VERSION exists it
should have one line, defining the program&acirc;s version.
E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define VERSION
&quot;1.00.00&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it does not exist icmstart
uses the default #define VERSION &quot;0.00.00&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o If the file YEARS exists it
should have one line, defining the program&acirc;s initial
release year or range of release years. E.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define YEARS
&quot;2016&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or a range of years can be
defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define YEARS
&quot;1992-2016&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If it does not exist icmstart
uses the default #define YEARS &quot;yyyy&quot; where yyyy
is the current year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AUTHOR, VERSION, and YEARS
definitions are concatenated to one file, called VERSION,
which is installed in the top-level directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the file icmstart.rc does not
exist (or is empty) icmstart merely installs the top-level
directory, icmconf and VERSION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The mentioned paths are sugestive only and may be
installation dependent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o /usr/share/icmake/icmconf
Example of a icmbuild configuration file;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o /usr/share/icmake/CLASSES
Example of a icmbuild CLASSES file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o /etc/icmake/icmstart.rc
Default skeleton resource file.</p>
