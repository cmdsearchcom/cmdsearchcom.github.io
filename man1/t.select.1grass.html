<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
t.select performs selection of maps that are registered in
space time datasets using temporal algebra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROGRAM USE <br>
The module expects an expression as input parameter in the
following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;result =
expression&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The statement structure is
similar to r.mapcalc, see r.mapcalc. Where result represents
the name of a space time dataset (STDS)that will contain the
result of the calculation <br>
that is given as expression on the right side of the
equality sign. These expression can be any valid or nested
combination of temporal operations and functions that are
pro&acirc; <br>
vided by the temporal algebra. <br>
The temporal algebra works with space time datasets of any
type (STRDS, STR3DS and STVDS). The algebra provides methods
for map selection from STDS based on their temporal
rela&acirc; <br>
tions. It is also possible to temporally shift maps, to
create temporal buffer and to snap time instances to create
a valid temporal topology. Furthermore expressions can be
<br>
nested and evaluated in conditional statements (if, else
statements). Within if-statements the algebra provides
temporal variables like start time, end time, day of year,
time <br>
differences or number of maps per time interval to build up
conditions. These operations can be assigned to space time
datasets or to the results of operations between space time
<br>
datasets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The type of the input space time
datasets must be defined with the input parameter type.
Possible options are STRDS, STVDS or STR3DS. The default is
set to space time raster <br>
datasets (STRDS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As default, topological
relationships between space time datasets will be evaluated
only temporal. Use the s flag to activate the additionally
spatial topology evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expression option must be
passed as quoted expression, for example: <br>
t.select expression=&quot;C = A : B&quot; <br>
Where C is the new space time raster dataset that will
contain maps from A that are selected by equal temporal
relationships to the existing dataset B in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL ALGEBRA <br>
The temporal algebra provides a wide range of temporal
operators and functions that will be presented in the
following section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL RELATIONS <br>
Several temporal topology relations between registered maps
of space time datasets are supported: <br>
equals A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
during A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
contains A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
starts A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
started A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
finishs A ---- <br>
B ------ <br>
finished A ------ <br>
B ---- <br>
precedes A ---- <br>
B ---- <br>
follows A ---- <br>
B ---- <br>
overlapped A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
overlaps A ------ <br>
B ------ <br>
over booth overlaps and overlapped <br>
The relations must be read as: A is related to B, like - A
equals B - A is during B - A contains B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Topological relations must be
specified in {} parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL OPERATORS <br>
The temporal algebra defines temporal operators that can be
combined with other operators to perform spatio-temporal
operations. The temporal operators process the time <br>
instances and intervals of two temporal related maps and
calculate the result temporal extent by five different
possibilities. <br>
LEFT REFERENCE l Use the time stamp of the left space time
dataset <br>
INTERSECTION i Intersection <br>
DISJOINT UNION d Disjoint union <br>
UNION u Union <br>
RIGHT REFERENCE r Use the time stamp of the right space time
dataset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEMPORAL SELECTION <br>
The temporal selection simply selects parts of a space time
dataset without processing raster or vector data. The
algebra provides a selection operator : that selects parts
of a <br>
space time dataset that are temporally equal to parts of a
second one by default. The following expression <br>
C = A : B <br>
means: Select all parts of space time dataset A that are
equal to B and store it in space time dataset C. The parts
are time stamped maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition the inverse
selection operator !: is defined as the complement of the
selection operator, hence the following expression <br>
C = A !: B <br>
means: select all parts of space time time dataset A that
are not equal to B and store it in space time dataset (STDS)
C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select parts of a STDS by
different topological relations to other STDS, the temporal
topology selection operator can be used. The operator
consists of the temporal selection <br>
operator, the topological relations, that must be separated
by the logical OR operator | and the temporal extent
operator. All three parts are separated by comma and
surrounded <br>
by curly braces: <br>
{&quot;temporal selection operator&quot;, &quot;topological
relations&quot;, &quot;temporal operator&quot;} <br>
Examples: <br>
C = A {:, equals} B <br>
C = A {!:, equals} B <br>
We can now define arbitrary topological relations using the
OR operator &quot;|&quot; to connect them: <br>
C = A {:,equals|during|overlaps} B <br>
Select all parts of A that are equal to B, during B or
overlaps B. <br>
In addition we can define the temporal extent of the result
STDS by adding the temporal operator. <br>
C = A {:, during,r} B <br>
Select all parts of A that are during B and use the temporal
extents from B for C. <br>
The selection operator is implicitly contained in the
temporal topology selection operator, so that the following
statements are exactly the same: <br>
C = A : B <br>
C = A {:} B <br>
C = A {:,equal} B <br>
C = A {:,equal,l} B <br>
Same for the complementary selection: <br>
C = A !: B <br>
C = A {!:} B <br>
C = A {!:,equal} B <br>
C = A {!:,equal,l} B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS <br>
Selection operations can be evaluated within conditional
statements. <br>
Note A and B can either be space time datasets or
expressions. The temporal <br>
relationship between the conditions and the conclusions can
be defined at the <br>
beginning of the if statement. The relationship between then
and else conclusion <br>
must be always equal. <br>
if statement decision option temporal relations <br>
if(if, then, else) <br>
if(conditions, A) A if conditions are True; temporal
topological relation between if and then is equal. <br>
if(conditions, A, B) A if conditions are True, B otherwise;
temporal topological relation between if, then and else is
equal. <br>
if(topologies, conditions, A) A if conditions are True;
temporal topological relation between if and then is
explicit specified by topologies. <br>
if(topologies, conditions, A, B) A if conditions are True, B
otherwise; temporal topological relation between if, then
and else is explicit specified by topologies. <br>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to
evaluate space time datasets. Specific values of temporal
variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated
for <br>
each map of the STDS. <br>
Important: The conditions are evaluated from left to
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comparison operator <br>
The conditions are comparison expressions that are used to
evaluate space time datasets. Specific values of temporal
variables are compared by logical operators and evaluated
for <br>
each map of the STDS and the related maps. For complex
relations the comparison operator can be used to combine
conditions: <br>
The structure is similar to the select operator with the
extension of an aggregation operator: {&quot;comparison
operator&quot;, &quot;topological relations&quot;,
aggregation operator, &quot;temporal <br>
operator&quot;} <br>
This aggregation operator (| or &amp;) define the behaviour
if a map is related the more than one map, e.g for the
topological relations &acirc;contains&acirc;. Should all
(&amp;) conditions for <br>
the related maps be true or is it sufficient to have any (|)
condition that is true. The resulting boolean value is then
compared to the first condition by the comparison
opera&acirc; <br>
tor (|| or &amp;&amp;). As default the aggregation operator
is related to the comparison operator: <br>
Comparison operator -&gt; aggregation operator: <br>
|| -&gt; | and &amp;&amp; -&gt; &amp; <br>
Examples: <br>
Condition 1 {||, equal, r} Condition 2 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|contains, |, l} Condition 2
<br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
&amp;&amp; Condition 3 <br>
Condition 1 {&amp;&amp;, equal|during, l} Condition 2
{&amp;&amp;,contains, |, r} Condition 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash operator <br>
Additionally the number of maps in intervals can be computed
and used in conditional statements with the hash (#)
operator. <br>
A{#, contains}B <br>
This expression computes the number of maps from space time
dataset B which are during the time intervals of maps from
space time dataset A. <br>
A list of integers (scalars) corresponding to the maps of A
that contain maps from B will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C = if({equal}, A {#, contains}
B &gt; 2, A {:, contains} B) <br>
This expression selects all maps from A that temporally
contains at least 2 maps from B and stores them in space
time dataset C. The leading equal statement in the if
condition <br>
specifies the temporal relation between the if and then part
of the if expression. This is very important, so we do not
need to specify a global time reference (a space time <br>
dataset) for temporal processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore the temporal algebra
allows temporal buffering, shifting and snapping with the
functions buff_t(), tshift() and tsnap() respectively. <br>
buff_t(A, size) Buffer STDS A with granule (&quot;1
month&quot; or 5) <br>
tshift(A, size) Shift STDS A with granule (&quot;1
month&quot; or 5) <br>
tsnap(A) Snap time instances and intervals of STDS A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single map with temporal extent
<br>
The temporal algebra can also handle single maps with time
stamps in the map function. <br>
tmap() <br>
For example: <br>
C = A {:,during} tmap(event) <br>
This statement select all maps from space time data set A
that are during the temporal extent of single map
&acirc;event&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
Select all maps from space time dataset A which have equal
time stamps with space time dataset B and C and are earlier
that Jan. 1. 2005 and store them in space time dataset D.
<br>
D = if(start_date(A) &lt; &quot;2005-01-01&quot;, A : B : C)
<br>
Select all maps from space time dataset A which contains
more than three maps of space time dataset B, else select
maps from C with time stamps that are not equal to A and
store <br>
them in space time dataset D. <br>
D = if(A {#, contains} B &gt; 3, A {:, contains} B, C) <br>
Select all maps from space time dataset B which are during
the temporal buffered space time dataset A with a map
interval of three days, else select maps from C and store
them in <br>
space time dataset D. <br>
D = if(contains, td(buff_t(A, &quot;1 days&quot;)) == 3, B,
C)</p>
