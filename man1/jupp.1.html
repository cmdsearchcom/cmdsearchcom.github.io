JOE is a powerful ASCII-text screen editor. It has a &quot;mode-less&quot; user
  interface which is similar to many user-friendly PC editors. Users of
  Micro-Pro's WordStar or Borland's &quot;Turbo&quot; languages will feel at
  home. JOE is a full featured UNIX screen-editor though, and has many features
  for editing programs and text.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
JOE also emulates several other editors. JSTAR is a close imitation of WordStar
  with many &quot;JOE&quot; extensions. JPICO is a close imitation of the Pine
  mailing system's PICO editor, but with many extensions and improvements. JMACS
  is a GNU-EMACS imitation. RJOE is a restricted version of JOE, which allows
  you to edit only the files specified on the command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Although JOE is actually six different editors, it still requires only one
  executable, but one with six different names. The name of the editor with an
  &quot;rc&quot; appended gives the name of JOE's initialisation file, which
  determines the personality of the editor.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
JUPP is free software; you can distribute it and/or modify it under the terms of
  the GNU General Public License, Version 1, as published by the Free Software
  Foundation. (main.c contains more detailed exceptions.) I have no plans for
  turning JOE into a commercial or share-ware product. See the source code for
  exact authorship and licencing information. JOE is available over the Internet
  from <b>http://joe-editor.sf.net/</b>. JUPP is available at
  <b>http://mirbsd.de/jupp</b>.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Usage"><a class="selflink" href="#Usage">Usage</a></h1>
To start the editor, type <b>joe</b> followed by zero or more names of files you
  want to edit. Each file name may be preceded by a local option setting (see
  the local options table which follows). Other global options, which apply to
  the editor as a whole, may also be placed on the command line (see the global
  options table which follows). If you are editing a new file, you can either
  give the name of the new file when you invoke the editor, or in the editor
  when you save the new file. A modified syntax for file names is provided to
  allow you to edit program output, standard input/output, or sections of files
  or devices. See the section <b>Filenames</b> below for details.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On cygwin32 systems, the special option <b>-CYGhack</b> is replaced by anything
  that comes past it (and separating whitespace) on the command line as
  <i>one</i> option (to work around a Cygwin bug as it cannot correctly be
  passed a UNC pathname with spaces as one argument from Explorer <i>at
  all</i>).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Once you are in the editor, you can type in text and use special
  control-character sequences to perform other editing tasks. To find out what
  the control-character sequences are, read the rest of this man page or type
  <b>^K H</b> for help in the editor.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Now for some obscure computer-lore:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>^</b> means that you hold down the <b>Control</b> key while pressing the
  following key (the same way the <b>Shift</b> key works for uppercase letters).
  A number of control-key sequences are duplicated on other keys, so that you
  don't need to press the control key: <b>ESC</b> will work in place of
  <b>^[</b>, <b>Del</b> will work in place of <b>^?</b>, <b>Backspace</b> will
  work in place of <b>^H</b>, <b>Tab</b> will work in place of <b>^I</b>,
  <b>Return</b> or <b>Enter</b> will work in place of <b>^M</b> and
  <b>Linefeed</b> will work in place of <b>^J</b>. Some keyboards may give you
  trouble with some control keys. <b>^_</b>, <b>^^</b> and <b>^@</b> can usually
  be entered without pressing shift (I.E., try <b>^-</b>, <b>^6</b> and
  <b>^2</b>). Other keyboards may reassign these to other keys. Try: <b>^.</b>,
  <b>^,</b> and <b>^/</b>. <b>^SPACE</b> can usually be used in place of
  <b>^@</b>. <b>^\</b> and <b>^]</b> are interpreted by many communication
  programs, including telnet and kermit. Usually you just hit the key twice to
  get it to pass through the communication program.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Once you have typed <b>^K H</b>, the first help window appears at the top of the
  screen. You can continue to enter and edit text while the help window is on.
  To page through other topics, hit ^[, and ^[. (that is, ESC , and ESC .). Use
  <b>^K H</b> to dismiss the help window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can customise the keyboard layout, the help screens and a number of behavior
  defaults by copying JOE's initialisation file (usually <b>/etc/jupp/joerc</b>)
  to <b>.joerc</b> in your home directory and then by modifying it. See the
  section <b>joerc</b> below. The filename is actually
  <b>.</b><i>name</i><b>rc</b> where <i>name</i> is the <b>argv[0]</b> the
  editor is called with.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Custom syntax files are loaded from <b>.jupp/syntax/</b><i>name</i><b>.jsf</b>
  in your home directory and <b>.jupp/charmaps/</b><i>name</i> holds custom
  charmaps ( <i>name</i> here is the name of the syntax or charmap).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To have JOE used as your default editor for e-mail and News, you need to set the
  <b>EDITOR</b> and <b>VISUAL</b> environment variables in your shell
  initialisation file ( <b>.cshrc</b> or <b>.profile</b>) to refer to JOE (the
  joe binary usually resides as <b>/usr/bin/joe</b>).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are a number of other obscure invocation parameters which may have to be
  set, particularly if your terminal screen is not updating as you think it
  should. See the section <b>Environment variables</b> below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Command_Line_Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Command_Line_Options">Command

These options can also be specified in the joerc file. They can be set depending
  on the file-name extension. Programs (.c, .h or .p extension) usually have

  disabled.

  Editing</a></h2>
When you type characters into the editor, they are normally inserted into the
  file being edited (or appended to the file if the cursor is at the end of the
  file). This is the normal operating mode of the editor. If you want to replace
  some existing text, you have to delete the old text before or after you type
  in the replacement text. The <b>Backspace</b> key can be used for deleting
  text: move the cursor to right after the text you want to delete and hit
  <b>Backspace</b> a number of times.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hit the <b>Enter</b> or <b>Return</b> key to insert a line-break. For example,
  if the cursor was in the middle of a line and you hit <b>Return</b>, the line
  would be split into two lines with the cursor appearing at the beginning of
  the second line. Hit <b>Backspace</b> at the beginning of a line to eliminate
  a line-break.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Use the arrow keys to move around the file. If your keyboard doesn't have arrow
  keys (or if they don't work for some reason), use <b>^F</b> to move forwards
  (right), <b>^B</b> to move backwards (left), <b>^P</b> to move to the previous
  line (up), and <b>^N</b> to move to the next line (down). The right and left
  arrow keys simply move forwards or backwards one character at a time through
  the text: if you're at the beginning of a line and you press left-arrow, you
  will end up at the end of the previous line. The up and down arrow keys move
  forwards and backwards by enough characters so that the cursor appears in the
  same column that it was in on the original line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want to indent the text you enter, you can use the <b>TAB</b> key. This
  inserts a special control character which makes the characters which follow it
  begin at the next TAB STOP. TAB STOPS normally occur every 8 columns, but this
  can be changed with the <b>^T D</b> command. PASCAL and C programmers often
  set TAB STOPS on every 4 columns.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If for some reason your terminal screen gets messed up (for example, if you
  receive a mail notice from biff), you can have the editor refresh the screen
  by hitting <b>^R</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are many other keys for deleting text and moving around the file. For
  example, hit <b>^D</b> to delete the character the cursor is on instead of
  deleting backwards like <b>Backspace</b>. <b>^D</b> will also delete a
  line-break if the cursor is at the end of a line. Type <b>^Y</b> to delete the
  entire line the cursor is on or <b>^J</b> to delete just from the cursor to
  the end of the line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Hit <b>^A</b> to move the cursor to the beginning of the line it's on. Hit
  <b>^E</b> to move the cursor to the end of the line. Hit <b>^U</b> or
  <b>^V</b> for scrolling the cursor up or down 1/2 a screen's worth.
  &quot;Scrolling&quot; means that the text on the screen moves, but the cursor
  stays at the same place relative to the screen. Hit <b>^K U</b> or <b>^K V</b>
  to move the cursor to the beginning or the end of the file. Look at the help
  screens in the editor to find even more delete and movement commands.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you make a mistake, you can hit <b>^_</b> to &quot;undo&quot; it. On most
  keyboards you hit just <b>^-</b> to get <b>^_</b>, but on some you might have
  to hold both the <b>Shift</b> and <b>Control</b> keys down at the same time to
  get it. If you &quot;undo&quot; too much, you can &quot;redo&quot; the changes
  back into existence by hitting <b>^^</b> (type this with just <b>^6</b> on
  most keyboards).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you were editing in one place within the file, and you then temporarily had
  to look or edit some other place within the file, you can get back to the
  original place by hitting <b>^K -</b>. This command actually returns you to
  the last place you made a change in the file. You can step through a history
  of places with <b>^K -</b> and <b>^K =</b>, in the same way you can step
  through the history of changes with the &quot;undo&quot; and &quot;redo&quot;
  commands.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When you are done editing the file, hit <b>^K X</b> to exit the editor. You will
  be prompted for a file name if you hadn't already named the file you were
  editing.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When you edit a file, you actually edit only a copy of the file. So if you
  decide that you don't want the changes you made to a file during a particular
  edit session, you can hit <b>^C</b> to exit the editor without saving them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you edit a file and save the changes, a &quot;backup&quot; copy of that file
  is created in the current directory, with a ~ appended to the name, which
  contains the original version of the file.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Word_wrap_and_formatting"><a class="selflink" href="#Word_wrap_and_formatting">Word
  wrap and formatting</a></h2>
If you type past the right edge of the screen in a C language or PASCAL file,
  the screen will scroll to the right to follow the cursor. If you type past the
  right edge of the screen in a normal file (one whose name doesn't end in .c,
  .h or .p), JOE will automatically wrap the last word onto the next line so
  that you don't have to hit <b>Return</b>. This is called word-wrap mode.
  Word-wrap can be turned on or off with the <b>^T W</b> command. JOE's
  initialisation file is usually set up so that this mode is automatically
  turned on for all non-program files. See the section below on the <b>joerc</b>
  file to change this and other defaults.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Aside for Word-wrap mode, JOE does not automatically keep paragraphs formatted
  like some word-processors. Instead, if you need a paragraph to be reformatted,
  hit <b>^K J</b>. This command &quot;fills in&quot; the paragraph that the
  cursor is in, fitting as many words in a line as is possible. A paragraph, in
  this case, is a block of text separated above and below by a blank line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The margins which JOE uses for paragraph formatting and word-wrap can be set
  with the <b>^T L</b> and <b>^T R</b> commands. If the left margin is set to a
  value other than 1, then when you start typing at the beginning of a line, the
  cursor will immediately jump to the left margin.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want to center a line within the margins, use the <b>^K A</b> command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Over-type_mode"><a class="selflink" href="#Over-type_mode">Over-type
  mode</a></h2>
Sometimes it's tiresome to have to delete old text before or after you insert
  new text. This happens, for example, when you are changing a table and you
  want to maintain the column position of the right side of the table. When this
  occurs, you can put the editor in over-type mode with <b>^T T</b>. When the
  editor is in this mode, the characters you type in replace existing
  characters, in the way an idealised typewriter would. Also, <b>Backspace</b>
  simply moves left instead of deleting the character to the left, when it's not
  at the end or beginning of a line. Over-type mode is not the natural way of
  dealing with text electronically, so you should go back to insert-mode as soon
  as possible by typing <b>^T T</b> again.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to insert while you're in over-type mode, hit <b>^@</b>. This
  inserts a single SPACE into the text.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Control_and_Meta_characters"><a class="selflink" href="#Control_and_Meta_characters">Control
  and Meta characters</a></h2>
Each character is represented by a number. For example, the number for 'A' is 65
  and the number for '1' is 49. All of the characters which you normally see
  have numbers in the range of 32 - 126 (this particular arbitrary assignment
  between characters and numbers is called the ASCII character set). The numbers
  outside of this range, from 0 to 255, aren't usually displayed, but sometimes
  have other special meanings. The number 10, for example, is used for the
  line-breaks. You can enter these special, non-displayed <b>control
  characters</b> by first hitting <b>`</b> and then hitting a character in the
  range <b>@ A B C ... X Y Z [ ^ ] \ _</b> to get the number 0 - 31, and ? to
  get 127. For example, if you hit <b>` J</b>, you'll insert a line-break
  character, or if you hit <b>` I</b>, you'll insert a TAB character (which does
  the same thing the TAB key does). A useful control character to enter is 12 (
  <b>` L</b>), which causes most printers to advance to the top of the page.
  You'll notice that JOE displays this character as an underlined L. You can
  enter the characters above 127, the <b>meta characters</b>, by first hitting
  <b>^\</b>. This adds 128 to the next (possibly control) character entered. JOE
  displays characters above 128 in inverse-video. Some foreign languages, which
  have more letters than English, use the meta characters for the rest of their
  alphabet. You have to put the editor in <b>ASIS</b> mode (described later) to
  have these passed untranslated to the terminal.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Prompts"><a class="selflink" href="#Prompts">Prompts</a></h2>
If you hit <b>TAB</b> at any file name prompt, joe will attempt to complete the
  name you entered as much as possible. If it couldn't complete the entire name,
  because there are more than one possible completions, joe beeps. If you hit
  <b>TAB</b> again, joe list the completions. You can use the arrow keys to move
  around this directory menu and press RETURN or SPACE to select an item. If you
  press the first letter of one of the directory entries, it will be selected,
  or if more than one entry has the same first letter, the cursor will jump
  between those entries. If you select a subdirectory or .., the directory name
  is appended to the prompt and the new directory is loaded into the menu. You
  can hit Backspace to go back to the previous directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Most prompts record a history of the responses you give them. You can hit up and
  down arrow to step through these histories.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Prompts are actually single line windows with no status line, so you can use any
  editing command that you normally use on text within the prompts. The prompt
  history is actually just other lines of the same &quot;prompt file&quot;. Thus
  you can can search backwards though the prompt history with the normal
  <b>^K</b> <b>F</b> command if you want.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Since prompts are windows, you can also switch out of them with <b>^K P</b> and
  <b>^K N</b>.

Hit <b>^K SPACE</b> to have JOE report the line number, column number, and byte
  number on the last line of the screen. The number associated with the
  character the cursor is on (its ASCII code) is also shown. You can have the
  line number and/or column number always displayed on the status line by
  setting placing the appropriate escape sequences in the status line setup
  strings. Edit the joerc file for details.

If you need to temporarily stop the editor and go back to the shell, hit <b>^K
  Z</b>. You might want to do this to stop whatever you're editing and answer an
  e-mail message or read this man page, for example. You have to type <b>fg</b>

Some examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Suppose you have a list of addresses, each on a separate line, which starts with
  &quot;Address:&quot; and has each element separated by commas. Like so:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Address: S. Holmes, 221b Baker St., London, England
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you wanted to rearrange the list, to get the country first, then the city,
  then the person's name, and then the address, you could do this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Type <b>^K F</b> to start the search, and type:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Address:\*,\*,\*,\*\$</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
to match &quot;Address:&quot;, the four comma-separated elements, and then the
  end of the line. When asked for options, you would type <b>r</b> to replace
  the string, and then type:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>Address:\3,\2,\0,\1</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To shuffle the information the way you want it. After hitting return, the search
  would begin, and the sample line would be changed to:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Address: England, London, S. Holmes, 221b Baker St.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Blocks"><a class="selflink" href="#Blocks">Blocks</a></h2>
If you want to move, copy, save or delete a specific section of text, you can do
  it with highlighted blocks. First, move the cursor to the start of the section
  of text you want to work on, and press <b>^K B</b>. Then move the cursor to
  the character just after the end of the text you want to affect and press
  <b>^K K</b>. The text between the <b>^K B</b> and <b>^K K</b> should become
  highlighted. Now you can move your cursor to someplace else in your document
  and press <b>^K M</b> to move the highlighted text there. You can press <b>^K
  C</b> to make a copy of the highlighted text and insert it to where the cursor
  is positioned. <b>^K Y</b> to deletes the highlighted text. <b>^K W</b>,
  writes the highlighted text to a file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A very useful command is <b>^K /</b>, which filters a block of text through a
  unix command. For example, if you select a list of words with <b>^K B</b> and
  <b>^K K</b>, and then type <b>^K / sort</b>, the list of words will be sorted.
  Another useful unix command for <b>^K /</b>, is <b>tr</b>. If you type <b>^K /
  tr a-z A-Z</b>, then all of the letters in the highlighted block will be
  converted to uppercase.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
After you are finished with some block operations, you can just leave the
  highlighting on if you don't mind it (of course, if you accidentally hit <b>^K
  Y</b> without noticing...). If it really bothers you, however, just hit <b>^K
  B ^K K</b>, to turn the highlighting off.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Indenting_program_blocks"><a class="selflink" href="#Indenting_program_blocks">Indenting
  program blocks</a></h2>
Auto-indent mode toggled with the <b>^T I</b> command. The <b>joerc</b> is
  normally set up so that files with names ending with .p, .c or .h have
  auto-indent mode enabled. When auto-indent mode is enabled and you hit
  <b>Return</b>, the cursor will be placed in the same column that the first
  non-SPACE/TAB character was in on the original line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can use the <b>^K ,</b> and <b>^K .</b> commands to shift a block of text to
  the left or right. If no highlighting is set when you give these commands, the
  program block the cursor is located in will be selected, and will be moved by
  subsequent <b>^K ,</b> and <b>^K .</b> commands. The number of columns these
  commands shift by can be set through a <b>^T</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Windows"><a class="selflink" href="#Windows">Windows</a></h2>
You can edit more than one file at the same time or edit two or more different
  places of the same file. To do this, hit <b>^K O</b>, to split the screen into
  two windows. Use <b>^K P</b> or <b>^K N</b> to move the cursor into the top
  window or the lower window. Use <b>^K E</b> to edit a new file in one of the
  windows. A window will go away when you save the file with <b>^K X</b> or
  abort the file with <b>^C</b>. If you abort a file which exists in two
  windows, one of the window goes away, not the file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can hit <b>^K O</b> within a window to create even more windows. If you have
  too many windows on the screen, but you don't want to eliminate them, you can
  hit <b>^K I</b>. This will show only the window the cursor is in, or if there
  was only one window on the screen to begin with, try to fit all hidden windows
  on the screen. If there are more windows than can fit on the screen, you can
  hit <b>^K N</b> on the bottom-most window or <b>^K P</b> on the top-most
  window to get to them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you gave more than one file name to JOE on the command line, each file will
  be placed in a different window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can change the height of the windows with the <b>^K G</b> and <b>^K T</b>
  commands.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Keyboard_macros"><a class="selflink" href="#Keyboard_macros">Keyboard
  macros</a></h2>
Macros allow you to record a series of keystrokes and replay them with the press
  of two keys. This is useful to automate repetitive tasks. To start a macro
  recording, hit <b>^K [</b> followed by a number from 0 to 9. The status line
  will display (Macro n recording...). Now, type in the series of keystrokes
  that you want to be able to repeat. The commands you type will have their
  usual effect. Hit <b>^K ]</b> to stop recording the macro. Hit <b>^K</b>
  followed by the number you recorded the macro in to execute one iteration of
  the key-strokes.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, if you want to put &quot;**&quot; in front of a number of lines,
  you can type:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>^K [ ^A ** </b>&lt;down arrow&gt; <b>^K ]</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Which starts the macro recording, moves the cursor to the beginning of the line,
  inserts &quot;**&quot;, moves the cursor down one line, and then ends the
  recording. Since we included the key-strokes needed to position the cursor on
  the next line, we can repeatedly use this macro without having to move the
  cursor ourselves, something you should always keep in mind when recording a
  macro.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you find that the macro you are recording itself has a repeated set of
  key-strokes in it, you can record a macro within the macro, as long as you use
  a different macro number. Also you can execute previously recorded macros from
  within new macros.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Repeat"><a class="selflink" href="#Repeat">Repeat</a></h2>
You can use the repeat command, <b>^K \</b>, to repeat a macro, or any other
  edit command or even a normal character, a specified number of times. Hit
  <b>^K \</b>, type in the number of times you want the command repeated and
  press <b>Return</b>. The next edit command you now give will be repeated that
  many times.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, to delete the next 20 lines of text, type:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>^K &#x00A0;20</b>&lt;return&gt;<b>^Y</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Rectangle_mode"><a class="selflink" href="#Rectangle_mode">Rectangle
  mode</a></h2>
Type <b>^T X</b> to have <b>^K B</b> and <b>^K K</b> select rectangular blocks
  instead of stream-of-text blocks. This mode is useful for moving, copying,
  deleting or saving columns of text. You can also filter columns of text with
  the <b>^K /</b> command- if you want to sort a column, for example. The insert
  file command, <b>^K R</b> is also effected.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When rectangle mode is selected, over-type mode is also useful ( <b>^T T</b>).
  When over-type mode is selected, rectangles will replace existing text instead
  of getting inserted before it. Also the delete block command ( <b>^K Y</b>)
  will clear the selected rectangle with SPACEs and TABs instead of deleting it.
  Over-type mode is especially useful for the filter block command ( <b>^K
  /</b>), since it will maintain the original width of the selected column.

If you are editing a large C program with many source files, you can use the
  <b>ctags</b> program to generate a <b>tags</b> file. This file contains a list
  of program symbols and the files and positions where the symbols are defined.
  The <b>^K ;</b> command can be used to lookup a symbol (functions, defined
  constants, etc.), load the file where the symbol is defined into the current
  window and position the cursor to where the symbol is defined. <b>^K ;</b>
  prompts you for the symbol you want, but uses the symbol the cursor was on as
  a default. Since <b>^K ;</b> loads the definition file into the current
  window, you probably want to split the window first with <b>^K O</b>, to have
  both the original file and the definition file loaded.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Shell_windows"><a class="selflink" href="#Shell_windows">Shell
  windows</a></h2>
Hit <b>^K '</b> to run a command shell in one of JOE's windows. When the cursor
  is at the end of a shell window (use <b>^K V</b> if it's not), whatever you
  type is passed to the shell instead of the window. Any output from the shell
  or from commands executed in the shell is appended to the shell window (the
  cursor will follow this output if it's at the end of the shell window). This
  command is useful for recording the results of shell commands- for example the
  output of <b>make</b>, the result of <b>grep</b>ping a set of files for a
  string, or directory listings from <b>FTP</b> sessions. Besides typeable
  characters, the keys ^C, Backspace, DEL, Return and ^D are passed to the
  shell. Type the shell <b>exit</b> command to stop recording shell output. If
  you press <b>^C</b> in a shell window, when the cursor is not at the end of
  the window, the shell is <b>kill</b>ed.

For JOE to operate correctly, a number of other environment settings must be
  correct. The throughput (baud rate) of the connection between the computer and
  your terminal must be set correctly for JOE to update the screen smoothly and
  allow typeahead to defer the screen update. Use the <b>stty</b> <b>nnn</b>
  command to set this. You want to set it as close as possible to actual
  throughput of the connection. For example, if you are connected via a 1200
  baud modem, you want to use this value for <b>stty</b>. If you are connected
  via 14.4k modem, but the terminal server you are connected to connects to the
  computer a 9600 baud, you want to set your speed as 9600 baud. The special
  baud rate of 38400 or <b>extb</b> is used to indicate that you have a
  very-high speed connection, such as a memory mapped console or an X-window
  terminal emulator. If you can't use <b>stty</b> to set the actual throughput
  (perhaps because of a modem communicating with the computer at a different
  rate than it's communicating over the phone line), you can put a numeric value
  in the <b>BAUD</b> environment variable instead (use <b>setenv</b> <b>BAUD
  9600</b> for csh or <b>BAUD=9600; export BAUD</b> for sh).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>SHELL</b> or <b>EXECSHELL</b> environment variable must be set to the
  full pathname of a shell executable that accepts the -i (interactive) and -c
  (run a command) arguments of the Korn Shell; otherwise, <b>/bin/sh</b> is
  used.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>TERM</b> environment variable must be set to the type of terminal you're
  using. If the size (number of lines/columns) of your terminal is different
  from what is reported in the TERMCAP or TERMINFO entry, you can set this with
  the <b>stty rows nn cols nn</b> command, or by setting the <b>LINES</b> and
  <b>COLUMNS</b> environment variables.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>xterm-xfree86</b> terminal allows automatic entering and leaving of the
  bracketed paste mode.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>JOETERM</b> environment variable may be set to override the regular
  <b>TERM</b> environment variable for specifying your terminal type.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
JOE uses two character maps for its operation: the terminal I/O character map,
  which determines how characters are sent to the terminal and whether the %a/%A
  message specifiers use Unicode, and the file encoding, which can be specified
  per file using the <b>-encoding</b> option and changed with the <b>^T E</b>
  command, and which defaults to the terminal I/O character map, which, in turn,
  is determined from the current locale, if the system supports such, otherwise
  the <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LANG</b> environment variables (if
  they contain a period, only the part after it and before an optional &quot;at
  sign&quot; is used); on cygwin32 before 1.7.2, the codepage is used instead if
  the POSIX locale environment variables are empty; the environment variable
  <b>JOECHARMAP</b> can be used to manually force one overriding all methods
  described above, and can be used together with <b>-encoding</b> to specify a
  different default file character map.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
JOE normally expects that flow control between the computer and your terminal to
  use ^S/^Q handshaking (I.E., if the computer is sending characters too fast
  for your terminal, your terminal sends ^S to stop the output and ^Q to restart
  it). If the flow control uses out-of-band or hardware handshaking or if your
  terminal is fast enough to always keep up with the computer output and you
  wish to map ^S/^Q to edit commands, you can set the environment variable
  <b>NOXON</b> to have JOE attempt to turn off ^S/^Q handshaking. If the
  connection between the computer and your terminal uses no handshaking and your
  terminal is not fast enough to keep up with the output of the computer, you
  can set the environment variable <b>DOPADDING</b> to have <b>JOE</b> slow down
  the output by interspersing PAD characters between the terminal screen update
  sequences.

Wherever JOE expects you to enter a file name, whether on the command line or in
  prompts within the editor, you may also type:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>!command</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Read or write data to or from a shell command. For example,
      use <b>joe '!ls'</b> to get a copy of your directory listing to edit or
      from within the editor use <b>^K D !mail jhallen@world.std.com</b> to send
      the file being edited to me.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&gt;&gt;filename</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use this to have JOE append the edited text to the end of
      the file &quot;filename.&quot;

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>filename,START,SIZE</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use this to access a fixed section of a file or device.
      <b>START</b> and <b>SIZE</b> may be entered in decimal (ex.: 123) octal
      (ex.: 0777) or hexadecimal (ex.: 0xFF). For example, use <b>joe
      /dev/fd0,508,2</b> to edit bytes 508 and 509 of the first floppy drive in
      Linux.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use this to get input from the standard input or to write

      about your low quota.

<b>^T</b> options, the help screens and the key-sequence to editor command
  bindings are all defined in JOE's initialisation file. If you make a copy of
  this file (which normally resides in <b>/etc/jupp/joerc</b>) to
  <b>$HOME/.joerc</b>, you can customise these settings to your liking. The
  syntax of the initialisation file should be fairly obvious, and there are
  further instruction in it.

JOE was written by Joseph H. Allen. If you have bug reports or questions, e-mail
  them to jhallen@world.std.com. Larry Foard (entropy@world.std.com) and Gary
  Gray (ggray@world.std.com) also helped with the creation of JOE. Thorsten
  &quot;mirabilos&quot; Glaser (tg@mirbsd.org) created JUPP, and the 16-bit
  MS-DOS version of JUPP 2.8 was compiled by Andreas Totlis
  (atotlis@t-online.de).
