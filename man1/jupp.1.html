<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
JOE is a powerful ASCII-text screen editor. It has a
&quot;mode-less&quot; user interface which is similar to
many user-friendly PC editors. Users of Micro-Pro&rsquo;s
WordStar or Borland&rsquo;s <br>
&quot;Turbo&quot; languages will feel at home. JOE is a full
featured UNIX screen-editor though, and has many features
for editing programs and text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOE also emulates several other
editors. JSTAR is a close imitation of WordStar with many
&quot;JOE&quot; extensions. JPICO is a close imitation of
the Pine mailing system&rsquo;s PICO editor, <br>
but with many extensions and improvements. JMACS is a
GNU-EMACS imitation. RJOE is a restricted version of JOE,
which allows you to edit only the files specified on the
command <br>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although JOE is actually six
different editors, it still requires only one executable,
but one with six different names. The name of the editor
with an &quot;rc&quot; appended gives the <br>
name of JOE&rsquo;s initialisation file, which determines
the personality of the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JUPP is free software; you can
distribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License, Version 1, as published by the Free
Software Foundation. (main.c <br>
contains more detailed exceptions.) I have no plans for
turning JOE into a commercial or share-ware product. See the
source code for exact authorship and licencing information.
<br>
JOE is available over the Internet from
http://joe-editor.sf.net/. JUPP is available at
http://mirbsd.de/jupp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage <br>
To start the editor, type joe followed by zero or more names
of files you want to edit. Each file name may be preceded by
a local option setting (see the local options table <br>
which follows). Other global options, which apply to the
editor as a whole, may also be placed on the command line
(see the global options table which follows). If you are
<br>
editing a new file, you can either give the name of the new
file when you invoke the editor, or in the editor when you
save the new file. A modified syntax for file names is <br>
provided to allow you to edit program output, standard
input/output, or sections of files or devices. See the
section Filenames below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On cygwin32 systems, the special
option -CYGhack is replaced by anything that comes past it
(and separating whitespace) on the command line as one
option (to work around a Cygwin <br>
bug as it cannot correctly be passed a UNC pathname with
spaces as one argument from Explorer at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you are in the editor, you
can type in text and use special control-character sequences
to perform other editing tasks. To find out what the
control-character sequences <br>
are, read the rest of this man page or type ^K H for help in
the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now for some obscure
computer-lore:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ^ means that you hold down
the Control key while pressing the following key (the same
way the Shift key works for uppercase letters). A number of
control-key sequences are <br>
duplicated on other keys, so that you don&rsquo;t need to
press the control key: ESC will work in place of ^[, Del
will work in place of ^?, Backspace will work in place of
^H, Tab <br>
will work in place of ^I, Return or Enter will work in place
of ^M and Linefeed will work in place of ^J. Some keyboards
may give you trouble with some control keys. ^_, ^^ and <br>
^@ can usually be entered without pressing shift (I.E., try
^-, ^6 and ^2). Other keyboards may reassign these to other
keys. Try: ^., ^, and ^/. ^SPACE can usually be used in <br>
place of ^@. ^&nbsp;and ^] are interpreted by many
communication programs, including telnet and kermit. Usually
you just hit the key twice to get it to pass through the
communica&acirc; <br>
tion program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have typed ^K H, the
first help window appears at the top of the screen. You can
continue to enter and edit text while the help window is on.
To page through other <br>
topics, hit ^[, and ^[. (that is, ESC , and ESC .). Use ^K H
to dismiss the help window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can customise the keyboard
layout, the help screens and a number of behavior defaults
by copying JOE&rsquo;s initialisation file (usually
/etc/jupp/joerc) to .joerc in your home <br>
directory and then by modifying it. See the section joerc
below. The filename is actually .namerc where name is the
argv[0] the editor is called with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom syntax files are loaded
from .jupp/syntax/name.jsf in your home directory and
.jupp/charmaps/name holds custom charmaps (name here is the
name of the syntax or charmap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To have JOE used as your default
editor for e-mail and News, you need to set the EDITOR and
VISUAL environment variables in your shell initialisation
file (.cshrc or .profile) to <br>
refer to JOE (the joe binary usually resides as
/usr/bin/joe).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of other
obscure invocation parameters which may have to be set,
particularly if your terminal screen is not updating as you
think it should. See the section <br>
Environment variables below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Line Options <br>
The following global options may be specified on the command
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-asis Characters with codes
above 127 will be sent to the terminal as-is, instead of as
inverse of the corresponding character below 128. If this
does not work, check your ter&acirc; <br>
minal server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-backpath path <br>
If this option is given, backup files will be stored in the
specified directory instead of in each file&rsquo;s original
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-baud nnn <br>
Set the baud rate for the purposes of terminal screen
optimisation. Joe inserts delays for baud rates below 19200,
which bypasses tty buffering so that typeahead will <br>
interrupt the screen output. Scrolling commands will not be
used for 38400 baud. This is useful for X-terms and other
console ttys which really aren&rsquo;t going over a <br>
serial line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-beep Joe will beep on command
errors and when the cursor goes past extremes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-columns nnn <br>
Sets the number of screen columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-csmode <br>
Continued search mode: a search immediately following a
search will repeat the previous search instead of prompting
for new string. This is useful for the the ^[S and ^[R <br>
commands and for when joe is trying to be emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dopadding <br>
Joe usually assumes that there is some kind of flow control
between it and the tty. If there isn&rsquo;t, this option
will make joe output extra ^@s to the tty as specified by
<br>
the termcap entry. The extra ^@s allow the terminal to catch
up after long terminal commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exask This option makes ^KX
verify the file name that it&rsquo;s about to write.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force This option makes sure
that the last line of the file has a line-feed which
it&rsquo;s saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help The editor will start with
the help screen on if this option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keepup <br>
Normally the column number and control-key prefix fields of
the status lines are on a one second delay to reduce CPU
consumption, but with this option they are updated <br>
after each key-stroke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lightoff <br>
The block highlighting will go away after any block command
if this option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lines nnn <br>
Sets the number of screen lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-marking <br>
Text between ^KB and the cursor is highlighted (use with
-lightoff and a modified joerc file to have drop-anchor
style block selection).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mid If this option is set and
the cursor moves off the window, the window will be scrolled
so that the cursor is in the center. This option is forced
on slow terminals which <br>
don&rsquo;t have scrolling commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nobackups <br>
This option prevents backup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nonotice <br>
This option prevent the copyright notice from being
displayed when the editor starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nosta This option eliminates
the top-most status line. It&rsquo;s nice for when you only
want to see your text on the screen or if you&rsquo;re using
a vt52.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noxon Attempt to turn off ^S/^Q
processing. This is useful for when joe is trying to be
WordStar or EMACS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-orphan <br>
When this option is active, extra files on the command line
will be placed in orphaned buffers instead of in extra
windows. This is useful for when joe is trying to be <br>
emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pg nnn <br>
This specifies the number of lines to keep after PgUp/PgDn
(^U/^V). If -1 is given, half the window is kept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-skiptop nnn <br>
Don&rsquo;t use the top nnn lines of the screen. Useful for
when joe is used as a BBS editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these options may be
specified in the joerc file as well. In addition, the NOXON,
BAUD, LINES, COLUMNS and DOPADDING options may be specified
with environment variables. <br>
See the section Environment variables below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options may be
specified before each filename on the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+nnn The cursor starts on the
specified line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crlf Joe uses CR-LF as the end
of line sequence instead of just LF. This is for editing
MS-DOS or VMS files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hex Sets the buffer to hex edit
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wordwrap <br>
Joe wraps the previous word when you type past the right
margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-autoindent <br>
When you hit Return on an indented line, the indentation is
duplicated onto the new line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-overwrite <br>
Typing overwrites existing characters instead of inserting
before them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lmargin nnn <br>
Sets the left margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rmargin nnn <br>
Sets the right margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tab nnn <br>
Sets the tab width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-indentc nnn <br>
Sets the indentation character for ^K, and ^K. (32 for
SPACE, 9 for TAB).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-istep nnn <br>
Sets the indentation step for ^K, and ^K..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linums <br>
Line numbers are displayed before each line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rdonly <br>
The file is read only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-keymap name <br>
Use an alternate section of the joerc file for the key
sequence bindings. For example, joe, jstar, rjoe and jupp
support -keymap cua to make ^Z, ^X, ^C and ^V do the same
<br>
thing as in contemporary GUI editors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options can also be
specified in the joerc file. They can be set depending on
the file-name extension. Programs (.c, .h or .p extension)
usually have autoindent enabled. <br>
Wordwrap is enabled on other files, but rc files have it
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing Tasks <br>
Basic Editing <br>
When you type characters into the editor, they are normally
inserted into the file being edited (or appended to the file
if the cursor is at the end of the file). This is the <br>
normal operating mode of the editor. If you want to replace
some existing text, you have to delete the old text before
or after you type in the replacement text. The Backspace
<br>
key can be used for deleting text: move the cursor to right
after the text you want to delete and hit Backspace a number
of times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hit the Enter or Return key to
insert a line-break. For example, if the cursor was in the
middle of a line and you hit Return, the line would be split
into two lines with the <br>
cursor appearing at the beginning of the second line. Hit
Backspace at the beginning of a line to eliminate a
line-break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the arrow keys to move
around the file. If your keyboard doesn&rsquo;t have arrow
keys (or if they don&rsquo;t work for some reason), use ^F
to move forwards (right), ^B to move back&acirc; <br>
wards (left), ^P to move to the previous line (up), and ^N
to move to the next line (down). The right and left arrow
keys simply move forwards or backwards one character at a
<br>
time through the text: if you&rsquo;re at the beginning of a
line and you press left-arrow, you will end up at the end of
the previous line. The up and down arrow keys move forwards
<br>
and backwards by enough characters so that the cursor
appears in the same column that it was in on the original
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to indent the text
you enter, you can use the TAB key. This inserts a special
control character which makes the characters which follow it
begin at the next TAB <br>
STOP. TAB STOPS normally occur every 8 columns, but this can
be changed with the ^T D command. PASCAL and C programmers
often set TAB STOPS on every 4 columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If for some reason your terminal
screen gets messed up (for example, if you receive a mail
notice from biff), you can have the editor refresh the
screen by hitting ^R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many other keys for
deleting text and moving around the file. For example, hit
^D to delete the character the cursor is on instead of
deleting backwards like <br>
Backspace. ^D will also delete a line-break if the cursor is
at the end of a line. Type ^Y to delete the entire line the
cursor is on or ^J to delete just from the cursor to <br>
the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hit ^A to move the cursor to the
beginning of the line it&rsquo;s on. Hit ^E to move the
cursor to the end of the line. Hit ^U or ^V for scrolling
the cursor up or down 1/2 a <br>
screen&rsquo;s worth. &quot;Scrolling&quot; means that the
text on the screen moves, but the cursor stays at the same
place relative to the screen. Hit ^K U or ^K V to move the
cursor to the <br>
beginning or the end of the file. Look at the help screens
in the editor to find even more delete and movement
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you make a mistake, you can
hit ^_ to &quot;undo&quot; it. On most keyboards you hit
just ^- to get ^_, but on some you might have to hold both
the Shift and Control keys down at the <br>
same time to get it. If you &quot;undo&quot; too much, you
can &quot;redo&quot; the changes back into existence by
hitting ^^ (type this with just ^6 on most keyboards).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you were editing in one place
within the file, and you then temporarily had to look or
edit some other place within the file, you can get back to
the original place by hitting <br>
^K -. This command actually returns you to the last place
you made a change in the file. You can step through a
history of places with ^K - and ^K =, in the same way you
can <br>
step through the history of changes with the
&quot;undo&quot; and &quot;redo&quot; commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are done editing the
file, hit ^K X to exit the editor. You will be prompted for
a file name if you hadn&rsquo;t already named the file you
were editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you edit a file, you
actually edit only a copy of the file. So if you decide that
you don&rsquo;t want the changes you made to a file during a
particular edit session, you can <br>
hit ^C to exit the editor without saving them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you edit a file and save the
changes, a &quot;backup&quot; copy of that file is created
in the current directory, with a ~ appended to the name,
which contains the original version of <br>
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Word wrap and formatting <br>
If you type past the right edge of the screen in a C
language or PASCAL file, the screen will scroll to the right
to follow the cursor. If you type past the right edge of the
<br>
screen in a normal file (one whose name doesn&rsquo;t end in
.c, .h or .p), JOE will automatically wrap the last word
onto the next line so that you don&rsquo;t have to hit
Return. This is <br>
called word-wrap mode. Word-wrap can be turned on or off
with the ^T W command. JOE&rsquo;s initialisation file is
usually set up so that this mode is automatically turned on
for all <br>
non-program files. See the section below on the joerc file
to change this and other defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aside for Word-wrap mode, JOE
does not automatically keep paragraphs formatted like some
word-processors. Instead, if you need a paragraph to be
reformatted, hit ^K J. This <br>
command &quot;fills in&quot; the paragraph that the cursor
is in, fitting as many words in a line as is possible. A
paragraph, in this case, is a block of text separated above
and below <br>
by a blank line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The margins which JOE uses for
paragraph formatting and word-wrap can be set with the ^T L
and ^T R commands. If the left margin is set to a value
other than 1, then when you <br>
start typing at the beginning of a line, the cursor will
immediately jump to the left margin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to center a line
within the margins, use the ^K A command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Over-type mode <br>
Sometimes it&rsquo;s tiresome to have to delete old text
before or after you insert new text. This happens, for
example, when you are changing a table and you want to
maintain the <br>
column position of the right side of the table. When this
occurs, you can put the editor in over-type mode with ^T T.
When the editor is in this mode, the characters you type
<br>
in replace existing characters, in the way an idealised
typewriter would. Also, Backspace simply moves left instead
of deleting the character to the left, when it&rsquo;s not
at the <br>
end or beginning of a line. Over-type mode is not the
natural way of dealing with text electronically, so you
should go back to insert-mode as soon as possible by typing
^T T <br>
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to insert while
you&rsquo;re in over-type mode, hit ^@. This inserts a
single SPACE into the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Control and Meta characters <br>
Each character is represented by a number. For example, the
number for &rsquo;A&rsquo; is 65 and the number for
&rsquo;1&rsquo; is 49. All of the characters which you
normally see have numbers in the <br>
range of 32 - 126 (this particular arbitrary assignment
between characters and numbers is called the ASCII character
set). The numbers outside of this range, from 0 to 255, <br>
aren&rsquo;t usually displayed, but sometimes have other
special meanings. The number 10, for example, is used for
the line-breaks. You can enter these special, non-displayed
control <br>
characters by first hitting &lsquo; and then hitting a
character in the range @ A B C ... X Y Z [ ^ ] &nbsp;_ to
get the number 0 - 31, and ? to get 127. For example, if you
hit &lsquo; J, <br>
you&rsquo;ll insert a line-break character, or if you hit
&lsquo; I, you&rsquo;ll insert a TAB character (which does
the same thing the TAB key does). A useful control character
to enter is 12 (&lsquo; <br>
L), which causes most printers to advance to the top of the
page. You&rsquo;ll notice that JOE displays this character
as an underlined L. You can enter the characters above 127,
the <br>
meta characters, by first hitting ^. This adds 128 to the
next (possibly control) character entered. JOE displays
characters above 128 in inverse-video. Some foreign
lan&acirc; <br>
guages, which have more letters than English, use the meta
characters for the rest of their alphabet. You have to put
the editor in ASIS mode (described later) to have these <br>
passed untranslated to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prompts <br>
If you hit TAB at any file name prompt, joe will attempt to
complete the name you entered as much as possible. If it
couldn&rsquo;t complete the entire name, because there are
more <br>
than one possible completions, joe beeps. If you hit TAB
again, joe list the completions. You can use the arrow keys
to move around this directory menu and press RETURN or <br>
SPACE to select an item. If you press the first letter of
one of the directory entries, it will be selected, or if
more than one entry has the same first letter, the cursor
will <br>
jump between those entries. If you select a subdirectory or
.., the directory name is appended to the prompt and the new
directory is loaded into the menu. You can hit <br>
Backspace to go back to the previous directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most prompts record a history of
the responses you give them. You can hit up and down arrow
to step through these histories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prompts are actually single line
windows with no status line, so you can use any editing
command that you normally use on text within the prompts.
The prompt history is actually <br>
just other lines of the same &quot;prompt file&quot;. Thus
you can can search backwards though the prompt history with
the normal ^K F command if you want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since prompts are windows, you
can also switch out of them with ^K P and ^K N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where am I? <br>
Hit ^K SPACE to have JOE report the line number, column
number, and byte number on the last line of the screen. The
number associated with the character the cursor is on (its
<br>
ASCII code) is also shown. You can have the line number
and/or column number always displayed on the status line by
setting placing the appropriate escape sequences in the
sta&acirc; <br>
tus line setup strings. Edit the joerc file for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File operations <br>
You can hit ^K D to save the current file (possibly under a
different name from what the file was called originally).
After the file is saved, you can hit ^K E to edit a
differ&acirc; <br>
ent file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to save only a
selected section of the file, see the section on Blocks
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to include another
file in the file you&rsquo;re editing, use ^K R to insert
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Temporarily suspending the
editor <br>
If you need to temporarily stop the editor and go back to
the shell, hit ^K Z. You might want to do this to stop
whatever you&rsquo;re editing and answer an e-mail message
or read <br>
this man page, for example. You have to type fg or exit
(you&rsquo;ll be told which when you hit ^K Z) to return to
the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching for text <br>
Hit ^K F to have the editor search forwards or backwards for
a text fragment (string) for you. You will be prompted for
the text to search for. After you hit Return, you are <br>
prompted to enter options. You can just hit Return again to
have the editor immediately search forwards for the text, or
you can enter one or more of these options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Search backwards instead of
forwards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Treat uppercase and lower case
letters as the same when searching. Normally uppercase and
lowercase letters are considered to be different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nnn (where nnn is a number) If
you enter a number, JOE searches for the Nth occurrence of
the text. This is useful for going to specific places in
files structured in some <br>
regular manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Replace text. If you enter the
r option, then you will be further prompted for replacement
text. Each time the editor finds the search text, you will
be prompted as to <br>
whether you want to replace the found search text with the
replacement text. You hit: y to replace the text and then
find the next occurrence, n to not replace this text, <br>
but to then find the next occurrence, l to replace the text
and then stop searching, r to replace all of the remaining
occurrences of the search text in the remainder of <br>
the file without asking for confirmation (subject to the nnn
option above), or ^C to stop searching and replacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can hit ^L to repeat the
previous search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular Expressions <br>
A number of special character sequences may be entered as
search text:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This finds zero or more
characters. For example, if you give A as the search text,
JOE will try to find an A followed by any number of
characters and then a B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B as the search text, JOE will
find AXB, but not AB or AXXB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These match the beginning and
end of a line. For example, if you give test then JOE with
find test on a line by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; &gt; These match the
beginning and end of a word. For example, if you give
&lt;s&gt;, then joe will find whole words which have the
sub-string is within them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This matches any single
character which appears within the brackets. For example, if
his is entered as the search string, then JOE finds both
This and this. Ranges <br>
of characters can be entered within the brackets. For
example, finds any uppercase letter. If the first character
given in the brackets is ^, then JOE tries to <br>
find any character not given in the the brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">there was a ) within the
parenthesis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ This finds zero or more of the
character which immediately follows the +. For example, if
you give ]+], where the characters within the brackets are
both SPACE <br>
and TAB, then JOE will find whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">\ Matches a single .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This finds the special
end-of-line or line-break character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of special character
sequences may also be given in the replacement string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This gets replaced by the text
which matched the search string. For example, if the search
string was &lt;&gt;, which matches words, and you give
&quot;&quot;, then joe will put <br>
quote marks around words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- 9 <br>
These get replaced with the text which matched the Nth <br>
\ Use this if you need to put a &nbsp;in the replacement
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use this if you need to put a
line-break in the replacement string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you have a list of
addresses, each on a separate line, which starts with
&quot;Address:&quot; and has each element separated by
commas. Like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address: S. Holmes, 221b Baker
St., London, England</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wanted to rearrange the
list, to get the country first, then the city, then the
person&rsquo;s name, and then the address, you could do
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type ^K F to start the search,
and type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to match &quot;Address:&quot;,
the four comma-separated elements, and then the end of the
line. When asked for options, you would type r to replace
the string, and then type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address:3,2, ,1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To shuffle the information the
way you want it. After hitting return, the search would
begin, and the sample line would be changed to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address: England, London, S.
Holmes, 221b Baker St.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks <br>
If you want to move, copy, save or delete a specific section
of text, you can do it with highlighted blocks. First, move
the cursor to the start of the section of text you want <br>
to work on, and press ^K B. Then move the cursor to the
character just after the end of the text you want to affect
and press ^K K. The text between the ^K B and ^K K should
<br>
become highlighted. Now you can move your cursor to
someplace else in your document and press ^K M to move the
highlighted text there. You can press ^K C to make a copy of
the <br>
highlighted text and insert it to where the cursor is
positioned. ^K Y to deletes the highlighted text. ^K W,
writes the highlighted text to a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A very useful command is ^K /,
which filters a block of text through a unix command. For
example, if you select a list of words with ^K B and ^K K,
and then type ^K / sort, the <br>
list of words will be sorted. Another useful unix command
for ^K /, is tr. If you type ^K / tr a-z A-Z, then all of
the letters in the highlighted block will be converted to
<br>
uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you are finished with some
block operations, you can just leave the highlighting on if
you don&rsquo;t mind it (of course, if you accidentally hit
^K Y without noticing...). If <br>
it really bothers you, however, just hit ^K B ^K K, to turn
the highlighting off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indenting program blocks <br>
Auto-indent mode toggled with the ^T I command. The joerc is
normally set up so that files with names ending with .p, .c
or .h have auto-indent mode enabled. When auto-indent <br>
mode is enabled and you hit Return, the cursor will be
placed in the same column that the first non-SPACE/TAB
character was in on the original line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the ^K , and ^K .
commands to shift a block of text to the left or right. If
no highlighting is set when you give these commands, the
program block the cursor is <br>
located in will be selected, and will be moved by subsequent
^K , and ^K . commands. The number of columns these commands
shift by can be set through a ^T option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows <br>
You can edit more than one file at the same time or edit two
or more different places of the same file. To do this, hit
^K O, to split the screen into two windows. Use ^K P or <br>
^K N to move the cursor into the top window or the lower
window. Use ^K E to edit a new file in one of the windows. A
window will go away when you save the file with ^K X or <br>
abort the file with ^C. If you abort a file which exists in
two windows, one of the window goes away, not the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can hit ^K O within a window
to create even more windows. If you have too many windows on
the screen, but you don&rsquo;t want to eliminate them, you
can hit ^K I. This will show <br>
only the window the cursor is in, or if there was only one
window on the screen to begin with, try to fit all hidden
windows on the screen. If there are more windows than can
<br>
fit on the screen, you can hit ^K N on the bottom-most
window or ^K P on the top-most window to get to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you gave more than one file
name to JOE on the command line, each file will be placed in
a different window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change the height of the
windows with the ^K G and ^K T commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keyboard macros <br>
Macros allow you to record a series of keystrokes and replay
them with the press of two keys. This is useful to automate
repetitive tasks. To start a macro recording, hit ^K [ <br>
followed by a number from 0 to 9. The status line will
display (Macro n recording...). Now, type in the series of
keystrokes that you want to be able to repeat. The commands
<br>
you type will have their usual effect. Hit ^K ] to stop
recording the macro. Hit ^K followed by the number you
recorded the macro in to execute one iteration of the
key-strokes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you want to put
&quot;**&quot; in front of a number of lines, you can
type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^K [ ^A ** &lt;down arrow&gt; ^K
]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which starts the macro
recording, moves the cursor to the beginning of the line,
inserts &quot;**&quot;, moves the cursor down one line, and
then ends the recording. Since we included the <br>
key-strokes needed to position the cursor on the next line,
we can repeatedly use this macro without having to move the
cursor ourselves, something you should always keep in mind
<br>
when recording a macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that the macro you
are recording itself has a repeated set of key-strokes in
it, you can record a macro within the macro, as long as you
use a different macro number. <br>
Also you can execute previously recorded macros from within
new macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeat <br>
You can use the repeat command, ^K to repeat a macro, or any
other edit command or even a normal character, a specified
number of times. Hit ^K type in the number of times <br>
you want the command repeated and press Return. The next
edit command you now give will be repeated that many
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to delete the next
20 lines of text, type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^K 20&lt;return&gt;^Y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rectangle mode <br>
Type ^T X to have ^K B and ^K K select rectangular blocks
instead of stream-of-text blocks. This mode is useful for
moving, copying, deleting or saving columns of text. You can
<br>
also filter columns of text with the ^K / command- if you
want to sort a column, for example. The insert file command,
^K R is also effected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rectangle mode is selected,
over-type mode is also useful (^T T). When over-type mode is
selected, rectangles will replace existing text instead of
getting inserted before <br>
it. Also the delete block command (^K Y) will clear the
selected rectangle with SPACEs and TABs instead of deleting
it. Over-type mode is especially useful for the filter block
<br>
command (^K /), since it will maintain the original width of
the selected column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tag search <br>
If you are editing a large C program with many source files,
you can use the ctags program to generate a tags file. This
file contains a list of program symbols and the files <br>
and positions where the symbols are defined. The ^K ;
command can be used to lookup a symbol (functions, defined
constants, etc.), load the file where the symbol is defined
into <br>
the current window and position the cursor to where the
symbol is defined. ^K ; prompts you for the symbol you want,
but uses the symbol the cursor was on as a default. Since
<br>
^K ; loads the definition file into the current window, you
probably want to split the window first with ^K O, to have
both the original file and the definition file loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell windows <br>
Hit ^K &rsquo; to run a command shell in one of JOE&rsquo;s
windows. When the cursor is at the end of a shell window
(use ^K V if it&rsquo;s not), whatever you type is passed to
the shell instead <br>
of the window. Any output from the shell or from commands
executed in the shell is appended to the shell window (the
cursor will follow this output if it&rsquo;s at the end of
the <br>
shell window). This command is useful for recording the
results of shell commands- for example the output of make,
the result of grepping a set of files for a string, or
direc&acirc; <br>
tory listings from FTP sessions. Besides typeable
characters, the keys ^C, Backspace, DEL, Return and ^D are
passed to the shell. Type the shell exit command to stop
recording <br>
shell output. If you press ^C in a shell window, when the
cursor is not at the end of the window, the shell is
killed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variables <br>
For JOE to operate correctly, a number of other environment
settings must be correct. The throughput (baud rate) of the
connection between the computer and your terminal must be
<br>
set correctly for JOE to update the screen smoothly and
allow typeahead to defer the screen update. Use the stty nnn
command to set this. You want to set it as close as
possi&acirc; <br>
ble to actual throughput of the connection. For example, if
you are connected via a 1200 baud modem, you want to use
this value for stty. If you are connected via 14.4k modem,
<br>
but the terminal server you are connected to connects to the
computer a 9600 baud, you want to set your speed as 9600
baud. The special baud rate of 38400 or extb is used to <br>
indicate that you have a very-high speed connection, such as
a memory mapped console or an X-window terminal emulator. If
you can&rsquo;t use stty to set the actual throughput
(per&acirc; <br>
haps because of a modem communicating with the computer at a
different rate than it&rsquo;s communicating over the phone
line), you can put a numeric value in the BAUD environment
<br>
variable instead (use setenv BAUD 9600 for csh or BAUD=9600;
export BAUD for sh).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SHELL or EXECSHELL
environment variable must be set to the full pathname of a
shell executable that accepts the -i (interactive) and -c
(run a command) arguments of the Korn <br>
Shell; otherwise, /bin/sh is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TERM environment variable
must be set to the type of terminal you&rsquo;re using. If
the size (number of lines/columns) of your terminal is
different from what is reported in the <br>
TERMCAP or TERMINFO entry, you can set this with the stty
rows nn cols nn command, or by setting the LINES and COLUMNS
environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The xterm-xfree86 terminal
allows automatic entering and leaving of the bracketed paste
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JOETERM environment variable
may be set to override the regular TERM environment variable
for specifying your terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOE uses two character maps for
its operation: the terminal I/O character map, which
determines how characters are sent to the terminal and
whether the %a/%A message specifiers <br>
use Unicode, and the file encoding, which can be specified
per file using the -encoding option and changed with the ^T
E command, and which defaults to the terminal I/O character
<br>
map, which, in turn, is determined from the current locale,
if the system supports such, otherwise the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE
and LANG environment variables (if they contain a period,
<br>
only the part after it and before an optional &quot;at
sign&quot; is used); on cygwin32 before 1.7.2, the codepage
is used instead if the POSIX locale environment variables
are empty; the <br>
environment variable JOECHARMAP can be used to manually
force one overriding all methods described above, and can be
used together with -encoding to specify a different default
<br>
file character map.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JOE normally expects that flow
control between the computer and your terminal to use ^S/^Q
handshaking (I.E., if the computer is sending characters too
fast for your terminal, <br>
your terminal sends ^S to stop the output and ^Q to restart
it). If the flow control uses out-of-band or hardware
handshaking or if your terminal is fast enough to always
keep <br>
up with the computer output and you wish to map ^S/^Q to
edit commands, you can set the environment variable NOXON to
have JOE attempt to turn off ^S/^Q handshaking. If the
con&acirc; <br>
nection between the computer and your terminal uses no
handshaking and your terminal is not fast enough to keep up
with the output of the computer, you can set the environment
<br>
variable DOPADDING to have JOE slow down the output by
interspersing PAD characters between the terminal screen
update sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames <br>
Wherever JOE expects you to enter a file name, whether on
the command line or in prompts within the editor, you may
also type:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!command <br>
Read or write data to or from a shell command. For example,
use joe &rsquo;!ls&rsquo; to get a copy of your directory
listing to edit or from within the editor use ^K D !mail
<br>
jhallen@world.std.com to send the file being edited to
me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;&gt;filename <br>
Use this to have JOE append the edited text to the end of
the file &quot;filename.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename,START,SIZE <br>
Use this to access a fixed section of a file or device.
START and SIZE may be entered in decimal (ex.: 123) octal
(ex.: 0777) or hexadecimal (ex.: 0xFF). For example, <br>
use joe /dev/fd0,508,2 to edit bytes 508 and 509 of the
first floppy drive in Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Use this to get input from the
standard input or to write output to the standard output.
For example, you can put joe in a pipe of commands: quota -v
| joe - | mail root, <br>
if you want to complain about your low quota.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The joerc file <br>
^T options, the help screens and the key-sequence to editor
command bindings are all defined in JOE&rsquo;s
initialisation file. If you make a copy of this file (which
normally <br>
resides in /etc/jupp/joerc) to $HOME/.joerc, you can
customise these settings to your liking. The syntax of the
initialisation file should be fairly obvious, and there are
fur&acirc; <br>
ther instruction in it.</p>
