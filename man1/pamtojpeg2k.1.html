<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtojpeg2k converts the named
PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file, or Standard Input if no file is
named, to a JPEG-2000 code stream (JPC) file on Standard
Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JPEG-2000 specification
specifies two different formats: JP2 and JPEG-2000 code
stream (JPC). JP2 represents a visual image quite
specifically, whereas JPC is a more or less <br>
arbitrary array of codes. pamtojpeg2k can&rsquo;t produce a
JP2, but the JPC image that pamtojpeg2k produces is very
similar to a JP2 if the input is a PBM, PGM, or PPM image or
<br>
equivalent PAM image. One difference is that the RGB
intensity values in a JP2 are SRGB values, while pamtojpeg2k
produces ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 values. Those are very
<br>
similar, but not identical. Another difference is that a JP2
can contain extra information about an image that JPC
cannot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the input is a PAM image
other than a PBM, PGM, or PPM equivalent, the JPC raster
produced contains whatever the PAM raster does. It can have
any number of planes with any <br>
meanings; the planes are in the same order in the JPC output
as in the PAM input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A JPC image has a
&quot;precision,&quot; which is the number of bits used for
each code (in Netpbm lingo, &quot;sample&quot;). Actually,
it has a separate precision for each component. pamtojpeg2k
<br>
uses for the precision of every component the least number
of bits that can represent the maxval of the input image. A
JPC image does not have an independent concept of maxval;
<br>
the maxval of a JPC sample is the maximum value that the
number of bits specified by the precision can represent in
pure binary code. E.g. if the precision is 4, the maxval is
<br>
15. pamtojpeg2k does of course scale the sample values from
the input maxval to the output maxval. Example: The input
maxval is 99. This means JPC precision is 7 bits and the
<br>
JPC maxval is 127. A sample value of 33 in the input becomes
a sample value of 43 in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtojpeg2k generates the JPC
output with the Jasper JPEG-2000 library
&acirc;&uml;http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/&acirc;&copy;
. See documentation of the library for details on what
pamto&acirc; <br>
jpeg2k produces. Note that the Jasper library contains
facilities for reading PNM images, but pamtojpeg2k does not
use those. It uses the Netpbm library instead. Note that the
<br>
makers of the Jasper library write it &quot;JasPer,&quot;
but Netpbm documentation follows standard American English
typography rules, which don&rsquo;t allow that kind of
capitalization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use jpeg2ktopam to convert in
the other direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program jasper, which is
packaged with the Jasper JPEG-2000 library, also converts
between JPEG-2000 and PNM formats. Because it&rsquo;s
packaged with the library, it may exploit <br>
it better, especially recently added features. However,
since it does not use the Netpbm library to read and write
the Netpbm formats, it doesn&rsquo;t do as good a job on
that side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Most of the options are identical in name and function to
options that the Jasper library JPC encoder subroutine
takes. See Jasper documentation <br>

&acirc;&uml;http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/&acirc;&copy;
for details. Here, we document only options that are not
direct analogs of Jasper options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-compression=ratio <br>
ratio is a floating point number that specifies the
compression ratio. pamtojpeg2k will adjust quality as
necessary to ensure that you get this compression ratio.
E.g. 4 <br>
means the output will be about one fourth the size in bytes
of the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ratio concerns just the
raster part of the image, with the denominator being what
the raster would take if it were encoded the most naive way
possible (e.g. 3 bytes <br>
per pixel in 8-bit-per-sample RGB). It does, however,
include metadata that is part of the compressed raster.
Because of that, it may not be possible to give you your
<br>
requested compression ratio at any quality. If it
isn&rsquo;t, pamtojpeg2k fails with a message saying so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify this
option, pamtojpeg2k gives you the best compression it can
without losing any quality. Because of the metadata issue
described above, this may <br>
mean, for a small image, the image actually expands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that though the Jasper
library takes a compression factor, this option specifies a
compression ratio. The compression factor is the
multiplicative inverse of (1 <br>
divided by) the compression ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.61 (December
2012), the default was a compression ratio of 1, and if
pamtojpeg2k could not make the output that small, it just
made it as small as it <br>
could, with zero quality. You know this is happening when
you see the warning message, &rsquo;empty layer
generated.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This option causes pamtojpeg2k to issue informational
messages about the conversion process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debuglevel=number <br>
This option controls debug messages from the Jasper library.
pamtojpeg2k passes number as the debug level to the Jasper
JPC encoder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This example compresses losslessly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtojpeg2k myimg.ppm
&gt;myimg.jpc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jpeg2ktopam will recreate
myimg.ppm exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This example compresses the file
to one tenth its original size, throwing away information as
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtojpeg2k -compression=10
myimg.pgm &gt;myimg.jpc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABOUT JPEG-2000 <br>
JPEG-2000 is a format that compresses a visual image (or a
similar set of data) into a minimal number of bytes for
storage or transmission. In that, its goal is similar to
JPEG. <br>
It has two main differences from JPEG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One difference is that it does a
much better job on most images of throwing out information
in order to achieve a smaller output. That means when you
reconstruct the image from <br>
the resulting compressed file, it looks a lot closer to the
image you started with JPEG-2000 than with JPEG, for the
same compressed file size. Or, looked at another way, with
<br>
JPEG-2000 you get a much smaller file than with JPEG for the
same image quality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second difference is that
with JPEG-2000, you decide how much compression you want and
the compressor adjusts the quality to meet your requirement,
whereas with JPEG, you <br>
decide how much quality you want and the compressor adjusts
the size of the output to meet your requirement. I.e. with
JPEG-2000, the quality of the result depends on the
com&acirc; <br>
pressibility of the input, but with JPEG, the size of the
result depends on the compressibility of the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With JPEG-2000, you can specify
lossless compression, thus making it compete with GIF and
PNG. With standard JPEG, you always lose something. (There
are rumored to be varia&acirc; <br>
tions of JPEG around that are lossless, though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG is much older than
JPEG-2000 and far more popular. JPEG is one of the half
dozen most popular graphics formats and virtually all
graphics facilities understand it. <br>
JPEG-2000 is virtually unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no compatibility
between JPEG and JPEG-2000. Programs that read JPEG do not
automatically read JPEG-2000 and vice versa.</p>
