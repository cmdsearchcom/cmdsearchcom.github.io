<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCGUESS(1) Encryption
CCGUESS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccguess - search for ccrypt encryption keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccguess [options] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ccguess program attempts to guess ccrypt(1) encryption
keys by searching the relevant part of the key space. This
is done by prompting the user for an approximate key and
<br>
then trying many variations of this key. This is intended to
assist ccrypt users in recovering mistyped or forgotten
keys, provided that they remember at least part of the
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ccrypt provides strong
cryptographic security: there are no special back doors or
shortcuts to recovering forgotten keys. Therefore, the
ccguess program does not have <br>
any special powers. It simply works by trying different keys
until a possible match is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A search of the entire key space
is not usually a practical option. ccguess therefore works
by prompting the user for an approximate key. It then tries
all variations that can <br>
be obtained by applying a small number of changes. Here,
each change is either a deletion of one letter, an insertion
of one letter, a replacement of one letter by another, or a
<br>
transposition of two adjacent letters. By default, ccguess
searches all keys that differ from the approximate key by up
to 5 changes. The number of changes searched can be <br>
adjusted with the --depth option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mechanism by which ccguess
determines whether a key is a &quot;possible match&quot; is
the same as that used by ccrypt to reject non-matching
decryption keys. There is a small chance <br>
of a false match, i.e., ccguess may find a key that turns
out not to be the true encryption key and does not decrypt
the file correctly. A false match happens approximately once
<br>
for every 4.3 billion keywords tried, so the longer your
search goes on, the higher the likelihood that a false match
is found. Normally, ccguess stops after the first possible
<br>
match is found, but the -c option can be used to search for
additional keys. The possibility of a false match can be
further reduced by supplying multiple files that have been
<br>
encrypted with the same key. In this case, ccguess will
search for keys that match any of the files, but will print
a warning for keys that do not match all of the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Help. Print usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --license <br>
Print license info and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print version info and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K key, --key key <br>
Specify the approximate key on the command line, rather than
prompting the user for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d n, --depth n <br>
Search keys that contain up to n changes. The default is
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --continue <br>
Keep trying more keys even after the first match is found.
By default, ccguess will stop after the first key is found
that matches all input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t chars, --chartable chars <br>
Specify the list of characters to try for replacements and
insertions. By default, ccguess will try all printable ASCII
characters. If you know, for example, that your <br>
key only used lowercase letters and numbers, you can speed
up the search by specifying a list of characters explicitly.
This option is mutually exclusive with -n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --non-printable <br>
Allow non-printable characters in keys. By default, ccguess
will only try printable ASCII characters. Note that the use
of this option slows down the search signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly. This option is mutually exclusive with -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
file The name of a file that has been encrypted with the
unknown key. This file is only read from, not written to.
The special filename &quot;-&quot; is used to denote
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple files are specified,
ccguess will search for keys that match any of the files,
but will print a warning for keys that do not match all of
the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Suppose the file myfile.cpt has been encrypted with the key
&quot;gardenhouse&quot;, but the user remembers
&quot;gardenhose&quot;. The command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccguess -K gardenhose
myfile.cpt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will find the correct key after
2318 guesses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status is 0 if at least one possible match is
found, 1 if no matches are found, and &gt;=2 if an error
occurred.</p>
