<p>GVHDL(1) User Commands GVHDL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gvhdl - Frontend to the VHDL compiler/simulator FreeHDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gvhdl [OPTION] ... [VHDL_FILES] ... [OBJECT_FILES] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
FreeHDL is a compiler/simulator suite for the hardware
description language VHDL. VHDL&rsquo;93 as well as
VHDL&rsquo;87 standards are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeHDL translates the original
VHDL source FILEs into C++. Then, the C++ source can be
compiled and linked to the kernel to build the simulation
program. Starting the generated <br>
executable will simulate the corresponding VHDL model. The
actual build process to generate the simulator from the VHDL
source is a complex process which is handled by the gvhdl
<br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VHDL_FILES is a list of VHDL
source file names that must end with .vhdl or .vhd. The
first VHDL file name also determines the name of the
simulator executable. This is, the final <br>
executable will be named after the first VHDL file without
the .vhdl or .vhd extension. Note that the object files as
well as the simulator will be created in the current
direc&acirc; <br>
tory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBJECT_FILES specifies a list of
object files that are linked to the simulator executable.
gvhdl considers all files that end with .o to be object
files. Typically, these object <br>
files are generated previously (using option -c) from VHDL
source code during a separate compilation step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-L VHDLLIB <br>
Path to VHDL library root directory. Within this directory
the compiler search for a file named v2cc.libs. The mapping
file v2cc.libs translates library unit names to <br>
directories. Note that more than one VHDLLIB may be
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Adds debug information to the
executable. In detail, this options associates the generated
machine code to the corresponding lines in the VHDL source
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Adds debug information to the
executable but does not associate machine code to VHDL
source lines. This option is actually used to debug the
generated C++ code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Do not generate simulator
executable. Using this option, the compiler translated VHDL
source into executables and compiles them into object code
but does not generate a <br>
final simulator executable. This option is especially useful
to compile VHDL packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l LIBNAME <br>
Associate the VHDL source code to VHDL library LIBNAME. As
default the library name WORK is used. This option is
especially important if VHDL components from several VHDL
<br>
libraries shall be build into the simulator. Note that in
order to successfully use a VHDL component from another than
the current working library, the corresponding VHDL <br>
files must be found by the compiler using the mechanisms
described in v2cc.libs. Further, components must be compiled
with the appropriate -l LIBNAME option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--relaxed-component-visibility
<br>
Allows invisible default bindings from WORK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--libieee <br>
Add the IEEE standard library files to the simulation
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V2CC_LIBRARY_PATH <br>
The variable V2CC_LIBRARY_PATH consists of &quot;:&quot;
separated filenames. In addition to the environment
variable, you can use the &quot;-L libdir&quot; command line
option with v2cc. <br>
The directories specified with &quot;-L&quot; are added in
front of the ones specified by V2CC_LIBRARY_PATH. In the
final library path, they appear in the same order as on the
com&acirc; <br>
mand line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORTED VHDL SUBSET <br>
Currently, FreeHDL does not support the entire VHDL&rsquo;93
standard. The following incomplete list gives an overview on
what is currently not supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Individual association of
formals of composite type are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Shared variables are not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Attributes transaction, quiet,
stable and delayed are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- User defined attributes are
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Groups are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Guarded signal assignments are
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Configurations are not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Currently, drivers cannot be
switched off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gvhdl -c adder.vhdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to build an object file for
adder.vhdl. Note that adder.vhdl may contain several VHDL
models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gvhdl adder.vhdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will generate a simulator for
the last VHDL model found in adder.vhdl. However, in this
case, all VHDL components that area required to build the
simulator must be included in <br>
the VHDL source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gvhdl top.vhdl adder.o
--libieee</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generates a simulator for the
last VHDL model found in top.vhdl by compiling all models in
top.vhdl and linking (the previously generated) adder.o
object file and the IEEE stan&acirc; <br>
dard libraries to the executable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gvhdl -c -l mylib adder.vhdl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will build an object file
including all components provided in adder.vhdl. However, in
this case the components will be associated with library
mylib instead of the default <br>
library name work. Note that option -l does only effect the
generated C++ source code but does not alter the place where
the object files or executables are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMULATION COMMANDS <br>
After the simulator has been started a short summary of the
available commands is printed to the screen:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c &lt;number&gt; : execute
cycles = execute &lt;number&gt; simulation cycles <br>
n : next = execute next simulation cycle <br>
q : quit = quit simulation <br>
r &lt;time&gt; : run = execute simulation for &lt;time&gt;
<br>
d : dump = dump signals <br>
doff : dump off = stop dumping signals <br>
don : dump on = continue dumping signals <br>
s : show = show signal values <br>
dv : dump var = dump a signal from the signal lists <br>
ds : dump show = shows the list of dumped signals <br>
nds : number show = shows the number of dumped signals <br>
dc [-f &lt;filename&gt;] [-t &lt;timescale&gt; &lt;time
unit&gt;] [-cfg &lt;translation file&gt;] [-q] <br>
: configures dump process</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that signals are dumped
into a file (default file name is &quot;wave.dmp&quot;) in
VCD format. This file format should be accepted by each VCD
waveform viewer. The file name is set to <br>
&quot;wave.dmp&quot; but may be changed using &quot;dc -f
&lt;new_file_name&gt;&quot;. However, make sure to execute
&quot;dc -f ...&quot; before executing &quot;d&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIMULATOR COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
<br>
Simulation can be controlled via the command line parameter
&rsquo;-cmd &quot;cmd1; cmd2; ...&quot;&rsquo; where
&rsquo;cmd1&rsquo;, &rsquo;cmd2&rsquo;, ... are simulation
commands as described in the previous section. Note <br>
that each command must be separated by &rsquo;;&rsquo;.
E.g., executing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./top -cmd &quot;d;run 1000
ns;q;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will start simulation program
&rsquo;top&rsquo;, dump all signals and run simulation for
1000 ns. Finally, simulation is terminated. Actually, the
last command &rsquo;q;&rsquo; is optional as the simu&acirc;
<br>
lator automatically terminates as soon as the last command
has been executed.</p>
