<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
botch - bootstrap/build order tool chain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
botch is a collection of tools to create and analyze
dependency graphs. This task is facilitated by a range of
individual tools which use the deb822 and graphml formats to
<br>
exchange information with each other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also consider browsing the HTML
based doc-base Manual at
/usr/share/doc/botch/wiki/Home.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tools that botch ships allow
one to:</p>
