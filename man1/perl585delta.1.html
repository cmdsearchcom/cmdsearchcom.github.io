<p>PERL585DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL585DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl585delta - what is new for perl v5.8.5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.8.4
release and the 5.8.5 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine now contains support
for matching on the intersection of two Unicode character
classes. You can also now refer to user-defined character
classes <br>
from within other user defined character classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Carp improved to work nicely with Safe.
Carp&rsquo;s message reporting should now be anomaly free -
it will always print out line number information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; CGI upgraded to
version 3.05</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; charnames now
avoids clobbering $_</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Digest upgraded
to version 1.08</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Encode upgraded
to version 2.01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; FileCache
upgraded to version 1.04</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; libnet upgraded
to version 1.19</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pod::Parser
upgraded to version 1.28</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pod::Perldoc
upgraded to version 3.13</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Pod::LaTeX
upgraded to version 0.57</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Safe now works
properly with Carp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Scalar-List-Utils upgraded to version 1.14</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Shell&rsquo;s
documentation has been re-written, and its historical
partial auto-quoting of command arguments can now be
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Test upgraded to
version 1.25</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Test::Harness
upgraded to version 2.42</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Time::Local
upgraded to version 1.10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unicode::Collate
upgraded to version 0.40</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Unicode::Normalize upgraded to version 0.30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
Perl&rsquo;s debugger <br>
The debugger can now emulate stepping backwards, by
restarting and rerunning all bar the last command from a
saved command history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h2ph <br>
h2ph is now able to understand a very limited set of C
inline functions -- basically, the inline functions that
look like CPP macros. This has been introduced to deal with
some <br>
of the headers of the newest versions of the glibc. The
standard warning still applies; to quote h2ph&rsquo;s
documentation, you may need to dicker with the files
produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
Perl 5.8.5 should build cleanly from source on LynxOS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The in-place sort optimisation introduced in
5.8.4 had a bug. For example, in code such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a = sort ($b, @a)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the result would omit the value
$b. This is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The optimisation
for unnecessary assignments introduced in 5.8.4 could give
spurious warnings. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl should now
correctly detect and read BOM-marked and (BOMless) UTF-16
scripts of either endianness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Creating a new
thread when weak references exist was buggy, and would often
cause warnings at interpreter destruction time. The known
bug is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several obscure
bugs involving manipulating Unicode strings with
&quot;substr&quot; have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Previously if
Perl&rsquo;s file globbing function encountered a directory
that it did not have permission to open it would return
immediately, leading to unexpected truncation of <br>
the list of results. This has been fixed, to be consistent
with Unix shells&rsquo; globbing behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Thread creation
time could vary wildly between identical runs. This was
caused by a poor hashing algorithm in the thread cloning
routines, which has now been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The internals of
the ithreads implementation were not checking if OS-level
thread creation had failed. threads-&gt;create() now returns
&quot;undef&quot; in if thread creation fails <br>
instead of crashing perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New or Changed Diagnostics <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Perl -V has several improvements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; correctly
outputs local patch names that contain embedded code
snippets or other characters that used to confuse it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; arguments to -V
that look like regexps will give multiple lines of
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a trailing colon
suppresses the linefeed and &rsquo;;&rsquo; terminator,
allowing embedding of queries into shell commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a leading colon
removes the &rsquo;name=&rsquo; part of the response,
allowing mapping to any name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When perl fails
to find the specified script, it now outputs a second line
suggesting that the user use the &quot;-S&quot; flag:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ perl5.8.5 missing.pl <br>
Can&rsquo;t open perl script &quot;missing.pl&quot;: No such
file or directory. <br>
Use -S to search $PATH for it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Internals <br>
The Unicode character class files used by the regular
expression engine are now built at build time from the
supplied Unicode consortium data files, instead of being
shipped <br>
prebuilt. This makes the compressed Perl source tarball
about 200K smaller. A side effect is that the layout of
files inside lib/unicore has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
The regression test t/uni/class.t is now performing
considerably more tests, and can take several minutes to run
even on a fast machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Problems <br>
This release is known not to build on Windows 95.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.
There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org, the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team. You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at
<br>
http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
