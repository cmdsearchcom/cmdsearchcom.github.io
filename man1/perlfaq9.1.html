perlfaq9 - Web, Email and Networking
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This section deals with questions related to running web sites, sending and
  receiving email as well as general networking.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Should_I_use_a_web_framework?"><a class="selflink" href="#Should_I_use_a_web_framework?">Should
  I use a web framework?</a></h2>
Yes. If you are building a web site with any level of interactivity (forms /
  users / databases), you will want to use a framework to make handling requests
  and responses easier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is no interactivity then you may still want to look at using something
  like Template Toolkit &lt;https://metacpan.org/module/Template&gt; or
  Plack::Middleware::TemplateToolkit so maintenance of your HTML files (and
  other assets) is easier.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Which_web_framework_should_I_use?"><a class="selflink" href="#Which_web_framework_should_I_use?">Which
  web framework should I use?</a></h2>
There is no simple answer to this question. Perl frameworks can run everything
  from basic file servers and small scale intranets to massive multinational
  multilingual websites that are the core to international businesses.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Below is a list of a few frameworks with comments which might help you in making
  a decision, depending on your specific requirements. Start by reading the
  docs, then ask questions on the relevant mailing list or IRC channel.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Catalyst</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Strongly object-oriented and fully-featured with a long
      development history and a large community and addon ecosystem. It is
      excellent for large and complex applications, where you have full control
      over the server.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Dancer</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Young and free of legacy weight, providing a lightweight
      and easy to learn API. Has a growing addon ecosystem. It is best used for
      smaller projects and very easy to learn for beginners.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Mojolicious</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Fairly young with a focus on HTML5 and real-time web
      technologies such as WebSockets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Web::Simple</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Currently experimental, strongly object-oriented, built for
      speed and intended as a toolkit for building micro web apps, custom
      frameworks or for tieing together existing Plack-compatible web
      applications with one central dispatcher.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of these interact with or use Plack which is worth understanding the basics
  of when building a website in Perl (there is a lot of useful Plack::Middleware
  &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=plack%3A%3Amiddleware&gt;).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="What_is_Plack_and_PSGI?"><a class="selflink" href="#What_is_Plack_and_PSGI?">What
  is Plack and PSGI?</a></h2>
PSGI is the Perl Web Server Gateway Interface Specification, it is a standard
  that many Perl web frameworks use, you should not need to understand it to
  build a web site, the part you might want to use is Plack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Plack is a set of tools for using the PSGI stack. It contains middleware
  &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=plack%3A%3Amiddleware&gt; components, a
  reference server and utilities for Web application frameworks. Plack is like
  Ruby's Rack or Python's Paste for WSGI.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could build a web site using Plack and your own code, but for anything other
  than a very basic web site, using a web framework (that uses Plack) is a
  better option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_remove_HTML_from_a_string?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_remove_HTML_from_a_string?">How
  do I remove HTML from a string?</a></h2>
Use HTML::Strip, or HTML::FormatText which not only removes HTML but also
  attempts to do a little simple formatting of the resulting plain text.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_extract_URLs?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_extract_URLs?">How
  do I extract URLs?</a></h2>
HTML::SimpleLinkExtor will extract URLs from HTML, it handles anchors, images,
  objects, frames, and many other tags that can contain a URL. If you need
  anything more complex, you can create your own subclass of HTML::LinkExtor or
  HTML::Parser. You might even use HTML::SimpleLinkExtor as an example for
  something specifically suited to your needs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can use URI::Find to extract URLs from an arbitrary text document.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_fetch_an_HTML_file?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_fetch_an_HTML_file?">How
  do I fetch an HTML file?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the libwww-perl distribution. The LWP::Simple module can fetch web resources
  and give their content back to you as a string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use LWP::Simple qw(get);
    my $html = get( &quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot; );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It can also store the resource directly in a file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use LWP::Simple qw(getstore);
    getstore( &quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot;, &quot;foo.html&quot; );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need to do something more complicated, you can use LWP::UserAgent module
  to create your own user-agent (e.g. browser) to get the job done. If you want
  to simulate an interactive web browser, you can use the WWW::Mechanize module.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_automate_an_HTML_form_submission?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_automate_an_HTML_form_submission?">How
  do I automate an HTML form submission?</a></h2>
If you are doing something complex, such as moving through many pages and forms
  or a web site, you can use WWW::Mechanize. See its documentation for all the
  details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're submitting values using the GET method, create a URL and encode the
  form using the &quot;query_form&quot; method:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use LWP::Simple;
    use URI::URL;
    my $url = url('L&lt;http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod')&gt;;
    $url-&gt;query_form(module =&gt; 'DB_File', readme =&gt; 1);
    $content = get($url);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're using the POST method, create your own user agent and encode the
  content appropriately.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST);
    use LWP::UserAgent;
    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new();
    my $req = POST 'L&lt;http://www.perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod'&gt;,
                   [ module =&gt; 'DB_File', readme =&gt; 1 ];
    my $content = $ua-&gt;request($req)-&gt;as_string;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_decode_or_create_those_%-encodings_on_the_web?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_decode_or_create_those_%-encodings_on_the_web?">How
  do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web?</a></h2>
Most of the time you should not need to do this as your web framework, or if you
  are making a request, the LWP or other module would handle it for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To encode a string yourself, use the URI::Escape module. The
  &quot;uri_escape&quot; function returns the escaped string:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $original = &quot;Colon : Hash # Percent %&quot;;
    my $escaped = uri_escape( $original );
    print &quot;$escaped\n&quot;; # 'Colon%20%3A%20Hash%20%23%20Percent%20%25'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To decode the string, use the &quot;uri_unescape&quot; function:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    my $unescaped = uri_unescape( $escaped );
    print $unescaped; # back to original
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember not to encode a full URI, you need to escape each component separately
  and then join them together.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_redirect_to_another_page?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_redirect_to_another_page?">How
  do I redirect to another page?</a></h2>
Most Perl Web Frameworks will have a mechanism for doing this, using the
  Catalyst framework it would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $c-&gt;res-&gt;redirect($url);
    $c-&gt;detach();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are using Plack (which most frameworks do), then
  Plack::Middleware::Rewrite is worth looking at if you are migrating from
  Apache or have URL's you want to always redirect.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_put_a_password_on_my_web_pages?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_put_a_password_on_my_web_pages?">How
  do I put a password on my web pages?</a></h2>
See if the web framework you are using has an authentication system and if that
  fits your needs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternativly look at Plack::Middleware::Auth::Basic, or one of the other Plack
  authentication &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=plack+auth&gt; options.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_make_sure_users_can't_enter_values_into_a_form_that_causes_my_CGI_script_to_do_bad_things?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_make_sure_users_can't_enter_values_into_a_form_that_causes_my_CGI_script_to_do_bad_things?">How
  do I make sure users can't enter values into a form that causes my CGI script
  to do bad things?</a></h2>
(contributed by brian d foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can't prevent people from sending your script bad data. Even if you add some
  client-side checks, people may disable them or bypass them completely. For
  instance, someone might use a module such as LWP to submit to your web site.
  If you want to prevent data that try to use SQL injection or other sorts of
  attacks (and you should want to), you have to not trust any data that enter
  your program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The perlsec documentation has general advice about data security. If you are
  using the DBI module, use placeholder to fill in data. If you are running
  external programs with &quot;system&quot; or &quot;exec&quot;, use the list
  forms. There are many other precautions that you should take, too many to list
  here, and most of them fall under the category of not using any data that you
  don't intend to use. Trust no one.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_parse_a_mail_header?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_parse_a_mail_header?">How
  do I parse a mail header?</a></h2>
Use the Email::MIME module. It's well-tested and supports all the craziness that
  you'll see in the real world (comment-folding whitespace, encodings, comments,
  etc.).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use Email::MIME;
  my $message = Email::MIME-&gt;new($rfc2822);
  my $subject = $message-&gt;header('Subject');
  my $from    = $message-&gt;header('From');
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you've already got some other kind of email object, consider passing it to
  Email::Abstract and then using its cast method to get an Email::MIME object:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $mail_message_object = read_message();
  my $abstract = Email::Abstract-&gt;new($mail_message_object);
  my $email_mime_object = $abstract-&gt;cast('Email::MIME');
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_check_a_valid_mail_address?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_check_a_valid_mail_address?">How
  do I check a valid mail address?</a></h2>
(partly contributed by Aaron Sherman)
<div class="Pp"></div>
This isn't as simple a question as it sounds. There are two parts:
<div class="Pp"></div>
a) How do I verify that an email address is correctly formatted?
<div class="Pp"></div>
b) How do I verify that an email address targets a valid recipient?
<div class="Pp"></div>
Without sending mail to the address and seeing whether there's a human on the
  other end to answer you, you cannot fully answer part <i>b</i>, but the
  Email::Valid module will do both part <i>a</i> and part <i>b</i> as far as you
  can in real-time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Our best advice for verifying a person's mail address is to have them enter
  their address twice, just as you normally do to change a password. This
  usually weeds out typos. If both versions match, send mail to that address
  with a personal message. If you get the message back and they've followed your
  directions, you can be reasonably assured that it's real.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A related strategy that's less open to forgery is to give them a PIN (personal
  ID number). Record the address and PIN (best that it be a random one) for
  later processing. In the mail you send, include a link to your site with the
  PIN included. If the mail bounces, you know it's not valid. If they don't
  click on the link, either they forged the address or (assuming they got the
  message) following through wasn't important so you don't need to worry about
  it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_decode_a_MIME/BASE64_string?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_decode_a_MIME/BASE64_string?">How
  do I decode a MIME/BASE64 string?</a></h2>
The MIME::Base64 package handles this as well as the MIME/QP encoding. Decoding
  base 64 becomes as simple as:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use MIME::Base64;
    my $decoded = decode_base64($encoded);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Email::MIME module can decode base 64-encoded email message parts
  transparently so the developer doesn't need to worry about it.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_find_the_user's_mail_address?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_find_the_user's_mail_address?">How
  do I find the user's mail address?</a></h2>
Ask them for it. There are so many email providers available that it's unlikely
  the local system has any idea how to determine a user's email address.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exception is for organization-specific email (e.g. foo@yourcompany.com)
  where policy can be codified in your program. In that case, you could look at
  $ENV{USER}, $ENV{LOGNAME}, and getpwuid($&lt;) in scalar context, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $user_name = getpwuid($&lt;)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
But you still cannot make assumptions about whether this is correct, unless your
  policy says it is. You really are best off asking the user.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_send_email?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_send_email?">How
  do I send email?</a></h2>
Use the Email::MIME and Email::Sender::Simple modules, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  # first, create your message
  my $message = Email::MIME-&gt;create(
    header_str =&gt; [
      From    =&gt; 'you@example.com',
      To      =&gt; 'friend@example.com',
      Subject =&gt; 'Happy birthday!',
    ],
    attributes =&gt; {
      encoding =&gt; 'quoted-printable',
      charset  =&gt; 'ISO-8859-1',
    },
    body_str =&gt; &quot;Happy birthday to you!\n&quot;,
  );
  use Email::Sender::Simple qw(sendmail);
  sendmail($message);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, Email::Sender::Simple will try `sendmail` first, if it exists in
  your $PATH. This generally isn't the case. If there's a remote mail server you
  use to send mail, consider investigating one of the Transport classes. At time
  of writing, the available transports include:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Email::Sender::Transport::Sendmail</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the default. If you can use the <i>mail</i>(1) or
      <i>mailx</i>(1) program to send mail from the machine where your code
      runs, you should be able to use this.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This transport contacts a remote SMTP server over TCP. It
      optionally uses SSL and can authenticate to the server via SASL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP::TLS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is like the SMTP transport, but uses TLS security. You
      can authenticate with this module as well, using any mechanisms your
      server supports after STARTTLS.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Telling Email::Sender::Simple to use your transport is straightforward.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  sendmail(
    $message,
    {
      transport =&gt; $email_sender_transport_object,
    }
  );
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_use_MIME_to_make_an_attachment_to_a_mail_message?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_use_MIME_to_make_an_attachment_to_a_mail_message?">How
  do I use MIME to make an attachment to a mail message?</a></h2>
Email::MIME directly supports multipart messages. Email::MIME objects themselves
  are parts and can be attached to other Email::MIME objects. Consult the
  Email::MIME documentation for more information, including all of the supported
  methods and examples of their use.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_read_email?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_read_email?">How
  do I read email?</a></h2>
Use the Email::Folder module, like so:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use Email::Folder;
  my $folder = Email::Folder-&gt;new('/path/to/email/folder');
  while(my $message = $folder-&gt;next_message) {
    # next_message returns Email::Simple objects, but we want
    # Email::MIME objects as they're more robust
    my $mime = Email::MIME-&gt;new($message-&gt;as_string);
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are different classes in the Email::Folder namespace for supporting
  various mailbox types. Note that these modules are generally rather limited
  and only support <b>reading</b> rather than writing.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="How_do_I_find_out_my_hostname,_domainname,_or_IP_address?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_find_out_my_hostname,_domainname,_or_IP_address?">How
  do I find out my hostname, domainname, or IP address?</a></h2>
gethostbyname, Socket, Net::Domain, Sys::Hostname&quot; (contributed by brian d
  foy)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Net::Domain module, which is part of the Standard Library starting in Perl
  5.7.3, can get you the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the host name, or
  the domain name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Net::Domain qw(hostname hostfqdn hostdomain);
    my $host = hostfqdn();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Sys::Hostname module, part of the Standard Library, can also get the
  hostname:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Sys::Hostname;
    $host = hostname();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Sys::Hostname::Long module takes a different approach and tries harder to
  return the fully qualified hostname:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use Sys::Hostname::Long 'hostname_long';
  my $hostname = hostname_long();
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get the IP address, you can use the &quot;gethostbyname&quot; built-in
  function to turn the name into a number. To turn that number into the dotted
  octet form (a.b.c.d) that most people expect, use the &quot;inet_ntoa&quot;
  function from the Socket module, which also comes with perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use Socket;
    my $address = inet_ntoa(
        scalar gethostbyname( $host || 'localhost' )
    );
</pre>
