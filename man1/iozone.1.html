<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Iozone is a filesystem benchmark tool. The benchmark
generates and measures a variety of file operations. Iozone
has been ported to many machines and runs under many
operating <br>
systems. This document will cover the many different types
of operations that are tested as well as coverage of all of
the command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Iozone is useful for determining
a broad filesystem analysis of a vendor&rsquo;s computer
platform. The benchmark tests file I/O performance for the
following operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read, write, re-read, re-write,
read backwards, read strided, fread, fwrite, random
read/write, pread/pwrite variants</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While computers are typically
purchased with an application in mind it is also likely that
over time the application mix will change. Many vendors have
enhanced their operating <br>
systems to perform well for some frequently used
applications. Although this accelerates the I/O for those
few applications it is also likely that the system may not
perform well <br>
for other applications that were not targeted by the
operating system. An example of this type of enhancement is:
Database. Many operating systems have tested and tuned the
<br>
filesystem so it works well with databases. While the
database users are happy, the other users may not be so
happy as the entire system may be giving all of the system
resources <br>
to the database users at the expense of all other users. As
time rolls on the system administrator may decide that a few
more office automation tasks could be shifted to this
ma&acirc; <br>
chine. The load may now shift from a random reader
application (database) to a sequential reader. The users may
discover that the machine is very slow when running this new
ap&acirc; <br>
plication and become dissatisfied with the decision to
purchase this platform. By using Iozone to get a broad
filesystem performance coverage the buyer is much more
likely to see <br>
any hot or cold spots and pick a platform and operating
system that is more well balanced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Used to select full automatic mode. Produces output that
covers all tested file operations for record sizes of 4k to
16M for file sizes of 64k to 512M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A This version of automatic
mode provides more coverage but consumes a bunch of time.
The -a option will automatically stop using transfer sizes
less than 64k once the file <br>
size is 32M or larger. This saves time. The -A option tells
Iozone that you are willing to wait and want dense coverage
for small transfers even when the file size is very <br>
large. NOTE: This option is deprecated in Iozone version
3.61. Use -az -i 0 -i 1 instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b filename <br>
Used to specify a filename that will be used for output of
an Excel compatible file that contains the results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Use mmap() files. This causes
all of the temporary files being measured to be created and
accessed with the mmap() interface. Some applications prefer
to treat files as <br>
arrays of memory. These applications mmap() the file and
then just access the array with loads and stores to perform
file I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Include close() in the timing
calculations. This is useful only if you suspect that
close() is broken in the operating system currently under
test. It can be useful for <br>
NFS Version 3 testing as well to help identify if the
nfs3_commit is working well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Show bytes transferred by
each child in throughput testing. Useful if your operating
system has any starvation problems in file I/O or in process
management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d # Microsecond delay out of
barrier. During the throughput tests all threads or
processes are forced to a barrier before beginning the test.
Normally, all of the threads or <br>
processes are released at the same moment. This option
allows one to delay a specified time in microseconds between
releasing each of the processes or threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Use msync(MS_ASYNC) on mmap
files. This tells the operating system that all the data in
the mmap space needs to be written to disk
asynchronously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Include flush (fsync,fflush)
in the timing calculations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Used to select the extension
tests. Only available on some platforms. Uses pread
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f filename <br>
Used to specify the filename for the temporary file under
test. This is useful when the unmount option is used. When
testing with unmount between tests it is necessary for <br>
the temporary file under test to be in a directory that can
be unmounted. It is not possible to unmount the current
working directory as the process Iozone is running in <br>
this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F filename filename filename ?
<br>
Specify each of the temporary file names to be used in the
throughput testing. The number of names should be equal to
the number of processes or threads that are speci&acirc;
<br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g # Set maximum file size (in
Kbytes) for auto mode. One may also specify -g #k (size in
Kbytes) or -g #m (size in Mbytes) or -g #g (size in Gbytes).
See -n for minimum file <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Use msync(MS_SYNC) on mmap
files. This tells the operating system that all the data in
the mmap space needs to be written to disk
synchronously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Displays help screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H # Use POSIX async I/O with #
async operations. Iozone will use POSIX async I/O with a
bcopy from the async buffers back into the applications
buffer. Some versions of MSC <br>
NASTRAN perform I/O this way. This technique is used by
applications so that the async I/O may be performed in a
library and requires no changes to the applications
in&acirc; <br>
ternal model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i # Used to specify which tests
to run. (0=write/rewrite, 1=read/re-read,
2=random-read/write, 3=Read-backwards, 4=Re-write-record,
5=stride-read, 6=fwrite/re-fwrite, <br>
7=fread/Re-fread, 8=mixed workload, 9=pwrite/Re-pwrite,
10=pread/Re-pread, 11=pwritev/Re-pwritev,
12=preadv/Re-preadv). One will always need to specify 0 so
that any of <br>
the following tests will have a file to measure. -i # -i #
-i # is also supported so that one may select more than one
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Use DIRECT IO if possible for
all file operations. Tells the filesystem that all
operations to the file are to bypass the buffer cache and go
directly to disk. (not avail&acirc; <br>
able on all platforms)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j # Set stride of file accesses
to (# * record size). The stride read test will read records
at this stride.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J # Millisecond delay before
each I/O operation. This simulates the cpu compute cycle of
an application that precedes an I/O operation. One may also
use -X or -Y to control <br>
the compute cycle on a per I/O operation basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k # Use POSIX async I/O (no
bcopy) with # async operations. Iozone will use POSIX async
I/O and will not perform any extra bcopys. The buffers used
by Iozone will be handed <br>
to the async I/O system call directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Inject some random accesses
in the testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l # Set the lower limit on
number of processes to run. When running throughput tests
this option allows the user to specify the least number of
processes or threads to start. <br>
This option should be used in conjunction with the -u
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L # Set processor cache line
size to value (in bytes). Tells Iozone the processor cache
line size. This is used internally to help speed up the
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Tells Iozone to use multiple
buffers internally. Some applications read into a single
buffer over and over. Others have an array of buffers. This
option allows both types <br>
of applications to be simulated. Iozone&Acirc;&acute;s
default behavior is to re-use internal buffers. This option
allows one to override the default and to use multiple
internal buf&acirc; <br>
fers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Iozone will call uname() and
will put the string in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n # Set minimum file size (in
Kbytes) for auto mode. One may also specify -n #k (size in
Kbytes) or -n #m (size in Mbytes) or -n #g (size in Gbytes).
See -g for maximum file <br>
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Report results in
microseconds per operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Writes are synchronously
written to disk. (O_SYNC). Iozone will open the files with
the O_SYNC flag. This forces all writes to the file to go
completely to disk before <br>
returning to the benchmark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Give results in operations
per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p This purges the processor
cache before each file operation. Iozone will allocate
another internal buffer that is aligned to the same
processor cache boundary and is of a <br>
size that matches the processor cache. It will zero fill
this alternate buffer before beginning each test. This will
purge the processor cache and allow one to see the <br>
memory subsystem without the acceleration due to the
processor cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P # Bind processes/threads to
processors, starting with this cpu #. Only available on some
platforms. The first sub process or thread will begin on the
specified processor. <br>
Future processes or threads will be placed on the next
processor. Once the total number of cpus is exceeded then
future processes or threads will be placed in a round <br>
robin fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q # Set maximum record size (in
Kbytes) for auto mode. One may also specify -q #k (size in
Kbytes) or -q #m (size in Mbytes) or -q #g (size in Gbytes).
See -y for minimum <br>
record size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Create offset/latency files.
Iozone will create latency versus offset data files that can
be imported with a graphics package and plotted. This is
useful for finding if <br>
certain offsets have very high latencies. Such as the point
where UFS will allocate its first indirect block. One can
see from the data the impacts of the extent alloca&acirc;
<br>
tions for extent based filesystems with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r # Used to specify the record
size, in Kbytes, to test. One may also specify -r #k (size
in Kbytes) or -r #m (size in Mbytes) or -r #g (size in
Gbytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Generate Excel report. Iozone
will generate an Excel compatible report to standard out.
This file may be imported with Microsoft Excel (space
delimited) and used to cre&acirc; <br>
ate a graph of the filesystem performance. Note: The 3D
graphs are column oriented. You will need to select this
when graphing as the default in Excel is row oriented
da&acirc; <br>
ta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s # Used to specify the size,
in Kbytes, of the file to test. One may also specify -s #k
(size in Kbytes) or -s #m (size in Mbytes) or -s #g (size in
Gbytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S # Set processor cache size to
value (in Kbytes). This tells Iozone the size of the
processor cache. It is used internally for buffer alignment
and for the purge functional&acirc; <br>
ity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t # Run Iozone in a throughput
mode. This option allows the user to specify how many
threads or processes to have active during the
measurement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Use POSIX pthreads for
throughput tests. Available on platforms that have POSIX
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u # Set the upper limit on
number of processes to run. When running throughput tests
this option allows the user to specify the greatest number
of processes or threads to <br>
start. This option should be used in conjunction with the -l
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U mountpoint <br>
Mount point to unmount and remount between tests. Iozone
will unmount and remount this mount point before beginning
each test. This guarantees that the buffer cache does <br>
not contain any of the file under test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display the version of
Iozone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V # Specify a pattern that is
to be written to the temporary file and validated for
accuracy in each of the read tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Do not unlink temporary files
when finished using them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Lock file when reading or
writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Turn off stone-walling.
Stonewalling is a technique used internally to Iozone. It is
used during the throughput tests. The code starts all
threads or processes and then <br>
stops them on a barrier. Once they are all ready to start
then they are all released at the same time. The moment that
any of the threads or processes finish their work <br>
then the entire test is terminated and throughput is
calculated on the total I/O that was completed up to this
point. This ensures that the entire measurement was taken
<br>
while all of the processes or threads were running in
parallel. This flag allows one to turn off the stonewalling
and see what happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X filename <br>
Used to specify a filename that will be used for the write
telemetry information. The file contains lines with offset,
size, delay_in_milliseconds. Each of these lines are <br>
used to perform an I/O operation. This is used when an
application&rsquo;s specific I/O operations are known, and
one wishes to benchmark the system with this specific
applica&acirc; <br>
tion file behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y # Set minimum record size (in
Kbytes) for auto mode. One may also specify -y #k (size in
Kbytes) or -y #m (size in Mbytes) or -y #g (size in Gbytes).
See -q for maximum <br>
record size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y filename <br>
Used to specify a filename that will be used for the read
telemetry information. The file contains lines with offset,
size, delay_in_milliseconds. Each of these lines are <br>
used to perform an I/O operation. This is used when an
application&rsquo;s specific I/O operations are known, and
one wishes to benchmark the system with this specific
applica&acirc; <br>
tion file behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Used in conjunction with -a
to test all possible record sizes. Normally Iozone omits
testing of small record sizes for very large files when used
in full automatic mode. <br>
This option forces Iozone to include the small record sizes
in the automatic tests also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Enable mixing of mmap I/O and
file I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+m filename <br>
Used to specify a filename that will be used to specify the
clients in a distributed measurement. The file contains one
line for each client. The fields are space delimit&acirc;
<br>
ed. Field 1 is the client name. Field 2 is the working
directory, on the client, where Iozone will run. Field 3 is
the path to the executable Iozone on the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+n No retests selected. Used to
prevent retests from running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+N No truncating or deleting of
previous test file before the sequential write test. Useful
only after -w is used in previous command to leave the test
file in place for re&acirc; <br>
use. This flag is of limited use, when a single retest is
not enough, or to easily control when sequential write
retests occur without file truncation or deletion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+u Used to enable CPU
statistics collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+d Diagnostic mode to
troubleshoot a broken file I/O subsystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+p percentage_reads <br>
Used to set the percentage of threads/processes that will
perform read testing in the mixed workload test case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+r Enable O_RSYNC | O_SYNC on
all testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+l Enable byte range
locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+L Enable byte range locking
&amp; shared file mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+D Enable O_DSYNC on all
testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+t Enable network performance
test. Use with -+m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+A# Enable madvise behavior. 0
= normal, 1=random, 2=sequential, 3=dontneed, 4=willneed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+B Enable sequential mixed
workload testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+T Enable time stamps
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+h Manually set hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-+w# Percentage of data to be
de-dupable between files.</p>
