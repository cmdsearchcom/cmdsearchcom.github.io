<p>PG_RECEIVEXLOG(1) PostgreSQL 9.2.18 Documentation
PG_RECEIVEXLOG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_receivexlog - streams transaction logs from a PostgreSQL
cluster</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_receivexlog [option...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_receivexlog is used to stream transaction log from a
running PostgreSQL cluster. The transaction log is streamed
using the streaming replication protocol, and is written to
a <br>
local directory of files. This directory can be used as the
archive location for doing a restore using point-in-time
recovery (see Section 24.3, &acirc;Continuous Archiving and
Point- <br>
in-Time Recovery (PITR)&acirc;, in the documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_receivexlog streams the
transaction log in real time as it&rsquo;s being generated
on the server, and does not wait for segments to complete
like archive_command does. For this <br>
reason, it is not necessary to set archive_timeout when
using pg_receivexlog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transaction log is streamed
over a regular PostgreSQL connection, and uses the
replication protocol. The connection must be made with a
superuser or a user having REPLICATION <br>
permissions (see Section 20.2, &acirc;Role
Attributes&acirc;, in the documentation), and pg_hba.conf
must explicitly permit the replication connection. The
server must also be configured <br>
with max_wal_senders set high enough to leave at least one
session available for the stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the connection is lost, or if
it cannot be initially established, with a non-fatal error,
pg_receivexlog will retry the connection indefinitely, and
reestablish streaming as <br>
soon as possible. To avoid this behavior, use the -n
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command-line options control the location and
format of the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D directory,
--directory=directory <br>
Directory to write the output to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This parameter is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command-line
options control the running of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-loop <br>
Don&rsquo;t loop on connection errors. Instead, exit right
away with an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Enables verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command-line
options control the database connection parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h host, --host=host <br>
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as
the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default <br>
is taken from the PGHOST environment variable, if set, else
a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, --port=port <br>
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file
extension on which the server is listening for connections.
Defaults to the PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a
<br>
compiled-in default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s interval,
--status-interval=interval <br>
Specifies the number of seconds between status packets sent
back to the server. This is required if replication timeout
is configured on the server, and allows for easier <br>
monitoring. A value of zero disables the status updates
completely. The default value is 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U username, --username=username
<br>
User name to connect as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --no-password <br>
Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires
password authentication and a password is not available by
other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt
<br>
will fail. This option can be useful in batch jobs and
scripts where no user is present to enter a password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --password <br>
Force pg_receivexlog to prompt for a password before
connecting to a database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is never essential,
since pg_receivexlog will automatically prompt for a
password if the server demands password authentication.
However, pg_receivexlog will <br>
waste a connection attempt finding out that the server wants
a password. In some cases it is worth typing -W to avoid the
extra connection attempt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options are also
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the pg_receivexlog version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?, --help <br>
Show help about pg_receivexlog command line arguments, and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, uses the
environment variables supported by libpq (see Section 31.14,
&acirc;Environment Variables&acirc;, in the
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
When using pg_receivexlog instead of archive_command, the
server will continue to recycle transaction log files even
if the backups are not properly archived, since there is no
<br>
command that fails. This can be worked around by having an
archive_command that fails when the file has not been
properly archived yet, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">archive_command = &rsquo;sleep 5
&amp;&amp; test -f /mnt/server/archivedir/%f&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial timeout is necessary
because pg_receivexlog works using asynchronous replication
and can therefore be slightly behind the master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To stream the transaction log from the server at mydbserver
and store it in the local directory
/usr/local/pgsql/archive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ pg_receivexlog -h mydbserver
-D /usr/local/pgsql/archive</p>
