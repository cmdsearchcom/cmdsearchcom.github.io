<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ispell is fashioned after the spell program from ITS (called
ispell on Twenex systems.) The most common usage is
&quot;ispell filename&quot;. In this case, ispell will
display each word <br>
which does not appear in the dictionary at the top of the
screen and allow you to change it. If there are &quot;near
misses&quot; in the dictionary (words which differ by only a
single <br>
letter, a missing or extra letter, a pair of transposed
letters, or a missing space or hyphen), then they are also
displayed on following lines. As well as &quot;near
misses&quot;, ispell <br>
may display other guesses at ways to make the word from a
known root, with each guess preceded by question marks.
Finally, the line containing the word and the previous line
are <br>
printed at the bottom of the screen. If your terminal can
display in reverse video, the word itself is highlighted.
You have the option of replacing the word completely, or
<br>
choosing one of the suggested words. Commands are single
characters as follows (case is ignored):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Replace the misspelled word
completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Space Accept the word this time
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Accept the word for the rest
of this ispell session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Accept the word, capitalized
as it is in the file, and update private dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Accept the word, and add an
uncapitalized (actually, all lower-case) version to the
private dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0-n Replace with one of the
suggested words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L Look up words in system
dictionary (controlled by the WORDS compilation option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Write the rest of this file,
ignoring misspellings, and start next file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q Exit immediately and leave the
file unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Shell escape.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^L Redraw screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^Z Suspend ispell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Give help screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -M switch is specified, a
one-line mini-menu at the bottom of the screen will
summarize these options. Conversely, the -N switch may be
used to suppress the mini-menu. <br>
(The minimenu is displayed by default if ispell was compiled
with the MINIMENU option, but these two switches will always
override the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -L flag is given, the
specified number is used as the number of lines of context
to be shown at the bottom of the screen (The default is to
calculate the amount of context <br>
as a certain percentage of the screen size). The amount of
context is subject to a system-imposed limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -V flag is given,
characters that are not in the 7-bit ANSI printable
character set will always be displayed in the style of
&quot;cat -v&quot;, even if ispell thinks that these <br>
characters are legal ISO Latin-1 on your system. This is
useful when working with older terminals. Without this
switch, ispell will display 8-bit characters &quot;as
is&quot; if they <br>
have been defined as string characters for the chosen file
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Normal&quot; mode, as well
as the -l, -a, and -A options and interactive mode (see
below) also accepts the following &quot;common&quot; flags
on the command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t The input file is in TeX or
LaTeX format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The input file is in
nroff/troff format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H The input file is in
SGML/HTML format. (This should really be -s, but for
historical reasons that flag was already taken.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o The input file should be
treated as ordinary text. (This could be used to override
DEFTEXFLAG.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g The input file is in Debian
control file format. Ispell will ignore everything outside
the Description(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Create a backup file by
appending &quot;.bak&quot; to the name of the input
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Delete the backup file after
spell-checking is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Report run-together words
with missing blanks as spelling errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Consider run-together words
as legal compounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Don&rsquo;t generate extra
root/affix combinations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Make possible root/affix
combinations that aren&rsquo;t in the dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Sort the list of guesses by
probable correctness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d file <br>
Specify an alternate dictionary file. For example, use -d
british to choose /usr/lib/ispell/british.{aff|hash} instead
of your default ispell dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file <br>
Specify an alternate personal dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w chars <br>
Specify additional characters that can be part of a
word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W n Specify length of words
that are always legal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T type <br>
Assume a given formatter type for all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -H, -n, -t, and -o options
select whether ispell runs in HTML (-H), nroff/troff (-n),
TeX/LaTeX (-t), or ordinary text (-o) input mode. mode. (The
default mode is con&acirc; <br>
trolled by the DEFTEXFLAG installation option, but is
normally nroff/troff mode for historical reasons.) Unless
overridden by one of the mode-selection switches, TeX/LaTeX
mode <br>
is automatically selected if an input file has the extension
&quot;.tex&quot;, and HTML mode is automatically selected if
an input file has the extension &quot;.html&quot; or
&quot;.htm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In HTML mode, HTML tags
delimited by &lt;&gt; signs are skipped, except that the
&quot;ALT=&quot; construct is recognized if it appears with
no spaces around the equals sign, and the text inside <br>
is spell-checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a
backslash (&quot; <br>
checked, such as labels and reference keys as are found in
the mode. Thus, for example, given</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ispell will find
&quot;Ckapter&quot; but not &quot;SCH&quot;. The -t option
does not recognize the TeX comment character &quot;%&quot;,
so comments are also spell-checked. It also assumes correct
LaTeX syn&acirc; <br>
tax. Arguments to infrequently used commands and some
optional arguments are sometimes checked unnecessarily. The
bibliography will not be checked if ispell was compiled with
<br>
IGNOREBIB defined. Otherwise, the bibliography will be
checked but the reference key will not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">References for the tib (if
available on your system), bibliography system, that is,
text between a &lsquo;&lsquo;[.&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;.&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;.]&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;.&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; will always be ignored in
TeX/LaTeX mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b and -x options control
whether ispell leaves a backup (.bak) file for each input
file. The .bak file contains the pre-corrected text. If
there are file opening / writing <br>
errors, the .bak file may be left for recovery purposes even
with the -x option. The default for this option is
controlled by the DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -B and -C options control
how ispell handles run-together words, such as
&quot;notthe&quot; for &quot;not the&quot;. If -B is
specified, such words will be considered as errors, and
ispell will <br>
list variations with an inserted blank or hyphen as possible
replacements. If -C is specified, run-together words will be
considered to be legal compounds, so long as both com&acirc;
<br>
ponents are in the dictionary, and each component is at
least as long as a language-dependent minimum (3 characters,
by default). This is useful for languages such as German and
<br>
Norwegian, where many compound words are formed by
concatenation. (Note that compounds formed from three or
more root words will still be considered errors). The
default for <br>
this option is language-dependent; in a multi-lingual
installation the default may vary depending on which
dictionary you choose. Warning: the -C option can cause
ispell to rec&acirc; <br>
ognize non-words and misspellings. Use it with caution!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -P and -m options control
when ispell automatically generates suggested root/affix
combinations for possible addition to your personal
dictionary. (These are the entries in <br>
the &quot;guess&quot; list which are preceded by question
marks.) If -P is specified, such guesses are displayed only
if ispell cannot generate any possibilities that match the
current <br>
dictionary. If -m is specified, such guesses are always
displayed. This can be useful if the dictionary has a
limited word list, or a word list with few suffixes.
However, you <br>
should be careful when using this option, as it can generate
guesses that produce illegal words. The default for this
option is controlled by the dictionary file used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S option suppresses
ispell&rsquo;s normal behavior of sorting the list of
possible replacement words. Some people may prefer this,
since it somewhat enhances the probability that <br>
the correct word will be low-numbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -d option is used to specify
an alternate hashed dictionary file, other than the default.
If the filename does not contain a &quot;/&quot;, the
library directory for the default dic&acirc; <br>
tionary file is prefixed; thus, to use a dictionary in the
local directory &quot;-d ./xxx.hash&quot; must be used. This
is useful to allow dictionaries for alternate languages.
Unlike <br>
previous versions of ispell, a dictionary of /dev/null is
illegal, because the dictionary contains the affix table. If
you need an effectively empty dictionary, create a one- <br>
entry list with an unlikely string (e.g.,
&quot;qqqqq&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -p option is used to specify
an alternate personal dictionary file. If the file name does
not begin with &quot;/&quot;, $HOME is prefixed. Also, the
shell variable WORDLIST may be <br>
set, which renames the personal dictionary in the same
manner. The command line overrides any WORDLIST setting. If
neither the -p switch nor the WORDLIST environment variable
<br>
is given, ispell will search for a personal dictionary in
both the current directory and $HOME, creating one in $HOME
if none is found. The preferred name is constructed by <br>
appending &quot;.ispell_&quot; to the base name of the hash
file. For example, if you use the English dictionary, your
personal dictionary would be named
&quot;.ispell_english&quot;. However, if <br>
the file &quot;.ispell_words&quot; exists, it will be used
as the personal dictionary regardless of the language hash
file chosen. This feature is included primarily for
backwards compat&acirc; <br>
ibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -p option is not
specified, ispell will look for personal dictionaries in
both the current directory and the home directory. If
dictionaries exist in both places, they <br>
will be merged. If any words are added to the personal
dictionary, they will be written to the current directory if
a dictionary already existed in that place; otherwise they
<br>
will be written to the dictionary in the home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -w option may be used to
specify characters other than alphabetics which may also
appear in words. For instance, -w &quot;&amp;&quot; will
allow &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; to be picked up. Underscores are
<br>
useful in many technical documents. There is an admittedly
crude provision in this option for 8-bit international
characters. Non-printing characters may be specified in the
<br>
usual way by inserting a backslash followed by the octal
character code; e.g., &quot; 14&quot; for a form feed.
Alternatively, if &quot;n&quot; appears in the character
string, the (up to) three <br>
characters following are a DECIMAL code 0 - 255, for the
character. For example, to include bells and form feeds in
your words (an admittedly silly thing to do, but
aren&rsquo;t most <br>
pedagogical examples):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n007n012</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numeric digits other than the
three following &quot;n&quot; are simply numeric characters.
Use of &quot;n&quot; does not conflict with anything because
actual alphabetics have no meaning - alpha&acirc; <br>
betics are already accepted. Ispell will typically be used
with input from a file, meaning that preserving parity for
possible 8 bit characters from the input text is OK. If <br>
you specify the -l option, and actually type text from the
terminal, this may create problems if your stty settings
preserve parity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible to use -w
with certain characters. In particular, the flag-marker
character for the language (defined in the affix file, but
usually &quot;/&quot;) can never be made <br>
into a word character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -W option may be used to
change the length of words that ispell always accepts as
legal. Normally, ispell will accept all 1-character words as
legal, which is equivalent to <br>
specifying &quot;-W 1.&quot; (The default for this switch is
actually controlled by the MINWORD installation option, so
it may vary at your installation.) If you want all words to
be <br>
checked against the dictionary, regardless of length, you
might want to specify &quot;-W 0.&quot; On the other hand,
if your document specifies a lot of three-letter acronyms,
you would <br>
specify &quot;-W 3&quot; to accept all words of three
letters or less. Regardless of the setting of this option,
ispell will only generate words that are in the dictionary
as suggested <br>
replacements for words; this prevents the list from becoming
too long. Obviously, this option can be very dangerous,
since short misspellings may be missed. If you use this <br>
option a lot, you should probably make a last pass without
it before you publish your document, to protect yourself
against errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T option is used to specify
a default formatter type for use in generating string
characters. This switch overrides the default type
determined from the file name. The <br>
type argument may be either one of the unique names defined
in the language affix file (e.g., nroff) or a file suffix
including the dot (e.g., .tex). If no -T option appears and
<br>
no type can be determined from the file name, the default
string character type declared in the language affix file
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -k option is used to enhance
the behavior of certain deformatters. The name parameter
gives the name of a deformatter keyword set (see below), and
the list parameter gives a <br>
list of one or more keywords that are to be treated
specially. If list begins with a plus (+) sign, it is added
to the existing keywords; otherwise it replaces the existing
key&acirc; <br>
word list. For example, -ktexskip1 +bibliographystyle adds
&quot;bibliographystyle&quot; to the TeX skip-1 list, while
-khtmlignore pre,strong replaces the HTML ignore list with
&quot;pre&quot; and <br>
&quot;strong&quot;. The lists available are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texskip1 <br>
TeX/LaTeX commands that take a single argument that should
not be spell-checked, such as &quot;bibliographystyle&quot;.
The default is &quot;end&quot;, &quot;vspace&quot;,
&quot;hspace&quot;, &quot;cite&quot;, &quot;ref&quot;, <br>
&quot;parbox&quot;, &quot;label&quot;, &quot;input&quot;,
&quot;nocite&quot;, &quot;include&quot;,
&quot;includeonly&quot;, &quot;documentstyle&quot;,
&quot;documentclass&quot;, &quot;usepackage&quot;,
&quot;selectlanguage&quot;, &quot;pagestyle&quot;,
&quot;pagenumbering&quot;, &quot;hyphen&acirc; <br>
ation&quot;, &quot;pageref&quot;, and &quot;psfig&quot;,
plus &quot;bibliography&quot; in some installations. These
keywords are case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">texskip2 <br>
TeX/LaTeX commands that take two arguments that should not
be spell-checked, such as &quot;setlength&quot;. The default
is &quot;rule&quot;, &quot;setcounter&quot;,
&quot;addtocounter&quot;, &quot;setlength&quot;, <br>
&quot;addtolength&quot;, and &quot;settowidth&quot;. These
keywords are case-sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htmlignore <br>
HTML tags that delimit text that should not be spell-checked
until the matching end tag is reached. The default is
&quot;code&quot;, &quot;samp&quot;, &quot;kbd&quot;,
&quot;pre&quot;, &quot;listing&quot;, and
&quot;address&quot;. <br>
These keywords are case-insensitive. (Note that the content
inside HTML tags, such as HREF=, is not normally
checked.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htmlcheck <br>
Subfields that should be spell-checked even inside HTML
tags. The default is &quot;alt&quot;, so that the ALT=
portion of IMG tags will be spell-checked. These keywords
are case- <br>
insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the above keyword lists
can also be modified by environment variables whose names
are the same as above, except in uppercase, e.g., TEXSKIP1.
The -k switch overrides (or <br>
adds to) the environment variables, and the environment
variables override or add to the built-in defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -F switch specifies an
external deformatter program. This program should read data
from its standard input and write to its standard output.
The program must produce <br>
exactly one character of output for each character of input,
or ispell will lose synchronization and corrupt the output
file. Whitespace characters (especially blanks, tabs, and
<br>
newlines) and characters that should be spell-checked should
be passed through unchanged. Characters that should not be
spell-checked should be converted into blanks or other <br>
non-word characters. For example, an HTML deformatter might
turn all HTML tags into blanks, and also blank out all text
delimited by tags such as &quot;code&quot; or
&quot;kbd&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -F switch is the preferred
way to deformat files for ispell, and eventually will become
the only way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ispell is invoked without any
filenames or mode switches, it enters an interactive mode
designed to let the user check the spelling of individual
words. The program repeat&acirc; <br>
edly prompts on standard output with &quot;word:&quot; and
responds with either &quot;ok&quot; (possibly with
commentary), &quot;not found&quot;, or &quot;how about&quot;
followed by a list of suggestions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l or &quot;list&quot;
option to ispell is used to produce a list of misspelled
words from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option is intended to be
used from other programs through a pipe. In this mode,
ispell prints a one-line version identification message, and
then begins reading lines of <br>
input. For each input line, a single line is written to the
standard output for each word checked for spelling on the
line. If the word was found in the main dictionary, or <br>
your personal dictionary, then the line contains only a
&rsquo;*&rsquo;. If the word was found through affix
removal, then the line contains a &rsquo;+&rsquo;, a space,
and the root word. If the word <br>
was found through compound formation (concatenation of two
words, controlled by the -C option), then the line contains
only a &rsquo;-&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the word is not in the
dictionary, but there are near misses, then the line
contains an &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, a space, the misspelled
word, a space, the number of near misses, the number of <br>
characters between the beginning of the line and the
beginning of the misspelled word, a colon, another space,
and a list of the near misses separated by commas and
spaces. Fol&acirc; <br>
lowing the near misses (and identified only by the count of
near misses), if the word could be formed by adding
(illegal) affixes to a known root, is a list of suggested
deriva&acirc; <br>
tions, again separated by commas and spaces. If there are no
near misses at all, the line format is the same, except that
the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; is replaced by &rsquo;?&rsquo; (and
the near-miss count is <br>
always zero). The suggested derivations following the near
misses are in the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[prefix+] root [-prefix]
[-suffix] [+suffix]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(e.g., &quot;re+fry-y+ies&quot;
to get &quot;refries&quot;) where each optional pfx and sfx
is a string. Also, each near miss or guess is capitalized
the same as the input word unless such capital&acirc; <br>
ization is illegal; in the latter case each near miss is
capitalized correctly according to the dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, if the word does not
appear in the dictionary, and there are no near misses, then
the line contains a &rsquo;#&rsquo;, a space, the misspelled
word, a space, and the character off&acirc; <br>
set from the beginning of the line. Each sentence of text
input is terminated with an additional blank line,
indicating that ispell has completed processing the input
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These output lines can be
summarized as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK: *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Root: + &lt;root&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compound: <br>
-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miss: &amp; &lt;original&gt;
&lt;count&gt; &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;miss&gt;, &lt;miss&gt;,
..., &lt;guess&gt;, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Guess: ? &lt;original&gt; 0
&lt;offset&gt;: &lt;guess&gt;, &lt;guess&gt;, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">None: # &lt;original&gt;
&lt;offset&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a dummy dictionary
containing the words &quot;fray&quot;, &quot;Frey&quot;,
&quot;fry&quot;, and &quot;refried&quot; might produce the
following response to the command &quot;echo &rsquo;frqy
refries | ispell -a -m <br>
-d ./test.hash&quot;: <br>
(#) International Ispell Version 3.0.05 (beta), 08/10/91
<br>
&amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry <br>
&amp; refries 1 5: refried, re+fry-y+ies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mode is also suitable for
interactive use when you want to figure out the spelling of
a single word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A option works just like
-a, except that if a line begins with the string
&quot;&amp;Include_File&amp;&quot;, the rest of the line is
taken as the name of a file to read for further words. <br>
Input returns to the original file when the include file is
exhausted. Inclusion may be nested up to five deep. The key
string may be changed with the environment variable <br>
INCLUDE_STRING (the ampersands, if any, must be
included).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in the -a mode, ispell will
also accept lines of single words prefixed with any of
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;, &rsquo;@&rsquo;,
&rsquo;+&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo;, &rsquo;~&rsquo;,
&rsquo;#&rsquo;, &rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;%&rsquo;,
&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;, or &rsquo;^&rsquo;. A line starting
with &rsquo;*&rsquo; tells <br>
ispell to insert the word into the user&rsquo;s dictionary
(similar to the I command). A line starting with
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; tells ispell to insert an all-lowercase
version of the word into the <br>
user&rsquo;s dictionary (similar to the U command). A line
starting with &rsquo;@&rsquo; causes ispell to accept this
word in the future (similar to the A command). A line
starting with &rsquo;+&rsquo;, <br>
followed immediately by tex or nroff will cause ispell to
parse future input according the syntax of that formatter. A
line consisting solely of a &rsquo;+&rsquo; will place
ispell in <br>
TeX/LaTeX mode (similar to the -t option) and
&rsquo;-&rsquo; returns ispell to nroff/troff mode (but
these commands are obsolete). However, the string character
type is not changed; the <br>
&rsquo;~&rsquo; command must be used to do this. A line
starting with &rsquo;~&rsquo; causes ispell to set internal
parameters (in particular, the default string character
type) based on the filename <br>
given in the rest of the line. (A file suffix is sufficient,
but the period must be included. Instead of a file name or
suffix, a unique name, as listed in the language affix <br>
file, may be specified.) However, the formatter parsing is
not changed; the &rsquo;+&rsquo; command must be used to
change the formatter. A line prefixed with &rsquo;#&rsquo;
will cause the personal <br>
dictionary to be saved. A line prefixed with &rsquo;!&rsquo;
will turn on terse mode (see below), and a line prefixed
with &rsquo;%&rsquo; will return ispell to normal
(non-terse) mode. A line pre&acirc; <br>
fixed with &rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; will turn on
verbose-correction mode (see below); this mode can only be
disabled by turning on terse mode with &rsquo;%&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any input following the prefix
characters &rsquo;+&rsquo;, &rsquo;-&rsquo;,
&rsquo;#&rsquo;, &rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;%&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo; is ignored, as is any input following
the filename on a &rsquo;~&rsquo; line. To allow
spell-checking of lines <br>
beginning with these characters, a line starting with
&rsquo;^&rsquo; has that character removed before it is
passed to the spell-checking code. It is recommended that
programmatic inter&acirc; <br>
faces prefix every data line with an uparrow to protect
themselves against future changes in ispell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To summarize these:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Add to personal dictionary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ Accept word, but leave out of
dictionary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Save current personal
dictionary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ Set parameters based on
filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Enter TeX mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Exit TeX mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Enter terse mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% Exit terse mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo; Enter verbose-correction
mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^ Spell-check rest of line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In terse mode, ispell will not
print lines beginning with &rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;+&rsquo;,
or &rsquo;-&rsquo;, all of which indicate correct words.
This significantly improves running speed when the driving
pro&acirc; <br>
gram is going to ignore correct words anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In verbose-correction mode,
ispell includes the original word immediately after the
indicator character in output lines beginning with
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;+&rsquo;, and &rsquo;-&rsquo;, which
simplifies inter&acirc; <br>
action for some programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -s option is only valid in
conjunction with the -a or -A options, and only on
BSD-derived systems. If specified, ispell will stop itself
with a SIGTSTP signal after each <br>
line of input. It will not read more input until it receives
a SIGCONT signal. This may be useful for handshaking with
certain text editors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -f option is only valid in
conjunction with the -a or -A options. If -f is specified,
ispell will write its results to the given file, rather than
to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v option causes ispell to
print its current version identification on the standard
output and exit. If the switch is doubled, ispell will also
print the options that it was <br>
compiled with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c, -e[1-5], and -D options
of ispell, are primarily intended for use by the munchlist
shell script. The -c switch causes a list of words to be
read from the standard input. <br>
For each word, a list of possible root words and affixes
will be written to the standard output. Some of the root
words will be illegal and must be filtered from the output
by <br>
other means; the munchlist script does this. As an example,
the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo BOTHER | ispell -c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOTHER BOTHE/R BOTH/R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e switch is the reverse of
-c; it expands affix flags to produce a list of words. For
example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo BOTH/R | ispell -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOTH BOTHER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional expansion level can
also be specified. A level of 1 (-e1) is the same as -e
alone. A level of 2 causes the original root/affix
combination to be prepended to the <br>
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOTH/R BOTH BOTHER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A level of 3 causes multiple
lines to be output, one for each generated word, with the
original root/affix combination followed by the word it
creates:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOTH/R BOTH <br>
BOTH/R BOTHER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A level of 4 causes a
floating-point number to be appended to each of the level-3
lines, giving the ratio between the length of the root and
the total length of all generated <br>
words including the root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOTH/R BOTH 2.500000 <br>
BOTH/R BOTHER 2.500000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A level of 5 causes multiple
lines to be output, one for each generated word. If the
generated word did not use any affixes, the line is just
that word. If one or more affixes <br>
were used, the original root and the affixes actually used
are printed, joined by a plus sign; then the generated word
is printed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOTH <br>
BOTH+R BOTHER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the -D flag causes the
affix tables from the dictionary file to be dumped to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ispell is aware of the correct
capitalizations of words in the dictionary and in your
personal dictionary. As well as recognizing words that must
be capitalized (e.g., George) <br>
and words that must be all-capitals (e.g., NASA), it can
also handle words with &quot;unusual&quot; capitalization
(e.g., &quot;ITCorp&quot; or &quot;TeX&quot;). If a word is
capitalized incorrectly, the <br>
list of possibilities will include all acceptable
capitalizations. (More than one capitalization may be
acceptable; for example, my dictionary lists both
&quot;ITCorp&quot; and &quot;ITcorp&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, this feature will not
cause you surprises, but there is one circumstance you need
to be aware of. If you use &quot;I&quot; to add a word to
your dictionary that is at the begin&acirc; <br>
ning of a sentence (e.g., the first word of this paragraph
if &quot;normally&quot; were not in the dictionary), it will
be marked as &quot;capitalization required&quot;. A
subsequent usage of this <br>
word without capitalization (e.g., the quoted word in the
previous sentence) will be considered a misspelling by
ispell, and it will suggest the capitalized version. You
must <br>
then compare the actual spellings by eye, and then type
&quot;I&quot; to add the uncapitalized variant to your
personal dictionary. You can avoid this problem by using
&quot;U&quot; to add the <br>
original word, rather than &quot;I&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rules for capitalization are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(1) Any word may appear in all
capitals, as in headings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(2) Any word that is in the
dictionary in all-lowercase form may appear either in
lowercase or capitalized (as at the beginning of a
sentence).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(3) Any word that has
&quot;funny&quot; capitalization (i.e., it contains both
cases and there is an uppercase character besides the first)
must appear exactly as in the dictionary, <br>
except as permitted by rule (1). If the word is acceptable
in all-lowercase, it must appear thus in a dictionary
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">buildhash <br>
The buildhash program builds hashed dictionary files for
later use by ispell. The raw word list (with affix flags) is
given in dict-file, and the the affix flags are defined by
<br>
affix-file. The hashed output is written to hash-file. The
formats of the two input files are described in ispell(5).
The -s (silent) option suppresses the usual status
mes&acirc; <br>
sages that are written to the standard error device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">munchlist <br>
The munchlist shell script is used to reduce the size of
dictionary files, primarily personal dictionary files. It is
also capable of combining dictionaries from various <br>
sources. The given files are read (standard input if no
arguments are given), reduced to a minimal set of roots and
affixes that will match the same list of words, and written
<br>
to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input for munchlist contains of
raw words (e.g from your personal dictionary files) or root
and affix combinations (probably generated in earlier
munchlist runs). Each word or <br>
root/affix combination must be on a separate line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -D (debug) option leaves
temporary files around under standard names instead of
deleting them, so that the script can be debugged. Warning:
on a multiuser system, this can <br>
be a security hole. To avoid possible destruction of
important files, don&rsquo;t run the script as root, and set
MUNCHDEBUGDIR to the name of a directory that only you can
access.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v (verbose) option causes
progress messages to be reported to stderr so you
won&rsquo;t get nervous that munchlist has hung.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s (strip) option is
specified, words that are in the specified hash-file are
removed from the word list. This can be useful with personal
dictionaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option can be used to
specify an alternate affix-file for munching dictionaries in
languages other than English.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option can be used to
convert dictionaries that were built with an older affix
file, without risk of accidentally introducing unintended
affix combinations into the dic&acirc; <br>
tionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -T option allows
dictionaries to be converted to a canonical string-character
format. The suffix specified is looked up in the affix file
(-l switch) to determine the <br>
string-character format used for the input file; the output
always uses the canonical string-character format. For
example, a dictionary collected from TeX source files might
be <br>
converted to canonical format by specifying -T tex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -w option is passed on to
ispell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">findaffix <br>
The findaffix shell script is an aid to writers of new
language descriptions in choosing affixes. The given
dictionary files (standard input if none are given) are
examined for <br>
possible prefixes (-p switch) or suffixes (-s switch, the
default). Each commonly-occurring affix is presented along
with a count of the number of times it appears and an
esti&acirc; <br>
mate of the number of bytes that would be saved in a
dictionary hash file if it were added to the language table.
Only affixes that generate legal roots (found in the
original <br>
input) are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;-c&quot; option is
not given, the output lines are in the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">strip/add/count/bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where strip is the string that
should be stripped from a root word before adding the affix,
add is the affix to be added, count is a count of the number
of times that this <br>
strip/add combination appears, and bytes is an estimate of
the number of bytes that might be saved in the raw
dictionary file if this combination is added to the affix
file. The <br>
field separator in the output will be the tab character
specified by the -t switch; the default is a slash
(&quot;/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -c (&quot;clean
output&quot;) option is given, the appearance of the output
is made visually cleaner (but harder to post-process) by
changing it to:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-strip+add&lt;tab&gt;count&lt;tab&gt;bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where strip, add, count, and
bytes are as before, and &lt;tab&gt; represents the ASCII
tab character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method used to generate
possible affixes will also generate longer affixes which
have common headers or trailers. For example, the two words
&quot;moth&quot; and &quot;mother&quot; will gener&acirc;
<br>
ate not only the obvious substitution &quot;+er&quot; but
also &quot;-h+her&quot; and &quot;-th+ther&quot; (and
possibly even longer ones, depending on the value of min).
To prevent cluttering the output <br>
with such affixes, any affix pair that shares a common
header (or, for prefixes, trailer) string longer than elim
characters (default 1) will be suppressed. You may want to
set <br>
&quot;elim&quot; to a value greater than 1 if your language
has string characters; usually the need for this parameter
will become obvious when you examine the output of your
findaffix <br>
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the affixes are sorted
according to the estimate of bytes saved. The -f switch may
be used to cause the affixes to be sorted by frequency of
appearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To save output file space,
affixes which occur fewer than 10 times are eliminated; this
limit may be changed with the -l switch. The -M switch
specifies a maximum affix length <br>
(default 8). Affixes longer than this will not be reported.
(This saves on temporary disk space and makes the script run
faster.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Affixes which generate stems
shorter than 3 characters are suppressed. (A stem is the
word after the strip string has been removed, and before the
add string has been added.) <br>
This reduces both the running time and the size of the
output file. This limit may be changed with the -m switch.
The minimum stem length should only be set to 1 if you have
a <br>
lot of free time and disk space (in the range of many days
and hundreds of megabytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The findaffix script requires a
non-blank field-separator character for internal use.
Normally, this character is a slash (&quot;/&quot;), but if
the slash appears as a character in the <br>
input word list, a different character can be specified with
the -t switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ispell dictionaries should be
expanded before being fed to findaffix; in addition,
characters that are not in the English alphabet (if any)
should be translated to lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tryaffix <br>
The tryaffix shell script is used to estimate the
effectiveness of a proposed prefix (-p switch) or suffix (-s
switch, the default) with a given expanded-file. Only one
affix <br>
can be tried with each execution of tryaffix, although
multiple arguments can be used to describe varying forms of
the same affix flag (e.g., the D flag for English can add
<br>
either D or ED depending on whether a trailing E is already
present). Each word in the expanded dictionary that ends (or
begins) with the chosen suffix (or prefix) has that
suf&acirc; <br>
fix (prefix) removed; the dictionary is then searched for
root words that match the stripped word. Normally, all
matching roots are written to standard output, but if the -c
<br>
(count) flag is given, only a statistical summary of the
results is written. The statistics given are a count of
words the affix potentially applies to and an estimate of
the <br>
number of dictionary bytes that a flag using the affix would
save. The estimate will be high if the flag generates words
that are currently generated by other affix flags (e.g.,
<br>
in English, bathers can be generated by either bath/X or
bather/S).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dictionary file,
expanded-file, must already be expanded (using the -e switch
of ispell) and sorted, and things will usually work best if
uppercase has been folded to lower <br>
with &rsquo;tr&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The affix arguments are things
to be stripped from the dictionary file to produce trial
roots: for English, con (prefix) and ing (suffix) are
examples. The addition parts of the <br>
argument are letters that would have been stripped off the
root before adding the affix. For example, in English the
affix ing normally strips e for words ending in that letter
<br>
(e.g., like becomes liking) so we might run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tryaffix ing ing+e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to cover both cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the shell scripts contain
documentation as commentary at the beginning; sometimes
these comments contain useful information beyond the scope
of this manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to install ispell
in such a way as to only support ASCII range text if
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icombine <br>
The icombine program is a helper for munchlist. It reads a
list of words in dictionary format (roots plus flags) from
the standard input, and produces a reduced list on standard
<br>
output which combines common roots found on adjacent
entries. Identical roots which have differing flags will
have their flags combined, and roots which have differing
capital&acirc; <br>
izations will be combined in a way which only preserves
important capitalization information. The optional aff-file
specifies a language file which defines the character sets
<br>
used and the meanings of the various flags. The -T switch
can be used to select among alternative string character
types by giving a dummy suffix that can be found in an
alt&acirc; <br>
stringtype statement. The -w switch is identical to the same
switch in ispell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ijoin <br>
The ijoin program is a re-implementation of join(1) which
handles long lines and 8-bit characters correctly. The -s
switch specifies that the sort(1) program used to prepare
the <br>
input to ijoin uses signed comparisons on 8-bit characters;
the -u switch specifies that sort(1) uses unsigned
comparisons. All other options and behaviors of join(1) are
dupli&acirc; <br>
cated as exactly as possible based on the manual page,
except that ijoin will not handle newline as a field
separator. See the join(1) manual page for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
On some machines it takes too long for ispell to read in the
hash table, depending on size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When all options are enabled,
ispell may take several seconds to generate all the guesses
at corrections for a misspelled word; on slower machines
this time is long enough to be <br>
annoying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hash table is stored as a
quarter-megabyte (or larger) array, so a PDP-11 or 286
version does not seem likely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ispell should understand more
troff syntax, and deal more intelligently with
contractions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although small personal
dictionaries are sorted before they are written out, the
order of capitalizations of the same word is somewhat
random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -x flag is specified,
ispell will unlink any existing .bak file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are too many flags, and
many of them have non-mnemonic names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e flag should accept
mnemonic arguments instead of numeric ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Munchlist does not deal very
gracefully with dictionaries which contain
&quot;non-word&quot; characters. Such characters ought to be
deleted from the dictionary with a warning message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Findaffix and munchlist require
tremendous amounts of temporary file space for large
dictionaries. They do respect the TMPDIR environment
variable, so this space can be redi&acirc; <br>
rected. However, a lot of the temporary space needed is for
sorting, so TMPDIR is only a partial help on systems with an
uncooperative sort(1). (&quot;Cooperative&quot; is defined
as <br>
accepting the undocumented -T switch). At its peak usage,
munchlist takes 10 to 40 times the original
dictionary&rsquo;s size in Kb. (The larger ratio is for
dictionaries that <br>
already have heavy affix use, such as the one distributed
with ispell). Munchlist is also very slow; munching a
normal-sized dictionary (15K roots, 45K expanded words)
takes <br>
around an hour on a small workstation. (Most of this time is
spent in sort(1), and munchlist can run much faster on
machines that have a more modern sort that makes better use
<br>
of the memory available to it.) Findaffix is even worse; the
smallest English dictionary cannot be processed with this
script in a mere 50Kb of free space, and even after
speci&acirc; <br>
fying switches to reduce the temporary space required, the
script will run for over 24 hours on a small
workstation.</p>
