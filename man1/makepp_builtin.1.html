<p>MAKEPP_BUILTIN(1) Makepp MAKEPP_BUILTIN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
makepp_builtin -- Built in rules for makepp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Makepp may be able to figure out how to compile and link
your program even if you specify no rules at all (or if you
don&rsquo;t even have a Makeppfile). After every Makeppfile
is <br>
loaded, makepp also loads a set of default rules. (These
rules are special in that they do not override any other
rules in the Makeppfile.) The default rule database is
stored <br>
in the file &quot;makepp_builtin_rules.mk&quot; in the
makepp distribution or library directory, so you can always
look at that to see exactly what the default rules are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makepp&rsquo;s builtin rules are
almost the same as the rules in GNU make, except that it has
no rules for some of the rare languages that GNU make has
rules for. (This is deliberate; <br>
I often ran into trouble with GNU make on several projects
that accidentally reused some of the suffixes that GNU make
assigned to those rare languages.) The rules use the same
<br>
variables as GNU make, with some possibly useful additions.
Makepp is smarter than GNU make about inferring which
compiler to use, and which other objects and libraries to
link <br>
in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default variable values <br>
Makepp supplies default values for a number of variables.
Most of these are typically used in rules, and are indeed
used in the default rules. Their values can be overridden by
<br>
assigning to these variables in your Makeppfile or on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables are documented
in &quot;Predefined Variables&quot; in makepp_variables. If
you have any questions about what any variable evaluates to,
you can always put a line like <br>
either of these lines in your Makeppfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dummy := $(print $(CC)) <br>
&amp;echo -- $(CC) # Must be indented less than previous
rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which simply prints the value of
the &quot;$(CC)&quot; variable when the Makeppfile is
loaded. (Incidentally, this is a useful way to debug any
expression that you&rsquo;re not sure is right.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compilation rules <br>
In simplified form, here is approximately what the
compilation rules look like. If you change the values of any
of the indicated variables, the compilation command is
changed as <br>
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# For C programs: <br>
# <br>
%.o: %.c <br>
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# For C++ programs: <br>
# <br>
%.o: %.cxx # and also %.cc, %.cpp, %.c++, and %.C <br>
$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# For Fortran programs: <br>
# <br>
%.o: %.f <br>
$(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# Yacc and lex: <br>
# <br>
%.c: %.y <br>
$(YACC) $(YFLAGS) $(input) <br>
&amp;mv -f y.tab.c $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.c: %.l <br>
$(LEX) $(LFLAGS) -t $(input) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re curious about
the exact details, you can look in the file
makepp_builtin_rules.mk in the makepp distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link rules <br>
Makepp also knows how to link programs, too. Makepp attempts
to be more clever than the standard Unix make when it comes
to figuring out a link command. Suppose you are trying <br>
to build the target program &quot;xyz&quot;. Makepp will try
to build this from &quot;xyz.o&quot;, and (unlike the
standard Unix make) it will also attempt to infer whether
any other objects or <br>
libraries need to be linked in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The link rule looks something
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xyz: $(infer_objects xyz.o, *.o)
<br>
$(infer_linker $(inputs)) $(inputs) $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)
$(LIBS) -o $(output)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;$(infer_objects)&quot;
attempts to infer what other &quot;.o&quot; files need to be
linked in based on what &quot;.h&quot; files are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;inferred linker&quot;
is a special bit of magic that turns into &quot;$(CC)&quot;
if all the sources are C code, &quot;$(CXX)&quot; if any of
the sources are C++, or &quot;$(F77)&quot; if any of the
sources <br>
are Fortran.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turning off the built-in rules
<br>
If you don&rsquo;t like the built-in rules, don&rsquo;t use
them. If they don&rsquo;t work for you, your built is
probably sufficiently complicated that you need your own
custom Makeppfile <br>
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To turn off the builtin rules,
you can add a line like this to your Makeppfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp_no_builtin = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you do use them, but not the
fairly expensive builtin linker rules, you can turn those
off with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makepp_no_builtin_linker = 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility,
makepp also turns off its default rules if you include this
line somewhere in your Makeppfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.SUFFIXES:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can turn off builtin rules
for every Makeppfile in the entire build by specifying the
&quot;--no-builtin-rules&quot; option on the command
line.</p>
