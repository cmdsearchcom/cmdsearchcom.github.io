makepp_builtin -- Built in rules for makepp
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Makepp may be able to figure out how to compile and link your program even if
  you specify no rules at all (or if you don't even have a Makeppfile). After
  every Makeppfile is loaded, makepp also loads a set of default rules. (These
  rules are special in that they do not override any other rules in the
  Makeppfile.) The default rule database is stored in the file
  &quot;makepp_builtin_rules.mk&quot; in the makepp distribution or library
  directory, so you can always look at that to see exactly what the default
  rules are.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Makepp's builtin rules are almost the same as the rules in GNU make, except that
  it has no rules for some of the rare languages that GNU make has rules for.
  (This is deliberate; I often ran into trouble with GNU make on several
  projects that accidentally reused some of the suffixes that GNU make assigned
  to those rare languages.) The rules use the same variables as GNU make, with
  some possibly useful additions. Makepp is smarter than GNU make about
  inferring which compiler to use, and which other objects and libraries to link
  in.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Default_variable_values"><a class="selflink" href="#Default_variable_values">Default
  variable values</a></h2>
Makepp supplies default values for a number of variables. Most of these are
  typically used in rules, and are indeed used in the default rules. Their
  values can be overridden by assigning to these variables in your Makeppfile or
  on the command line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These variables are documented in &quot;Predefined Variables&quot; in
  makepp_variables. If you have any questions about what any variable evaluates
  to, you can always put a line like either of these lines in your Makeppfile:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    dummy := $(print $(CC))
    &amp;echo -- $(CC)              # Must be indented less than previous rule.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which simply prints the value of the &quot;$(CC)&quot; variable when the
  Makeppfile is loaded. (Incidentally, this is a useful way to debug any
  expression that you're not sure is right.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compilation_rules"><a class="selflink" href="#Compilation_rules">Compilation
  rules</a></h2>
In simplified form, here is approximately what the compilation rules look like.
  If you change the values of any of the indicated variables, the compilation
  command is changed as expected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    #
    # For C programs:
    #
    %.o: %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
 
    #
    # For C++ programs:
    #
    %.o: %.cxx # and also %.cc, %.cpp, %.c++, and %.C
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
 
    #
    # For Fortran programs:
    #
    %.o: %.f
        $(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c $(input) -o $(output)
 
    #
    # Yacc and lex:
    #
    %.c: %.y
        $(YACC) $(YFLAGS) $(input)
        &amp;mv -f y.tab.c $(output)
 
    %.c: %.l
        $(LEX) $(LFLAGS) -t $(input) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you're curious about the exact details, you can look in the file
  <i>makepp_builtin_rules.mk</i> in the makepp distribution.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Link_rules"><a class="selflink" href="#Link_rules">Link
  rules</a></h2>
Makepp also knows how to link programs, too. Makepp attempts to be more clever
  than the standard Unix make when it comes to figuring out a link command.
  Suppose you are trying to build the target program &quot;xyz&quot;. Makepp
  will try to build this from &quot;xyz.o&quot;, and (unlike the standard Unix
  make) it will also attempt to infer whether any other objects or libraries
  need to be linked in.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The link rule looks something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    xyz: $(infer_objects xyz.o, *.o)
        $(infer_linker $(inputs)) $(inputs) $(LDFLAGS) $(LDLIBS) $(LIBS) -o $(output)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;$(infer_objects)&quot; attempts to infer what other &quot;.o&quot; files
  need to be linked in based on what &quot;.h&quot; files are included.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;inferred linker&quot; is a special bit of magic that turns into
  &quot;$(CC)&quot; if all the sources are C code, &quot;$(CXX)&quot; if any of
  the sources are C++, or &quot;$(F77)&quot; if any of the sources are Fortran.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Turning_off_the_built-in_rules"><a class="selflink" href="#Turning_off_the_built-in_rules">Turning
  off the built-in rules</a></h2>
If you don't like the built-in rules, don't use them. If they don't work for
  you, your built is probably sufficiently complicated that you need your own
  custom Makeppfile anyway.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To turn off the builtin rules, you can add a line like this to your Makeppfile:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    makepp_no_builtin = 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you do use them, but not the fairly expensive builtin linker rules, you can
  turn those off with:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    makepp_no_builtin_linker = 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For backward compatibility, makepp also turns off its default rules if you
  include this line somewhere in your Makeppfile:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    .SUFFIXES:
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can turn off builtin rules for every Makeppfile in the entire build by
  specifying the &quot;--no-builtin-rules&quot; option on the command
  line.</div>
