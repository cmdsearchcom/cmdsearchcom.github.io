editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNTAX">SYNTAX</a></h1>
<b>editres</b> [ <i>-toolkitoption</i> ... ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>Editres</i> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see
  <i>X(7)</i>). The order of the command line options is not important.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Editres is a tool that allows users and application developers to view the full
  widget hierarchy of any X Toolkit application that speaks the Editres
  protocol. In addition, editres will help the user construct resource
  specifications, allow the user to apply the resource to the application and
  view the results dynamically. Once the user is happy with a resource
  specification editres will append the resource string to the user's X
  Resources file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_EDITRES"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_EDITRES">USING
  EDITRES</a></h1>
<i>Editres</i> provides a window consisting of the following four areas:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Menu Bar</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A set of popup menus that allow you full access to
      editres's features.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Panner</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The panner allows a more intuitive way to scroll the
      application tree display.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Message Area</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Displays information to the user about the action that
      editres expects of her.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Application Widget Tree</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This area will be used to display the selected
      application's widget tree.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To begin an editres session select the <b>Get Widget Tree</b> menu item from the
  command menu. This will change the pointer cursor to cross hair. You should
  now select the application you wish look at by clicking on any of its windows.
  If this application understands the editres protocol then editres will display
  the application's widget tree in its tree window. If the application does not
  understand the editres protocol editres will inform you of this fact in the
  message area after a few seconds delay.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you have a widget tree you may now select any of the other menu options.
  The effect of each of these is described below.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Get Widget Tree</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allows the user to click on any application that speaks the
      editres protocol and receive its widget tree.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Refresh Current Widget Tree</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Editres only knows about the widgets that exist at the
      present time. Many applications create and destroy widgets on the fly.
      Selecting this menu item will cause editres to ask the application to
      resend its widget tree, thus updating its information to the new state of
      the application.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For example, xman only creates the widgets for its
      <i>topbox</i> when it starts up. None of the widgets for the manual page
      window are created until the user actually clicks on the <i>Manual
      Page</i> button. If you retrieved xman's widget tree before the the manual
      page is active, you may wish to refresh the widget tree after the manual
      page has been displayed. This will allow you to also edit the manual
      page's resources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Dump Widget Tree to a File</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For documenting applications it is often useful to be able
      to dump the entire application widget tree to an ASCII file. This file can
      then be included in the manual page. When this menu item is selected a
      popup dialog is activated. Type the name of the file in this dialog, and
      either select <i>okay</i>, or type a carriage-return. Editres will now
      dump the widget tree to this file. To cancel the file dialog, select the
      <i>cancel</i> button.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Show Resource Box</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command will popup a resource box for the current
      application. This resource box (described in detail below) will allow the
      user to see exactly which resources can be set for the widget that is
      currently selected in the widget tree display. Only one widget may be
      currently selected; if greater or fewer are selected editres will refuse
      to pop up the resource box and put an error message in the <b>Message
      Area</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Set Resource</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This command will popup a simple dialog box for setting an
      arbitrary resource on all selected widgets. You must type in the resource
      name, as well as the value. You can use the Tab key to switch between the

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TREE_COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#TREE_COMMANDS">TREE
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
The <b>Tree</b> menu contains several commands that allow operations to be
  performed on the widget tree.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Select Widget in Client</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This menu item allows you to select any widget in the
      application; editres will then highlight the corresponding element the
      widget tree display. Once this menu item is selected the pointer cursor
      will again turn to a crosshair, and you must click any pointer button in
      the widget you wish to have displayed. Since some widgets are fully
      obscured by their children, it is not possible to get to every widget this
      way, but this mechanism does give very useful feedback between the
      elements in the widget tree and those in the actual application.</dd>

In addition there are keyboard accelerators for each of the Tree operations. If
  the input focus is over an individual widget in the tree, then that operation
  will only effect that widget. If the input focus is in the Tree background it
  will have exactly the same effect as the corresponding menu item.

The translation entries shown may be applied to any widget in the application.
  If that widget is a child of the Tree widget, then it will only affect that

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">The Widget Names and Classes</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This area allows you to select exactly which widgets this
      resource will apply to. The area contains four lines, the first contains
      the name of the selected widget and all its ancestors, and the more
      restrictive dot ( <b>.</b>) separator. The second line contains less
      specific the Class names of each widget, and well as the less restrictive
      star ( <b>*</b>) separator. The third line contains a set of special
      buttons called <b>Any Widget</b> which will generalize this level to match
      any widget. The last line contains a set of special buttons called
      <b>Any</b> <b>Widget Chain</b> which will turn the single level into
      something that matches zero or more levels.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The initial state of this area is the most restrictive, using the resource
      names and the dot separator. By selecting the other buttons in this area
      you can ease the restrictions to allow more and more widgets to match the
      specification. The extreme case is to select all the <b>Any Widget
      Chain</b> buttons, which will match every widget in the application. As
      you select different buttons the tree display will update to show you

  <dd class="It-tag">This button attempts to perform a XtSetValues call on all
      widgets that match the <b>resource line</b> described above. The value
      specified is applied directly to all matching widgets. This behavior is an
      attempt to give a dynamic feel to the resource editor. Since this feature
      allows users to put an application in states it may not be willing to
      handle, a hook has been provided to allow specific applications to block
      these SetValues requests (see <b>Blocking Editres Requests</b> below).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Unfortunately due to design constraints imposed on the widgets by the X
      Toolkit and the Resource Manager, trying to coerce an inherently static
      system into dynamic behavior can cause strange results. There is no
      guarantee that the results of an apply will be the same as what will
      happen when you save the value and restart the application. This
      functionality is provided to try to give you a rough feel for what your
      changes will accomplish, and the results obtained should be considered
      suspect at best. Having said that, this is one of the neatest features of

  EDITRES REQUESTS</a></h1>
The editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget set. This allows all
  applications that are linked against Xaw to be able to speak to the resource
  editor. While this provides great flexibility, and is a useful tool, it can
  quite easily be abused. It is therefore possible for any Xaw application to
  specify a value for the <b>editresBlock</b> resource described below, to keep
  editres from divulging information about its internals, or to disable the
  <b>SetValues</b> part of the protocol.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>editresBlock (<b>Class</b><b> EditresBlock)</b></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to
      impose on the editres protocol.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The accepted values are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">all</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Block all requests.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">setValues</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Block all SetValues requests. As this is the only editres
      request that actually modifies the application, this is in effect stating
      that the application is read-only.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">none</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allow all editres requests.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember that these resources are set on any Xaw application, <b>not</b>
  <b>editres</b>. They allow individual applications to keep all or some of the
  requests editres makes from ever succeeding. Of course, editres is also an Xaw
  application, so it may also be viewed and modified by editres (rather
  recursive, I know), these commands can be blocked by setting the
  <b>editresBlock</b> resource on editres itself.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESOURCES"><a class="selflink" href="#RESOURCES">RESOURCES</a></h1>
For <i>editres</i> the available application resources are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
