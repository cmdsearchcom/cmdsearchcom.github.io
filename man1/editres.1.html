<p>EDITRES(1) General Commands Manual EDITRES(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit
applications</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
editres [ -toolkitoption ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Editres accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line
options (see X(7)). The order of the command line options is
not important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Editres is a tool that allows users and application
developers to view the full widget hierarchy of any X
Toolkit application that speaks the Editres protocol. In
addition, <br>
editres will help the user construct resource
specifications, allow the user to apply the resource to the
application and view the results dynamically. Once the user
is happy <br>
with a resource specification editres will append the
resource string to the user&rsquo;s X Resources file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING EDITRES <br>
Editres provides a window consisting of the following four
areas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu Bar A set of popup menus
that allow you full access to editres&rsquo;s features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panner The panner allows a more
intuitive way to scroll the application tree display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message Area Displays
information to the user about the action that editres
expects of her.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Application Widget Tree This
area will be used to display the selected
application&rsquo;s widget tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To begin an editres session
select the Get Widget Tree menu item from the command menu.
This will change the pointer cursor to cross hair. You
should now select the application <br>
you wish look at by clicking on any of its windows. If this
application understands the editres protocol then editres
will display the application&rsquo;s widget tree in its tree
win&acirc; <br>
dow. If the application does not understand the editres
protocol editres will inform you of this fact in the message
area after a few seconds delay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have a widget tree you
may now select any of the other menu options. The effect of
each of these is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Get Widget Tree <br>
Allows the user to click on any application that speaks the
editres protocol and receive its widget tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refresh Current Widget Tree <br>
Editres only knows about the widgets that exist at the
present time. Many applications create and destroy widgets
on the fly. Selecting this menu item will cause <br>
editres to ask the application to resend its widget tree,
thus updating its information to the new state of the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, xman only creates
the widgets for its topbox when it starts up. None of the
widgets for the manual page window are created until the
user actually clicks on <br>
the Manual Page button. If you retrieved xman&rsquo;s widget
tree before the the manual page is active, you may wish to
refresh the widget tree after the manual page has been <br>
displayed. This will allow you to also edit the manual
page&rsquo;s resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dump Widget Tree to a File <br>
For documenting applications it is often useful to be able
to dump the entire application widget tree to an ASCII file.
This file can then be included in the manual <br>
page. When this menu item is selected a popup dialog is
activated. Type the name of the file in this dialog, and
either select okay, or type a carriage-return. Editres <br>
will now dump the widget tree to this file. To cancel the
file dialog, select the cancel button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Resource Box <br>
This command will popup a resource box for the current
application. This resource box (described in detail below)
will allow the user to see exactly which resources can <br>
be set for the widget that is currently selected in the
widget tree display. Only one widget may be currently
selected; if greater or fewer are selected editres will <br>
refuse to pop up the resource box and put an error message
in the Message Area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Resource <br>
This command will popup a simple dialog box for setting an
arbitrary resource on all selected widgets. You must type in
the resource name, as well as the value. You can <br>
use the Tab key to switch between the resource name field
the resource value field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit Exits editres.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TREE COMMANDS <br>
The Tree menu contains several commands that allow
operations to be performed on the widget tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Widget in Client <br>
This menu item allows you to select any widget in the
application; editres will then highlight the corresponding
element the widget tree display. Once this menu item is <br>
selected the pointer cursor will again turn to a crosshair,
and you must click any pointer button in the widget you wish
to have displayed. Since some widgets are fully <br>
obscured by their children, it is not possible to get to
every widget this way, but this mechanism does give very
useful feedback between the elements in the widget tree <br>
and those in the actual application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select All</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unselect All</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invert All <br>
These functions allow the user to select, unselect, or
invert all widgets in the widget tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Children</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Parents <br>
These functions select the immediate parent or children of
each of the currently selected widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Descendants</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select Ancestors <br>
These functions select all parents or children of each of
the currently selected widgets. This is a recursive
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Widget Names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Class Names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Widget IDs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show Widget Windows <br>
When the tree widget is initially displayed the labels of
each widget in the tree correspond to the widget names.
These functions will cause the label of all widgets in <br>
the tree to be changed to show the class name, IDs, or
window associated with each widget in the application. The
widget IDs, and windows are shown as hex numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition there are keyboard
accelerators for each of the Tree operations. If the input
focus is over an individual widget in the tree, then that
operation will only effect <br>
that widget. If the input focus is in the Tree background it
will have exactly the same effect as the corresponding menu
item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The translation entries shown
may be applied to any widget in the application. If that
widget is a child of the Tree widget, then it will only
affect that widget, otherwise it <br>
will have the same effect as the commands in the tree
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flash Active Widgets <br>
This command is the inverse of the Select Widget in Client
command, it will show the user each widget that is currently
selected in the widget tree, by flashing the corre&acirc;
<br>
sponding widget in the application numFlashes (three by
default) times in the flashColor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Option Translation Entry
<br>
- <br>
space Unselect Select(nothing) <br>
w Select Select(widget) <br>
s Select Select(all) <br>
i Invert Select(invert) <br>
c Select Children Select(children) <br>

C Show Class Names Relabel(class) <br>
I Show Widget IDs Relabel(id) <br>
W Show Widget Windows Relabel(window) <br>
T Toggle Widget/Class Name Relabel(toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clicking button 1 on a widget
adds it to the set of selected widgets. Clicking button 2 on
a widget deselects all other widgets and then selects just
that widget. Click&acirc; <br>
ing button 3 on a widget toggles its label between the
widget&rsquo;s instance name the widget&rsquo;s class
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING THE RESOURCE BOX <br>
The resource box contains five different areas. Each of the
areas, as they appear on the screen, from top to bottom will
be discussed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Resource Line <br>
This area at the top of the resource box shows the current
resource name exactly as it would appear if you were to save
it to a file or apply it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Widget Names and Classes
<br>
This area allows you to select exactly which widgets this
resource will apply to. The area contains four lines, the
first contains the name of the selected widget and all <br>
its ancestors, and the more restrictive dot (.) separator.
The second line contains less specific the Class names of
each widget, and well as the less restrictive star <br>
(*) separator. The third line contains a set of special
buttons called Any Widget which will generalize this level
to match any widget. The last line contains a set of <br>
special buttons called Any Widget Chain which will turn the
single level into something that matches zero or more
levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial state of this area
is the most restrictive, using the resource names and the
dot separator. By selecting the other buttons in this area
you can ease the <br>
restrictions to allow more and more widgets to match the
specification. The extreme case is to select all the Any
Widget Chain buttons, which will match every widget in <br>
the application. As you select different buttons the tree
display will update to show you exactly which widgets will
be effected by the current resource specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal and Constraint Resources
<br>
The next area allows you to select the name of the normal or
constraint resources you wish to set. Some widgets may not
have constraint resources, so that area will not <br>
appear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resource Value <br>
This next area allows you to enter the resource value. This
value should be entered exactly as you would type a line
into your resource file. Thus it should contain no <br>
unescaped new-lines. There are a few special character
sequences for this file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- This will be replaced with a
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NULL byte can be stored by
specifying 00.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;new-line&gt; - This will
compress to nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">\ - This will compress to a
single backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Area <br>
This area contains several command buttons, described in
this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Save File <br>
This button allows the user to modify file that the
resources will be saved to. This button will bring up a
dialog box that will ask you for a filename; once the
filename <br>
has been entered, either hit carriage-return or click on the
okay button. To pop down the dialog box without changing the
save file, click the cancel button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save This button will append the
resource line described above to the end of the current save
file. If no save file has been set the Set Save File dialog
box will be popped up <br>
to prompt the user for a filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apply This button attempts to
perform a XtSetValues call on all widgets that match the
resource line described above. The value specified is
applied directly to all matching <br>
widgets. This behavior is an attempt to give a dynamic feel
to the resource editor. Since this feature allows users to
put an application in states it may not be willing <br>
to handle, a hook has been provided to allow specific
applications to block these SetValues requests (see Blocking
Editres Requests below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately due to design
constraints imposed on the widgets by the X Toolkit and the
Resource Manager, trying to coerce an inherently static
system into dynamic behav&acirc; <br>
ior can cause strange results. There is no guarantee that
the results of an apply will be the same as what will happen
when you save the value and restart the applica&acirc; <br>
tion. This functionality is provided to try to give you a
rough feel for what your changes will accomplish, and the
results obtained should be considered suspect at best. <br>
Having said that, this is one of the neatest features of
editres, and I strongly suggest that you play with it, and
see what it can do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save and Apply <br>
This button combines the Save and Apply actions described
above into one button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popdown Resource Box <br>
This button will remove the resource box from the
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCKING EDITRES REQUESTS <br>
The editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget
set. This allows all applications that are linked against
Xaw to be able to speak to the resource editor. While this
<br>
provides great flexibility, and is a useful tool, it can
quite easily be abused. It is therefore possible for any Xaw
application to specify a value for the editresBlock <br>
resource described below, to keep editres from divulging
information about its internals, or to disable the SetValues
part of the protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editresBlock (Class
EditresBlock) <br>
Specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to
impose on the editres protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The accepted values are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Block all requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setValues Block all SetValues
requests. As this is the only editres request that actually
modifies the application, this is in effect stating that the
application is read- <br>
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none Allow all editres
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that these resources
are set on any Xaw application, not editres. They allow
individual applications to keep all or some of the requests
editres makes from ever suc&acirc; <br>
ceeding. Of course, editres is also an Xaw application, so
it may also be viewed and modified by editres (rather
recursive, I know), these commands can be blocked by setting
the <br>
editresBlock resource on editres itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>
For editres the available application resources are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numFlashes (Class NumFlashes)
<br>
Specifies the number of times the widgets in the application
will be flashed when the Show Active Widgets command in
invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flashTime (Class FlashTime) <br>
Amount of time between the flashes described above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flashColor (Class flashColor)
<br>
Specifies the color used to flash application widgets. A
bright color should be used that will immediately draw your
attention to the area being flashed, such as red or <br>
yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">saveResourcesFile (Class
SaveResourcesFile) <br>
This is the file the resource line will be append to when
the Save button activated in the resource box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDGETS <br>
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the
hierarchy of the widgets which compose editres. In the
notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical
structure. The <br>
widget class name is given first, followed by the widget
instance name.</p>

about what a resource editor can do.</p>
