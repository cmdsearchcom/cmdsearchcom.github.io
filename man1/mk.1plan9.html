<p>MK(1plan9) MK(1plan9)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mk - maintain (make) related files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mk [ -f mkfile ] ... [ option ... ] [ target ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Mk uses the dependency rules specified in mkfile to control
the update (usually by compilation) of targets (usually
files) from the source files upon which they depend. The
<br>
mkfile (default contains a rule for each target that
identifies the files and other targets upon which it depends
and an sh(1) script, a recipe, to update the target. The
script <br>
is run if the target does not exist or if it is older than
any of the files it depends on. Mkfile may also contain
meta-rules that define actions for updating implicit
targets. <br>
If no target is specified, the target of the first rule (not
meta-rule) in mkfile is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable $NPROC
determines how many targets may be updated simultaneously;
Some operating systems, e.g., Plan 9, set $NPROC
automatically to the number of CPUs on <br>
the current machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Assume all targets to be out
of date. Thus, everything is updated. <br>
-d[egp] Produce debugging output (p is for parsing, g for
graph building, e for execution). <br>
-e Explain why each target is made. <br>
-i Force any missing intermediate targets to be made. <br>
-k Do as much work as possible in the face of errors. <br>
-n Print, but do not execute, the commands needed to update
the targets. <br>
-s Make the command line arguments sequentially rather than
in parallel. <br>
-t Touch (update the modified date of) file targets, without
executing any recipes. <br>
-wtarget1,target2,... <br>
Pretend the modify time for each target is the current time;
useful in conjunction with -n to learn what updates would be
triggered by modifying the targets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mkfile <br>
A mkfile consists of assignments (described under
&lsquo;Environment&rsquo;) and rules. A rule contains
targets and a tail. A target is a literal string and is
normally a file name. The <br>
tail contains zero or more prerequisites and an optional
recipe, which is an shell script. Each line of the recipe
must begin with white space. A rule takes the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target: prereq1 prereq2 <br>
recipe using prereq1, prereq2 to build target</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the recipe is executed, the
first character on every line is elided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the colon on the target
line, a rule may specify attributes, described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A meta-rule has a target of the
form A%B where A and B are (possibly empty) strings. A
meta-rule acts as a rule for any potential target whose name
matches A%B with % replaced <br>
by an arbitrary string, called the stem. In interpreting a
meta-rule, the stem is substituted for all occurrences of %
in the prerequisite names. In the recipe of a meta-rule,
<br>
the environment variable $stem contains the string matched
by the %. For example, a meta-rule to compile a C program
using 9c(1) might be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%: %.c <br>
9c -c $stem.c <br>
9l -o $stem $stem.o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Meta-rules may contain an
ampersand &amp; rather than a percent sign %. A % matches a
maximal length string of any characters; an &amp; matches a
maximal length string of any characters <br>
except period or slash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text of the mkfile is
processed as follows. Lines beginning with &lt; followed by
a file name are replaced by the contents of the named file.
Lines beginning with &lt;| followed <br>
by a file name are replaced by the output of the execution
of the named file. Blank lines and comments, which run from
unquoted # characters to the following newline, are <br>
deleted. The character sequence backslash-newline is
deleted, so long lines in mkfile may be folded. Non-recipe
lines are processed by substituting for &lsquo;{command} the
output of <br>
the command when run by sh. References to variables are
replaced by the variables&rsquo; values. Special characters
may be quoted using single quotes &rsquo;&rsquo; as in
sh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assignments and rules are
distinguished by the first unquoted occurrence of : (rule)
or = (assignment).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A later rule may modify or
override an existing rule under the following
conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If the targets of the rules
exactly match and one rule contains only a prerequisite
clause and no recipe, the clause is added to the
prerequisites of the other rule. If <br>
either or both targets are virtual, the recipe is always
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If the targets of the rules
match exactly and the prerequisites do not match and both
rules contain recipes, mk reports an &lsquo;&lsquo;ambiguous
recipe&rsquo;&rsquo; error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- If the target and
prerequisites of both rules match exactly, the second rule
overrides the first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment <br>
Rules may make use of shell environment variables. A legal
reference of the form $OBJ or ${name} is expanded as in
sh(1). A reference of the form ${name:A%B=C%D}, where A, B,
<br>
C, D are (possibly empty) strings, has the value formed by
expanding $name and substituting C for A and D for B in each
word in $name that matches pattern A%B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables can be set by
assignments of the form <br>
var=[attr=]value <br>
Blanks in the value break it into words. Such variables are
exported to the environment of recipes as they are executed,
unless U, the only legal attribute attr, is present. <br>
The initial value of a variable is taken from (in increasing
order of precedence) the default values below, mk&rsquo;s
environment, the mkfiles, and any command line assignment as
an <br>
argument to mk. A variable assignment argument overrides the
first (but not any subsequent) assignment to that
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variable MKFLAGS contains
all the option arguments (arguments starting with or
containing and MKARGS contains all the targets in the call
to mk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The variable MKSHELL contains
the shell command line mk uses to run recipes. If the first
word of the command ends in rc or rcsh, mk uses
rc(1)&rsquo;s quoting rules; otherwise it <br>
uses sh(1)&rsquo;s. The MKSHELL variable is consulted when
the mkfile is read, not when it is executed, so that
different shells can be used within a single mkfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKSHELL=$PLAN9/bin/rc <br>
use-rc:V: <br>
for(i in a b c) echo $i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKSHELL=sh <br>
use-sh:V: <br>
for i in a b c; do echo $i; done</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mkfiles included via &lt; or
&lt;| (q.v.) see their own private copy of MKSHELL, which
always starts set to sh .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dynamic information may be
included in the mkfile by using a line of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;|command args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This runs the command command
with the given arguments args and pipes its standard output
to mk to be included as part of the mkfile. For instance,
the Inferno kernels use this <br>
technique to run a shell command with an awk script and a
configuration file as arguments in order for the awk script
to process the file and output a set of variables and their
<br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execution <br>
During execution, mk determines which targets must be
updated, and in what order, to build the names specified on
the command line. It then runs the associated recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A target is considered up to
date if it has no prerequisites or if all its prerequisites
are up to date and it is newer than all its prerequisites.
Once the recipe for a target <br>
has executed, the target is considered up to date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The date stamp used to determine
if a target is up to date is computed differently for
different types of targets. If a target is virtual (the
target of a rule with the V <br>
attribute), its date stamp is initially zero; when the
target is updated the date stamp is set to the most recent
date stamp of its prerequisites. Otherwise, if a target does
<br>
not exist as a file, its date stamp is set to the most
recent date stamp of its prerequisites, or zero if it has no
prerequisites. Otherwise, the target is the name of a file
<br>
and the target&rsquo;s date stamp is always that
file&rsquo;s modification date. The date stamp is computed
when the target is needed in the execution of a rule; it is
not a static value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nonexistent targets that have
prerequisites and are themselves prerequisites are treated
specially. Such a target t is given the date stamp of its
most recent prerequisite and <br>
if this causes all the targets which have t as a
prerequisite to be up to date, t is considered up to date.
Otherwise, t is made in the normal fashion. The -i flag
overrides <br>
this special treatment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files may be made in any order
that respects the preceding restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A recipe is executed by
supplying the recipe as standard input to the command
/bin/sh. (Note that unlike make, mk feeds the entire recipe
to the shell rather than running each <br>
line of the recipe separately.) The environment is augmented
by the following variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$alltarget all the targets of
this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$newprereq the prerequisites
that caused this rule to execute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$newmember the prerequisites
that are members of an aggregate that caused this rule to
execute. When the prerequisites of a rule are members of an
aggregate, $newprereq con&acirc; <br>
tains the name of the aggregate and out of date members,
while $newmember contains only the name of the members.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$nproc the process slot for this
recipe. It satisfies 0&acirc;&curren;$nproc&lt;$NPROC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$pid the process id for the mk
executing the recipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$prereq all the prerequisites
for this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$stem if this is a meta-rule,
$stem is the string that matched % or &amp;. Otherwise, it
is empty. For regular expression meta-rules (see below), the
variables are set to <br>
the corresponding subexpressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$target the targets for this
rule that need to be remade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables are available
only during the execution of a recipe, not while evaluating
the mkfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless the rule has the Q
attribute, the recipe is printed prior to execution with
recognizable environment variables expanded. Commands
returning error status cause mk to ter&acirc; <br>
minate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recipes and backquoted rc
commands in places such as assignments execute in a copy of
mk&rsquo;s environment; changes they make to environment
variables are not visible from mk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable substitution in a rule
is done when the rule is read; variable substitution in the
recipe is done when the recipe is executed. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bar=a.c <br>
foo: $bar <br>
$CC -o foo $bar <br>
bar=b.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will compile b.c into foo, if
a.c is newer than foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Aggregates <br>
Names of the form a(b) refer to member b of the aggregate a.
Currently, the only aggregates supported are 9ar (see 9c(1))
archives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes <br>
The colon separating the target from the prerequisites may
be immediately followed by attributes and another colon. The
attributes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D If the recipe exits with a
non-null status, the target is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E Continue execution if the
recipe draws errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N If there is no recipe, the
target has its time updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n The rule is a meta-rule that
cannot be a target of a virtual rule. Only files match the
pattern in the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P The characters after the P
until the terminating : are taken as a program name. It will
be invoked as sh -c prog &rsquo;arg1&rsquo;
&rsquo;arg2&rsquo; and should return a zero exit status if
and <br>
only if arg1 is up to date with respect to arg2. Date stamps
are still propagated in the normal way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q The recipe is not printed
prior to execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R The rule is a meta-rule using
regular expressions. In the rule, % has no special meaning.
The target is interpreted as a regular expression as defined
in regexp(7). The <br>
prerequisites may contain references to subexpressions in
form 0 as in the substitute command of sed(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U The targets are considered to
have been updated even if the recipe did not do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V The targets of this rule are
marked as virtual. They are distinct from files of the same
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
A simple mkfile to compile a program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;/$objtype/mkfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prog: a.$O b.$O c.$O <br>
$LD $LDFLAGS -o $target $prereq</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%.$O: %.c <br>
$CC $CFLAGS $stem.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Override flag settings in the
mkfile:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% mk target &rsquo;CFLAGS=-S
-w&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Maintain a library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">libc.a(%.$O):N: %.$O <br>
libc.a: libc.a(abs.$O) libc.a(access.$O) libc.a(alarm.$O)
... <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String expression variables to
derive names from a master list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAMES=alloc arc bquote builtins

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expression
meta-rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">([^/]*)/(.*).$O:R: 1/2.c <br>
cd $stem1; $CC $CFLAGS $stem2.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A correct way to deal with
yacc(1) grammars. The file lex.c includes the file x.tab.h
rather than y.tab.h in order to reflect changes in content,
not just modification time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lex.$O: x.tab.h <br>
x.tab.h: y.tab.h <br>
cmp -s x.tab.h y.tab.h || cp y.tab.h x.tab.h <br>
y.tab.c y.tab.h: gram.y <br>
$YACC -d gram.y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above example could also use
the P attribute for the x.tab.h rule:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x.tab.h:Pcmp -s: y.tab.h <br>
cp y.tab.h x.tab.h</p>
