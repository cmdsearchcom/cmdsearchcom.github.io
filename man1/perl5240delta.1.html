<p>PERL5240DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5240DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5240delta - what is new for perl v5.24.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes the differences between the 5.22.0
release and the 5.24.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
Postfix dereferencing is no longer experimental <br>
Using the &quot;postderef&quot; and &quot;postderef_qq&quot;
features no longer emits a warning. Existing code that
disables the &quot;experimental::postderef&quot; warning
category that they previously used <br>
will continue to work. The &quot;postderef&quot; feature has
no effect; all Perl code can use postfix dereferencing,
regardless of what feature declarations are in scope. The
5.24 feature <br>
bundle now includes the &quot;postderef_qq&quot;
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode 8.0 is now supported
<br>
For details on what is in this release, see
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl will now croak when closing
an in-place output file fails <br>
Until now, failure to close the output file for an in-place
edit was not detected, meaning that the input file could be
clobbered without the edit being successfully completed.
<br>
Now, when the output file cannot be closed successfully, an
exception is raised. l b } &quot; b o u n d a r y i n r
e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New &quot;g u l a r e x p r e s
s i o n s <br>
&quot;lb&quot; stands for Line Break. It is a Unicode
property that determines where a line of text is suitable to
break (typically so that it can be output without
overflowing the <br>
available horizontal space). This capability has long been
furnished by the Unicode::LineBreak module, but now a
light-weight, non-customizable version that is suitable for
many <br>
purposes is in core Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr/(?[ ])/&quot; now works
in UTF-8 locales <br>
Extended Bracketed Character Classes now will successfully
compile when &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect. The
compiled pattern will use standard Unicode rules. If the
runtime locale <br>
is not a UTF-8 one, a warning is raised and standard Unicode
rules are used anyway. No tainting is done since the outcome
does not actually depend on the locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integer shift
(&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) now more
explicitly defined <br>
Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right
shift, and right shift becomes left shift.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shifting by the number of bits
in a native integer (or more) is zero, except when the
&quot;overshift&quot; is right shifting a negative value
under &quot;use integer&quot;, in which case the result <br>
is -1 (arithmetic shift).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Until now negative shifting and
overshifting have been undefined because they have relied on
whatever the C implementation happens to do. For example,
for the overshift a common <br>
C behavior is &quot;modulo shift&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 &gt;&gt; 64 == 1 &gt;&gt; (64
% 64) == 1 &gt;&gt; 0 == 1 # Common C behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># And the same for &lt;&lt;,
while Perl now produces 0 for both.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now these behaviors are
well-defined under Perl, regardless of what the underlying C
implementation does. Note, however, that you are still
constrained by the native integer <br>
width: you need to know how far left you can go. You can use
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Config; <br>
my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8; # Or $Config{uvsize}
&lt;&lt; 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need a more bits on the
left shift, you can use for example the &quot;bigint&quot;
pragma, or the &quot;Bit::Vector&quot; module from CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printf and sprintf now allow
reordered precision arguments <br>
That is, &quot;sprintf &rsquo;|%.*2$d|&rsquo;, 2, 3&quot;
now returns &quot;|002|&quot;. This extends the existing
reordering mechanism (which allows reordering for arguments
that are used as format fields, <br>
widths, and vector separators).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More fields provided to
&quot;sigaction&quot; callback with &quot;SA_SIGINFO&quot;
<br>
When passing the &quot;SA_SIGINFO&quot; flag to sigaction,
the &quot;errno&quot;, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;uid&quot;,
&quot;pid&quot;, &quot;addr&quot; and &quot;band&quot;
fields are now included in the hash passed to the handler,
if supported by <br>
the platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hashbang redirection to Perl 6
<br>
Previously perl would redirect to another interpreter if it
found a hashbang path unless the path contains
&quot;perl&quot; (see perlrun). To improve compatability
with Perl 6 this <br>
behavior has been extended to also redirect if
&quot;perl&quot; is followed by &quot;6&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Set proper umask before calling mkstemp(3) <br>
In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling
mkstemp(3) and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully
tells open(2) to strip the owner read and write bits from
the <br>
given mode before applying it, rather than the intended
negation of leaving only those bits in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Systems that use mode 0666 in
mkstemp(3) (like old versions of glibc) create a file with
permissions 0066, leaving world read and write permissions
regardless of current umask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has been fixed by using
umask 0177 instead. [perl #127322]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fix out of boundary access in
Win32 path handling <br>
This is CVE-2015-8608. For more information see [perl
#126755]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fix loss of taint in canonpath
<br>
This is CVE-2015-8607. For more information see [perl
#126862]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Avoid accessing uninitialized
memory in win32 &quot;crypt()&quot; <br>
Added validation that will detect both a short salt and
invalid characters in the salt. [perl #126922]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126922&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove duplicate environment
variables from &quot;environ&quot; <br>
Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than
once in &quot;environ[]&quot;, %ENV would contain the last
entry for that name, while a typical &quot;getenv()&quot;
would return the first <br>
entry. We now make sure %ENV contains the same as what
&quot;getenv&quot; returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, we remove duplicates
from &quot;environ[]&quot;, so if a setting with that name
is set in %ENV, we won&rsquo;t pass an unsafe value to a
child process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[CVE-2016-2381]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
The &quot;autoderef&quot; feature has been removed <br>
The experimental &quot;autoderef&quot; feature (which
allowed calling &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;,
&quot;shift&quot;, &quot;unshift&quot;, &quot;splice&quot;,
&quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot;, and &quot;each&quot;
on a scalar argument) has been deemed <br>
unsuccessful. It has now been removed; trying to use the
feature (or to disable the
&quot;experimental::autoderef&quot; warning it previously
triggered) now yields an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lexical $_ has been removed <br>
&quot;my $_&quot; was introduced in Perl 5.10, and
subsequently caused much confusion with no obvious solution.
In Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental on the theory that
it would either <br>
be removed or redesigned in a less confusing (but
backward-incompatible) way. Over the following years, no
alternatives were proposed. The feature has now been removed
and will <br>
fail to compile. w b } / &quot; i s n o w t a i l o r e
d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr/t o P e r l e x p e c t
a t i o n s <br>
This is now more suited to be a drop-in replacement for , b
u t g i v i n g b e t t e r r e s u l t s f o r p a r s i n

rules which calls for it to match between each white space
character. Now it doesn&rsquo;t generally match within spans
of white d ow eb s} space, behaving like &quot;.&quot; Si en
e <br>
perlrebackslash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expression compilation
errors <br>
Some regular expression patterns that had runtime errors now
don&rsquo;t compile at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Almost all Unicode properties
using the &quot;{}&quot; and &quot;P{}&quot; regular
expression pattern constructs are now checked for validity
at pattern compilation time, and invalid ones will <br>
cause the program to not compile. In earlier releases, this
check was often deferred until run time. Whenever an error
check is moved from run- to compile time, erroneous code
<br>
is caught 100% of the time, whereas before it would only get
caught if and when the offending portion actually gets
executed, which for unreachable code might be never.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr//&quot; now disallowed
under &quot;use re &quot;strict&quot;&quot; <br>
An empty &quot;&quot; makes no sense, but for backwards
compatibility is accepted as doing nothing, though a
deprecation warning is raised by default. But now this is a
fatal error <br>
under the experimental feature &quot;&rsquo;strict&rsquo;
mode&quot; in re.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nested declarations are now
disallowed <br>
A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;state&quot;
declaration is no longer allowed inside of another
&quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;state&quot;
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, these are now
fatal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my ($x, my($y)); <br>
our (my $x);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #125587]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[perl #121058]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121058&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;/character class has
been removed. <br>
This regular expression character class was deprecated in
v5.20.0 and has produced a deprecation warning since
v5.22.0. It is now a compile-time error. If you need to
examine the <br>
individual bytes that make up a UTF8-encoded character, then
use &quot;utf8::encode()&quot; on the string (or a copy)
first.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;chdir(&rsquo;&rsquo;)&quot;
no longer chdirs home <br>
Using &quot;chdir(&rsquo;&rsquo;)&quot; or
&quot;chdir(undef)&quot; to chdir home has been deprecated
since perl v5.8, and will now fail. Use &quot;chdir()&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII characters in variable
names must now be all visible <br>
It was legal until now on ASCII platforms for variable names
to contain non-graphical ASCII control characters (ordinals
0 through 31, and 127, which are the C0 controls and <br>
&quot;DELETE&quot;). This usage has been deprecated since
v5.20, and as of now causes a syntax error. The variables
these names referred to are special, reserved by Perl for
whatever use <br>
it may choose, now, or in the future. Each such variable has
an alternative way of spelling it. Instead of the single
non-graphic control character, a two character sequence <br>
beginning with a caret is used, like $^] and
&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;. Details are at perlvar. It
remains legal, though unwise and deprecated (raising a
deprecation warning), to use <br>
certain non-graphic non-ASCII characters in variables names
when not under &quot;use utf8&quot;. No code should do this,
as all such variables are reserved by Perl, and Perl
doesn&rsquo;t <br>
currently define any of them (but could at any time, without
notice).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An off by one issue in
$Carp::MaxArgNums has been fixed <br>
$Carp::MaxArgNums is supposed to be the number of arguments
to display. Prior to this version, it was instead showing
$Carp::MaxArgNums + 1 arguments, contrary to the <br>
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only blanks and tabs are now
allowed within &quot;[...]&quot; within
&quot;(?[...])&quot;. <br>
The experimental Extended Bracketed Character Classes can
contain regular bracketed character classes within them.
These differ from regular ones in that white space is <br>
generally ignored, unless escaped by preceding it with a
backslash. The white space that is ignored is now limited to
just tab &quot;&quot; and SPACE characters. Previously, it
was any <br>
white space. See &quot;Extended Bracketed Character
Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
Using code points above the platform&rsquo;s
&quot;IV_MAX&quot; is now deprecated <br>
Unicode defines code points in the range
&quot;0..0x10FFFF&quot;. Some standards at one time defined
them up to 2**31 - 1, but Perl has allowed them to be as
high as anything that will <br>
fit in a word on the platform being used. However, use of
those above the platform&rsquo;s &quot;IV_MAX&quot; is
broken in some constructs, notably &quot;tr///&quot;,
regular expression patterns <br>
involving quantifiers, and in some arithmetic and comparison
operations, such as being the upper limit of a loop. Now the
use of such code points raises a deprecation warning, <br>
unless that warning category is turned off.
&quot;IV_MAX&quot; is typically 2**31 -1 on 32-bit
platforms, and 2**63-1 on 64-bit ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Doing bitwise operations on
strings containing code points above 0xFF is deprecated <br>
The string bitwise operators treat their operands as strings
of bytes, and values beyond 0xFF are nonsensical in this
context. To operate on encoded bytes, first encode the <br>
strings. To operate on code points&rsquo; numeric values,
use &quot;split&quot; and &quot;map ord&quot;. In the
future, this warning will be replaced by an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;sysread()&quot;,
&quot;syswrite()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot; and
&quot;send()&quot; are deprecated on :utf8 handles <br>
The &quot;sysread()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot;,
&quot;syswrite()&quot; and &quot;send()&quot; operators are
deprecated on handles that have the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer,
either explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the <br>
&quot;:encoding(UTF-16LE)&quot; layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both &quot;sysread()&quot; and
&quot;recv()&quot; currently use only the &quot;:utf8&quot;
flag for the stream, ignoring the actual layers. Since
&quot;sysread()&quot; and &quot;recv()&quot; do no UTF-8
validation they can end <br>
up creating invalidly encoded scalars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
&quot;syswrite()&quot; and &quot;send()&quot; use only the
&quot;:utf8&quot; flag, otherwise ignoring any layers. If
the flag is set, both write the value UTF-8 encoded, even if
the layer is some <br>
different encoding, such as the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ideally, all of these operators
would completely ignore the &quot;:utf8&quot; state, working
only with bytes, but this would result in silently breaking
existing code. To avoid this a <br>
future version of perl will throw an exception when any of
&quot;sysread()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot;,
&quot;syswrite()&quot; or &quot;send()&quot; are called on
handle with the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Performance Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The overhead of scope entry and exit has
been considerably reduced, so for example subroutine calls,
loops and basic blocks are all faster now. This empty
function call now <br>
takes about a third less time to execute:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub f{} f();</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many languages,
such as Chinese, are caseless. Perl now knows about most
common ones, and skips much of the work when a program tries
to change case in them (like <br>
&quot;ucfirst()&quot;) or match caselessly
(&quot;qr//i&quot;). This will speed up a program, such as a
web server, that can operate on multiple languages, while it
is operating on a caseless <br>
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;/fixed-substr/&quot; has been made much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On platforms with a libc
&quot;memchr()&quot; implementation which makes good use of
underlying hardware support, patterns which include fixed
substrings will now often be much faster; <br>
for example with glibc on a recent x86_64 CPU, this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$s = &quot;a&quot; x 1000 .
&quot;wxyz&quot;; <br>
$s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is now about 7 times faster. On
systems with slow &quot;memchr()&quot;, e.g. 32-bit ARM
Raspberry Pi, there will be a small or little speedup.
Conversely, some pathological cases, <br>
such as &quot;&quot;ab&quot; x 1000 =~ /aa/&quot; will be
slower now; up to 3 times slower on the rPi, 1.5x slower on
x86_64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Faster addition,
subtraction and multiplication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since 5.8.0, arithmetic became
slower due to the need to support 64-bit integers. To deal
with 64-bit integers, a lot more corner cases need to be
checked, which adds time. <br>
We now detect common cases where there is no need to check
for those corner cases, and special-case them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Preincrement,
predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement have been
made faster by internally splitting the functions which
handled multiple cases into different <br>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Creating Perl
debugger data structures (see &quot;Debugger Internals&quot;
in perldebguts) for XSUBs and const subs has been removed.
This removed one glob/scalar combo for each <br>
unique &quot;.c&quot; file that XSUBs and const subs came
from. On startup (&quot;perl -e&quot;0&quot;&quot;) about
half a dozen glob/scalar debugger combos were created.
Loading XS modules created more <br>
glob/scalar combos. These things were being created
regardless of whether the perl debugger was being used, and
despite the fact that it can&rsquo;t debug C code anyway</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Win32,
&quot;stat&quot;ing or &quot;-X&quot;ing a path, if the file
or directory does not exist, is now 3.5x faster than
before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Single arguments
in list assign are now slightly faster:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">($x) = (...); <br>
(...) = ($x);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Less peak memory
is now used when compiling regular expression patterns.</p>

or global variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlcall</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A number of
cleanups have been made to perlcall, including:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; use
&quot;EXTEND(SP, n)&quot; and &quot;PUSHs()&quot; instead of
&quot;XPUSHs()&quot; where applicable and update prose to
match</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; add POPu, POPul
and POPpbytex to the &quot;complete list of POP macros&quot;
and clarify the documentation for some of the existing

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; add API

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; use ERRSV more

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; approaches to

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlfunc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The

valid inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Better explain
meaning of negative PIDs in &quot;waitpid&quot;. [perl
#127080]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127080&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; General cleanup:
there&rsquo;s more consistency now (in POD usage, grammar,
code examples), better practices in code examples (use of
&quot;my&quot;, removal of bareword filehandles, dropped
<br>
usage of &quot;&amp;&quot; when calling subroutines, ...),
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlguts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new section
has been added, &quot;Dynamic Scope and the Context
Stack&quot; in perlguts, which explains how the perl context
stack works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perllocale</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A stronger
caution about using locales in threaded applications is
given. Locales are not thread-safe, and you can get wrong
results or even segfaults if you use them there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlmodlib</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; %s() is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing Diagnostics
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Accessing the &quot;IO&quot; part of a glob
as &quot;FILEHANDLE&quot; instead of &quot;IO&quot; is no
longer deprecated. It is discouraged to encourage uniformity
(so that, for example, one can grep more <br>
easily) but it will not be removed. [perl #127060]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127060&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The diagnostic
&quot;Hexadecimal float: internal error&quot; has been
changed to &quot;Hexadecimal float: internal error
(%s)&quot; to include more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Can&rsquo;t
modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &amp;%s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This error now reports the name
of the non-lvalue subroutine you attempted to use as an
lvalue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When running out
of memory during an attempt the increase the stack size,
previously, perl would die using the cryptic message
&quot;panic: av_extend_guts() negative count <br>
(-9223372036854775681)&quot;. This has been fixed to show
the prettier message: Out of memory during stack extend</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Configure&quot; now acts as if the
&quot;-O&quot; option is always passed, allowing command
line options to override saved configuration. This should
eliminate confusion when command line <br>
options are ignored for no obvious reason. &quot;-O&quot; is
now permitted, but ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bison 3.0 is now
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure no
longer probes for libnm by default. Originally this was the
&quot;New Math&quot; library, but the name has been re-used
by the GNOME NetworkManager. [perl #127131] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127131&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Added Configure
probes for &quot;newlocale&quot;, &quot;freelocale&quot;,
and &quot;uselocale&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PPPort.so/PPPort.dll&quot; no longer get installed, as
they are not used by &quot;PPPort.pm&quot;, only by its test
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It is now
possible to specify which compilation date to show on
&quot;perl -V&quot; output, by setting the macro
&quot;PERL_BUILD_DATE&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using the
&quot;NO_HASH_SEED&quot; define in combination with the
default hash algorithm
&quot;PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD&quot; resulted in a
fatal error while compiling the interpreter, <br>
since Perl 5.17.10. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure should
handle spaces in paths a little better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; No longer
generate EBCDIC POSIX-BC tables. We don&rsquo;t believe
anyone is using Perl and POSIX-BC at this time, and by not
generating these tables it saves time during <br>
development, and makes the resulting tar ball smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The GNU Make
makefile for Win32 now supports parallel builds. [perl
#126632]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can now
build perl with MSVC++ on Win32 using GNU Make. [perl
#126632]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Win32
miniperl now has a real &quot;getcwd&quot; which increases
build performance resulting in &quot;getcwd()&quot; being
605x faster in Win32 miniperl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure now
takes &quot;-Dusequadmath&quot; into account when
calculating the &quot;alignbytes&quot; configuration
variable. Previously the mis-calculated
&quot;alignbytes&quot; could cause alignment <br>
errors on debugging builds. [perl #127894]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A new test (t/op/aassign.t) has been added
to test the list assignment operator
&quot;OP_AASSIGN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parallel
building has been added to the dmake &quot;makefile.mk&quot;
makefile. All Win32 compilers are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
AmigaOS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The AmigaOS port has been reintegrated into
the main tree, based off of Perl 5.22.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cygwin <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Tests are more robust against unusual
cygdrive prefixes. [perl #126834]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126834&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC <br>
UTF-EBCDIC extended <br>
UTF-EBCDIC is like UTF-8, but for EBCDIC platforms. It now
has been extended so that it can represent code points up to
2 ** 64 - 1 on platforms with 64-bit words. This <br>
brings it into parity with UTF-8. This enhancement requires
an incompatible change to the representation of code points
in the range 2 ** 30 to 2 ** 31 -1 (the latter <br>
was the previous maximum representable code point). This
means that a file that contains one of these code points,
written out with previous versions of perl cannot be <br>
read in, without conversion, by a perl containing this
change. We do not believe any such files are in existence,
but if you do have one, submit a ticket at <br>
perlbug@perl.org &lt;mailto:perlbug@perl.org&gt;, and we
will write a conversion script for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC &quot;cmp()&quot; and
&quot;sort()&quot; fixed for UTF-EBCDIC strings <br>
Comparing two strings that were both encoded in UTF-8 (or
more precisely, UTF-EBCDIC) did not work properly until now.
Since &quot;sort()&quot; uses &quot;cmp()&quot;, this fixes
that as <br>
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EBCDIC &quot;tr///&quot; and
&quot;y///&quot; fixed for &quot;&quot;, and &quot;use
utf8&quot; ranges <br>
Perl v5.22 introduced the concept of portable ranges to
regular expression patterns. A portable range matches the
same set of characters no matter what platform is being <br>
run on. This concept is now extended to &quot;tr///&quot;.
See &quot;tr///&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There were also some problems
with these operations under &quot;use utf8&quot;, which are
now fixed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeBSD <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Use the &quot;fdclose()&quot; function from
FreeBSD if it is available. [perl #126847]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126847&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IRIX <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Under some circumstances IRIX stdio
&quot;fgetc()&quot; and &quot;fread()&quot; set the errno to
&quot;ENOENT&quot;, which made no sense according to either
IRIX or POSIX docs. Errno is now cleared <br>
in such cases. [perl #123977]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123977&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Problems when

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126396&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MacOS X <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Until now OS X builds of perl have specified
a link target of 10.3 (Panther, 2003) but have not specified
a compiler target. From now on, builds of perl on OS X 10.6
or <br>
later (Snow Leopard, 2008) by default capture the current OS
X version and specify that as the explicit build target in
both compiler and linker flags, thus preserving <br>
binary compatibility for extensions built later regardless
of changes in OS X, SDK, or compiler and linker versions. To
override the default value used in the build and <br>
preserved in the flags, specify &quot;export
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.N&quot; before configuring and
building perl, where 10.N is the version of OS X you wish to
target. In OS <br>
X 10.5 or earlier there is no change to the behavior present
when those systems were current; the link target is still OS
X 10.3 and there is no explicit compiler target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Builds with both
-DDEBUGGING and threading enabled would fail with a
&quot;panic: free from wrong pool&quot; error when built or
tested from Terminal on OS X. This was caused by <br>
perl&rsquo;s internal management of the environment
conflicting with an atfork handler using the libc
&quot;setenv()&quot; function to update the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now uses
&quot;setenv()&quot;/&quot;unsetenv()&quot; to update the
environment on OS X. [perl #126240]

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris <br>
&Acirc;&middot; All Solaris variants now build a shared
libperl</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Solaris and variants like
OpenIndiana now always build with the shared Perl library
(Configure -Duseshrplib). This was required for the
OpenIndiana builds, but this has <br>
also been the setting for Oracle/Sun Perl builds for several
years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tru64 <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Workaround where Tru64 balks when prototypes
are listed as &quot;PERL_STATIC_INLINE&quot;, but where the
test is build with
&quot;-DPERL_NO_INLINE_FUNCTIONS&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; On VMS, the math function prototypes in
&quot;math.h&quot; are now visible under C++. Now building
the POSIX extension with C++ will no longer crash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; VMS has had
&quot;setenv&quot;/&quot;unsetenv&quot; since v7.0 (released
in 1996), &quot;Perl_vmssetenv&quot; now always uses
&quot;setenv&quot;/&quot;unsetenv&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now
implements its own &quot;killpg&quot; by scanning for
processes in the specified process group, which may not mean
exactly the same thing as a Unix process group, but <br>
allows us to send a signal to a parent (or master) process
and all of its sub-processes. At the perl level, this means
we can now send a negative pid like so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kill SIGKILL, -$pid;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to signal all processes in the
same group as $pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For those %ENV
elements based on the CRTL environ array, we&rsquo;ve always
preserved case when setting them but did look-ups only after
upcasing the key first, which made <br>
lower- or mixed-case entries go missing. This problem has
been corrected by making %ENV elements derived from the
environ array case-sensitive on look-up as well as case-
<br>
preserving on store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Environment
look-ups for &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; and &quot;PERLLIB&quot;
previously only considered logical names, but now consider
all sources of %ENV as determined by
&quot;PERL_ENV_TABLES&quot; and as <br>
documented in &quot;%ENV&quot; in perlvms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The minimum
supported version of VMS is now v7.3-2, released in 2003. As
a side effect of this change, VAX is no longer supported as
the terminal release of OpenVMS VAX <br>
was v7.3 in 2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Win32 <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A new build option
&quot;USE_NO_REGISTRY&quot; has been added to the makefiles.
This option is off by default, meaning the default is to do
Windows registry lookups. This option <br>
stops Perl from looking inside the registry for anything.
For what values are looked up in the registry see perlwin32.
Internally, in C, the name of this option is <br>
&quot;WIN32_NO_REGISTRY&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The behavior of
Perl using &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USERtwarePerl&quot; and
&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEtwarePerl&quot; to lookup certain
values, including %ENV vars starting with &quot;PERL&quot;
has <br>
changed. Previously, the 2 keys were checked for entries at
all times through the perl process&rsquo;s life time even if
they did not exist. For performance reasons, now, if <br>
the root key (i.e. &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USERtwarePerl&quot; or
&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEtwarePerl&quot;) does not exist at
process start time, it will not be checked again for %ENV
<br>
override entries for the remainder of the perl
process&rsquo;s life. This more closely matches Unix
behavior in that the environment is copied or inherited on
startup and <br>
changing the variable in the parent process or another
process or editing .bashrc will not change the environmental
variable in other existing, running, processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; One glob fetch
was removed for each &quot;-X&quot; or &quot;stat&quot; call
whether done from Perl code or internally from Perl&rsquo;s
C code. The glob being looked up was <br>
&quot;${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}&quot; which is a special
variable. This makes &quot;-X&quot; and &quot;stat&quot;
slightly faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; During
miniperl&rsquo;s process startup, during the build process,
4 to 8 IO calls related to the process starting .pl and the
buildcustomize.pl file were removed from the code <br>
opening and executing the first 1 or 2 .pl files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Builds using
Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 and earlier no longer produce an
&quot;INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR&quot; message. [perl
#126045]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Visual C++ 2013
builds will now execute on XP and higher. Previously they
would only execute on Vista and higher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You can now
build perl with GNU Make and GCC. [perl #123440]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;truncate($filename, $size)&quot; now works for files
over 4GB in size. [perl #125347]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Parallel
building has been added to the dmake &quot;makefile.mk&quot;
makefile. All Win32 compilers are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Building a
64-bit perl with a 64-bit GCC but a 32-bit gmake would
result in an invalid $Config{archname} for the resulting
perl. [perl #127584]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Errors set by
Winsock functions are now put directly into $^E, and the
relevant &quot;WSAE*&quot; error codes are now exported from
the Errno and POSIX modules for testing this <br>
against.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The previous behavior of putting
the errors (converted to POSIX-style &quot;E*&quot; error
codes since Perl 5.20.0) into $! was buggy due to the
non-equivalence of like-named <br>
Winsock and POSIX error constants, a relationship between
which has unfortunately been established in one way or
another since Perl 5.8.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The new behavior provides a much
more robust solution for checking Winsock errors in portable
software without accidentally matching POSIX tests that were
intended for <br>
other OSes and may have different meanings for Winsock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The old behavior is currently
retained, warts and all, for backwards compatibility, but
users are encouraged to change any code that tests $!
against &quot;E*&quot; constants for <br>
Winsock errors to instead test $^E against &quot;WSAE*&quot;
constants. After a suitable deprecation period, the old
behavior may be removed, leaving $! unchanged after Winsock
<br>
function calls, to avoid any possible confusion over which
error variable to check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppc64el <br>
floating point <br>
The floating point format of ppc64el (Debian naming for
little-endian PowerPC) is now detected correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The implementation of perl&rsquo;s context
stack system, and its internal API, have been heavily
reworked. Note that no significant changes have been made to
any external APIs, but <br>
XS code which relies on such internal details may need to be
fixed. The main changes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;PUSHBLOCK()&quot;, &quot;POPSUB()&quot; etc. macros
have been replaced with static inline functions such as
&quot;cx_pushblock()&quot;, &quot;cx_popsub()&quot; etc.
These use function args rather than <br>
implicitly relying on local vars such as &quot;gimme&quot;
and &quot;newsp&quot; being available. Also their
functionality has changed: in particular,
&quot;cx_popblock()&quot; no longer decrements <br>
&quot;cxstack_ix&quot;. The ordering of the steps in the
&quot;pp_leave*&quot; functions involving
&quot;cx_popblock()&quot;, &quot;cx_popsub()&quot; etc. has
changed. See the new documentation, &quot;Dynamic Scope <br>
and the Context Stack&quot; in perlguts, for details on how
to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various macros,
which now consistently have a CX_ prefix, have been
added:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CX_CUR(), CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(),
CX_POP()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or renamed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CX_POP_SAVEARRAY(), CX_DEBUG(),
CX_PUSHSUBST(), CX_POPSUBST()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;cx_pushblock()&quot; now saves
&quot;PL_savestack_ix&quot; and &quot;PL_tmps_floor&quot;,
so &quot;pp_enter*&quot; and &quot;pp_leave*&quot; no longer
do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENTER; SAVETMPS; ....; LEAVE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;cx_popblock()&quot; now also restores
&quot;PL_curpm&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
&quot;dounwind()&quot; for every context type, the current
savestack frame is now processed before each context is
popped; formerly this was only done for sub-like context
<br>
frames. This action has been removed from
&quot;cx_popsub()&quot; and placed into its own macro,
&quot;CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(cx)&quot;, which must be called before
&quot;cx_popsub()&quot; etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;dounwind()&quot; now also
does a &quot;cx_popblock()&quot; on the last popped frame
(formerly it only did the &quot;cx_popsub()&quot; etc.
actions on each frame).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The temps stack
is now freed on scope exit; previously, temps created during
the last statement of a block wouldn&rsquo;t be freed until
the next &quot;nextstate&quot; following the <br>
block (apart from an existing hack that did this for
recursive subs in scalar context); and in something like
&quot;f(g())&quot;, the temps created by the last statement
in &quot;g()&quot; <br>
would formerly not be freed until the statement following
the return from &quot;f()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Most values that
were saved on the savestack on scope entry are now saved in
suitable new fields in the context struct, and saved and
restored directly by &quot;cx_pushfoo()&quot; <br>
and &quot;cx_popfoo()&quot;, which is much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various context
struct fields have been added, removed or modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The handling of
@_ in &quot;cx_pushsub()&quot; and &quot;cx_popsub()&quot;
has been considerably tidied up, including removing the
&quot;argarray&quot; field from the context struct, and
extracting <br>
out some common (but rarely used) code into a separate
function, &quot;clear_defarray()&quot;. Also, useful subsets
of &quot;cx_popsub()&quot; which had been unrolled in places
like <br>
&quot;pp_goto&quot; have been gathered into the new
functions &quot;cx_popsub_args()&quot; and
&quot;cx_popsub_common()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;pp_leavesub&quot; and &quot;pp_leavesublv&quot; now
use the same function as the rest of the
&quot;pp_leave*&quot;&rsquo;s to process return args.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;CXp_FOR_PAD&quot; and &quot;CXp_FOR_GV&quot; flags
have been added, and &quot;CXt_LOOP_FOR&quot; has been split
into &quot;CXt_LOOP_LIST&quot;,
&quot;CXt_LOOP_ARY&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some variables
formerly declared by &quot;dMULTICALL&quot; (but not
documented) have been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The obscure
&quot;PL_timesbuf&quot; variable, effectively a vestige of
Perl 1, has been removed. It was documented as deprecated in
Perl 5.20, with a statement that it would be removed <br>
early in the 5.21.x series; that has now finally happened.
[perl #121351]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121351&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An unwarranted
assertion in &quot;Perl_newATTRSUB_x()&quot; has been
removed. If a stub subroutine definition with a prototype
has been seen, then any subsequent stub (or definition) <br>
of the same subroutine with an attribute was causing an
assertion failure because of a null pointer. [perl #126845]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126845&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;::&quot;
has been replaced by &quot;__&quot; in
&quot;ExtUtils::ParseXS&quot;, like it&rsquo;s done for
parameters/return values. This is more consistent, and
simplifies writing XS code wrapping C++ <br>
classes into a nested Perl namespace (it requires only a
typedef for &quot;Foo__Bar&quot; rather than two, one for
&quot;Foo_Bar&quot; and the other for
&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;to_utf8_case()&quot; function is now deprecated.
Instead use &quot;toUPPER_utf8&quot;,
&quot;toTITLE_utf8&quot;, &quot;toLOWER_utf8&quot;, and
&quot;toFOLD_utf8&quot;. (See <br>

&lt;http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233287&gt;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl core code
and the threads extension have been annotated so that, if
Perl is configured to use threads, then during compile-time
clang (3.6 or later) will warn about <br>
suspicious uses of mutexes. See
&lt;http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html&gt;
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;signbit()&quot; emulation has been enhanced. This will
help older and/or more exotic platforms or
configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Most
EBCDIC-specific code in the core has been unified with
non-EBCDIC code, to avoid repetition and make maintenance
easier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; MSWin32 code for
$^X has been moved out of the win32 directory to caretx.c,
where other operating systems set that variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;sv_ref()&quot; is now part of the API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;sv_backoff&quot; in perlapi had its return type
changed from &quot;int&quot; to &quot;void&quot;. It
previously has always returned 0 since Perl 5.000 stable but
that was undocumented. Although <br>
&quot;sv_backoff&quot; is marked as public API, XS code is
not expected to be impacted since the proper API call would
be through public API &quot;sv_setsv(sv,
&amp;PL_sv_undef)&quot;, or quasi- <br>
public &quot;SvOOK_off&quot;, or non-public
&quot;SvOK_off&quot; calls, and the return value of
&quot;sv_backoff&quot; was previously a meaningless constant
that can be rewritten as &quot;(sv_backoff(sv),0)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;EXTEND&quot; and &quot;MEXTEND&quot; macros have been
improved to avoid various issues with integer truncation and
wrapping. In particular, some casts formerly used within the
macros <br>
have been removed. This means for example that passing an
unsigned &quot;nitems&quot; argument is likely to raise a
compiler warning now (it&rsquo;s always been documented to
require a <br>
signed value; formerly int, lately SSize_t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PL_sawalias&quot; and &quot;GPf_ALIASED_SV&quot; have
been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;GvASSIGN_GENERATION&quot; and
&quot;GvASSIGN_GENERATION_set&quot; have been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; It now works properly to specify a
user-defined property, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qr/{mypkg1::IsMyProperty}/i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with &quot;/i&quot; caseless
matching, an explicit package name, and IsMyProperty not
defined at the time of the pattern compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s
&quot;memcpy()&quot;, &quot;memmove()&quot;,
&quot;memset()&quot; and &quot;memcmp()&quot; fallbacks are
now more compatible with the originals. [perl #127619]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed the issue
where a &quot;s///r&quot;) with -DPERL_NO_COW attempts to
modify the source SV, resulting in the program dying. [perl
#127635]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed an
EBCDIC-platform-only case where a pattern could fail to
match. This occurred when matching characters from the set
of C1 controls when the target matched string was <br>
in UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Narrow the
filename check in strict.pm and warnings.pm. Previously, it
assumed that if the filename (without the .pmc? extension)
differed from the package name, if was a <br>
misspelled use statement (i.e. &quot;use Strict&quot;
instead of &quot;use strict&quot;). We now check whether
there&rsquo;s really a miscapitalization happening, and not
some other issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Turn an
assertion into a more user friendly failure when parsing
regexes. [perl #127599]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Correctly raise

character classes while there are trailing backslashes.
[perl #126141].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Line numbers
larger than 2**31-1 but less than 2**32 are no longer
returned by &quot;caller()&quot; as negative numbers. [perl
#126991]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;unless (
assignment )&quot; now properly warns when syntax warnings
are enabled. [perl #127122]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Setting an
&quot;ISA&quot; glob to an array reference now properly adds
&quot;isaelem&quot; magic to any existing elements.
Previously modifying such an element would not update the
ISA cache, <br>
so method calls would call the wrong function. Perl would
also crash if the &quot;ISA&quot; glob was destroyed, since
new code added in 5.23.7 would try to release the
&quot;isaelem&quot; magic <br>
from the elements. [perl #127351]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If a here-doc
was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
already read end of file, and the here-doc was not
terminated, perl could produce an assertion or a <br>
segmentation fault. This now reliably complains about the
unterminated here-doc. [perl #125540]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;untie()&quot; would sometimes return the last value
returned by the &quot;UNTIE()&quot; handler as well as
it&rsquo;s normal value, messing up the stack. [perl
#126621]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed an
operator precedence problem when &quot; castflags &amp;
2&quot; is true. [perl #127474]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Caching of
DESTROY methods could result in a non-pointer or a non-STASH
stored in the &quot;SvSTASH()&quot; slot of a stash,
breaking the B &quot;STASH()&quot; method. The DESTROY
method is now <br>
cached in the MRO metadata for the stash. [perl #126410]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The AUTOLOAD
method is now called when searching for a DESTROY method,
and correctly sets $AUTOLOAD too. [perl #124387] [perl
#127494]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Avoid parsing
beyond the end of the buffer when processing a
&quot;#line&quot; directive with no filename. [perl
#127334]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now raises
a warning when a regular expression pattern looks like it
was supposed to contain a POSIX class, like
&quot;qr/[[:alpha:]]/&quot;, but there was some slight
defect in <br>
its specification which causes it to instead be treated as a
regular bracketed character class. An example would be
missing the second colon in the above like this: <br>
&quot;qr/[[:alpha]]/&quot;. This compiles to match a
sequence of two characters. The second is &quot;]&quot;, and
the first is any of: &quot;[&quot;, &quot;:&quot;,
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, or
&quot;p&quot;. This is unlikely to be <br>
the intended meaning, and now a warning is raised. No
warning is raised unless the specification is very close to
one of the 14 legal POSIX classes. (See &quot;POSIX
Character <br>
Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.) [perl #8904]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain regex
patterns involving a complemented POSIX class in an inverted
bracketed character class, and matching something else
optionally would improperly fail to match. <br>
An example of one that could fail is
&quot;qr/_?[^Wbar]/&quot;. This has been fixed. [perl
#127537]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.22 added
support to the C99 hexadecimal floating point notation, but
sometimes misparses hex floats. This has been fixed. [perl
#127183]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression
that allowed undeclared barewords in hash keys to work
despite strictures has been fixed. [perl #126981]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126981&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calls to the

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Report more
context when we see an array where we expect to see an
operator and avoid an assertion failure. [perl #123737] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modifying an
array that was previously a package @ISA no longer causes
assertion failures or crashes. [perl #123788]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123788&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Retain binary
compatibility across plain and DEBUGGING perl builds. [perl

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Avoid leaking
memory when setting $ENV{foo} on darwin. [perl #126240]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;/...G/&quot; no longer crashes on utf8 strings. When
&quot;G&quot; is a fixed number of characters from the start
of the regex, perl needs to count back that many characters
from the <br>
current &quot;pos()&quot; position and start matching from
there. However, it was counting back bytes rather than
characters, which could lead to panics on utf8 strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In some cases
operators that return integers would return negative
integers as large positive integers. [perl #126635]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126635&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;pipe()&quot; operator would assert for DEBUGGING
builds instead of producing the correct error message. The
condition asserted on is detected and reported on correctly
<br>
without the assertions, so the assertions were removed.
[perl #126480]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In some cases,
failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
memory. This was caused by a pointer not being restored
correctly. [perl #126443] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126443&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;@x = sort
{ *a = 0; $a &lt;=&gt; $b } 0 .. 1&quot; no longer frees the
GP for *a before restoring its SV slot. [perl #124097]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124097&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Multiple
problems with the new hexadecimal floating point printf
format %a were fixed: [perl #126582]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582&gt;,
[perl #126586] <br>
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586&gt;,
[perl #126822]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126822&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calling
&quot;mg_set()&quot; in &quot;leave_scope()&quot; no longer
leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression
from Perl v5.20 was fixed in which debugging output of
regular expression compilation was wrong. (The pattern was
correctly compiled, but what got displayed for <br>
it was wrong.) s b } &quot; w o r k s m u c h b e t t e r .
I n P e r l v 5 . 2 2 . 0 , t h i s n e w c o n s t r u c t
d i d n &rsquo; t s e e m t o g i v e t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;h e e x p
e c t e d r e s u l t s , y e t p a s s e d a l l t h e t e
s t s i n t h e e x t e n s i v e s u i t e f u r n i s h e
d b y <br>
Unicode. It turns out that it was because these were short
input strings, and the failures had to do with longer
inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain syntax
errors in &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot;
in perlrecharclass caused panics instead of the proper error
message. This has now been fixed. [perl #126481]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.20 added
a message when a quantifier in a regular expression was
useless, but then caused the parser to skip it; this caused
the surplus quantifier to be silently <br>
ignored, instead of throwing an error. This is now fixed.
[perl #126253]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The switch to
building non-XS modules last in win32/makefile.mk
(introduced by design as part of the changes to enable
parallel building) caused the build of POSIX to break <br>
due to problems with the version module. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Improved parsing
of hex float constants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed an issue
with &quot;pack&quot; where &quot;pack &quot;H&quot;&quot;
(and &quot;pack &quot;h&quot;&quot;) could read past the
source when given a non-utf8 source, and a utf8 target.
[perl #126325]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixed several
cases where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault, or
a C-level assert. [perl #126615], [perl #126602], [perl
#126193].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; There were
places in regular expression patterns where comments
(&quot;(?#...)&quot;) weren&rsquo;t allowed, but should have
been. This is now fixed. [perl #116639] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116639&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some regressions
from Perl 5.20 have been fixed, in which some syntax errors
in &quot;(?[...])&quot; constructs within regular expression
patterns could cause a segfault instead of a <br>
proper error message. [perl #126180]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180&gt;
[perl #126404]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126404&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Another problem
with &quot;(?[...])&quot; constructs has been fixed wherein
things like &quot; <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Some problems with attempting to extend the
perl stack to around 2G or 4G entries have been fixed. This
was particularly an issue on 32-bit perls built to use
64-bit <br>
integers, and was easily noticeable with the list repetition
operator, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@a = (1) x $big_number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Formerly perl may have crashed,
depending on the exact value of $big_number; now it will
typically raise an exception. [perl #125937] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125937&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In a regex
conditional expression
&quot;(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)&quot;, if the
condition is &quot;(?!)&quot; then perl failed the match
outright instead of matching the no-pattern. <br>
This has been fixed. [perl #126222]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126222&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The special
backtracking control verbs &quot;(*VERB:ARG)&quot; now all
allow an optional argument and set
&quot;REGERROR&quot;/&quot;REGMARK&quot; appropriately as
well. [perl #126186] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126186&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several bugs,
including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the
boundary checking constructs (introduced in g c b Perl 5.22)
&quot;} &quot; , &quot; <br>
&quot;0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Duplicating a
closed file handle for write no longer creates a filename of
the form GLOB(0xXXXXXXXX). [perl #125115]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Warning fatality
is now ignored when rewinding the stack. This prevents
infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes
rewinding of the stack. [perl #123398]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In perl v5.22.0,
the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the -C
option, such that the successfully parsed number was not
saved as the option value if it parsed <br>
to the end of the argument. [perl #125381]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The PadlistNAMES
macro is an lvalue again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Zero
-DPERL_TRACE_OPS memory for sub-threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl_clone_using()&quot;
was missing Zero init of PL_op_exec_cnt[]. This caused
sub-threads in threaded -DPERL_TRACE_OPS builds to spew
exceedingly large op-counts at destruct. <br>
These counts would print %x as &quot;ABABABAB&quot;, clearly
a mem-poison value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A leak in the XS
typemap caused one scalar to be leaked each time a
&quot;FILE *&quot; or a &quot;PerlIO *&quot; was
&quot;OUTPUT:&quot;ed or imported to Perl, since perl 5.000.
These particular typemap <br>
entries are thought to be extremely rarely used by XS
modules. [perl #124181]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;alarm()&quot; and &quot;sleep()&quot; will now warn if
the argument is a negative number and return undef.
Previously they would pass the negative value to the
underlying C function which <br>
may have set up a timer with a surprising value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl can again
be compiled with any Unicode version. This used to (mostly)
work, but was lost in v5.18 through v5.20. The property
&quot;Name_Alias&quot; did not exist prior to <br>
Unicode 5.0. Unicode::UCD incorrectly said it did. This has
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Very large
code-points (beyond Unicode) in regular expressions no
longer cause a buffer overflow in some cases when converted
to UTF-8. [perl #125826] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125826&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The integer
overflow check for the range operator (...) in list context
now correctly handles the case where the size of the range
is larger than the address space. This <br>
could happen on 32-bits with -Duse64bitint. [perl #125781]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125781&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A crash with
&quot;%::=(); J-&gt;${</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;qr/(?[ ()
])/&quot; no longer segfaults, giving a syntax error message
instead. [perl #125805]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Regular
expression possessive quantifier v5.20 regression now fixed.
&quot;qr/&quot;PAT&quot;{&quot;min,max&quot;}+&quot;&quot;/&quot;
is supposed to behave identically to
&quot;qr/(?&gt;&quot;PAT&quot;{&quot;min,max&quot;})/&quot;.
Since v5.20, <br>
this didn&rsquo;t work if min and max were equal. [perl
#125825]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;BEGIN
&lt;&gt;&quot; no longer segfaults and properly produces an
error message. [perl #125341]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
&quot;tr///&quot; an illegal backwards range like
&quot;tr/-//&quot; was not always detected, giving incorrect
results. This is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Some modules have been broken by the context
stack rework. These modules were relying on non-guaranteed
implementation details in perl. Their maintainers have been
<br>
informed, and should contact perl5-porters for advice if
needed. Below is a subset of these modules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithm::Permute <br>
Coro <br>
Coro and perl v5.22.0 were already incompatible due to a
change in the perl, and the reworking on the perl context
stack creates a further incompatibility. perl5-porters <br>
has discussed the issue on the mailing list
&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/05/msg236174.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data::Alias <br>
RPerl <br>
Scope::Upper <br>
TryCatch <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The module lexical::underscore no longer
works on perl v5.24.0, because perl no longer has a lexical
$_!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;mod_perl&quot; has been patched for compatibility for
v5.22.0 and later but no release has been made. The relevant
patch (and other changes) can be found in their source code
<br>
repository, mirrored at GitHub
