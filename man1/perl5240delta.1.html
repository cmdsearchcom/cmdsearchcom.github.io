perl5240delta - what is new for perl v5.24.0
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes the differences between the 5.22.0 release and the
  5.24.0 release.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="selflink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Postfix_dereferencing_is_no_longer_experimental"><a class="selflink" href="#Postfix_dereferencing_is_no_longer_experimental">Postfix
  dereferencing is no longer experimental</a></h2>
Using the &quot;postderef&quot; and &quot;postderef_qq&quot; features no longer
  emits a warning. Existing code that disables the
  &quot;experimental::postderef&quot; warning category that they previously used
  will continue to work. The &quot;postderef&quot; feature has no effect; all
  Perl code can use postfix dereferencing, regardless of what feature
  declarations are in scope. The 5.24 feature bundle now includes the
  &quot;postderef_qq&quot; feature.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Unicode_8.0_is_now_supported"><a class="selflink" href="#Unicode_8.0_is_now_supported">Unicode
  8.0 is now supported</a></h2>
For details on what is in this release, see
  &lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/&gt;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="perl_will_now_croak_when_closing_an_in-place_output_file_fails"><a class="selflink" href="#perl_will_now_croak_when_closing_an_in-place_output_file_fails">perl
  will now croak when closing an in-place output file fails</a></h2>
Until now, failure to close the output file for an in-place edit was not
  detected, meaning that the input file could be clobbered without the edit
  being successfully completed. Now, when the output file cannot be closed
  successfully, an exception is raised.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="New_&quot;\b{lb}&quot;_boundary_in_regular_expressions"><a class="selflink" href="#New_&quot;\b{lb}&quot;_boundary_in_regular_expressions">New
  &quot;\b{lb}&quot; boundary in regular expressions</a></h2>
&quot;lb&quot; stands for Line Break. It is a Unicode property that determines
  where a line of text is suitable to break (typically so that it can be output
  without overflowing the available horizontal space). This capability has long
  been furnished by the Unicode::LineBreak module, but now a light-weight,
  non-customizable version that is suitable for many purposes is in core Perl.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;qr/(?[_])/&quot;_now_works_in_UTF-8_locales"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;qr/(?[_])/&quot;_now_works_in_UTF-8_locales">&quot;qr/(?[
  ])/&quot; now works in UTF-8 locales</a></h2>
Extended Bracketed Character Classes now will successfully compile when
  &quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot; is in effect. The compiled pattern will use
  standard Unicode rules. If the runtime locale is not a UTF-8 one, a warning is
  raised and standard Unicode rules are used anyway. No tainting is done since
  the outcome does not actually depend on the locale.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Integer_shift_(&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;_and_&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;)_now_more_explicitly_defined"><a class="selflink" href="#Integer_shift_(&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;_and_&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;)_now_more_explicitly_defined">Integer
  shift (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) now more explicitly
  defined</a></h2>
Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right shift, and right
  shift becomes left shift.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Shifting by the number of bits in a native integer (or more) is zero, except
  when the &quot;overshift&quot; is right shifting a negative value under
  &quot;use integer&quot;, in which case the result is -1 (arithmetic shift).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Until now negative shifting and overshifting have been undefined because they
  have relied on whatever the C implementation happens to do. For example, for
  the overshift a common C behavior is &quot;modulo shift&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  1 &gt;&gt; 64 == 1 &gt;&gt; (64 % 64) == 1 &gt;&gt; 0 == 1  # Common C behavior.
  # And the same for &lt;&lt;, while Perl now produces 0 for both.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now these behaviors are well-defined under Perl, regardless of what the
  underlying C implementation does. Note, however, that you are still
  constrained by the native integer width: you need to know how far left you can
  go. You can use for example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use Config;
  my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8;  # Or $Config{uvsize} &lt;&lt; 3.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need a more bits on the left shift, you can use for example the
  &quot;bigint&quot; pragma, or the &quot;Bit::Vector&quot; module from CPAN.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="printf_and_sprintf_now_allow_reordered_precision_arguments"><a class="selflink" href="#printf_and_sprintf_now_allow_reordered_precision_arguments">printf
  and sprintf now allow reordered precision arguments</a></h2>
That is, &quot;sprintf '|%.*2$d|', 2, 3&quot; now returns &quot;|002|&quot;.
  This extends the existing reordering mechanism (which allows reordering for
  arguments that are used as format fields, widths, and vector separators).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="More_fields_provided_to_&quot;sigaction&quot;_callback_with_&quot;SA_SIGINFO&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#More_fields_provided_to_&quot;sigaction&quot;_callback_with_&quot;SA_SIGINFO&quot;">More
  fields provided to &quot;sigaction&quot; callback with
  &quot;SA_SIGINFO&quot;</a></h2>
When passing the &quot;SA_SIGINFO&quot; flag to sigaction, the
  &quot;errno&quot;, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;uid&quot;, &quot;pid&quot;,
  &quot;addr&quot; and &quot;band&quot; fields are now included in the hash
  passed to the handler, if supported by the platform.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hashbang_redirection_to_Perl_6"><a class="selflink" href="#Hashbang_redirection_to_Perl_6">Hashbang
  redirection to Perl 6</a></h2>
Previously perl would redirect to another interpreter if it found a hashbang
  path unless the path contains &quot;perl&quot; (see perlrun). To improve
  compatability with Perl 6 this behavior has been extended to also redirect if
  &quot;perl&quot; is followed by &quot;6&quot;.

  proper umask before calling mkstemp(3)</a></h2>
In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling mkstemp(3) and
  restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells open(2) to strip the owner read
  and write bits from the given mode before applying it, rather than the
  intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Systems that use mode 0666 in mkstemp(3) (like old versions of glibc) create a
  file with permissions 0066, leaving world read and write permissions
  regardless of current umask.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This has been fixed by using umask 0177 instead. [perl #127322]

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Remove_duplicate_environment_variables_from_&quot;environ&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#Remove_duplicate_environment_variables_from_&quot;environ&quot;">Remove
  duplicate environment variables from &quot;environ&quot;</a></h2>
Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in
  &quot;environ[]&quot;, %ENV would contain the last entry for that name, while
  a typical &quot;getenv()&quot; would return the first entry. We now make sure
  %ENV contains the same as what &quot;getenv&quot; returns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, we remove duplicates from &quot;environ[]&quot;, so if a setting with
  that name is set in %ENV, we won't pass an unsafe value to a child process.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_&quot;autoderef&quot;_feature_has_been_removed"><a class="selflink" href="#The_&quot;autoderef&quot;_feature_has_been_removed">The
  &quot;autoderef&quot; feature has been removed</a></h2>
The experimental &quot;autoderef&quot; feature (which allowed calling
  &quot;push&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;shift&quot;, &quot;unshift&quot;,
  &quot;splice&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot;, and &quot;each&quot;
  on a scalar argument) has been deemed unsuccessful. It has now been removed;
  trying to use the feature (or to disable the
  &quot;experimental::autoderef&quot; warning it previously triggered) now
  yields an exception.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Lexical_$__has_been_removed"><a class="selflink" href="#Lexical_$__has_been_removed">Lexical
  $_ has been removed</a></h2>
&quot;my $_&quot; was introduced in Perl 5.10, and subsequently caused much
  confusion with no obvious solution. In Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental
  on the theory that it would either be removed or redesigned in a less
  confusing (but backward-incompatible) way. Over the following years, no
  alternatives were proposed. The feature has now been removed and will fail to
  compile.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;qr/\b{wb}/&quot;_is_now_tailored_to_Perl_expectations"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;qr/\b{wb}/&quot;_is_now_tailored_to_Perl_expectations">&quot;qr/\b{wb}/&quot;
  is now tailored to Perl expectations</a></h2>
This is now more suited to be a drop-in replacement for plain &quot;\b&quot;,
  but giving better results for parsing natural language. Previously it strictly
  followed the current Unicode rules which calls for it to match between each
  white space character. Now it doesn't generally match within spans of white
  space, behaving like &quot;\b&quot; does. See &quot;\b{wb}&quot; in
  perlrebackslash
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Regular_expression_compilation_errors"><a class="selflink" href="#Regular_expression_compilation_errors">Regular
  expression compilation errors</a></h2>
Some regular expression patterns that had runtime errors now don't compile at
  all.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Almost all Unicode properties using the &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot;
  regular expression pattern constructs are now checked for validity at pattern
  compilation time, and invalid ones will cause the program to not compile. In
  earlier releases, this check was often deferred until run time. Whenever an
  error check is moved from run- to compile time, erroneous code is caught 100%
  of the time, whereas before it would only get caught if and when the offending
  portion actually gets executed, which for unreachable code might be never.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;qr/\N{}/&quot;_now_disallowed_under_&quot;use_re_&quot;strict&quot;&quot;"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;qr/\N{}/&quot;_now_disallowed_under_&quot;use_re_&quot;strict&quot;&quot;">&quot;qr/\N{}/&quot;
  now disallowed under &quot;use re &quot;strict&quot;&quot;</a></h2>
An empty &quot;\N{}&quot; makes no sense, but for backwards compatibility is
  accepted as doing nothing, though a deprecation warning is raised by default.
  But now this is a fatal error under the experimental feature &quot;'strict'
  mode&quot; in re.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Nested_declarations_are_now_disallowed"><a class="selflink" href="#Nested_declarations_are_now_disallowed">Nested
  declarations are now disallowed</a></h2>
A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;state&quot; declaration is no longer
  allowed inside of another &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or
  &quot;state&quot; declaration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, these are now fatal:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   my ($x, my($y));
   our (my $x);
</pre>

  &quot;/\C/&quot; character class has been removed.</a></h2>
This regular expression character class was deprecated in v5.20.0 and has
  produced a deprecation warning since v5.22.0. It is now a compile-time error.
  If you need to examine the individual bytes that make up a UTF8-encoded
  character, then use &quot;utf8::encode()&quot; on the string (or a copy)
  first.

  no longer chdirs home</a></h2>
Using &quot;chdir('')&quot; or &quot;chdir(undef)&quot; to chdir home has been
  deprecated since perl v5.8, and will now fail. Use &quot;chdir()&quot;
  instead.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="ASCII_characters_in_variable_names_must_now_be_all_visible"><a class="selflink" href="#ASCII_characters_in_variable_names_must_now_be_all_visible">ASCII
  characters in variable names must now be all visible</a></h2>
It was legal until now on ASCII platforms for variable names to contain
  non-graphical ASCII control characters (ordinals 0 through 31, and 127, which
  are the C0 controls and &quot;DELETE&quot;). This usage has been deprecated
  since v5.20, and as of now causes a syntax error. The variables these names
  referred to are special, reserved by Perl for whatever use it may choose, now,
  or in the future. Each such variable has an alternative way of spelling it.
  Instead of the single non-graphic control character, a two character sequence
  beginning with a caret is used, like $^] and &quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;.
  Details are at perlvar. It remains legal, though unwise and deprecated
  (raising a deprecation warning), to use certain non-graphic non-ASCII
  characters in variables names when not under &quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;. No
  code should do this, as all such variables are reserved by Perl, and Perl
  doesn't currently define any of them (but could at any time, without notice).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="An_off_by_one_issue_in_$Carp::MaxArgNums_has_been_fixed"><a class="selflink" href="#An_off_by_one_issue_in_$Carp::MaxArgNums_has_been_fixed">An
  off by one issue in $Carp::MaxArgNums has been fixed</a></h2>
$Carp::MaxArgNums is supposed to be the number of arguments to display. Prior to
  this version, it was instead showing $Carp::MaxArgNums + 1 arguments, contrary
  to the documentation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Only_blanks_and_tabs_are_now_allowed_within_&quot;[...]&quot;_within_&quot;(?[...])&quot;."><a class="selflink" href="#Only_blanks_and_tabs_are_now_allowed_within_&quot;[...]&quot;_within_&quot;(?[...])&quot;.">Only
  blanks and tabs are now allowed within &quot;[...]&quot; within
  &quot;(?[...])&quot;.</a></h2>
The experimental Extended Bracketed Character Classes can contain regular
  bracketed character classes within them. These differ from regular ones in
  that white space is generally ignored, unless escaped by preceding it with a
  backslash. The white space that is ignored is now limited to just tab
  &quot;\t&quot; and SPACE characters. Previously, it was any white space. See
  &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_code_points_above_the_platform's_&quot;IV_MAX&quot;_is_now_deprecated"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_code_points_above_the_platform's_&quot;IV_MAX&quot;_is_now_deprecated">Using
  code points above the platform's &quot;IV_MAX&quot; is now deprecated</a></h2>
Unicode defines code points in the range &quot;0..0x10FFFF&quot;. Some standards
  at one time defined them up to 2**31 - 1, but Perl has allowed them to be as
  high as anything that will fit in a word on the platform being used. However,
  use of those above the platform's &quot;IV_MAX&quot; is broken in some
  constructs, notably &quot;tr///&quot;, regular expression patterns involving
  quantifiers, and in some arithmetic and comparison operations, such as being
  the upper limit of a loop. Now the use of such code points raises a
  deprecation warning, unless that warning category is turned off.
  &quot;IV_MAX&quot; is typically 2**31 -1 on 32-bit platforms, and 2**63-1 on
  64-bit ones.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Doing_bitwise_operations_on_strings_containing_code_points_above_0xFF_is_deprecated"><a class="selflink" href="#Doing_bitwise_operations_on_strings_containing_code_points_above_0xFF_is_deprecated">Doing
  bitwise operations on strings containing code points above 0xFF is
  deprecated</a></h2>
The string bitwise operators treat their operands as strings of bytes, and
  values beyond 0xFF are nonsensical in this context. To operate on encoded
  bytes, first encode the strings. To operate on code points' numeric values,
  use &quot;split&quot; and &quot;map ord&quot;. In the future, this warning
  will be replaced by an exception.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="&quot;sysread()&quot;,_&quot;syswrite()&quot;,_&quot;recv()&quot;_and_&quot;send()&quot;_are_deprecated_on_:utf8_handles"><a class="selflink" href="#&quot;sysread()&quot;,_&quot;syswrite()&quot;,_&quot;recv()&quot;_and_&quot;send()&quot;_are_deprecated_on_:utf8_handles">&quot;sysread()&quot;,
  &quot;syswrite()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot; and &quot;send()&quot; are
  deprecated on :utf8 handles</a></h2>
The &quot;sysread()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot;, &quot;syswrite()&quot; and
  &quot;send()&quot; operators are deprecated on handles that have the
  &quot;:utf8&quot; layer, either explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the
  &quot;:encoding(UTF-16LE)&quot; layer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Both &quot;sysread()&quot; and &quot;recv()&quot; currently use only the
  &quot;:utf8&quot; flag for the stream, ignoring the actual layers. Since
  &quot;sysread()&quot; and &quot;recv()&quot; do no UTF-8 validation they can
  end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Similarly, &quot;syswrite()&quot; and &quot;send()&quot; use only the
  &quot;:utf8&quot; flag, otherwise ignoring any layers. If the flag is set,
  both write the value UTF-8 encoded, even if the layer is some different
  encoding, such as the example above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the &quot;:utf8&quot;
  state, working only with bytes, but this would result in silently breaking
  existing code. To avoid this a future version of perl will throw an exception
  when any of &quot;sysread()&quot;, &quot;recv()&quot;, &quot;syswrite()&quot;
  or &quot;send()&quot; are called on handle with the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The previous behavior of putting the errors (converted to POSIX-style
      &quot;E*&quot; error codes since Perl 5.20.0) into $! was buggy due to the
      non-equivalence of like-named Winsock and POSIX error constants, a
      relationship between which has unfortunately been established in one way
      or another since Perl 5.8.0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The new behavior provides a much more robust solution for checking Winsock
      errors in portable software without accidentally matching POSIX tests that
      were intended for other OSes and may have different meanings for Winsock.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The old behavior is currently retained, warts and all, for backwards
      compatibility, but users are encouraged to change any code that tests $!
      against &quot;E*&quot; constants for Winsock errors to instead test $^E
      against &quot;WSAE*&quot; constants. After a suitable deprecation period,
      the old behavior may be removed, leaving $! unchanged after Winsock
      function calls, to avoid any possible confusion over which error variable
      to check.</dd>

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated
  from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of
  the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
  tracker.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
  included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
  helping Perl to flourish.

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ ,
  the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
  &quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec for details
  of how to report the issue.
