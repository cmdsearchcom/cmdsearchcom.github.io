<p>AO-DBG(1) General Commands Manual AO-DBG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ao-dbg - hex debugger for cc1111 processors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ao-dbg [-t cpu-type] [-X frequency] [-c] [-r listen-port]
[-Z listen-port] [-s] [-S] [-p prompt] [-V] [-v] [-H] [-h]
[-m] [-T tty-device] [--tty tty-device] [-D altos-device]
<br>
[--device altos-device]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ao-dbg connects to a cc1111 processor through either a
suitable cc1111 board or a cp2103 usb to serial converter
board, using the GPIO pins available on that chip. It
provides an <br>
interface compatible with the 8051 emulator from sdcc called
s51, but communicating with the real chip instead of an
emulation. Using a modified version of the SDCC debugger
<br>
(sdcdb), you can control program execution on the target
machine at source-level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The command line options are designed to be compatible with
the 8051 emulator so that it can be used with sdcdb. As
such, they&rsquo;re all one letter long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t cpu-type <br>
The 8051 emulator can operate as one of several different
chips. Oddly, the real hardware cannot, so this option is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X frequency <br>
Similarly, the emulator can pretend to run at an arbitrary
frequency which the real hardware cannot do. Ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V All ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r listen-port, -Z listen-port
<br>
The emulator and sdcdb communicate through a network socket.
This option switches the debugger from communicating through
stdin/stdout to listening on a specific network <br>
port instead. Once a connection is made, the debugger
continues on, using that network port for command input and
output. The debugger uses port 9756, and attempts to
con&acirc; <br>
nect before launching ao-dbg, so if ao-dbg is listening on
this port before sdcdb is started, sdcdb will end up talking
to the existing ao-dbg instance. That&rsquo;s often
use&acirc; <br>
ful for debugging ao-dbg itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p prompt <br>
This sets the command prompt to the specified string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P This sets the command prompt
to a single NUL character. This is for use by sdcdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h This should print a usage
message, but does nothing useful currently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m This option is not present in
the original 8051 emulator, and causes ao-dbg to dump all
commands and replies that are received from and sent to
sdcdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T tty-device | --tty tty-device
<br>
This selects which tty device the debugger uses to
communicate with the target device. The special name
&rsquo;BITBANG&rsquo; directs ao-dbg to use the cp2103
connection, otherwise <br>
this should be a usb serial port connected to a suitable
cc1111 debug node.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D AltOS-device | --device
AltOS-device <br>
Search for a connected device. This requires an argument of
one of the following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TeleMetrum:2 <br>
TeleMetrum <br>
2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leaving out the product name
will cause the tool to select a suitable product, leaving
out the serial number will cause the tool to match one of
the available devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Once started, ao-dbg connects to the cc1111 and then reads
and executes commands, either from stdin, or the nework
connection to sdcdb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike the command line, ao-dbg
contains built-in help for each of these commands, via the
&rsquo;help&rsquo; command. Most of the commands are
available in a long form and a single charac&acirc; <br>
ter short form. Below, the short form follows the long form
after a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help, ? {command} <br>
Without arguments, prints a list of available commands. With
an argument prints more detail about the specific
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit, q <br>
Terminates the application, without changing the state of
the target processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">di [start] [end] <br>
Dumps imem (256 bytes of &quot;internal&quot; memory) from
start to end (inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ds [start] [end] <br>
Dumps sprs from start to end (inclusive). Note that while
most sprs are visible in the global address space, some are
not, so use this command instead of &quot;dx&quot; to read
<br>
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dx [start] [end] <br>
Dump external (global) memory from start to end
(inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set, t &lt;prefix&gt; [start]
{data ...} <br>
Store to the memory space specified by prefix where prefix
is one of &quot;xram&quot;, &quot;rom&quot;,
&quot;iram&quot;, or &quot;sfr&quot;. Store bytes starting
at start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump, d &lt;prefix&gt; [start]
[end] <br>
Dump from the memory space specified by prefix, where prefix
is one of &quot;xram&quot;, &quot;rom&quot;,
&quot;iram&quot; or &quot;sfr&quot;. Dumps from start to end
(inclusive).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file [filename] <br>
Specifies an intel-format hex file (ihx) that contains the
contents of the rom area loaded into the cc1111. This is
used to respond to requests to dump rom memory contents <br>
without getting them from the cc1111 (which is slow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pc, p {address} <br>
If the address argument is given, this sets the program
counter to the specified value. Otherwise, the current
program counter value is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break, b [address] <br>
Sets a breakpoint at the specified address. This uses the
built-in hardware breakpoint support in the cc1111. As a
result, it supports no more than four breakpoints at <br>
once. You must therefore use a modified version of sdcdb
which changes how program execution is controlled to work
within this limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear, c [address] <br>
Clear a breakpoint from the specified address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run, r, go, g {start} {stop}
<br>
Resumes execution of the program. If the start argument is
present, then it begins at that address, otherwise it
continues running at the current pc. If a stop argument is
<br>
present, then a temporary breakpoint is set at that address.
This temporary breakpoint will be removed when execution
hits it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next, n <br>
Step one instruction. In the original s51 program this would
ignore subroutines, but as sdcdb doesn&rsquo;t require this
functionality, it&rsquo;s not available here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">step, s <br>
Step one instruction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load, l [filename] <br>
This is not implemented, but it is supposed to load a hex
file into flash. Use the ccload program instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">halt, h <br>
Halt the processor. This is the only command which can be
sent while the program is running. It is ignored at other
times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reset, res <br>
Reset the processor. This pulls the reset pin low and
re-enables debug mode. Check the cc1111 documentation to see
precisely what this does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">status This dumps the cc1111
debug status register.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info, i breakpoints, b <br>
List the current breakpoints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info, i help, ? <br>
List the things you can get info on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stop This doesn&rsquo;t do
anything and is present only to retain compatibility with
the original 8051 emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BOARD BRINGUP DEBUGGING <br>
While the original purpose for this program was to connect
the source debugger with the hardware, it can also be used
as a low-level hex debugger all on its own. In particular,
<br>
all of the cc1111 peripherals can be manipulated directly
from the ao-dbg command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting ao-dbg <br>
First ensure that the target cc1111 device and intermediate
cp2103 or cc111 board are all hooked up correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ao-dbg <br>
Welcome to the non-simulated processor <br>
&gt; status <br>
CPU halted <br>
Halted by debug command <br>
&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turning on LEDs <br>
Two of the cc1111 GPIO pins, P1_0 and P1_1 are capable of
driving external LEDs. To control these, set the Port 1
direction bits to make these output pins and then change
<br>
the Port 1 data to set them high or low:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set sfr 0xfe 0x02 # set
P1DIR to 0x2 <br>
&gt; set sfr 0x90 0x02 # set P1_1 to high <br>
&gt; set sfr 0x90 0x00 # set P1_1 to low</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading the A/D converters <br>
The six A/D converter inputs can each be connected to any of
the P0 pins, ground, the A/D voltage refernece, an internal
temperature sensor or VDD/3. To read one of these <br>
values, select an A/D converter to use then start the
conversion process. The cc1111 manual has the table for
selecting the input on page 144.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To configure one of the P0 pins
for use by the A/D unit, we program the ADCCFG register,
setting the bits in that which match the pins desired:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set sfr 0xf2 0x3f # enable
all 6 A/D inputs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To trigger a single conversion,
we ask the A/D unit to perform an &rsquo;extra&rsquo;
conversion, which means to do a single conversion not a
whole sequence of conversions. This is <br>
controlled by the ADCCON3 register at 0xB6:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; set sfr 0xb6 0xb2 # sample
P0_2 using 12 bits of precision <br>
&gt; ds 0xba 0xbb # dump the ADC data low and high regs <br>
&gt; set sfr 0xb6 0xbe # sample internal temperature sensor
<br>
&gt; ds 0xba 0xbb # dump the ADC data low and high regs</p>
