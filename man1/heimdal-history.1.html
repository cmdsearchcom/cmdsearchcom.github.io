<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
heimdal-history - Password history via Heimdal external
strength checking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
heimdal-history [-hmq] [-b target-time] [-d database] <br>
[-S length-stats-db] [-s strength-program] [principal]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
heimdal-history is an implementation of password history via
the Heimdal external password strength checking interface.
It stores separate history for each principal, hashed <br>
using Crypt::PBKDF2 with randomly-generated salt. (The
randomness is from a weak pseudorandom number generator, not
strongly random.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Password history is stored in a
BerkeleyDB DB_HASH file. The key is the principal. The value
is a JSON array of objects, each of which has two keys.
&quot;timestamp&quot; contains the <br>
time when the history entry was added (in POSIX seconds
since UNIX epoch), and &quot;hash&quot; contains the hash of
a previously-used password in the Crypt::PBKDF2
LDAP-compatible format. <br>
Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 (from PKCS#5) with SHA-256
as the underlying hash function using a number of rounds
configured in this script. See Crypt::PBKDF2 for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">heimdal-history also checks
password strength before checking history. It does so by
invoking another program that also uses the Heimdal external
password strength checking <br>
interface. By default, it runs /usr/bin/heimdal-strength.
Only if that program approves the password does it hash it
and check history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on how to
set up password history, see &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with any implementation of
the Heimdal external password strength checking protocol,
heimdal-history expects, on standard input:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">principal: &lt;principal&gt;
<br>
new-password: &lt;password&gt; <br>
end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(with no leading whitespace).
&lt;principal&gt; is the principal changing its password
(passed to the other password strength checking program but
otherwise unused here), and <br>
&lt;password&gt; is the new password. There must be exactly
one space after the colon. Any subsequent spaces are taken
to be part of the principal or password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If invoked as root,
heimdal-history will run the external strength checking
program as user &quot;nobody&quot; and group
&quot;nogroup&quot;, and will check and write to the history
database as user <br>
&quot;_history&quot; and group &quot;_history&quot;. These
users must exist on the system if it is run as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result of each password
check will be logged to syslog (priority LOG_INFO, facility
LOG_AUTH). Each log line will be a set of key/value pairs in
the format &quot;key=value&quot;. The <br>
keys are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">action <br>
The action performed (currently always
&quot;check&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">principal <br>
The principal for which a password was checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error <br>
An internal error message that did not stop the history
check, but which may indicate that something is wrong with
the history database (such as corrupted entries or invalid
<br>
hashes). If this key is present, neither &quot;result&quot;
nor &quot;reason&quot; will be present. There will be a
subsequent log message from the same invocation giving the
final result of <br>
the history check (assuming heimdal-history doesn&rsquo;t
exit with a fatal error).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result <br>
Either &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;rejected&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reason <br>
If the password was rejected, the reason for the
rejection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value will be surrounded
with double quotes if it contains a double quote or space.
Any double quotes in the value will be doubled, so
&quot;&quot;&quot; becomes &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b target-time, --benchmark=target-time <br>
Do not do a password history check. Instead, benchmark the
hash algorithm with various possible iteration counts and
find an iteration count that results in target-time <br>
seconds of computation time required to hash a password
(which should be a real number). A result will be considered
acceptable if it is within 0.005 seconds of the target <br>
time. The results will be printed to standard output and
then heimdal-history will exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d database, --database=database
<br>
Use database as the history database file instead of the
default (/var/lib/heimdal-history/history.db). Primarily
used for testing, since Heimdal won&rsquo;t pass this
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a short usage message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --manual, --man <br>
Display this manual and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Suppress logging to syslog and only return the results on
standard output and standard error. Primarily used for
testing, since Heimdal won&rsquo;t pass this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S length-stats-db,
--stats=length-stats-db <br>
Use length-stats-db as the database file for password length
statistics instead of the default
(/var/lib/heimdal-history/lengths.db). Primarily used for
testing, since <br>
Heimdal won&rsquo;t pass this argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s strength-program,
--strength=strength-program <br>
Run strength-program as the external strength-checking
program instead of the default (/usr/bin/heimdal-strength).
Primarily used for testing, since Heimdal won&rsquo;t pass
this <br>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
Additional setup is required to use this history
implementation with your Heimdal KDC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, ensure that its
dependencies are installed, and then examine the local
configuration settings at the top of the heimdal-history
program. By default, it requires a <br>
&quot;_history&quot; user and &quot;_history&quot; group be
present on the system, and all history information will be
read and written as that user and group. It also requires a
&quot;nobody&quot; user and <br>
&quot;nogroup&quot; group to be present (this should be the
default with most variants of UNIX), and all strength
checking will be done as that user and group. It uses
various files in <br>
/var/lib/heimdal-history to store history and statistical
information by default, so if using the defaults, create
that directory and ensure it is writable by the
&quot;_history&quot; <br>
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once that setup is done, change
your &quot;[password_quality]&quot; configuration in
krb5.conf or kdc.conf to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[password_quality] <br>
policies = external-check <br>
external_program = /usr/local/bin/heimdal-history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The heimdal-history program will
automatically also run heimdal-strength as well, looking for
it in /usr/bin. Change the $STRENGTH_PROGRAM setting at the
top of the script if <br>
you have that program in a different location. You should
continue to configure heimdal-strength as if you were
running it directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN STATUS <br>
On approval of the password, heimdal-history will print
&quot;APPROVED&quot; and a newline to standard output and
exit with status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the password is rejected by
the strength checking program or if it (or a version with a
single character removed) matches one of the hashes stored
in the password history, <br>
heimdal-history will print the reason for rejection to
standard error and exit with status 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On any internal error,
heimdal-history will print the error to standard error and
exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/bin/heimdal-strength <br>
The default password strength checking program. This program
must follow the Heimdal external password strength checking
API.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/heimdal-history/history.db
<br>
The default database path. If heimdal-strength is run as
root, this file needs to be readable and writable by user
&quot;_history&quot; and group &quot;_history&quot;. If it
doesn&rsquo;t exist, it <br>
will be created with mode 0600.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/heimdal-history/history.db.lock
<br>
The lock file used to synchronize access to the history
database. As with the history database, if heimdal-strength
is run as root, this file needs to be readable and <br>
writable by user &quot;_history&quot; and group
&quot;_history&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/heimdal-history/lengths.db
<br>
The default length statistics path, which will be a
BerkeleyDB DB_HASH file of password lengths to counts of
passwords with that length. If heimdal-strength is run as
root, <br>
this file needs to be readable and writable by user
&quot;_history&quot; and group &quot;_history&quot;. If it
doesn&rsquo;t exist, it will be created with mode 0600.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/var/lib/heimdal-history/lengths.db.lock
<br>
The lock file used to synchronize access to the length
statistics database. As with the length statistics database,
if heimdal-strength is run as root, this file needs to be
<br>
readable and writable by user &quot;_history&quot; and group
&quot;_history&quot;.</p>
