heimdal-history - Password history via Heimdal external strength checking

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>heimdal-history</b> is an implementation of password history via the Heimdal
  external password strength checking interface. It stores separate history for
  each principal, hashed using Crypt::PBKDF2 with randomly-generated salt. (The
  randomness is from a weak pseudorandom number generator, not strongly random.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Password history is stored in a BerkeleyDB DB_HASH file. The key is the
  principal. The value is a JSON array of objects, each of which has two keys.
  &quot;timestamp&quot; contains the time when the history entry was added (in
  POSIX seconds since UNIX epoch), and &quot;hash&quot; contains the hash of a
  previously-used password in the Crypt::PBKDF2 LDAP-compatible format.
  Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 (from PKCS#5) with SHA-256 as the underlying
  hash function using a number of rounds configured in this script. See
  Crypt::PBKDF2 for more information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>heimdal-history</b> also checks password strength before checking history. It
  does so by invoking another program that also uses the Heimdal external
  password strength checking interface. By default, it runs
  <b>/usr/bin/heimdal-strength</b>. Only if that program approves the password
  does it hash it and check history.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For more information on how to set up password history, see
  &quot;CONFIGURATION&quot; below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As with any implementation of the Heimdal external password strength checking
  protocol, <b>heimdal-history</b> expects, on standard input:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    principal: &lt;principal&gt;
    new-password: &lt;password&gt;
    end
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(with no leading whitespace). &lt;principal&gt; is the principal changing its
  password (passed to the other password strength checking program but otherwise
  unused here), and &lt;password&gt; is the new password. There must be exactly
  one space after the colon. Any subsequent spaces are taken to be part of the
  principal or password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If invoked as root, <b>heimdal-history</b> will run the external strength
  checking program as user &quot;nobody&quot; and group &quot;nogroup&quot;, and
  will check and write to the history database as user &quot;_history&quot; and
  group &quot;_history&quot;. These users must exist on the system if it is run
  as root.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The result of each password check will be logged to syslog (priority LOG_INFO,
  facility LOG_AUTH). Each log line will be a set of key/value pairs in the
  format &quot; <i>key</i>=<i>value</i>&quot;. The keys are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">action</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The action performed (currently always
    &quot;check&quot;).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">principal</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The principal for which a password was checked.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">error</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An internal error message that did not stop the history
      check, but which may indicate that something is wrong with the history
      database (such as corrupted entries or invalid hashes). If this key is
      present, neither &quot;result&quot; nor &quot;reason&quot; will be
      present. There will be a subsequent log message from the same invocation
      giving the final result of the history check (assuming
      <b>heimdal-history</b> doesn't exit with a fatal error).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">result</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Either &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;rejected&quot;.</dd>
</dl>

  <dt class="It-tag">reason</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the password was rejected, the reason for the
    rejection.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value will be surrounded with double quotes if it contains a double quote or
  space. Any double quotes in the value will be doubled, so &quot;&quot;&quot;
  becomes &quot;&quot;.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
Additional setup is required to use this history implementation with your
  Heimdal KDC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, ensure that its dependencies are installed, and then examine the local
  configuration settings at the top of the <b>heimdal-history</b> program. By
  default, it requires a &quot;_history&quot; user and &quot;_history&quot;
  group be present on the system, and all history information will be read and
  written as that user and group. It also requires a &quot;nobody&quot; user and
  &quot;nogroup&quot; group to be present (this should be the default with most
  variants of UNIX), and all strength checking will be done as that user and
  group. It uses various files in <i>/var/lib/heimdal-history</i> to store
  history and statistical information by default, so if using the defaults,
  create that directory and ensure it is writable by the &quot;_history&quot;
  user.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once that setup is done, change your &quot;[password_quality]&quot;
  configuration in <i>krb5.conf</i> or <i>kdc.conf</i> to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    [password_quality]
        policies         = external-check
        external_program = /usr/local/bin/heimdal-history
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>heimdal-history</b> program will automatically also run
  <b>heimdal-strength</b> as well, looking for it in <i>/usr/bin</i>. Change the
  $STRENGTH_PROGRAM setting at the top of the script if you have that program in
  a different location. You should continue to configure <b>heimdal-strength</b>
  as if you were running it directly.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RETURN_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#RETURN_STATUS">RETURN
  STATUS</a></h1>
On approval of the password, <b>heimdal-history</b> will print
  &quot;APPROVED&quot; and a newline to standard output and exit with status 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the password is rejected by the strength checking program or if it (or a
  version with a single character removed) matches one of the hashes stored in
  the password history, <b>heimdal-history</b> will print the reason for
  rejection to standard error and exit with status 0.
<div class="Pp"></div>
On any internal error, <b>heimdal-history</b> will print the error to standard
  error and exit with a non-zero status.
