<b>The DSPAM agent</b> provides a direct interface to mail servers for
  command-line spam filtering. The agent can masquerade as the mail server's
  local delivery agent and will process any email passed to it. The agent will
  then call whatever delivery agent was specified at compile time or
  quarantine/tag/drop messages identified as spam. The DSPAM agent can function
  locally or as a proxy. It is also responsible for processing classification
  errors so that DSPAM can learn from its mistakes.

  <dd class="It-tag">dspam.conf or the preference extension:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>teft</b> : Train-Everything. Trains on all messages processed. This is a
      very thorough training approach and should be considered the standard
      training approach for most users. TEFT may, however, prove too volatile on
      installations with extremely high per-user traffic, or prove not very
      scalable on systems with extremely large user-bases. In the event that
      TEFT is proving ineffective, one of the other modes is recommended.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>toe</b> : Train-on-Error. Trains only on a classification error, once the
      user's metadata has matured to 2500 innocent messages. This training mode
      is much less resource intensive, as only occasional metadata writes are
      necessary. It is also far less volatile than the TEFT mode of training.
      One drawback, however, is that TOE only learns when DSPAM has made a
      mistake - which means the data is sometimes too static, and unable to
      &quot;ease into&quot; a different type of behavior.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>tum</b> : Train-until-Mature. This training mode is a hybrid between the
      other two training modes and provides a great balance between volatility
      and static metadata. TuM will train on a per-token basis only tokens which
      have had fewer than 25 &quot;hits&quot; on them, unless an error is being
      retrained in which case all tokens are trained. This training mode
      provides a solid core of stable tokens to keep accuracy consistent, but
      also allows for dynamic adaptation to any new types of email behavior a
      user might be experiencing.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>notrain</b> : No training. Do not train the user's data, and do not keep
      totals. This should only be used in cases where you want to process mail
      for a particular user (based on a group, for example), but don't want the
      user to accumulate any learning data.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>unlearn</b> : Unlearn original training. Use this if you wish to unlearn
      a previously learned message. Be sure to specify <b>--source=error</b> and
      <b>--class</b> to whatever the original classification the message was
      learned under. If not using TrainPristine, this will require the original
      signature from training.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--feature=</b><i>noise|no,whitelist|wh,tb=N</i>Specifies
    the features that should be activated for this filter instance. The

  <dd class="It-tag">features may be used individually or combined using a comma
      as a delimiter:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>(no)ise</b> : Bayesian Noise Reduction (BNR). Bayesian Noise Reduction
      kicks in at 2500 innocent messages and provides an advanced progressive
      noise logic to reduce Bayesian Noise (wordlist attacks) in spams. See
      http://www.zdziarski.com/papers/bnr.html for more information.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>(tb)=N</b> : Sets the training loop buffering level. Training loop
      buffering is the amount of statistical sedation performed to water down
      statistics and avoid false positives during the user's training loop. The
      training buffer sets the buffer sensitivity, and should be a number
      between 0 (no buffering whatsoever) to 10 (heavy buffering). The default
      is 5, half of what previous versions of DSPAM used. To avoid dulling down
      statistics at all during the training loop, set this to 0.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>(wh)itelist</b> : Automatic whitelisting. DSPAM will keep track of the
      entire &quot;From:&quot; line for each message received per user, and
      automatically whitelist messages from senders with more than 20 innocent
      messages and zero spams. Once the user reports a spam from the sender,
      automatic whitelisting will automatically be deactivated for that sender.
      Since DSPAM uses the entire &quot;From:&quot; line, and not just the
      sender's email address, automatic whitelisting is a very safe approach to
      improving accuracy especially during initial training.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>NOTE:</b> : None of the present features are necessary when the source is
      &quot;error&quot;, because the original training data is used from the
      signature to retrain, instantiating whatever features (such as
      whitelisting) were active at the time of the initial classification. Since
      BNR is only necessary when a message is being classified, the
      <b>--feature</b> flag can be safely omitted from error source calls.

      being presented:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>error</b> : The message being presented was a message previously
      misclassified by DSPAM. When &#x00B4;error&#x00B4; is provided as a
      source, DSPAM requires that the DSPAM signature be present in the message,
      and will use the signature to recall the original training metadata. If
      the signature is not present, the message will be rejected. In this source
      mode, DSPAM will also decrement each token's previous classification's
      count as well as the user totals.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You should use error only when DSPAM has made an error in classifying the
      message, and should present the modified version of the message with the
      DSPAM signature when doing so.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>corpus</b> : The message being presented is from a mail corpus, and
      should be trained as a new message, rather than re-trained based on a
      signature. The message's full headers and body will be analyzed and the
      correct classification will be incremented, without its opposite being
      decremented.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You should use corpus only when feeding messages in from corpus.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>inoculation</b> : The message being presented is in pristine form, and
      should be trained as an inoculation. Inoculations are a more intense mode
      of training designed to cause DSPAM to train the user's metadata
      repeatedly on previoulsy unknown tokens, in an attempt to vaccinate the
      user from future messages similar to the one being presented. You should
      use inoculation only on honeypots and the like.
