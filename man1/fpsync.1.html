<p>FPSYNC(1) BSD General Commands Manual FPSYNC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fpsync &acirc; Synchronize directories in parallel using
fpart and rsync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fpsync [-h] [-v] [-n jobs] [-f files] [-s size] [-w wrks]
[-d shdir] [-t tmpdir] [-r jobname] [-o rsyncopts] [-O
fpartopts] [-S] src_dir/ dst_dir/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fpsync tool synchronizes directories in parallel using
fpart(1) and rsync(1). It computes subsets of src_dir/ and
spawns rsync(1) jobs to synchronize them to dst_dir/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synchronization jobs can be
executed either locally or remotely (using SSH workers, see
option -w) and are executed on-the-fly while filesystem
crawling goes on. This makes fpsync <br>
a good tool for migrating large filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. Can be be
specified several times to increase verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n jobs <br>
Start jobs concurrent sync jobs (either locally or remotely,
see below). Default: 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f files <br>
Transfer at most files files per sync job. Default: 2000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
Transfer at most size bytes per sync job. <br>
Default: 4294967296 (4 GB)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w wrks <br>
Use remote SSH wrks to synchronize files. Synchronization
jobs are executed locally when this option is not set. wrks
is a space-separated list of login@machine connection <br>
strings and can be specified several times. You must be
allowed to connect to those machines using a SSH key to
avoid user interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d shdir <br>
Set fpsync shared directory to shdir. This option is
mandatory when using SSH workers and set by default to
tmpdir when running locally. The specified directory must be
an <br>
absolute path ; it will be used to handle communications
with SSH hosts (sharing partitions and log files) and, as a
consequence, must be made available to all participat&acirc;
<br>
ing hosts (e.g. through a r/w NFS mount), including the
master one running fpsync.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tmpdir <br>
Set fpsync temporary directory to tmpdir. This directory
remains local and does not need to be shared amongst SSH
workers when using the -w option. Default: /tmp/fpsync</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r jobname <br>
Resume job jobname and restart synchronizing remaining
partitions from a previous run. jobname can be obtained
using verbose mode (see option -v). Note that filesystem
<br>
crawling is skipped when resuming a previous run. As a
consequence, options -f, -s, -o, -O, -S, src_dir/, and
dst_dir/ are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o rsyncopts <br>
Override default rsync(1) options with rsyncopts. Use this
option with care as certain options are incompatible with a
parallel usage (e.g. --delete). Default: -av <br>
--numeric-ids</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O fpartopts <br>
Override default fpart(1) options with fpartopts. <br>
Default: -x .zfs -x .snapshot* -x .ckpt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Sudo mode. Use sudo(8) for
filesystem crawling and synchronizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">src_dir/ <br>
Source directory. It must be absolute and available on all
participating hosts (including the master one, running
fpsync).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dst_dir/ <br>
Destination directory. It must be absolute and available on
all participating workers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNNING FPSYNC <br>
Each fpsync run generates a unique jobname, which is
displayed in verbose mode (see option -v) and within log
files. You can use that jobname to resume a previous run
(see option <br>
-r). fpsync will then restart synchronizing data from the
parts that were being synchonized at the time it
stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This unique feature gives the
administrator the ability to stop fpsync and restart it
later, without having to restart the whole filesystem
crawling and synchronization process. <br>
Note that resuming is only possible when filesystem crawling
step has finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During synchronization, you can
press CTRL-C to interrupt the process. The first CTRL-C
prevents new synchronizations from being submitted and the
process will wait for current <br>
synchronizations to be finished before exiting. If you press
CTRL-C again, current synchronizations will be killed and
fpsync will exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On certain systems, CTRL-T can
be pressed to get the status of current and remaining parts
to be synchronized. This can also be achieved by sending a
SIGINFO to the fpsync process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whether you use verbose mode or
not, everything is logged within shdir/log/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpsync -n 4 /usr/src/
/var/src/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synchronizes /usr/src/ to
/var/src/ using 4 local jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpsync -n 2 -w login@machine1 -w
login@machine2 -d /mnt/fpsync /mnt/src/ /mnt/dst/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synchronizes /mnt/src/ to
/mnt/dst/ using 2 concurrent jobs executed remotely on 2 SSH
workers (machine1 and machine2). The shared directory is set
to /mnt/fpsync and <br>
mounted on the machine running fpsync, as well as on
machine1 and machine2. The source directory (/mnt/src/) is
also available on those 3 machines, while the destination
<br>
directory (/mnt/dst/) is mounted on SSH workers only
(machine1 and machine2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITS <br>
Parallelizing rsync(1) makes several options not usable,
such as --delete. If your source directory is live while
fpsync is running, you will have to delete extra files from
des&acirc; <br>
tination directory. This is usually done by using a final
-offline- rsync(1) pass that will use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpsync enqueues synchronization
jobs on disk, within the tmpdir/queue directory. Be careful
to host this queue on a filesystem that can handle
fine-grained mtime timestamps (i.e. <br>
with a sub-second precision) if you want the queue to be
processed in order when fpart(1) generates several jobs per
second. On FreeBSD, VFS(9) timestamps&rsquo; precision can
be tuned <br>
using the &rsquo;vfs.timestamp_precision&rsquo; sysctl. See
vfs_timestamp(9).</p>
