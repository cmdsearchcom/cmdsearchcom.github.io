<p>STRFILE(1) UNIX System Manager&rsquo;s Manual
STRFILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
strfile - create a random access file for storing strings
<br>
unstr - dump strings in pointer order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
strfile [-iorsx] [-c char] sourcefile [outputfile] <br>
unstr [-c char] datafile[.ext] [outputfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
strfile reads a file containing groups of lines separated by
a line containing a single percent &lsquo;%&rsquo; sign (or
other specified delimiter character) and creates a data file
which <br>
contains a header structure and a table of file offsets for
each group of lines. This allows random access of the
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output file, if not
specified on the command line, is named sourcefile.dat.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of unstr is to undo
the work of strfile. It prints out the strings contained in
the sourcefile, which is datafile.ext without its extension,
or datafile if no exten&acirc; <br>
sion is specified (in this case, the extension .dat is added
to the name of the datafile) in the order that they are
listed in the header file datafile. If no outputfile is <br>
specified, it prints to standard output; otherwise it prints
to the file specified. unstr can also universally change the
delimiter character in a strings file. It is possible <br>
to create sorted versions of input files by using strfile -o
and then using unstr to dump them out in the table
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c char <br>
Change the delimiting character from the percent sign to
char. This option is available for both strfile and
unstr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Ignore case when ordering the
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Order the strings in
alphabetical order. The offset table will be sorted in the
alphabetical order of the groups of lines referenced. Any
initial non-alphanumeric char&acirc; <br>
acters are ignored. This option causes the STR_ORDERED bit
in the header str_flags field to be set. (It also now really
does sort! It didn&rsquo;t used to).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Randomize access to the
strings. Entries in the offset table will be randomly
ordered. This option causes the STR_RANDOM bit in the header
str_flags field to be set. <br>
(And really does randomize)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Run silently; don&rsquo;t
give a summary message when finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Note that each alphabetic
character in the groups of lines is rotated 13 positions in
a simple caesar cypher. This option causes the STR_ROTATED
bit in the header <br>
str_flags field to be set. Note that it does not rotate the
strings--that operation must be performed separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Header <br>
The format of the header is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define VERSION 1 <br>
unsigned long str_version; /* version number */ <br>
unsigned long str_numstr; /* # of strings in the file */
<br>
unsigned long str_longlen; /* length of longest string */
<br>
unsigned long str_shortlen; /* shortest string length */
<br>
#define STR_RANDOM 0x1 /* randomized pointers */ <br>
#define STR_ORDERED 0x2 /* ordered pointers */ <br>
#define STR_ROTATED 0x4 /* rot-13&rsquo;d text */ <br>
unsigned long str_flags; /* bit field for flags */ <br>
char str_delim; /* delimiting character */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All fields are written in
network byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Fewer now, one hopes. However, fortunes (text strings)
beginning with a blank line appear to be sorted between
random letters. This includes ASCII art that contains no
letters, <br>
and first lines that are solely non-alphanumeric,
apparently. I&rsquo;ve no idea why this should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER USES <br>
What can you do with this besides printing sarcastic and
obscene messages to the screens of lusers at login or
logout?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some other
possibilities. Source code for a sample program, randstr, is
included with this distribution: randstr splits the
difference between unstr and fortune. It <br>
reads a single, specified file, and randomly selects a
single text string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Include strfile.h into a news
reading/posting program, to generate random signatures.
Tin(1) does something similar, in a much more complex
manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Include it in a game. While
strfile doesn&rsquo;t support &rsquo;fields&rsquo; or
&rsquo;records&rsquo;, there&rsquo;s no reason that the text
strings can&rsquo;t be consistent: first line, a die roll;
second <br>
line, a score; third and subsequent lines, a text
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Use it to store your address
book. Hell, some of the guys I know would be as well off
using it to decide who to call on Friday nights (and for
some, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter <br>
whether there were phone numbers in it or not).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Use it in
&rsquo;lottery&rsquo; situations. If you&rsquo;re an ISP,
write a script to store login names and GECOS from
/etc/passwd in strfile format, write another to send
&rsquo;congratula&acirc; <br>
tions, you&rsquo;ve won&rsquo; to the lucky login selected.
The prize might be a month&rsquo;s free service, or if
you&rsquo;re AOL, a month free on a real service
provider.</p>

byteorder(3), fortune(6)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The strfile utility first appeared in 4.4BSD. This version
was heavily modified, much of it in ways peculiar to Linux.
Work has since been done to make the code more generic, <br>
and has so far been tested to work with SunOS 4.x. More
platforms are expected to be supported as work
continues.</p>
