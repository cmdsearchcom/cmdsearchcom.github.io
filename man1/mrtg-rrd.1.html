mrtg-rrd - How to use RRDtool with MRTG
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
After using MRTG for some time you may find some limitations, mostly in the
  areas of performance and graphing flexibility. These are exactly the areas
  addressed by RRDtool. To learn more about RRDtool check out its website on
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RRDTOOL_INTEGRATION"><a class="selflink" href="#RRDTOOL_INTEGRATION">RRDTOOL
  INTEGRATION</a></h1>
When using mrtg with RRDtool you are replacing <i>rateup</i> with the RRDtool
  perl module <i>RRDs.pm</i>. To enable RRDtool support in mrtg you have to add
  the line
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 LogFormat: rrdtool
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to your mrtg config file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
MRTG needs access to both the RRDtool perl module <b>RRDs.pm</b> and to the
  <b>rrdtool</b> executable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If these two items are not installed in locations where perl can find them on
  its own, then you can use the following two parameters to supply the
  appropriate directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the location of the <b>rrdtool</b> executable you put
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 PathAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/bin/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 PathAdd: c:\rrdtool\bin
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For the location of the perl module it would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 LibAdd: /usr/local/rrdtool/lib/perl/
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 LibAdd: c:\rrdtool\bin\lib\perl
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you have made this modification to the configuration file, several things
  will happen when you run mrtg again with the new config file:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">mrtg will take all your old &quot;.log&quot; files and
      <b>convert</b> them to &quot;.rrd&quot; format. (The &quot;.log&quot;
      files don't get touched in the process, so if things don't work out they
      are still there.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">mrtg will use <b>rrdtool</b> to update its databases. These
      will have a new format called <i>rrd</i> which is totally different than
      the native <i>log</i> format of the classic mrtg.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">mrtg will <b>not</b> create any webpages of graphs anymore.
      It will only query the routers for traffic information and update its
      <i>rrd</i> databases.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The advantage of whole thing is that the mrtg will become <b>much</b> faster.
  Expect the runtime to drop to 20% of the previous value. (I would like to get
  some feedback on this from folks with large installations.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Mind you, though, while the logging process of RRDtool is <b>very</b> fast, you
  are also gaining some time by neither creating graphs nor updating webpages.
  The idea behind this is that it is more efficient to create graphs and
  webpages on demand by using a cgi script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the moment there is no <b>official</b> script to do this, but two
  contributers have created such scripts:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">One4All aka 14all.cgi</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This was the first program to take over the webpage
      creation and graphing task. It has been developed by Rainer Bawidamann
      rainer.bawidamann@web.de. You can find a copy on Rainers website:
      http://my14all.sourceforge.net/ The program comes with its own
      documentation</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>routers2.cgi</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is another CGI frontend for mrtg running with rrdtool.
      The main difference between this and 14all is that the web pages it
      creates are much more stylish than the ones from mrtg, plus they support
      User Defined summary graphs and different levels of Authentication and
      Authorisation. This has been written by Steve Shipway
      (steve@steveshipway.org). You obtain a copy, and find a forum and
      demonstration system at http://www.steveshipway.org/software/ The program
      comes with its own installation instructions and install script.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>mrtg-rrd</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The mrtg-rrd script is a CGI/FastCGI application by Jan
      &quot;Yenya&quot; Kasprzak for displaying MRTG graphs from data in the
      RRDtool format. It is an intended replacement for the 14all.cgi script. It
      can make your monitoring system faster because MRTG does not have to
      generate all the PNG files with graphs every 5 minutes or so. Instead of
      this the graphs are generated on-demand when the user wants to see them.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FUTURE"><a class="selflink" href="#FUTURE">FUTURE</a></h1>
Just as a side note: MRTG-3 will be based entirely on rrdtool technology. But
  don't wait for it ... get going <b>now</b>!
