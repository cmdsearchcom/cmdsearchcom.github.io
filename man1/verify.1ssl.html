verify - Utility to verify certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
openssl verify [-CApath directory] [-CAfile file]
[-trusted_first] [-purpose purpose] [-policy arg]
[-ignore_critical] [-crl_check] [-crl_check_all]
[-policy_check] <br>
[-explicit_policy] [-inhibit_any] [-inhibit_map]

[-verbose] [-] [certificates]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The verify command verifies certificate chains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND OPTIONS <br>
-CApath directory <br>
A directory of trusted certificates. The certificates should
have names of the form: hash.0 or have symbolic links to
them of this form (&quot;hash&quot; is the hashed
certificate <br>
subject name: see the -hash option of the x509 utility).
Under Unix the c_rehash script will automatically create
symbolic links to a directory of certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CAfile file <br>
A file of trusted certificates. The file should contain
multiple certificates in PEM format concatenated
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-untrusted file <br>
A file of untrusted certificates. The file should contain
multiple certificates in PEM format concatenated
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trusted_first <br>
Use certificates in CA file or CA directory before the
certificates in the untrusted file when building the trust
chain to verify certificates. This is mainly useful in <br>
environments with Bridge CA or Cross-Certified CAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-purpose purpose <br>
The intended use for the certificate. If this option is not
specified, verify will not consider certificate purpose
during chain verification. Currently accepted uses are <br>
sslclient, sslserver, nssslserver, smimesign, smimeencrypt.
See the VERIFY OPERATION section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Print out a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print extra information about the operations being
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-issuer_checks <br>
Print out diagnostics relating to searches for the issuer
certificate of the current certificate. This shows why each
candidate issuer certificate was rejected. The presence <br>
of rejection messages does not itself imply that anything is
wrong; during the normal verification process, several
rejections may take place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-attime timestamp <br>
Perform validation checks using the time specified by
timestamp and not the current system time. timestamp is the
number of seconds since 01.01.1970 (UNIX time).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-policy arg <br>
Enable policy processing and add arg to the
user-initial-policy-set (see RFC5280). The policy arg can be
an object name an OID in numeric form. This argument can
appear more <br>
than once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-policy_check <br>
Enables certificate policy processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-explicit_policy <br>
Set policy variable require-explicit-policy (see
RFC5280).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inhibit_any <br>
Set policy variable inhibit-any-policy (see RFC5280).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inhibit_map <br>
Set policy variable inhibit-policy-mapping (see
RFC5280).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-policy_print <br>
Print out diagnostics related to policy processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crl_check <br>
Checks end entity certificate validity by attempting to look
up a valid CRL. If a valid CRL cannot be found an error
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crl_check_all <br>
Checks the validity of all certificates in the chain by
attempting to look up valid CRLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ignore_critical <br>
Normally if an unhandled critical extension is present which
is not supported by OpenSSL the certificate is rejected (as
required by RFC5280). If this option is set critical <br>
extensions are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x509_strict <br>
For strict X.509 compliance, disable non-compliant
workarounds for broken certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extended_crl <br>
Enable extended CRL features such as indirect CRLs and
alternate CRL signing keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use_deltas <br>
Enable support for delta CRLs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check_ss_sig <br>
Verify the signature on the self-signed root CA. This is
disabled by default because it doesn&rsquo;t add any
security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Indicates the last option. All
arguments following this are assumed to be certificate
files. This is useful if the first certificate filename
begins with a -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">certificates <br>
One or more certificates to verify. If no certificates are
given, verify will attempt to read a certificate from
standard input. Certificates must be in PEM format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERIFY OPERATION <br>
The verify program uses the same functions as the internal
SSL and S/MIME verification, therefore this description
applies to these verify operations too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one crucial difference
between the verify operations performed by the verify
program: wherever possible an attempt is made to continue
after an error whereas normally <br>
the verify operation would halt on the first error. This
allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be
determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The verify operation consists of
a number of separate steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly a certificate chain is
built up starting from the supplied certificate and ending
in the root CA. It is an error if the whole chain cannot be
built up. The chain is built <br>
up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current
certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own
issuer it is assumed to be the root CA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The process of &rsquo;looking up
the issuers certificate&rsquo; itself involves a number of
steps. In versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.5a the first
certificate whose subject name matched the <br>
issuer of the current certificate was assumed to be the
issuers certificate. In OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later all
certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name of
the current <br>
certificate are subject to further tests. The relevant
authority key identifier components of the current
certificate (if present) must match the subject key
identifier (if <br>
present) and issuer and serial number of the candidate
issuer, in addition the keyUsage extension of the candidate
issuer (if present) must permit certificate signing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lookup first looks in the
list of untrusted certificates and if no match is found the
remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates. The
root CA is always looked up in <br>
the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to verify
is a root certificate then an exact match must be found in
the trusted list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second operation is to check
every untrusted certificate&rsquo;s extensions for
consistency with the supplied purpose. If the -purpose
option is not included then no checks are <br>
done. The supplied or &quot;leaf&quot; certificate must have
extensions compatible with the supplied purpose and all
other certificates must also be valid CA certificates. The
precise <br>
extensions required are described in more detail in the
CERTIFICATE EXTENSIONS section of the x509 utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third operation is to check
the trust settings on the root CA. The root CA should be
trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with
previous versions of SSLeay and <br>
OpenSSL a certificate with no trust settings is considered
to be valid for all purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final operation is to check
the validity of the certificate chain. The validity period
is checked against the current system time and the notBefore
and notAfter dates in the <br>
certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at
this point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If all operations complete
successfully then certificate is considered valid. If any
operation fails then the certificate is not valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
When a verify operation fails the output messages can be
somewhat cryptic. The general form of the error message
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">server.pem:
/C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024
bit) <br>
error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first line contains the name
of the certificate being verified followed by the subject
name of the certificate. The second line contains the error
number and the depth. The <br>
depth is number of the certificate being verified when a
problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate
being verified itself then 1 for the CA that signed the <br>
certificate and so on. Finally a text version of the error
number is presented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exhaustive list of the error
codes and messages is shown below, this also includes the
name of the error code as defined in the header file
x509_vfy.h Some of the error codes <br>
are defined but never returned: these are described as
&quot;unused&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">30
X509_V_ERR_AKID_SKID_MISMATCH: authority and subject key

X509_V_ERR_APPLICATION_VERIFICATION: application
verification failure <br>
an application specific error. Unused.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Although the issuer checks are a considerably improvement
over the old technique they still suffer from limitations in
the underlying X509_LOOKUP API. One consequence of this is
<br>
that trusted certificates with matching subject name must
either appear in a file (as specified by the -CAfile option)
or a directory (as specified by -CApath. If they occur in
<br>
both then only the certificates in the file will be
recognised.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous versions of OpenSSL
assume certificates with matching subject name are identical
and mishandled them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous versions of this
documentation swapped the meaning of the
X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT and 20
X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY error
codes.</p>
