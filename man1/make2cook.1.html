<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>make2cook</i> program is used to translate <i>Makefile</i>s into
  cookbooks. This command is provided to ease the transition to using the
  <i>cook</i> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no input file is named, or the special name ``-'' is used, input will be
  taken from the standard input. If no output file is named, or the special name
  ``-'' is used, output will be taken from the standard output.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEMANTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#SEMANTICS">SEMANTICS</a></h1>
There is no one-to-one semantic mapping between <i>make</i> semantics and
  <i>cook</i> semantics, so the results will probably need some manual editing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The functionality provided by classic <i>make (1)</i> implementations is
  accurately reproduced. Extensions, such as those offered by GNU Make or BSD
  make, are not always understood, or are sometimes not reproduced identically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following subsections enumerate a few of the things which are understood and
  not understood. They are probably not complete.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Understood"><a class="selflink" href="#Understood">Understood</a></h2>
The <i>cook</i> program requires variables to be defined before they are used,
  whereas <i>make</i> will default them to be empty. This is understood, and
  empty definitions are inserted as required.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of the builtin variables of GNU Make are understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most of the builtin rules of classic make, GNU Make and BSD make are reproduced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>For best results</b> there should be a blank line after every rule, so that
  there can be no confusion where one rule ends and a new one begins.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Builtin variables are defaulted from the environment, if an environment variable
  of the same name is set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make <i>override</i> variable assignment is understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make ``+='' assignment is understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make ``:='' variable assignment is understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Traditional make assignments are macros, they are expanded on use, rather than
  on assignment. The <i>cook</i> program has only variables. Assignment
  statements are re-arranged to ensure the correct results when variables are
  referenced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Single and double suffix rules are understood. The .SUFFIXES rules are
  understood and honoured. Hint: if you want to suppress the builtin-recipes,
  use a .SUFFIXES rule with no dependencies.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .PHONY rule is understood, and is translated into a <i>set forced</i> flag
  in appropriate recipes, except files from implicit recipes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .PRECIOUS rule is understood, and is translated into a <i>set precious</i>
  flag in the appropriate recipes, except files from implicit recipes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .DEFAULT rule is understood, and is translated into an implicit recipe.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .IGNORE rule is understood, and is translated into a <i>set errok</i>
  statement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The .SILENT rule is understood, and is translated into a <i>set silent</i>
  statement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Most GNU Make functions are understood. The <i>filter</i> and <i>filter-out</i>
  functions only understand a single pattern. The <i>sort</i> function does not
  remove duplicates (wrap the <i>stringset</i> function around it if you need
  this).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make static pattern rules are understood. They are translated into
  recipe predicates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make and BSD make <i>include</i> variants are understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The bizarre irregularities surrounding archive files in automatic variables and
  suffix rules are understood, and translated into consistent readable recipes.
  The <i>make</i> semantics are preserved.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The BSD make <i>.CURDIR</i> variable is understood, and translated to an
  equivalent expression. It cannot be assigned to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make and BSD make conditionals are understood, provided that they
  bracket whole segments of the makefile, and that these segments are
  syntactically valid. Cconditionals may also appear within rule body commands.
  Conditionals are <i>not</i> understood within the lines of a <i>define</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make <i>define</i> is understood, but its use as a kind of ``function
  definition'' is <i>not</i> understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make <i>export</i> and <i>unexport</i> directives are understood.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Not_Understood"><a class="selflink" href="#Not_Understood">Not
  Understood</a></h2>
The <i>cook</i> program tokenizes its input, whereas make does textual
  replacement. The shennanigans required to construct a make macro containing a
  single space are not understood. The translation will result in a <i>cook</i>
  variable which is empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
References to automatic variables within macro definitions will not work.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make <i>foreach</i> function is olny partially understood. This has no
  exact <i>cook</i> equivalent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GNU Make <i>origin</i> function is not understood. This has no <i>cook</i>
  equivalent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>archive</i>((<i>member</i>)) notation is not understood. These semantics
  are not available from <i>cook</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>MAKEFILES</i> and <i>MAKELEVEL</i> variables are not translated, If you
  wish to reproduce this functionality, you must edit the output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>MAKEFLAGS</i> and <i>MFLAGS</i> variables will be translated to use the
  Cook <i>options</i> function, which has a different range of values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many variants of make can use builtin rules to make the Makefile if it is
  absent. <i>Cook</i> is unable to cook the cookbook if it is absent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Wildcards are not understood in rule targets, rule dependencies or include
  directives. If you want these, you will have to edit the output to use the
  <i>[wildcard]</i> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Home directory tildes (~) are not understood in targets and dependencies. If you
  want this, you will have to edit the output to use the <i>[home]</i> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The -l <i>home</i> dependency is not understood to mean a library. If you want
  this, you will have to edit the output to use the <i>[collect findlibs
  -l</i>name<i>]</i> function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</i> rule is not understood. This has no <i>cook</i>
  equivalent.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options are understood:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Environment</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option causes fragments to test for environment variables when
      performing the default settings for variables. (This corresponds to the
      make -e option.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-History_Commands</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    This option causes <i>make2cook</i> to include recipes for <i>RCS</i> and
      <i>SCCS</i> in the output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-Line_Numbers</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    Insert line number directives into the output, so that it is possible to
      tell where the lines came from. Most useful when debugging.

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-No_Internal_Rules</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>

      to make's internal rules. (This corresponds to the make -r option.)</dd>

All other options will produce a diagnostic error.
