<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
make2cook - translate makefiles into cookbooks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
make2cook [ option... ][ infile [ outfile ]] <br>
make2cook -Help <br>
make2cook -VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The make2cook program is used to translate Makefiles into
cookbooks. This command is provided to ease the transition
to using the cook command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no input file is named, or
the special name &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; is used,
input will be taken from the standard input. If no output
file is named, or the special name
&lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo; is used, out&acirc; <br>
put will be taken from the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEMANTICS <br>
There is no one-to-one semantic mapping between make
semantics and cook semantics, so the results will probably
need some manual editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functionality provided by
classic make (1) implementations is accurately reproduced.
Extensions, such as those offered by GNU Make or BSD make,
are not always understood, or <br>
are sometimes not reproduced identically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following subsections
enumerate a few of the things which are understood and not
understood. They are probably not complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Understood <br>
The cook program requires variables to be defined before
they are used, whereas make will default them to be empty.
This is understood, and empty definitions are inserted as
<br>
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the builtin variables of
GNU Make are understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the builtin rules of
classic make, GNU Make and BSD make are reproduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For best results there should be
a blank line after every rule, so that there can be no
confusion where one rule ends and a new one begins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin variables are defaulted
from the environment, if an environment variable of the same
name is set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make override variable
assignment is understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make
&lsquo;&lsquo;+=&rsquo;&rsquo; assignment is understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make
&lsquo;&lsquo;:=&rsquo;&rsquo; variable assignment is
understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Traditional make assignments are
macros, they are expanded on use, rather than on assignment.
The cook program has only variables. Assignment statements
are re-arranged to <br>
ensure the correct results when variables are
referenced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single and double suffix rules
are understood. The .SUFFIXES rules are understood and
honoured. Hint: if you want to suppress the builtin-recipes,
use a .SUFFIXES rule with no <br>
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .PHONY rule is understood,
and is translated into a set forced flag in appropriate
recipes, except files from implicit recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .PRECIOUS rule is
understood, and is translated into a set precious flag in
the appropriate recipes, except files from implicit
recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .DEFAULT rule is understood,
and is translated into an implicit recipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .IGNORE rule is understood,
and is translated into a set errok statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .SILENT rule is understood,
and is translated into a set silent statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most GNU Make functions are
understood. The filter and filter-out functions only
understand a single pattern. The sort function does not
remove duplicates (wrap the stringset <br>
function around it if you need this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make static pattern
rules are understood. They are translated into recipe
predicates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make and BSD make
include variants are understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The bizarre irregularities
surrounding archive files in automatic variables and suffix
rules are understood, and translated into consistent
readable recipes. The make semantics <br>
are preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BSD make .CURDIR variable is
understood, and translated to an equivalent expression. It
cannot be assigned to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make and BSD make
conditionals are understood, provided that they bracket
whole segments of the makefile, and that these segments are
syntactically valid. Cconditionals <br>
may also appear within rule body commands. Conditionals are
not understood within the lines of a define.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make define is
understood, but its use as a kind of &lsquo;&lsquo;function
definition&rsquo;&rsquo; is not understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make export and unexport
directives are understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not Understood <br>
The cook program tokenizes its input, whereas make does
textual replacement. The shennanigans required to construct
a make macro containing a single space are not understood.
<br>
The translation will result in a cook variable which is
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">References to automatic
variables within macro definitions will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make foreach function is
olny partially understood. This has no exact cook
equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU Make origin function is
not understood. This has no cook equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive((member)) notation
is not understood. These semantics are not available from
cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MAKEFILES and MAKELEVEL
variables are not translated, If you wish to reproduce this
functionality, you must edit the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MAKEFLAGS and MFLAGS
variables will be translated to use the Cook options
function, which has a different range of values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many variants of make can use
builtin rules to make the Makefile if it is absent. Cook is
unable to cook the cookbook if it is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards are not understood in
rule targets, rule dependencies or include directives. If
you want these, you will have to edit the output to use the
[wildcard] function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home directory tildes (~) are
not understood in targets and dependencies. If you want
this, you will have to edit the output to use the [home]
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -lhome dependency is not
understood to mean a library. If you want this, you will
have to edit the output to use the [collect findlibs -lname]
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES rule
is not understood. This has no cook equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Provide some help with using the make2cook command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Environment <br>
This option causes fragments to test for environment
variables when performing the default settings for
variables. (This corresponds to the make -e option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-History_Commands <br>
This option causes make2cook to include recipes for RCS and
SCCS in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Line_Numbers <br>
Insert line number directives into the output, so that it is
possible to tell where the lines came from. Most useful when
debugging. make2cook program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Internal_Rules <br>
This option may be used to supress all generation of recipes
corresponding to make&rsquo;s internal rules. (This
corresponds to the make -r option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VERSion <br>
Print the version of the make2cook program being
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other options will produce a
diagnostic error.</p>
