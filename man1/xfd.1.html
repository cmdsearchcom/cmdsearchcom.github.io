<p>XFD(1) General Commands Manual XFD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xfd - display all the characters in an X font</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xfd [-options ...] -fn fontname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xfd [-options ...] -fa
fontname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xfd utility creates a window containing the name of the
font being displayed, a row of command buttons, several
lines of text for displaying character metrics, and a grid
<br>
containing one glyph per cell. The characters are shown in
increasing order from left to right, top to bottom. The
first character displayed at the top left will be character
<br>
number 0 unless the -start option has been supplied in which
case the character with the number given in the -start
option will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The characters are displayed in
a grid of boxes, each large enough to hold any single
character in the font. Each character glyph is drawn using
the PolyText16 request (used by <br>
the Xlib routine XDrawString16) or the XftDrawString32
routine, depending on whether the -fn or -fa option was
given. If the -box option is given, a rectangle will be
drawn <br>
around each character, showing where an ImageText16 request
(used by the Xlib routine XDrawImageString16) would cause
background color to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The origin of each glyph is
normally set so that the character is drawn in the upper
left hand corner of the grid cell. However, if a glyph has a
negative left bearing or an <br>
unusually large ascent, descent, or right bearing (as is the
case with cursor font), some character may not appear in
their own grid cells. The -center option may be used to <br>
force all glyphs to be centered in their respective
cells.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the characters in the font
may not fit in the window at once. To see the next page of
glyphs, press the Next button at the top of the window. To
see the previous page, <br>
press Prev. To exit xfd, press Quit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual character metrics
(index, width, bearings, ascent and descent) can be
displayed at the top of the window by clicking on the
desired character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The font name displayed at the
top of the window is the full name of the font, as
determined by the server. See xlsfonts and fc-list for ways
to generate lists of fonts, as well <br>
as more detailed summaries of their metrics and
properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
xfd accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options
along with the additional options listed below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fn font <br>
This option specifies the core X server side font to be
displayed. This can also be set with the FontGrid font
resource. A font must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fa font <br>
This option specifies a Xft font to be displayed. This can
also be set with the FontGrid face resource. A font pattern
must be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-box This option indicates that
a box should be displayed outlining the area that would be
filled with background color by an ImageText request. This
can also be set with the <br>
FontGrid boxChars resource. The default is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-center This option indicates
that each glyph should be centered in its grid. This can
also be set with the FontGrid centerChars resource. The
default is False.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-start number <br>
This option specifies the glyph index of the upper left hand
corner of the grid. This is used to view characters at
arbitrary locations in the font. This can also be <br>
set with the FontGrid startChar resource. The default is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bc color <br>
This option specifies the color to be used if ImageText
boxes are drawn. This can also be set with the FontGrid
boxColor resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rows numrows <br>
This option specifies the number of rows in the grid. This
can also be set with the FontGrid cellRows resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-columns numcols <br>
This option specifies the number of columns in the grid.
This can also be set with the FontGrid cellColumns
resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WIDGETS <br>
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the
widgets which compose xfd. In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure. The widget
class name is <br>
given first, followed by the widget instance name. The
application class name is Xfd.</p>

FontGrid grid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FONTGRID RESOURCES <br>
The FontGrid widget is an application-specific widget, and a
subclass of the Simple widget in the Athena widget set. The
effects and instance names of this widget&rsquo;s resources
<br>
are given in the OPTIONS section. Capitalize the first
letter of the resource instance name to get the
corresponding class name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION SPECIFIC RESOURCES
<br>
The instance names of the application specific resources are
given below. Capitalize the first letter of the resource
instance name to get the corresponding class name. These
<br>
resources are unlikely to be interesting unless you are
localizing xfd for a different language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selectFormat <br>
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display
information about the selected character. The default is
&quot;character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)&quot;. The
arguments <br>
that will come after the format string are char.byte1,
char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2.
char.byte1 is byte 1 of the selected character. <br>
char.byte2 is byte 2 of the selected character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">metricsFormat <br>
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display
character metrics. The default is &quot;width %d; left %d,
right %d; ascent %d, descent %d (font %d, %d)&quot;. The
argu&acirc; <br>
ments that will come after the format string are the
character metrics width, lbearing, rbearing, character
ascent, character descent, font ascent, and font
descent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rangeFormat <br>
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display the
range of characters currently being displayed. The default
is &quot;range: 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) thru 0x%02x%02x <br>
(%u,%u)&quot;. The arguments that will come after the format
string are the following fields from the XFontStruct that is
returned from opening the font: min_byte1, <br>
min_char_or_byte2, min_byte1, min_char_or_byte2, max_byte1,
max_char_or_byte2, max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startFormat <br>
Specifies a printf-style format string used to display
information about the character at the upper left corner of
the font grid. The default is &quot;upper left: 0x%04x <br>
(%d,%d)&quot;. The arguments that will come after the format
string are the new character, the high byte of the new
character, and the low byte of the new character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nocharFormat <br>
Specifies a printf-style format string to display when the
selected character does not exist. The default is &quot;no
such character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)&quot;. The
argu&acirc; <br>
ments that will come after the format string are the same as
for the selectFormat resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The program should skip over pages full of non-existent
characters.</p>
