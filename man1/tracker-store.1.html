<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tracker-store - database indexer and query daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tracker-store [OPTION...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tracker-store provides both a powerful database daemon which
allows clients to query or update their data using the
highly descriptive SPARQL language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tracker-store does not do any
file crawling or any mining of data itself, instead other
processes do that while tracker-store serves as a daemon
waiting for such requests from <br>
application miners like tracker-miner-fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help <br>
A brief help message including some examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Returns the version of this binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbosity={0|1|2|3} <br>
Sets the logging level, 0=errors, 1=minimal, 2=detailed,
3=debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --force-reindex <br>
This forces tracker-store to remove databases and to
recreate fresh databases ready for data insertion from the
miners. For more information about the miners, see tracker-
<br>
miner-fs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --readonly-mode <br>
This starts tracker-store in a mode which disables writing
to the database. Only SPARQL read requests can be serviced
if this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TRACKER_DB_ONTOLOGIES_DIR <br>
This is the directory which tracker uses to load the
.ontology files from. If unset it will default to the
correct place. This is used mainly for testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_LANGUAGE_STOP_WORDS_DIR
<br>
This is the directory which tracker uses to load the stop
words dictionaries from. If unset it will default to the
correct place. This is used mainly for testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_STORE_MAX_TASK_TIME <br>
This is maximum time allowed for a process to finish before
interruption happens. The actual moment of interruption
depends also on the frequency of checks. The value 0 <br>
indicates no interruption. This environment variable is used
mainly for testing purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_STORE_SELECT_CACHE_SIZE
/ TRACKER_STORE_UPDATE_CACHE_SIZE <br>
Tracker caches database statements which occur frequently to
make subsequent repeat queries much faster. The cache size
is set to 100 by default for each type (select and <br>
update queries). This must be at least 2 as a minimum, any
less and a value of 3 is used instead. The number represents
the number of cached statements to keep around. <br>
This environment variable is used mainly for testing
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_PRAGMAS_FILE <br>
Tracker has a fixed set of PRAGMA settings for creating its
SQLite connection. With this environment variable pointing
to a text file you can override these settings. The <br>
file is a separated list of SQLite queries to execute on any
newly created SQLite connection in tracker-store.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_DISABLE_MEEGOTOUCH_LOCALE
<br>
If Tracker is compiled with meegotouch locale management
support, setting this variable in the environment will
disable retrieving the locale from GConf, and the standard
<br>
locale settings will be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_USE_LOG_FILES <br>
Don&rsquo;t just log to stdout and stderr, but to log files
too which are kept in $HOME/.local/share/tracker/. This came
into effect in 0.15.3 and 0.16.0. After this version of <br>
Tracker, logging to file (usually useful for debugging) can
only be done by declaring this environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES <br>
Don&rsquo;t use GSettings, instead use a config file similar
to how settings were saved in 0.10.x. That is, a file which
is much like an .ini file. These are saved to <br>
$HOME/.config/tracker/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
tracker-store is highly bound to the D-Bus freedesktop
project. A D-Bus session is needed for all Tracker processes
to communicate between each other. D-Bus is our acting IPC.
<br>
See dbus-daemon(1) for more information.</p>
