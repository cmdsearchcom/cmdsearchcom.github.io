<p>DF(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
DF(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
df &acirc; report free disk space</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
df [&acirc;k] [&acirc;P|&acirc;t] [file...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The df utility shall write the amount of available space and
file slots for file systems on which the invoking user has
appropriate read access. File systems shall be specified
<br>
by the file operands; when none are specified, information
shall be written for all file systems. The format of the
default output from df is unspecified, but all space figures
<br>
are reported in 512-byte units, unless the &acirc;k option
is specified. This output shall contain at least the file
system names, amount of available space on each of these
file sys&acirc; <br>
tems, and, if no options other than &acirc;t are specified,
the number of free file slots, or inodes, available; when
&acirc;t is specified, the output shall contain the total
allocated <br>
space as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The df utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;k Use 1024-byte units,
instead of the default 512-byte units, when writing space
figures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;P Produce output in the
format described in the STDOUT section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;t Include total
allocated-space figures in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file within
the hierarchy of the desired file system. If a file other
than a FIFO, a regular file, a directory, or a special file
representing the <br>
device containing the file system (for example,
/dev/dsk/0s1) is specified, the results are unspecified. If
the file operand names a file other than a special file
con&acirc; <br>
taining a file system, df shall write the amount of free
space in the file system containing the specified file
operand. Otherwise, df shall write the amount of free <br>
space in that file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of df:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error and informative messages written to standard
<br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
When both the &acirc;k and &acirc;P options are specified,
the following header line shall be written (in the POSIX
locale):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Filesystem 1024-blocks
Used Available Capacity Mounted on0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &acirc;P option is
specified without the &acirc;k option, the following header
line shall be written (in the POSIX locale):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Filesystem 512-blocks Used
Available Capacity Mounted on0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The implementation may adjust
the spacing of the header line and the individual data lines
so that the information is presented in orderly columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The remaining output with
&acirc;P shall consist of one line of information for each
specified file system. These lines shall be formatted as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %d %d %d %d%% %s0,
&lt;file system name&gt;, &lt;total space&gt;, <br>
&lt;space used&gt;, &lt;space free&gt;, &lt;percentage
used&gt;, <br>
&lt;file system root&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following list, all
quantities expressed in 512-byte units (1024-byte when
&acirc;k is specified) shall be rounded up to the next
higher unit. The fields are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file system name&gt; <br>
The name of the file system, in an implementation-defined
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;total space&gt; <br>
The total size of the file system in 512-byte units. The
exact meaning of this figure is implementation-defined, but
should include &lt;space used&gt;, &lt;space free&gt;, plus
any <br>
space reserved by the system not normally available to a
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;space used&gt; <br>
The total amount of space allocated to existing files in the
file system, in 512-byte units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;space free&gt; <br>
The total amount of space available within the file system
for the creation of new files by unprivileged users, in
512-byte units. When this figure is less than or <br>
equal to zero, it shall not be possible to create any new
files on the file system without first deleting others,
unless the process has appropriate privileges. The <br>
figure written may be less than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;percentage used&gt; <br>
The percentage of the normally available space that is
currently allocated to all files on the file system. This
shall be calculated using the fraction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;space used&gt;/( &lt;space
used&gt;+ &lt;space free&gt;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expressed as a percentage. This
percentage may be greater than 100 if &lt;space free&gt; is
less than zero. The percentage value shall be expressed as a
positive integer, <br>
with any fractional result causing it to be rounded to the
next highest integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;file system root&gt; <br>
The directory below which the file system hierarchy
appears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is unspecified
when &acirc;t is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
On most systems, the &lsquo;&lsquo;name of the file system,
in an implementation-defined format&rsquo;&rsquo; is the
special file on which the file system is mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On large file systems, the
calculation specified for percentage used can create huge
rounding errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
1. The following example writes portable information about
the /usr file system:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">df &acirc;P /usr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Assuming that /usr/src is
part of the /usr file system, the following produces the
same output as the previous example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">df &acirc;P /usr/src</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The behavior of df with the &acirc;P option is the default
action of the 4.2 BSD df utility. The uppercase &acirc;P was
selected to avoid collision with a known industry extension
using &acirc;p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical df implementations
vary considerably in their default output. It was therefore
necessary to describe the default output in a loose manner
to accommodate all known his&acirc; <br>
torical implementations and to add a portable option
(&acirc;P) to provide information in a portable format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of 512-byte units is
historical practice and maintains compatibility with ls and
other utilities in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. This
does not mandate that the file sys&acirc; <br>
tem itself be based on 512-byte blocks. The &acirc;k option
was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed by the
standard developers that 512 bytes was the best default unit
because <br>
of its complete historical consistency on System V (versus
the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a
&acirc;k option to switch to 1024-byte units was a good
compromise. <br>
Users who prefer the more logical 1024-byte quantity can
easily alias df to df &acirc;k without breaking many
historical scripts relying on the 512-byte units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It was suggested that df and the
various related utilities be modified to access a BLOCKSIZE
environment variable to achieve consistency and user
acceptance. Since this is not <br>
historical practice on any system, it is left as a possible
area for system extensions and will be re-evaluated in a
future version if it is widely implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
