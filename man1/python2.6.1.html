<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented
programming language that combines remarkable power with
very clear syntax. For an introduction to programming in
Python <br>
you are referred to the Python Tutorial. The Python Library
Reference documents built-in and standard types, constants,
functions and modules. Finally, the Python Reference <br>
Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the core
language in (perhaps too) much detail. (These documents may
be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES below; they may be
<br>
installed on your system as well.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Python&rsquo;s basic power can
be extended with your own modules written in C or C++. On
most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded. Python
is also adaptable as an extension <br>
language for existing applications. See the internal
documentation for hints.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation for installed
Python modules and packages can be viewed by running the
pydoc program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
-B Don&rsquo;t write .py[co] files on import. See also
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
Specify the command to execute (see next section). This
terminates the option list (following options are passed as
arguments to the command).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Turn on parser debugging
output (for wizards only, depending on compilation
options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Ignore environment variables
like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that modify the behavior of
the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h , -? , --help <br>
Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i When a script is passed as
first argument or the -c option is used, enter interactive
mode after executing the script or the command. It does not
read the $PYTHONSTARTUP <br>
file. This can be useful to inspect global variables or a
stack trace when a script raises an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m module-name <br>
Searches sys.path for the named module and runs the
corresponding .py file as a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O Turn on basic optimizations.
This changes the filename extension for compiled (bytecode)
files from .pyc to .pyo. Given twice, causes docstrings to
be discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O0 Discard docstrings in
addition to the -O optimizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Turn on &quot;hash
randomization&quot;, so that the hash() values of str, bytes
and datetime objects are &quot;salted&quot; with an
unpredictable pseudo-random value. Although they remain <br>
constant within an individual Python process, they are not
predictable between repeated invocations of Python.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is intended to provide
protection against a denial of service caused by
carefully-chosen inputs that exploit the worst case
performance of a dict construction, O(n^2) <br>
complexity. See
http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q argument <br>
Division control; see PEP 238. The argument must be one of
&quot;old&quot; (the default, int/int and long/long return
an int or long), &quot;new&quot; (new division semantics,
i.e. int/int <br>
and long/long returns a float), &quot;warn&quot; (old
division semantics with a warning for int/int and
long/long), or &quot;warnall&quot; (old division semantics
with a warning for all use <br>
of the division operator). For a use of &quot;warnall&quot;,
see the Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Don&rsquo;t add user site
directory to sys.path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Disable the import of the
module site and the site-dependent manipulations of sys.path
that it entails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Issue a warning when a source
file mixes tabs and spaces for indentation in a way that
makes it depend on the worth of a tab expressed in spaces.
Issue an error when the <br>
option is given twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Force stdin, stdout and
stderr to be totally unbuffered. On systems where it
matters, also put stdin, stdout and stderr in binary mode.
Note that there is internal <br>
buffering in xreadlines(), readlines() and file-object
iterators (&quot;for line in sys.stdin&quot;) which is not
influenced by this option. To work around this, you will
want to <br>
use &quot;sys.stdin.readline()&quot; inside a &quot;while
1:&quot; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print a message each time a
module is initialized, showing the place (filename or
built-in module) from which it is loaded. When given twice,
print a message for each <br>
file that is checked for when searching for a module. Also
provides information on module cleanup at exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V , --version <br>
Prints the Python version number of the executable and
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W argument <br>
Warning control. Python sometimes prints warning message to
sys.stderr. A typical warning message has the following
form: file:line: category: message. By default, each <br>
warning is printed once for each source line where it
occurs. This option controls how often warnings are printed.
Multiple -W options may be given; when a warning <br>
matches more than one option, the action for the last
matching option is performed. Invalid -W options are ignored
(a warning message is printed about invalid options <br>
when the first warning is issued). Warnings can also be
controlled from within a Python program using the warnings
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest form of argument is
one of the following action strings (or a unique
abbreviation): ignore to ignore all warnings; default to
explicitly request the default <br>
behavior (printing each warning once per source line); all
to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate
many messages if a warning is triggered repeatedly for <br>
the same source line, such as inside a loop); module to
print each warning only the first time it occurs in each
module; once to print each warning only the first time it
<br>
occurs in the program; or error to raise an exception
instead of printing a warning message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full form of argument is
action:message:category:module:line. Here, action is as
explained above but only applies to messages that match the
remaining fields. Empty <br>
fields match all values; trailing empty fields may be
omitted. The message field matches the start of the warning
message printed; this match is case-insensitive. The <br>
category field matches the warning category. This must be a
class name; the match test whether the actual warning
category of the message is a subclass of the specified <br>
warning category. The full class name must be given. The
module field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this
match is case-sensitive. The line field matches <br>
the line number, where zero matches all line numbers and is
thus equivalent to an omitted line number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Skip the first line of the
source. This is intended for a DOS specific hack only.
Warning: the line numbers in error messages will be off by
one!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3 Warn about Python 3.x
incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERPRETER INTERFACE <br>
The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell:
when called with standard input connected to a tty device,
it prompts for commands and executes them until an EOF is
<br>
read; when called with a file name argument or with a file
as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that
file; when called with -c command, it executes the Python
<br>
statement(s) given as command. Here command may contain
multiple statements separated by newlines. Leading
whitespace is significant in Python statements! In
non-interactive <br>
mode, the entire input is parsed before it is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If available, the script name
and additional arguments thereafter are passed to the script
in the Python variable sys.argv , which is a list of strings
(you must first import sys <br>
to be able to access it). If no script name is given,
sys.argv[0] is an empty string; if -c is used, sys.argv[0]
contains the string &rsquo;-c&rsquo;. Note that options
interpreted by the <br>
Python interpreter itself are not placed in sys.argv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In interactive mode, the primary
prompt is &lsquo;&gt;&gt;&gt;&rsquo;; the second prompt
(which appears when a command is not complete) is
&lsquo;...&rsquo;. The prompts can be changed by assignment
to sys.ps1 <br>
or sys.ps2. The interpreter quits when it reads an EOF at a
prompt. When an unhandled exception occurs, a stack trace is
printed and control returns to the primary prompt; in <br>
non-interactive mode, the interpreter exits after printing
the stack trace. The interrupt signal raises the
KeyboardInterrupt exception; other UNIX signals are not
caught <br>
(except that SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor of the
IOError exception). Error messages are written to
stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES AND DIRECTORIES <br>
These are subject to difference depending on local
installation conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are
installation-dependent and should be interpreted as for GNU
soft&acirc; <br>
ware; they may be the same. The default for both is
/usr/local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${exec_prefix}/bin/python <br>
Recommended location of the interpreter.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;
<br>
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; <br>
Recommended locations of the directories containing the
standard modules.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">${prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;
<br>
${exec_prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt; <br>
Recommended locations of the directories containing the
include files needed for developing Python extensions and
embedding the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.pythonrc.py <br>
User-specific initialization file loaded by the user module;
not used by default or by most applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
PYTHONHOME <br>
Change the location of the standard Python libraries. By
default, the libraries are searched in
${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; and
${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;, <br>
where ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are
installation-dependent directories, both defaulting to
/usr/local. When $PYTHONHOME is set to a single directory,
its value <br>
replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}. To specify
different values for these, set $PYTHONHOME to
${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONPATH <br>
Augments the default search path for module files. The
format is the same as the shell&rsquo;s $PATH: one or more
directory pathnames separated by colons. Non-existent
direc&acirc; <br>
tories are silently ignored. The default search path is
installation dependent, but generally begins with
${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt; (see PYTHONHOME above).
The <br>
default search path is always appended to $PYTHONPATH. If a
script argument is given, the directory containing the
script is inserted in the path in front of $PYTHONPATH. <br>
The search path can be manipulated from within a Python
program as the variable sys.path .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONSTARTUP <br>
If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands
in that file are executed before the first prompt is
displayed in interactive mode. The file is executed in <br>
the same name space where interactive commands are executed
so that objects defined or imported in it can be used
without qualification in the interactive session. You <br>
can also change the prompts sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 in this
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONY2K <br>
Set this to a non-empty string to cause the time module to
require dates specified as strings to include 4-digit years,
otherwise 2-digit years are converted based on <br>
rules described in the time module documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONOPTIMIZE <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -O option. If set to an integer, it is
equivalent to specifying -O multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONDEBUG <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -d option. If set to an integer, it is
equivalent to specifying -d multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -B option (don&rsquo;t try to write .py[co]
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONINSPECT <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -i option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONNOUSERSITE <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -s option (Don&rsquo;t add the user site
directory to sys.path).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONUNBUFFERED <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -u option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONVERBOSE <br>
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to
specifying the -v option. If set to an integer, it is
equivalent to specifying -v multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PYTHONHASHSEED <br>
If this variable is set to &quot;random&quot;, the effect is
the same as specifying the -R option: a random value is used
to seed the hashes of str, bytes and datetime objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an
integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the
hash() of the types covered by the hash randomization. Its
purpose is to allow <br>
repeatable hashing, such as for selftests for the
interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python
processes to share hash values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The integer must be a decimal
number in the range [0,4294967295]. Specifying the value 0
will lead to the same hash values as when hash randomization
is disabled.</p>
