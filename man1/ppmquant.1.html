<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ppmquant - quantize the colors in a PPM image down to a
specified number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ppmquant [-floyd|-fs] ncolors [ppmfile] ppmquant
[-floyd|-fs] [-nofloyd|-nofs] -mapfile mapfile [ppmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmquant is obsolete. All it
does now is invoke pnmquant or pnmremap. You should use one
of those programs in any new program, or if you are
modifying an old program, and your <br>
program does not have to work with a version of Netpbm
before 9.21 (January 2001). ppmquant exists only for name
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pnmquant is fully backward
compatible with ppmquant without the -mapfile option;
pnmremap is fully backward compatible with ppmquant with the
-mapfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one to designate an option. You may use either
white space or equals signs <br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Except with differences
suggested by the syntax synopsis above, ppmquant&rsquo;s
function is the same as pnmquant and pnmremap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.19 (November
2003), ppmquant was a completely separate program from
pnmquant, and was a bona fide PPM program. That means if you
gave it a PGM or PBM image as <br>
input, it would process it as if it were PPM and generate a
PPM output. Now, since it is really a PNM program, it
processes PBM and PGM inputs as what they are and produces
the <br>
same kind of output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The reason ppmquant was
changed in Netpbm 10.19 is that for some time before that,
ppmquant had a serious bug that would have been difficult to
fix -- it chose the wrong <br>
color set. Maintaining two versions of the same code did not
make sense.</p>
