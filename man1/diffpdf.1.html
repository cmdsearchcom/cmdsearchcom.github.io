<p>DIFFPDF(1) General Commands Manual DIFFPDF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
diffpdf - compare two PDF files textually or visually</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
diffpdf [file1] [file2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page very briefly documents the diffpdf command.
(Click the GUI&rsquo;s Help button or press F1 for more
information.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DiffPDF is a GUI application
used to compare two PDF files. <br>
By default the comparison is of the words on each pair of
pages, but comparing character by character is also
supported (e.g., for logographic languages). And
there&rsquo;s also sup&acirc; <br>
port for comparing the pages by appearance (for example, if
a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is reformatted, or a
font changed). It is also possible to compare particular
<br>
pages or page ranges. For example, if there are two versions
of a PDF file, one with pages 1-12 and the other with pages
1-13 because of an extra page having been added as page <br>
4, they can be compared by specifying two page ranges, 1-12
for the first and 1-3, 5-13 for the second. This will make
DiffPDF compare pages in the pairs (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3),
<br>
(4, 5), (5, 6), and so on, to (12, 13).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is passed two PDF
filenames on the command line it will start up and compare
those files in Text mode (or in Appearance mode if the
filenames are preceded by -a or <br>
--appearance).</p>
