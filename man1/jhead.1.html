<p>JHEAD(1) General Commands Manual JHEAD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jhead - Digicam JPEG Exif header manipulation tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jhead [ options ] [ file... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jhead is used to display and manipulate data contained in
the Exif header of JPEG images from digital cameras. By
default, jhead displays the more useful camera settings from
<br>
the file in a user-friendly format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jhead can also be used to
manipulate some aspects of the image relating to JPEG and
Exif headers, such as changing the internal timestamps,
removing the thumbnail, or transfer&acirc; <br>
ring Exif headers back into edited images after graphical
editors deleted the Exif header. jhead can also be used to
launch other programs, similar in style to the UNIX find
<br>
command, but much simpler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL METADATA OPTIONS <br>
-te file <br>
Transplant Exif header from a JPEG (with Exif header) in
file into the image that is manipulated. This option is
useful if you like to edit the photos but still want the
<br>
Exif header on your photos. As most photo editing programs
will wipe out the Exif header, this option can be used to
re-copy them back from original copies after editing <br>
the photos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature has an interesting
&rsquo;relative path&rsquo; option for specifying the
thumbnail name. Whenever the &lt;name&gt; contains the
characters &rsquo;&amp;i&rsquo;, will substitute the
original <br>
filename for this name. This allows creating a jhead
&rsquo;relative name&rsquo; when doing a whole batch of
files. For example, the incantation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jhead -te
&quot;originals/&amp;i&quot; *.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would transfer the exif header
for each .jpg file in the originals directory by the same
name, Both Win32 and most Unix shells treat the
&rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; character in a special way, so <br>
you have to put quotes around that command line option for
the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; to even be passed to the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dc Delete comment field from
the JPEG header. Note that the comment is not part of the
Exif header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-de Delete the Exif header
entirely. Leaves other metadata sections intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-di Delete the IPTC section, if
present. Leaves other metadata sections intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dx Delete the XMP section, if
present. Leaves other metadata sections intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-du Delete sections of jpeg that
are not Exif, not comment, and otherwise not contributing to
the image either - such as data that photoshop might leave
in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-purejpg <br>
Delete all JPEG sections that aren&rsquo;t necessary for
rendering the image. Strips any metadata that various
applications may have left in the image. A combination of
the <br>
-de -dc and -du options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mkexif <br>
Creates minimal exif header. Exif header contains date/time,
and empty thumbnail fields only. Date/time set to file time
by default. Use with -rgt option if you want the <br>
exif header to contain a thumbnail. Note that exif header
creation is very limited at this time, and no other fields
can be added to the exif header this way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ce Edit the JPEG header comment
field (note, this comment field is outside the Exif
structure and can be part of Exif and non Exif style JPEG
images).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A temporary file containing the
comment is created and a text editor is launched to edit the
file. The editor is specified in the EDITOR environment
variable. If none is <br>
specified notepad or vi are used under Windows and Unix
respectively. After the editor exits, the data is
transferred back into the image, and the temporary file
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cs file <br>
Save comment section to a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ci file <br>
Replace comment with text from file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cl string <br>
Replace comment with specified string from command line
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATE / TIME MANIPULATION OPTIONS
<br>
-ft Sets the file&rsquo;s system time stamp to what is
stored in the Exif header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dsft Sets the Exif timestamp to
the file&rsquo;s timestamp. Requires an Exif header to
pre-exist. Use -mkexif option to create one if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n[format_string] <br>
This option causes files to be renamed and/ or mmoved using
the date information from the Exif header
&quot;DateTimeOriginal&quot; field. If the file is not an
Exif file, or the <br>
DateTimeOriginal does not contain a valid value, the file
date is used. If the new name contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;,
this will be interpreted as a new path, and the file will be
moved <br>
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the format_string is omitted,
the file will be renamed to MMDD-HHMMSS. Note that this
scheme doesn&rsquo;t include the year (I never have photos
from different years <br>
together anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a format_string is provided,
it will be passed to the strftime function as the format
string. In addition, if the format string contains
&rsquo;%f&rsquo;, this will substitute the <br>
original name of the file (minus extension).
&rsquo;%i&rsquo; will substitute a sequence number. Leading
zeros can be specified like with printf - i.e.
&rsquo;%04i&rsquo; pads the number to 4 <br>
digits using leading zeros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the name includes
&rsquo;/&rsquo;, this is interpreted as a new path for the
file. If the new path does not exist, the path will be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the target name already
exists, the name will be appended with &quot;a&quot;,
&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, etc, unless the name ends with
a letter, in which case it will be appended with
&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, <br>
&quot;2&quot;, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature is especially
useful if more than one digital camera was used to take
pictures of an event. By renaming them to a scheme according
to date, they will auto&acirc; <br>
matically appear in order of taking in most directory
listings and image browsers. Alternatively, if your image
browser supports listing by file time, you can use the -ft
<br>
option to set the file time to the time the photo was
taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the more useful
arguments for strftime are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%H Hour in 24-hour format (00 -
23) <br>
%j Day of year as decimal number (001 - 366) <br>
%m Month as decimal number (01 - 12) <br>
%M Minute as decimal number (00 - 59) <br>
%S Second as decimal number (00 - 59) <br>
%w Weekday as decimal number (0 - 6; Sunday is 0) <br>
%y Year without century, as decimal number (00 - 99) <br>
%Y Year with century, as decimal number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jhead -n%Y%m%d-%H%M%S *.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will rename files matched
by *.jpg in the format YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a full listing of strftime
arguments, look up the strftime in them man pages. Note that
some arguments to the strftime function (not listed here)
produce strings with <br>
characters such as &rsquo;:&rsquo; that may not be valid as
part of a filename on some systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ta&lt;+|-&gt;&lt;timediff&gt;
<br>
Adjust time stored in the Exif header by h:mm forwards or
backwards. Useful when having taken pictures with the wrong
time set on the camera, such as after travelling <br>
across time zones, or when daylight savings time has
changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add 1 hourand 5 minutes to the
time <br>
jhead -ta+1:05</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Decrease time by one second:
<br>
jhead -ta-0:0:1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option changes all
Date/time fields in the exif header, including
&quot;DateTimeOriginal&quot; (tag 0x9003) and
&quot;DateTimeDigitized&quot; (tag 0x9004).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-da&lt;newdate&gt;-&lt;olddate&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Works like -ta, but for
specifying large date offsets, to be used when fixing dates
from cameras where the date was set incorrectly, such as
having date and time reset by <br>
battery removal on some cameras</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because different months and
years have different numbers of days in them, a simple
offset for months, days, years would lead to unexpected
results at times. The time <br>
offset is thus specified as a difference between two dates,
so that jhead can figure out exactly how many days the
timestamp needs to be adjusted by, including leap years <br>
and daylight savings time changes. The dates are specified
as yyyy:mm:dd. For sub-day adjustments, a time of day can
also be included, by specifying yyyy:nn:dd/hh:mm or <br>
yyyy:mm:dd/hh:mm:ss</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Year on camera was set to 2005
instead of 2004 for pictures taken in April <br>
jhead -da2004:03:01-2005:03:01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default camera date is
2002:01:01, and date was reset on 2005:05:29 at 11:21 am
<br>
jhead -da2005:05:29/11:21-2002:01:01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ts Sets the time stored in the
Exif header to what is specified on the command line. Time
must be specified as: yyyy:mm:dd-hh:mm:ss</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ds Sets the date stored in the
Exif header to what is specified on the command line. Can be
used to set date, just year and month, or just year. Date is
specified as: <br>
yyyy:mm:dd, yyyy:mm, or yyyy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THUMBNAIL MANIPULATION OPTIONS
<br>
-dt Delete thumbnails from the Exif header, but leave the
interesting parts intact. This option truncates the
thumbnail from the Exif header, provided that the thumbnail
is <br>
the last part of the Exif header (which so far as I know is
always the case). Exif headers have a built-in thumbnail,
which typically occupies around 10k of space. This <br>
thumbnail is used by digital cameras. Windows XP may also
use this thumbnail if present (but it doesn&rsquo;t need
it). The thumbnails are too small to use even full screen on
<br>
the digicam&rsquo;s LCD. I have not encountered any adverse
side effects of deleting the thumbnails, even from the
software provided with my old Olympus digicam. Use with
cau&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-st file <br>
Save the integral thumbnail to file The thumbnail lives
inside the Exif header, and is a very low-res JPEG image.
Note that making any changes to a photo, except for with
<br>
some programs, generally wipes out the Exif header and with
it the thumbnail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The thumbnail is too low res to
really use for very much.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature has an interesting
&rsquo;relative path&rsquo; option for specifying the
thumbnail name. Whenever the name for file contains the
characters &rsquo;&amp;i&rsquo;, jhead will substitute <br>
the original filename for this name. This allows creating a
&rsquo;relative name&rsquo; when doing a whole batch of
files. For example, the incantation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jhead -st
&quot;thumbnails/&amp;i&quot; *.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would create a thumbnail for
each .jpg file in the thumbnails directory by the same name,
(provided that the thumbnails directory exists, of course).
Both Win32 and UNIX <br>
shells treat the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;character in a special
way, so you have to put quotes around that command line
option for the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; to even be passed to the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a &rsquo;-&rsquo; is
specified for the output file, the thumbnail is sent to
stdout. (UNIX build only)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rt Replace thumbnails from the
Exif header. This only works if the exif header already
contains a thumbnail, and the thumbnail is at the end of the
header (both always the <br>
case if the photo came from a digital camera)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rgt size <br>
Regenerate exif thumbnail. &rsquo;size&rsquo; specifies
maximum height or width of thumbnail. Relies on
&rsquo;mogrify&rsquo; program (from ImageMagick) to
regenerate the thumbnail. This only <br>
works if the image already contains a thumbnail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROTATION OPTIONS <br>
-autorot <br>
Using the &rsquo;Orientation&rsquo; tag of the Exif header,
rotate the image so that it is upright. The program jpegtran
is used to perform the rotation. This program is present in
<br>
most Linux distributions. For windows, you need to get a
copy of it. After rotation, the orientation tag of the Exif
header is set to &rsquo;1&rsquo; (normal orientation). The
<br>
thumbnail is also rotated. Other fields of the Exif header,
including dimensions are untouched, but the JPEG
height/width are adjusted. This feature is especially useful
<br>
with newer Canon cameras, that set the orientation tag
automatically using a gravity sensor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-norot Clears the rotation field
in the Exif header without altering the image. Useful if the
images were previously rotated without clearing the Exif
rotation tag, as some <br>
image browsers will auto rotate images when the rotation tag
is set. Sometimes, thumbnails and rotation tags can get very
out of sync from manipulation with various <br>
tools. To reset it all use -norot with -rgt to clear this
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT VERBOSITY CONTROL <br>
-h Displays summary of command line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Makes the program even more
verbose than it already is. Like DOS programs, and unlike
UNIX programs, Jhead gives feedback as to what it is doing,
even when nothing goes <br>
wrong. Windows user that I am, when something doesn&rsquo;t
give me feedback for 20 seconds, I assume its crashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q No output on success, more
like Unix programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version info and
compilation date. -exifmap Show a map of the bytes in the
exif header. Useful when analyzing strange exif headers, not
of much use to non software <br>
developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-se Suppress error messages
relating to corrupt Exif header structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Concise output. This causes
picture info to be summarized on one line instead of
several. Useful for grep-ing through images, as well as
importing into spread sheets <br>
(data is space delimited with quotes as text qualifier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE MATCHING OPTIONS <br>
-model Restricts processing of files to those whose camera
model, as indicated by the Exif image information, contains
the substring specified in the argument after
&rsquo;-model&rsquo;. <br>
For example, the following command will list only images
that are from an S100 camera:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jhead -model S100 *.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I use this option to restrict my
JPEG recompensing to those images that came from my Canon
S100 digicam, (see the -cmd option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-exonly <br>
Skip all files that don&rsquo;t have an Exif header. Photos
straight from a digital camera have an Exif header, whereas
many photo manipulation tools discard the Exif header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cmd Executes the specified
command on each JPEG file to be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Exif section of each file is
read before running the command, and reinserted after the
command finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The specified command invoked
separately for each JPEG that is processed, even if multiple
files are specified (explicitly or by wild card).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having a whole directory of
photos from my S100, I run the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jhead -cmd &quot;mogrify
-quality 80 &amp;i&quot; -model S100 *.jpg <br>
jhead -cmd &quot;jpegtran -progressive &amp;i &gt;
&amp;o&quot; *.jpg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first command mogrifies all
JPEGs in the tree that indicate that they are from a Canon
S100 in their Exif header to 80% quality at the same
resolution. This is a <br>
&rsquo;lossy&rsquo; process, so I only run it on files that
are from the Canon, and only run it once. The next command
then takes a JPEGs and converts them to progressive JPEGs.
The <br>
result is the same images, with no discernible differences,
stored in half the space. This produces substantial savings
on some cameras.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
After jhead runs a program to rotate or resize an image, the
image dimensions and thumbnail in the Exif header are not
adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modifying of Exif header data is
very limited, as Jhead internally only has a read only
implementation of the file system contained in the Exif
header. For example, there is no <br>
way to replace the thumbnail or edit the Exif comment in the
Exif header. There is also no way to create minimal exif
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some Canon digital SLR cameras
fail to adjust the effective sensor resolution when shooting
at less than full resolution, causing jhead to incorrectly
miscalculate the sensor <br>
width and 35mm equivalent focal length. The same can result
from resizing photos with Photoshop, which will manipulate
parts of the exif header. This is often reported as a bug
<br>
in Jhead, but Jhead can&rsquo;t do much about incorrect
data.</p>

Jhead is &rsquo;public domain&rsquo;. You may freely copy
jhead, and reuse part or all of its code in free or
