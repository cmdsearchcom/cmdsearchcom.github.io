  arbitrary program). Uses include:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
To start <b>kibitz</b>, user1 runs kibitz with the argument of the user to
  kibitz. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	kibitz user2
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>kibitz</b> starts a new shell (or another program, if given on the command
  line), while prompting user2 to run <b>kibitz</b>. If user2 runs <b>kibitz</b>
  as directed, the keystrokes of both users become the input of the shell.
  Similarly, both users receive the output from the shell.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To terminate <b>kibitz</b> it suffices to terminate the shell itself. For
  example, if either user types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be EOF), the
  shell terminates followed by <b>kibitz</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted. However, if the escape
  character (described when <b>kibitz</b> starts) is issued, the user may talk
  directly to the <b>kibitz</b> interpreter. Any <b>Expect</b>(1) or
  <b>Tcl</b>(3) commands may be given. Also, job control may be used while in
  the interpreter, to, for example, suspend or restart <b>kibitz</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Various processes can provide various effects. For example, you can emulate a
  two-way write(1) session with the command:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	kibitz user2 sleep 1000000
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="selflink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<b>kibitz</b> takes arguments, these should also be separated by whitespace.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>-noproc</b> flag runs <b>kibitz</b> with no process underneath.
  Characters are passed to the other <b>kibitz</b>. This is particularly useful
  for connecting multiple interactive processes together. In this mode,
  characters are not echoed back to the typist.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-noescape</b> disables the escape character.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-escape</b><i> char</i> sets the escape character. The default escape
  character is ^].
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-silent</b> turns off informational messages describing what kibitz is doing
  to initiate a connection.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>-tty</b><i> ttyname</i> defines the tty to which the invitation should be
  sent.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you start <b>kibitz</b> to user2 on a remote computer, <b>kibitz</b> performs
  a <b>rlogin</b> to the remote computer with your current username. The flag
  <b>-proxy</b><i> username</i> causes <b>rlogin</b> to use <i>username</i> for
  the remote login (e.g. if your account on the remote computer has a different
  username). If the <b>-proxy</b> flag is not given, <b>kibitz</b> tries to
  determine your current username by (in that order) inspecting the environment
  variables USER and LOGNAME, then by using the commands <b>whoami</b> and
  <b>logname</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The arguments <b>-noescape</b> and <b>-escape</b> can also be given by user2
  when prompted to run <b>kibitz</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MORE_THAN_TWO_USERS"><a class="selflink" href="#MORE_THAN_TWO_USERS">MORE
  THAN TWO USERS</a></h1>
The current implementation of kibitz explicitly understands only two users,
  however, it is nonetheless possible to have a three (or more) -way kibitz, by
  kibitzing another <b>kibitz</b>. For example, the following command runs
  <b>kibitz</b> with the current user, user2, and user3:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
	% kibitz user2 kibitz user3
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Additional users may be added by simply appending more &quot;kibitz user&quot;
  commands.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>xkibitz</b> script is similar to <b>kibitz</b> but supports the ability
  to add additional users (and drop them) dynamically.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<b>kibitz</b> assumes the 2nd user has the same terminal type and size as the
  1st user. If this assumption is incorrect, graphical programs may display
  oddly.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>kibitz</b> handles character graphics, but cannot handle bitmapped graphics.
  Thus,
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	% xterm -e kibitz    will work
	% kibitz xterm       will not work
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
However, you can get the effect of the latter command by using <b>xkibitz</b>
  (see SEE ALSO below). <b>kibitz</b> uses the same permissions as used by
  rlogin, rsh, etc. Thus, you can only <b>kibitz</b> to users at hosts for which
  you can rlogin. Similarly, <b>kibitz</b> will prompt for a password on the
  remote host if rlogin would.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you <b>kibitz</b> to users at remote hosts, <b>kibitz</b> needs to
  distinguish your prompt from other things that may precede it during login.
  (Ideally, the end of it is preferred but any part should suffice.) If you have
  an unusual prompt, set the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT to an
  egrep(1)-style regular expression. Brackets should be preceded with one
  backslash in ranges, and three backslashes for literal brackets. The default
  prompt r.e. is &quot;($|%|#)&#x00A0;&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>kibitz</b> requires the <b>kibitz</b> program on both hosts. <b>kibitz</b>
  requires <b>expect</b>(1).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By comparison, the <b>xkibitz</b> script uses the X authorization mechanism for
  inter-host communication so it does not need to login, recognize your prompt,
  or require kibitz on the remote host. It does however need permission to
  access the other X servers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
An early version of Sun's tmpfs had a bug in it that causes <b>kibitz</b> to
  blow up. If <b>kibitz</b> reports &quot;error flushing ...: Is a
  directory&quot; ask Sun for patch #100174.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If your Expect is not compiled with multiple-process support (i.e., you do not
  have a working select or poll), you will not be able to run kibitz.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The environment variable SHELL is used to determine the shell to start, if no
  other program is given on the command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT exists, it is taken as a regular
  expression which matches the end of your login prompt (but does not otherwise
  occur while logging in). See also CAVEATS above.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the environment variables USER or LOGNAME are defined, they are used to
  determine the current user name for a <b>kibitz</b> to a remote computer. See
  description of the <b>-proxy</b> option in ARGUMENTS above.
