Dataflow is very experimental. Many features of it are disabled for 2.0,
  particularly families for one-directional dataflow. If you wish to use
  one-directional dataflow for something, please contact the author first and
  we'll work out how to make it functional again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Two-directional dataflow (which implements -&gt; <i>slice()</i> etc.) is fully
  functional, however. Just about any function which returns some subset of the
  values in some piddle will make a binding so that
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $a = some piddle
        $b = $a-&gt;slice(&quot;some parts&quot;);
        $b-&gt;set(3,3,10);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
also changes the corresponding element in $a. $b has become effectively a window
  to some sub-elements of $a. You can also define your own routines that do
  different types of subsets. If you don't want $b to be a window to $a, you
  must do
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $b = $a-&gt;slice(&quot;some parts&quot;)-&gt;copy;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The copying turns off all dataflow between the two piddles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The difficulties with one-directional dataflow are related to sequences like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $b = $a + 1;
        $b ++;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where there are several possible outcomes and the semantics get a little murky.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Dataflow is new to PDL2.0. The basic philosophy behind dataflow is that
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4;
        &gt; $b = $a * 2;
        &gt; print $b
        [2 3 4]
        &gt; $a-&gt;set(0,5);
        &gt; print $b;
        [10 3 4]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
should work. It doesn't. It was considered that doing this might be too
  confusing for novices and occasional users of the language. Therefore, you
  need to explicitly turn on dataflow, so
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4;
        &gt; $a-&gt;doflow();
        &gt; $b = $a * 2;
        ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
produces the unexpected result. The rest of this documents explains various
  features and details of the dataflow implementation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Lazy_evaluation"><a class="selflink" href="#Lazy_evaluation">Lazy
  evaluation</a></h1>
When you calculate something like the above
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4;
        &gt; $a-&gt;doflow();
        &gt; $b = $a * 2;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
nothing will have been calculated at this point. Even the memory for the
  contents of $b has not been allocated. Only the command
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; print $b
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
will actually cause $b to be calculated. This is important to bear in mind when
  doing performance measurements and benchmarks as well as when tracking errors.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is an explanation for this behaviour: it may save cycles but more
  importantly, imagine the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4;
        &gt; $b = pdl 5,6,7;
        &gt; $c = $a + $b;
        ...
        &gt; $a-&gt;resize(4);
        &gt; $b-&gt;resize(4);
        &gt; print $c;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, if $c were evaluated between the two resizes, an error condition of
  incompatible sizes would occur.
<div class="Pp"></div>
What happens in the current version is that resizing $a raises a flag in $c:
  &quot;PDL_PARENTDIMSCHANGED&quot; and $b just raises the same flag again. When
  $c is next evaluated, the flags are checked and it is found that a
  recalculation is needed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, lazy evaluation can sometimes make debugging more painful because
  errors may occur somewhere where you'd not expect them. A better stack trace
  for errors is in the works for PDL, probably so that you can toggle a switch
  $PDL::traceevals and get a good trace of where the error actually was.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Families"><a class="selflink" href="#Families">Families</a></h1>
This is one of the more intricate concepts of one-directional dataflow. Consider
  the following code ($a and $b are pdls that have dataflow enabled):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $c = $a + $b;
        $e = $c + 1;
        $d = $c-&gt;diagonal();
        $d ++;
        $f = $c + 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
What should $e and $f contain now? What about when $a is changed and a
  recalculation is triggered.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to make dataflow work like you'd expect, a rather strange concept must
  be introduced: families. Let us make a diagram:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        a   b
         \ /
          c
         /|
        / |
       e  d
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is what PDL actually has in memory after the first three lines. When $d is
  changed, we want $c to change but we don't want $e to change because it
  already is on the graph. It may not be clear now why you don't want it to
  change but if there were 40 lines of code between the 2nd and 4th lines, you
  would. So we need to make a copy of $c and $d:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        a   b
         \ /
          c' . . . c
         /|        |\
        / |        | \
       e  d' . . . d  f
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice that we primed the original c and d, because they do not correspond to
  the objects in $c and $d any more. Also, notice the dotted lines between the
  two objects: when $a is changed and this diagram is re-evaluated, $c really
  does get the value of c' with the diagonal incremented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To generalize on the above, whenever a piddle is mutated i.e. when its actual
  *value* is forcibly changed (not just the reference:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $d = $d + 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would produce a completely different result ($c and $d would not be bound any
  more whereas
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $d .= $d + 1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would yield the same as $d++), a &quot;family&quot; consisting of all other
  piddles joined to the mutated piddle by a two-way transformation is created
  and all those are copied.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All slices or transformations that simply select a subset of the original pdl
  are two-way. Matrix inverse should be. No arithmetic operators are.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Sources"><a class="selflink" href="#Sources">Sources</a></h1>
What you were told in the previous section is not quite true: the behaviour
  described is not *always* what you want. Sometimes you would probably like to
  have a data &quot;source&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $a = pdl 2,3,4; $b = pdl 5,6,7;
        $c = $a + $b;
        line($c);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, if you know that $a is going to change and that you want its children to
  change with it, you can declare it into a data source (XXX unimplemented in
  current version):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $a-&gt;datasource(1);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After this, $a++ or $a .= something will not create a new family but will alter
  $a and cut its relation with its previous parents. All its children will
  follow its current value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So if $c in the previous section had been declared as a source, $e and $f would
  remain equal.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Binding"><a class="selflink" href="#Binding">Binding</a></h1>
A dataflow mechanism would not be very useful without the ability to bind events
  onto changed data. Therefore, we provide such a mechanism:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4
        &gt; $b = $a + 1;
        &gt; $c = $b * 2;
        &gt; $c-&gt;bind( sub { print &quot;A now: $a, C now: $c\n&quot; } )
        &gt; PDL::dowhenidle();
        A now: [2,3,4], C now: [6 8 10]
        &gt; $a-&gt;set(0,1);
        &gt; $a-&gt;set(1,1);
        &gt; PDL::dowhenidle();
        A now: [1,1,4], C now: [4 4 10]
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Notice how the callbacks only get called during PDL::dowhenidle. An easy way to
  interface this to Perl event loop mechanisms (such as Tk) is being planned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are many kinds of uses for this feature: self-updating graphs, for
  instance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Blah blah blah XXX more explanation
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Limitations"><a class="selflink" href="#Limitations">Limitations</a></h1>
Dataflow as such is a fairly limited addition on top of Perl. To get a more
  refined addition, the internals of Perl need to be hacked a little. A true
  implementation would enable flow of everything, including
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">data</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">data size</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">datatype</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">operations</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the moment we only have the first two (hey, 50% in a couple of months is not
  bad ;) but even this is useful by itself. However, especially the last one is
  desirable since it would add the possibility of flowing closures from place to
  place and would make many things more flexible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To get the rest working, the internals of dataflow probably need to be changed
  to be a more general framework.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additionally, it would be nice to be able to flow data in time, lucid-like (so
  you could easily define all kinds of signal processing things).
