<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PDL::Dataflow -- description of the dataflow philosophy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pdl&gt; $a = zeroes(10); <br>
pdl&gt; $b = $a-&gt;slice(&quot;2:4:2&quot;); <br>
pdl&gt; $b ++; <br>
pdl&gt; print $a; <br>
[0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Dataflow is very experimental. Many features of it are
disabled for 2.0, particularly families for one-directional
dataflow. If you wish to use one-directional dataflow for
<br>
something, please contact the author first and we&rsquo;ll
work out how to make it functional again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two-directional dataflow (which
implements -&gt;slice() etc.) is fully functional, however.
Just about any function which returns some subset of the
values in some piddle will make <br>
a binding so that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = some piddle <br>
$b = $a-&gt;slice(&quot;some parts&quot;); <br>
$b-&gt;set(3,3,10);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">also changes the corresponding
element in $a. $b has become effectively a window to some
sub-elements of $a. You can also define your own routines
that do different types of <br>
subsets. If you don&rsquo;t want $b to be a window to $a,
you must do</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = $a-&gt;slice(&quot;some
parts&quot;)-&gt;copy;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The copying turns off all
dataflow between the two piddles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The difficulties with
one-directional dataflow are related to sequences like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b = $a + 1; <br>
$b ++;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where there are several possible
outcomes and the semantics get a little murky.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dataflow is new to PDL2.0. The basic philosophy behind
dataflow is that</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4; <br>
&gt; $b = $a * 2; <br>
&gt; print $b <br>
[2 3 4] <br>
&gt; $a-&gt;set(0,5); <br>
&gt; print $b; <br>
[10 3 4]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should work. It doesn&rsquo;t.
It was considered that doing this might be too confusing for
novices and occasional users of the language. Therefore, you
need to explicitly turn on <br>
dataflow, so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4; <br>
&gt; $a-&gt;doflow(); <br>
&gt; $b = $a * 2; <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">produces the unexpected result.
The rest of this documents explains various features and
details of the dataflow implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lazy evaluation <br>
When you calculate something like the above</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4; <br>
&gt; $a-&gt;doflow(); <br>
&gt; $b = $a * 2;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nothing will have been
calculated at this point. Even the memory for the contents
of $b has not been allocated. Only the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; print $b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will actually cause $b to be
calculated. This is important to bear in mind when doing
performance measurements and benchmarks as well as when
tracking errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an explanation for this
behaviour: it may save cycles but more importantly, imagine
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4; <br>
&gt; $b = pdl 5,6,7; <br>
&gt; $c = $a + $b; <br>
... <br>
&gt; $a-&gt;resize(4); <br>
&gt; $b-&gt;resize(4); <br>
&gt; print $c;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if $c were evaluated
between the two resizes, an error condition of incompatible
sizes would occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What happens in the current
version is that resizing $a raises a flag in $c:
&quot;PDL_PARENTDIMSCHANGED&quot; and $b just raises the
same flag again. When $c is next evaluated, the flags <br>
are checked and it is found that a recalculation is
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, lazy evaluation can
sometimes make debugging more painful because errors may
occur somewhere where you&rsquo;d not expect them. A better
stack trace for errors is in the <br>
works for PDL, probably so that you can toggle a switch
$PDL::traceevals and get a good trace of where the error
actually was.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Families <br>
This is one of the more intricate concepts of
one-directional dataflow. Consider the following code ($a
and $b are pdls that have dataflow enabled):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$c = $a + $b; <br>
$e = $c + 1; <br>
$d = $c-&gt;diagonal(); <br>
$d ++; <br>
$f = $c + 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What should $e and $f contain
now? What about when $a is changed and a recalculation is
triggered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to make dataflow work
like you&rsquo;d expect, a rather strange concept must be
introduced: families. Let us make a diagram:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a b &nbsp; <br>
/ <br>
c <br>
/| <br>
/ | <br>
e d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is what PDL actually has in
memory after the first three lines. When $d is changed, we
want $c to change but we don&rsquo;t want $e to change
because it already is on the graph. <br>
It may not be clear now why you don&rsquo;t want it to
change but if there were 40 lines of code between the 2nd
and 4th lines, you would. So we need to make a copy of $c
and $d:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a b &nbsp; <br>
/ <br>
c&rsquo; . . . c <br>
/| | / | | e d&rsquo; . . . d f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that we primed the
original c and d, because they do not correspond to the
objects in $c and $d any more. Also, notice the dotted lines
between the two objects: when $a is <br>
changed and this diagram is re-evaluated, $c really does get
the value of c&rsquo; with the diagonal incremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To generalize on the above,
whenever a piddle is mutated i.e. when its actual *value* is
forcibly changed (not just the reference:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$d = $d + 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would produce a completely
different result ($c and $d would not be bound any more
whereas</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$d .= $d + 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would yield the same as $d++), a
&quot;family&quot; consisting of all other piddles joined to
the mutated piddle by a two-way transformation is created
and all those are copied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All slices or transformations
that simply select a subset of the original pdl are two-way.
Matrix inverse should be. No arithmetic operators are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sources <br>
What you were told in the previous section is not quite
true: the behaviour described is not *always* what you want.
Sometimes you would probably like to have a data
&quot;source&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = pdl 2,3,4; $b = pdl 5,6,7;
<br>
$c = $a + $b; <br>
line($c);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if you know that $a is
going to change and that you want its children to change
with it, you can declare it into a data source (XXX
unimplemented in current version):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a-&gt;datasource(1);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this, $a++ or $a .=
something will not create a new family but will alter $a and
cut its relation with its previous parents. All its children
will follow its current <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So if $c in the previous section
had been declared as a source, $e and $f would remain
equal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Binding <br>
A dataflow mechanism would not be very useful without the
ability to bind events onto changed data. Therefore, we
provide such a mechanism:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; $a = pdl 2,3,4 <br>
&gt; $b = $a + 1; <br>
&gt; $c = $b * 2; <br>
&gt; $c-&gt;bind( sub { print &quot;A now: $a, C now: $c0 }
) <br>
&gt; PDL::dowhenidle(); <br>
A now: [2,3,4], C now: [6 8 10] <br>
&gt; $a-&gt;set(0,1); <br>
&gt; $a-&gt;set(1,1); <br>
&gt; PDL::dowhenidle(); <br>
A now: [1,1,4], C now: [4 4 10]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice how the callbacks only
get called during PDL::dowhenidle. An easy way to interface
this to Perl event loop mechanisms (such as Tk) is being
planned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many kinds of uses for
this feature: self-updating graphs, for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blah blah blah XXX more
explanation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations <br>
Dataflow as such is a fairly limited addition on top of
Perl. To get a more refined addition, the internals of Perl
need to be hacked a little. A true implementation would <br>
enable flow of everything, including</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data <br>
data size <br>
datatype <br>
operations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the moment we only have the
first two (hey, 50% in a couple of months is not bad ;) but
even this is useful by itself. However, especially the last
one is desirable since it <br>
would add the possibility of flowing closures from place to
place and would make many things more flexible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get the rest working, the
internals of dataflow probably need to be changed to be a
more general framework.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, it would be nice
to be able to flow data in time, lucid-like (so you could
easily define all kinds of signal processing things).</p>
