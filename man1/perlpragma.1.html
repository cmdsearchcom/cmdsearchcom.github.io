perlpragma - how to write a user pragma
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A pragma is a module which influences some aspect of the compile time or run
  time behaviour of Perl, such as &quot;strict&quot; or &quot;warnings&quot;.
  With Perl 5.10 you are no longer limited to the built in pragmata; you can now
  create user pragmata that modify the behaviour of user functions within a
  lexical scope.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="A_basic_example"><a class="selflink" href="#A_basic_example">A
  basic example</a></h1>
For example, say you need to create a class implementing overloaded mathematical
  operators, and would like to provide your own pragma that functions much like
  &quot;use integer;&quot; You'd like this code
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    use MyMaths;
    
    my $l = MyMaths-&gt;new(1.2);
    my $r = MyMaths-&gt;new(3.4);
    
    print &quot;A: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;;
    
    use myint;
    print &quot;B: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;;
    
    {
        no myint;
        print &quot;C: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    
    print &quot;D: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;;
    
    no myint;
    print &quot;E: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to give the output
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    A: 4.6
    B: 4
    C: 4.6
    D: 4
    E: 4.6
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>i.e.</i>, where &quot;use myint;&quot; is in effect, addition operations are
  forced to integer, whereas by default they are not, with the default behaviour
  being restored via &quot;no myint;&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
The minimal implementation of the package &quot;MyMaths&quot; would be something
  like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package MyMaths;
    use warnings;
    use strict;
    use myint();
    use overload '+' =&gt; sub {
        my ($l, $r) = @_;
        # Pass 1 to check up one call level from here
        if (myint::in_effect(1)) {
            int($$l) + int($$r);
        } else {
            $$l + $$r;
        }
    };
    
    sub new {
        my ($class, $value) = @_;
        bless \$value, $class;
    }
    
    1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note how we load the user pragma &quot;myint&quot; with an empty list
  &quot;()&quot; to prevent its &quot;import&quot; being called.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The interaction with the Perl compilation happens inside package
  &quot;myint&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    package myint;
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    sub import {
        $^H{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;} = 1;
    }
    
    sub unimport {
        $^H{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;} = 0;
    }
    
    sub in_effect {
        my $level = shift // 0;
        my $hinthash = (caller($level))[10];
        return $hinthash-&gt;{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;};
    }
    
    1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As pragmata are implemented as modules, like any other module, &quot;use
  myint;&quot; becomes
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN {
        require myint;
        myint-&gt;import();
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and &quot;no myint;&quot; is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    BEGIN {
        require myint;
        myint-&gt;unimport();
    }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hence the &quot;import&quot; and &quot;unimport&quot; routines are called at
  <b>compile time</b> for the user's code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
User pragmata store their state by writing to the magical hash &quot;%^H&quot;,
  hence these two routines manipulate it. The state information in
  &quot;%^H&quot; is stored in the optree, and can be retrieved read-only at
  runtime with &quot;caller()&quot;, at index 10 of the list of returned
  results. In the example pragma, retrieval is encapsulated into the routine
  &quot;in_effect()&quot;, which takes as parameter the number of call frames to
  go up to find the value of the pragma in the user's script. This uses
  &quot;caller()&quot; to determine the value of
  $^H{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;} when each line of the user's script was
  called, and therefore provide the correct semantics in the subroutine
  implementing the overloaded addition.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Key_naming"><a class="selflink" href="#Key_naming">Key
  naming</a></h1>
There is only a single &quot;%^H&quot;, but arbitrarily many modules that want
  to use its scoping semantics. To avoid stepping on each other's toes, they
  need to be sure to use different keys in the hash. It is therefore
  conventional for a module to use only keys that begin with the module's name
  (the name of its main package) and a &quot;/&quot; character. After this
  module-identifying prefix, the rest of the key is entirely up to the module:
  it may include any characters whatsoever. For example, a module
  &quot;Foo::Bar&quot; should use keys such as &quot;Foo::Bar/baz&quot; and
  &quot;Foo::Bar/$%/_!&quot;. Modules following this convention all play nicely
  with each other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Perl core uses a handful of keys in &quot;%^H&quot; which do not follow this
  convention, because they predate it. Keys that follow the convention won't
  conflict with the core's historical keys.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Implementation_details"><a class="selflink" href="#Implementation_details">Implementation
  details</a></h1>
The optree is shared between threads. This means there is a possibility that the
  optree will outlive the particular thread (and therefore the interpreter
  instance) that created it, so true Perl scalars cannot be stored in the
  optree. Instead a compact form is used, which can only store values that are
  integers (signed and unsigned), strings or &quot;undef&quot; - references and
  floating point values are stringified. If you need to store multiple values or
  complex structures, you should serialise them, for example with
  &quot;pack&quot;. The deletion of a hash key from &quot;%^H&quot; is recorded,
  and as ever can be distinguished from the existence of a key with value
  &quot;undef&quot; with &quot;exists&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Don't</b> attempt to store references to data structures as integers which
  are retrieved via &quot;caller&quot; and converted back, as this will not be
  threadsafe. Accesses would be to the structure without locking (which is not
  safe for Perl's scalars), and either the structure has to leak, or it has to
  be freed when its creating thread terminates, which may be before the optree
  referencing it is deleted, if other threads outlive it.</div>
