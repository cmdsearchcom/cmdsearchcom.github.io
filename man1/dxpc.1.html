<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dxpc is an X protocol compressor designed to improve the
speed of X11 applications run over low-bandwidth links (such
as dialup PPP connections).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dxpc must be run at both ends of
a low-bandwidth link. On the host where the real X server
is, dxpc runs in &quot;Server Proxy&quot; mode. On the host
at the other end of the link, dxpc <br>
runs in &quot;Client Proxy&quot; mode. The Client Proxy dxpc
must be started first. When the Server Proxy dxpc is
started, it connects to the Client Proxy. (Note that
versions of dxpc <br>
before 3.3.1 used the opposite convention.) If either of the
two communicating dxpc instances is subsequently terminated,
the other one automatically shuts down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Client Proxy mimics an X
server. X client applications connect to the Client Proxy
using display &quot;unix:8&quot; (or
&quot;&lt;hostname&gt;:8&quot;; dxpc supports both UNIX
domain and TCP sock&acirc; <br>
ets). The Client Proxy receives X requests from the
application, compresses them, and sends them to the Server
Proxy. The Server Proxy uncompresses the requests and sends
them <br>
to the real X server. Similarly, the Server Proxy receives X
events, replies, and errors from the real X server. It
compresses these messages and sends them to the Client <br>
Proxy, which uncompresses them and sends them to the client
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The compression performance of
dxpc depends upon the types of X applications being run. For
many applications, dxpc achieves between 3:1 and 6:1
compression of the X protocol <br>
traffic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES <br>
dxpc has two modes; the connection mode, which is either
listening or connecting; and the X mode, which is either
client or server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The listening process waits for
a connecting process to initiate the TCP connection between
the two processes. The listening process must always be
started first. The connecting <br>
process initiates the connection to the listening process.
dxpc will run as the connecting process if a hostname
argument is supplied (see connect options, above). Otherwise
it <br>
will run as the listening process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server process is typically
located on the same machine as the real X server, and is
responsible for displaying the output of applications. The
client process is typically <br>
located on the same machine as the X applications, and is
responsible for forwarding the output of those applications
to the server process. By default, dxpc runs as the client
<br>
process if it is the listening process (due to the lack of a
hostname argument) and the server process if it is the
connecting process, but the -w switch reverses this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the command dxpc
myhost.work.com starts dxpc as the connecting process
(because a host name is supplied) and the server process
(because it is the connecting process <br>
and -w is not supplied). The command dxpc -w starts dxpc as
the listening process (because no hostname is supplied) and
the server process (because it is the listening process,
<br>
and -w reverses the usual logic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
-b(a|w) This option specifies that any windows created
should be created with the BackingStore option set to Always
(-ba) or WhenMapped (-bw), if the application has not set
<br>
the option itself. Using the BackingStore option will reduce
traffic to repaint exposed regions of the window, at the
cost of extra memory use in the X server <br>
itself. (This option is ignored in Client Proxy mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The -ba option can cause
Expose events to be sent before the client has mapped its
windows. This can confuse some client programs, notably GNU
Emacs version <br>
20.3. The &quot;bug&quot; in this case is that dxpc
shouldn&rsquo;t be setting BackingStore to Always behind the
application&rsquo;s back. Neverless, the option is
available, if you want <br>
to try it; many client programs still function fine with it,
and it will cause the contents of iconified windows to be
retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d displaynum <br>
This option specifies the number of the X display that dxpc
imitates. The default value is 8. (This option is ignored in
Server Proxy mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f This option tells dxpc to
fork and run as a daemon process. All subsequent non-error
output is suppressed, including statistics reports. The
daemon can be killed by <br>
use of the -k option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k This option tells dxpc to
read a pid from the lockfile in the user&rsquo;s home
directory and then send a SIGKILL to the old process. It
does some error checking to try to <br>
ensure that the file contains a valid pid file (and nothing
else). The pidfile will exist only if dxpc was started with
the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l This option is used to tell
dxpc to write messages and statistics to a logfile. Very
useful with the -f option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p portnumber <br>
This option specifies the TCP port number to be used for
communication between the Client Proxy and the Server Proxy.
The default value is 4000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s(1|2) Print a report on
dxpc&rsquo;s compression performance for an X application
when the application exits. In Client Proxy mode, dxpc
displays a report on the compression of <br>
messages generated by the X client. In Server Proxy mode,
dxpc displays a report on the compression of messages
generated by the X server. The -s1 option yields a <br>
simple report that provides the overall compression ratio.
The -s2 option yields a far more detailed report on the
compression ratios achieved for all the individual <br>
message types in the X protocol. The -s2 option is the
&quot;hacker option&quot;; most people will probably want
the -s1 report instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u -t Normally, dxpc in Client
Proxy mode imitates an X display, :8 by default, by
listening on both a UNIX domain socket and a TCP socket. The
-u option tells it not to <br>
use the UNIX domain port, and the -t option tells it not to
use the TCP port. (These options are ignored in Server Proxy
mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v This option tells dxpc to
print out its version number and copyright message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Use of this option swaps the
connection sequence. That is, the client will initiate the
connection to the server. Thus, instead of starting the
client like dxpc -f <br>
and the server as dxpc -f workserver, you can start the
client as dxpc -w -f homepc and the server as dxpc -w -f.
This option is intended to be useful for people <br>
running the client proxy on a machine behind a firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hostname This argument must be
used in Server Proxy mode to tell dxpc the hostname or IP
address of the machine where other dxpc (the one in Client
Proxy mode) is running. <br>
(Note that the presence of this argument is what puts dxpc
in Server Proxy mode. If this argument is not used, dxpc
runs in Client Proxy mode.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D display Specify X host on
which to display proxied applications. Defaults to value of
the DISPLAY environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i(0..9|99|999) <br>
This option controls bitmap image compression. This option
is only valid on the instance which is accepting
connections; usually this is the client, but the -w option
<br>
will reverse this, making the -i option valid only on the
server. The specified number is the image compression level;
higher levels offer better compression at the <br>
cost of greater CPU and memory utilization (mostly on the
client proxy). The actual behavior of each level is given
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 : No compression (except for
the very limited compression supported in dxpc 3.7.0). In
other words, behaves like 3.7.0 (but is incompatible with
it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 : LZO lzo1x_1 compression;
very fast, low CPU and memory use, reasonable
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2-9: LZO lzo1c_... variant
compression algorithms. lzo1c_2 actually seems to be worse
than lzo1x_1...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">99: LZO lzo1c_99 algorithm.
Slow, but pretty good compression. NB: I have seen a couple
of unexplained crashes when using this level. Not
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">999: LZO lzo1x_999 compression.
Slow (but fast enough to feed a 128K ISDN link when hosted
on a Pentium II/300 without maxing out the processor), but
good compres&acirc; <br>
sion. This is the default and recommended value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Assume that you&rsquo;re running a real X server on the
console of a local workstation called homepc, and that you
want to run some X applications on a remote system called
workserver <br>
and have them display on the console of the local
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On workserver, run <br>
$ export DISPLAY=homepc:0 <br>
$ dxpc -f <br>
$ export DISPLAY=unix:8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On homepc, run <br>
$ export DISPLAY=unix:0 <br>
$ dxpc -f workserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now on workserver, <br>
$ xterm&amp; <br>
$ xemacs&amp; <br>
etc...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DXPC AND XAUTH <br>
If you use X authorization, with a .Xauthority file on the
workstation where your real X server runs, you&rsquo;ll need
to set up a .Xauthority file on the host where the
ClientProxy <br>
runs. One way to do this is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy your ~/.Xauthority file
from the host where the real X server runs to the host where
the Client Proxy runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run <br>
xauth list <br>
to see the authorization keys. There should be one for your
real X display. It will look something like this: <br>
&lt;hostname&gt;/unix:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 &lt;hex
string&gt; <br>
On the host where the Client Proxy is located, add a new
entry to the .Xauthority file with the display name of the
fake X server (the DISPLAY where the Client Proxy is
listen&acirc; <br>
ing) and all of the other values from the entry for the real
X display. The xauth &quot;add&quot; command can be used,
like this: <br>
xauth add &lt;hostname&gt;/unix:8 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 &lt;hex
string&gt; <br>
where &lt;hostname&gt; is the name of the host where the
Client Proxy is running and &lt;hex string&gt; has the same
value as the &lt;hex string&gt; obtained for the real X
display in step 2. <br>
Once you do this, you should be able to run X clients
through dxpc successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Some windows don&rsquo;t appear. This can happen if the -ba
option is used, and a client program (such as GNU Emacs
version 20.3) does not request backing store and thus
assumes that <br>
Expose events imply that the window has been mapped. Use
-bw, or leave out the -b option altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No windows appear. This can
happen if you are using a newer version of dxpc with an
older one, from before the client and server roles were
changed. A connection can be estab&acirc; <br>
lished between them, but both sides believe themselves to be
the client side, or both sides believe themselves to be the
server side. Make sure you&rsquo;re using the same version
of <br>
dxpc at both ends of the connection.</p>
