<p>LV2FILE(1) General Commands Manual LV2FILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lv2file - Apply LV2 effects to audio files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lv2file <br>
-l|--list <br>
-n|--nameports PLUGIN <br>
-i INFILE -o OUTFILE [ OPTIONS ] PLUGIN</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lv2file is aprogram which you can use to apply effects to
your audio files without much hassle. Possible use cases
are: <br>
* To apply an effect without having to open a GUI or start a
project. <br>
* To apply effects to a large number of files, or in an
automated manner. <br>
* A deterministic environment to debug a plugin. <br>
* Audio editing in a command-line only environment <br>
lv2file uses the LV2 plugin format (http://lv2plug.in/) for
the effects it uses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
lv2file follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;). A
summary of options is included below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list <br>
List and number all available plugins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n --nameports PLUGIN <br>
List all the input and control ports for the specified
plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i FILE <br>
Input the audio from a given FILE. Most common sampled audio
formats are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FILE <br>
Output to given FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --connect CHANNEL:PORT <br>
Connect the channel CHANNEL in the input file to the audio
port PORT of the plugin. If you connect multiple channels to
the same port, they will be mixed together. The <br>
-c option is often not necessary, as lv2file will try to
guess how you would like to connect the ports. <br>
It is possible to run multiple instances of a plugin using
the syntax &quot;-c 5:2.left&quot; which, for example, would
connect the fifth channel of audio to the port labeled
&quot;left&quot; <br>
in the second copy of the plugin. You don&rsquo;t need to
specify how many plugins to run, lv2file automatically makes
enough according to the connections you make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --parameters PORT:VALUE <br>
Pass values to the control ports of the plugin, essentially
telling the effect how to handle the audio. PORT is the name
of the control port, and VALUE is the value to <br>
set it to. For example &quot;-p volume:1&quot; sets the
effects &quot;volume&quot; control to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should note that because
lv2file uses LV2 plugins, the VALUES will always be floating
point numbers. It is not possible to vary a parameter with
time. It is also not <br>
possible to have different control values for multiple
plugin instances. Instead, split up the channels of your
audio files, and process them in batches whose parameters
<br>
are all the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ -m --mono ] <br>
Mix down all of the channels together and pass them to the
plugin. This will only work if the plugin has only a single
audio input. This is to be used instead of manually <br>
specifying connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ -b, --blocksize N ] <br>
The size of the chunks the audio is processed in. This might
have implications for speed of processing. N is measured in
frames, not samples. The default is 512.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ --ignore-clipping ] <br>
By default, lv2file will check every sample for clipping and
will warn the user if any clipping occurs. However, if know
that the effect won&rsquo;t produce clipping, or you <br>
don&rsquo;t care if it does, you can use this option to turn
off the check for clipping. This will make lv2file run
slightly faster.</p>
