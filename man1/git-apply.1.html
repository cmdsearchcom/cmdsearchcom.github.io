<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-apply - Apply a patch to files and/or to the index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git apply [--stat] [--numstat] [--summary] [--check]
[--index] [--3way] <br>
[--apply] [--no-add] [--build-fake-ancestor=&lt;file&gt;]
[-R | --reverse] <br>
[--allow-binary-replacement | --binary] [--reject] [-z] <br>
[-p&lt;n&gt;] [-C&lt;n&gt;] [--inaccurate-eof] [--recount]
[--cached] <br>
[--ignore-space-change | --ignore-whitespace ] <br>
[--whitespace=(nowarn|warn|fix|error|error-all)] <br>
[--exclude=&lt;path&gt;] [--include=&lt;path&gt;]
[--directory=&lt;root&gt;] <br>
[--verbose] [&lt;patch&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Reads the supplied diff output (i.e. &quot;a patch&quot;)
and applies it to files. With the --index option the patch
is also applied to the index, and with the --cached option
the patch is <br>
only applied to the index. Without these options, the
command applies the patch only to files, and does not
require them to be in a Git repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command applies the patch
but does not create a commit. Use git-am(1) to create
commits from patches generated by git-format-patch(1) and/or
received by email.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;patch&gt;... <br>
The files to read the patch from. - can be used to read from
the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stat <br>
Instead of applying the patch, output diffstat for the
input. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numstat <br>
Similar to --stat, but shows the number of added and deleted
lines in decimal notation and the pathname without
abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary
<br>
files, outputs two - instead of saying 0 0. Turns off
&quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary <br>
Instead of applying the patch, output a condensed summary of
information obtained from git diff extended headers, such as
creations, renames and mode changes. Turns off <br>
&quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check <br>
Instead of applying the patch, see if the patch is
applicable to the current working tree and/or the index file
and detects errors. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--index <br>
When --check is in effect, or when applying the patch (which
is the default when none of the options that disables it is
in effect), make sure the patch is applicable to what <br>
the current index file records. If the file to be patched in
the working tree is not up-to-date, it is flagged as an
error. This flag also causes the index file to be <br>
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cached <br>
Apply a patch without touching the working tree. Instead
take the cached data, apply the patch, and store the result
in the index without using the working tree. This implies
<br>
--index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3, --3way <br>
When the patch does not apply cleanly, fall back on 3-way
merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is
supposed to apply to, and we have those blobs available <br>
locally, possibly leaving the conflict markers in the files
in the working tree for the user to resolve. This option
implies the --index option, and is incompatible with the
<br>
--reject and the --cached options.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-fake-ancestor=&lt;file&gt;
<br>
Newer git diff output has embedded index information for
each blob to help identify the original version that the
patch applies to. When this flag is given, and if the <br>
original versions of the blobs are available locally, builds
a temporary index containing those blobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a pure mode change is
encountered (which has no index information), the
information is read from the current index instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --reverse <br>
Apply the patch in reverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reject <br>
For atomicity, git apply by default fails the whole patch
and does not touch the working tree when some of the hunks
do not apply. This option makes it apply the parts of the
<br>
patch that are applicable, and leave the rejected hunks in
corresponding *.rej files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z <br>
When --numstat has been given, do not munge pathnames, but
use a NUL-terminated machine-readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, each
pathname output will have TAB, LF, double quotes, and
backslash characters replaced with , 0 <br>
enclosed in double quotes if any of those replacements
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p&lt;n&gt; <br>
Remove &lt;n&gt; leading slashes from traditional diff
paths. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C&lt;n&gt; <br>
Ensure at least &lt;n&gt; lines of surrounding context match
before and after each change. When fewer lines of
surrounding context exist they all must match. By default no
context <br>
is ever ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unidiff-zero <br>
By default, git apply expects that the patch being applied
is a unified diff with at least one line of context. This
provides good safety measures, but breaks down when <br>
applying a diff generated with --unified=0. To bypass these
checks use --unidiff-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, for the reasons stated
above usage of context-free patches is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apply <br>
If you use any of the options marked &quot;Turns off
apply&quot; above, git apply reads and outputs the requested
information without actually applying the patch. Give this
flag after <br>
those flags to also apply the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-add <br>
When applying a patch, ignore additions made by the patch.
This can be used to extract the common part between two
files by first running diff on them and applying the result
<br>
with this option, which would apply the deletion part but
not the addition part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-binary-replacement,
--binary <br>
Historically we did not allow binary patch applied without
an explicit permission from the user, and this flag was the
way to do so. Currently we always allow binary patch <br>
application, so this is a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude=&lt;path-pattern&gt;
<br>
Don&acirc;t apply changes to files matching the given path
pattern. This can be useful when importing patchsets, where
you want to exclude certain files or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include=&lt;path-pattern&gt;
<br>
Apply changes to files matching the given path pattern. This
can be useful when importing patchsets, where you want to
include certain files or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When --exclude and --include
patterns are used, they are examined in the order they
appear on the command line, and the first match determines
if a patch to each path is <br>
used. A patch to a path that does not match any
include/exclude pattern is used by default if there is no
include pattern on the command line, and ignored if there is
any <br>
include pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-space-change,
--ignore-whitespace <br>
When applying a patch, ignore changes in whitespace in
context lines if necessary. Context lines will preserve
their whitespace, and they will not undergo whitespace
fixing <br>
regardless of the value of the --whitespace option. New
lines will still be fixed, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--whitespace=&lt;action&gt; <br>
When applying a patch, detect a new or modified line that
has whitespace errors. What are considered whitespace errors
is controlled by core.whitespace configuration. By <br>
default, trailing whitespaces (including lines that solely
consist of whitespaces) and a space character that is
immediately followed by a tab character inside the initial
<br>
indent of the line are considered whitespace errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the command outputs
warning messages but applies the patch. When git-apply is
used for statistics and not applying a patch, it defaults to
nowarn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use different
&lt;action&gt; values to control this behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; nowarn turns off
the trailing whitespace warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; warn outputs
warnings for a few such errors, but applies the patch as-is
(default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fix outputs
warnings for a few such errors, and applies the patch after
fixing them (strip is a synonym --- the tool used to
consider only trailing whitespace characters <br>
as errors, and the fix involved stripping them, but modern
Gits do more).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; error outputs
warnings for a few such errors, and refuses to apply the
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; error-all is
similar to error but shows all errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inaccurate-eof <br>
Under certain circumstances, some versions of diff do not
correctly detect a missing new-line at the end of the file.
As a result, patches created by such diff programs do <br>
not record incomplete lines correctly. This option adds
support for applying such patches by working around this
bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Report progress to stderr. By default, only a message about
the current patch being applied will be printed. This option
will cause additional information to be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recount <br>
Do not trust the line counts in the hunk headers, but infer
them by inspecting the patch (e.g. after editing the patch
without adjusting the hunk headers appropriately).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--directory=&lt;root&gt; <br>
Prepend &lt;root&gt; to all filenames. If a &quot;-p&quot;
argument was also passed, it is applied before prepending
the new root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a patch that talks
about updating a/git-gui.sh to b/git-gui.sh can be applied
to the file in the working tree modules/git-gui/git-gui.sh
by running git apply <br>
--directory=modules/git-gui.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
apply.ignorewhitespace <br>
Set to change if you want changes in whitespace to be
ignored by default. Set to one of: no, none, never, false if
you want changes in whitespace to be significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apply.whitespace <br>
When no --whitespace flag is given from the command line,
this configuration item is used as the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUBMODULES <br>
If the patch contains any changes to submodules then git
apply treats these changes as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --index is specified
(explicitly or implicitly), then the submodule commits must
match the index exactly for the patch to apply. If any of
the submodules are checked-out, then <br>
these check-outs are completely ignored, i.e., they are not
required to be up-to-date or clean and they are not
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --index is not specified,
then the submodule commits in the patch are ignored and only
the absence or presence of the corresponding subdirectory is
checked and (if possible) <br>
updated.</p>
