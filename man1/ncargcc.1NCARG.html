<p>NCARGCC(1NCARG) NCAR GRAPHICS NCARGCC(1NCARG)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ncargcc - Command for compiling C code that uses the NCAR
Graphics low-level utilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ncargcc [-ngmath] [-smooth] [-quick] [-super] [-agupwrtx]
[-ncarbd] ... [-ngmathbd] ... [-noX11] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ncargcc is a script that invokes the C compiler/linker with
the proper NCAR Graphics LLU (low-level utility) libraries.
Arguments presented above are associated with NCAR
Graph&acirc; <br>
ics. All other arguments and options are identical to the cc
command on your particular machine; arguments that include
quoted strings may have to be enclosed in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: ncargcc cannot be used to
compile NCAR Graphics C programs that call the HLUs
(high-level utilities). You must use nhlcc instead. See the
nhlcc man page for more informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t want to use
ncargcc, you can just type it on the command line to see
what gets included in the link line, and then you can add
this information to your own Makefile <br>
or script. It is important to note that you must define the
macro NeedFuncProto in order for function prototyping to
work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to run ncargcc, you
must have your NCARG_ROOT environment variable set to the
directory pathname where the NCAR Graphics libraries,
binaries, and include files were <br>
installed. If you are not sure what NCARG_ROOT should be set
to, please check with your system administrator or the site
representative for NCAR Graphics. If the NCAR Graphics <br>
libraries, binaries, and include files were not installed
under one root directory, then you will need to set the
environment variables NCARG_LIB, NCARG_BIN, and
NCARG_INCLUDE <br>
instead. Please see &quot;man ncargintro&quot; for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ncargcc is invoked with the
-ictrans option the resulting executable will, upon
invocation, send its metafile output to the translator
ictrans. The environment variable <br>
GRAPHCAP must be set to a valid graphics output device
whenever the executable is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ncargcc will load
the X11 library when linking your C program. If you try
running ncargcc and the compiler complains that it cannot
find the library for X11, then <br>
try running ncargcc -L/xxx/yyy/zzz program.c where
/xxx/yyy/zzz is the path leading to your X11 library. If you
do not have the X11 library, or else you just don&rsquo;t
want to link <br>
it in, you can use the -noX11 option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngmath <br>
Links in the NCAR Graphics ngmath library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-smooth <br>
Link in the &quot;smooth&quot; objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quick Link in the
&quot;quick&quot; objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-super Link in the
&quot;super&quot; objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agupwrtx <br>
Link in the &quot;agupwrtx&quot; library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ncarbd <br>
Use this option for compilers that appear to be having
trouble initializing blockdata variables. It will cause a
small subroutine to be linked in that helps force the <br>
loading of blockdata initialization routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ngmathbd <br>
Just like with the -ncarbd option, use this option for
compilers that appear to be having trouble initializing
Ngmath-related blockdata variables. It will cause a small
<br>
subroutine to be linked in that helps force the loading of
Ngmath blockdata initialization routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this option doesn&rsquo;t
need to be specified separately if you are already including
the -ncarbd and -ngmath options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noX11 Do not link in the X
library when linking the code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, ncargf77 will load
the X11 library when linking your Fortran program. This is
because the GKS library now has an X11 driver. If you try
running ncargf77 and <br>
the compiler complains that it cannot find the library for
X11, then try running ncargf77 -L/xxx/yyy/zzz program.f
where /xxx/yyy/zzz is the path leading to your X11 <br>
library. If you do not have the X11 library, or else you
just don&rsquo;t want it to be loaded, you can use the
-noX11 option.</p>
