<p>GIT-MERGE-BASE(1) Git Manual GIT-MERGE-BASE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-merge-base - Find as good common ancestors as possible
for a merge</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git merge-base [-a|--all] &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt;...
<br>
git merge-base [-a|--all] --octopus &lt;commit&gt;... <br>
git merge-base --is-ancestor &lt;commit&gt; &lt;commit&gt;
<br>
git merge-base --independent &lt;commit&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
git merge-base finds best common ancestor(s) between two
commits to use in a three-way merge. One common ancestor is
better than another common ancestor if the latter is an <br>
ancestor of the former. A common ancestor that does not have
any better common ancestor is a best common ancestor, i.e. a
merge base. Note that there can be more than one merge <br>
base for a pair of commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION MODE <br>
As the most common special case, specifying only two commits
on the command line means computing the merge base between
the given two commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More generally, among the two
commits to compute the merge base from, one is specified by
the first commit argument on the command line; the other
commit is a (possibly <br>
hypothetical) commit that is a merge across all the
remaining commits on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a consequence, the merge base
is not necessarily contained in each of the commit arguments
if more than two commits are specified. This is different
from git-show-branch(1) <br>
when used with the --merge-base option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--octopus <br>
Compute the best common ancestors of all supplied commits,
in preparation for an n-way merge. This mimics the behavior
of git show-branch --merge-base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--independent <br>
Instead of printing merge bases, print a minimal subset of
the supplied commits with the same ancestors. In other
words, among the commits given, list those which cannot be
<br>
reached from any other. This mimics the behavior of git
show-branch --independent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--is-ancestor <br>
Check if the first &lt;commit&gt; is an ancestor of the
second &lt;commit&gt;, and exit with status 0 if true, or
with status 1 if not. Errors are signaled by a non-zero
status that is <br>
not 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --all <br>
Output all merge bases for the commits, instead of just
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
Given two commits A and B, git merge-base A B will output a
commit which is reachable from both A and B through the
parent relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, with this
topology:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---B <br>
/ <br>
---o---1---o---o---o---A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the merge base between A and B
is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given three commits A, B and C,
git merge-base A B C will compute the merge base between A
and a hypothetical commit M, which is a merge between B and
C. For example, with this <br>
topology:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---C <br>
/ <br>
/ o---o---o---B <br>
/ / <br>
---2---1---o---o---o---A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the result of git merge-base A B
C is 1. This is because the equivalent topology with a merge
commit M between B and C is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o---o---o---o---o <br>
/ / o---o---o---o---M <br>
/ / <br>
---2---1---o---o---o---A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the result of git merge-base
A M is 1. Commit 2 is also a common ancestor between A and
M, but 1 is a better common ancestor, because 2 is an
ancestor of 1. Hence, 2 is not a <br>
merge base.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result of git merge-base
--octopus A B C is 2, because 2 is the best common ancestor
of all commits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the history involves
criss-cross merges, there can be more than one best common
ancestor for two commits. For example, with this
topology:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">---1---o---A &nbsp; <br>
/ <br>
X <br>
/ ---2---o---o---B</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">both 1 and 2 are merge-bases of
A and B. Neither one is better than the other (both are best
merge bases). When the --all option is not given, it is
unspecified which best one is <br>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common idiom to check
&quot;fast-forward-ness&quot; between two commits A and B is
(or at least used to be) to compute the merge base between A
and B, and check if it is the same as A, <br>
in which case, A is an ancestor of B. You will see this
idiom used often in older scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A=$(git rev-parse --verify A)
<br>
if test &quot;$A&quot; = &quot;$(git merge-base A B)&quot;
<br>
then <br>
... A is an ancestor of B ... <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In modern git, you can say this
in a more direct way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if git merge-base --is-ancestor
A B <br>
then <br>
... A is an ancestor of B ... <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead.</p>
