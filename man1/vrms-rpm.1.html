<p>VRMS-RPM(1) General Commands Manual VRMS-RPM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vrms-rpm - report of installed non-free software</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vrms-rpm [OPTION] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is a clone of the original vrms (&quot;virtual
Richard M. Stallman&quot;) program for Debian GNU/Linux,
created with the purpose of bringing its brilliant idea over
to RPM- <br>
based GNU/Linux distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program analyses the list
of currently installed RPM packages and reports found
non-free packages to stdout. The decision on whether to
classify a package as free or non- <br>
free is based on the Fedora Project licensing
guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fedora / CentOS users using
additional repositories, such as RPM Fusion, may notice that
not all packages coming from non-official repos are marked
as non-free. This is because <br>
the distinction, as noted before, is made depending on the
package licence. There are various reasons, apart from
licensing, why a package may not have been accepted into the
<br>
official Fedora / CentOS repository &acirc; such as software
patents or export restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Richard Stallman has been, for
years, the most prominent and vocal figure in the Free
Software movement, relentlessly reminding us on issues of
software ethics. Like Richard, we <br>
believe that users should have an easy way to know whether
they&acirc;re running non-free software on their systems.
This program is an attempt to fulfil that need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--ascii <br>
Display rms ASCII-art when no non-free packages are found,
or when non-free packages are 10% or more of the total.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--explain <br>
When listing packages, display licences as to justify the
free / non-free classification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display a short help on
program usage and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list &lt;none, free, nonfree,
all&gt; <br>
Apart from displaying the total number of free and non-free
packages, also list packages by name. The default value for
this option is &quot;nonfree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version information and exit.</p>
