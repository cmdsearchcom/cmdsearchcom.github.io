<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
logapp - An application output supervisor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
logapp [option]... application [--logapp_option]...
[app.-argument]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">applicationsymlink
[--logapp_option]... [application-argument]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of calling logapp
directly you can also create a symlink with the name of the
application pointing to logapp. Logapp will automatically
start the application the name <br>
points to. It will also work if the symlink name is prefixed
with log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Logapp is a wrapper utility that helps supervise the
execution of applications that produce heavy console output
(e.g. make, CVS and Subversion). It does this by logging,
trim&acirc; <br>
ming, and coloring each line of the output before displaying
it. It can be called instead of the executable that should
be monitored; it then starts the application and logs all
<br>
of its console output to a file. The output shown in the
terminal is preprocessed, e.g. to limit the length of
printed lines and to show the stderr output in a different
color. <br>
It is also possible to automatically highlight lines that
match a certain regular expression. The output is therefore
reduced to the necessary amount, and all important lines are
<br>
easy to identify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options provided before the application argument are
processed directly by logapp. Options provided after the
application argument are only parsed if they are prefixed
with <br>
--logapp_ (long option names only) otherwise they are passed
to the application. If logapp is called via a symlink all
unprefixed options are passed to the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every application usually uses
two independent output streams: stdout for normal output and
stderr for errors and important messages. Both of them are
handled independently by <br>
logapp, therefore many options are available for both
streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bool options are accepting 1/0
and true/false as value. For long boolean options the value
can be omitted, in that case it will be assumed to be
&rsquo;true&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help <br>
Show a short overview over all available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Show version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--configfile=FILE <br>
Use a specific configuration file instead of searching the
configuration search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--showconfig <br>
Print the current configuration of logapp and exit before
the application is executed. This can be used this to check
if all configuration options are setup correctly if <br>
something doesn&rsquo;t work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--configsection=NAME <br>
Enable a specific section in the configuration file. If this
option is not provided the application name is used as
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable <br>
This disables logapp data handling completely. The
application is still started, but logapp won&rsquo;t touch
the data streams coming from the application. Neither
logging nor <br>
output formating is performed, only the execution time and
the exit state tracked. This is useful if logapp won&rsquo;t
be able to deal with expected data correctly, for example
<br>
when starting curses based applications. Have a look at
--disable_keywords to see how this option can be enabled
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable_keywords=keywordlist
<br>
With this option a list of comma separated keywords can be
provided which will cause the --disable to be enabled
automatically if found in the applications option list. <br>
This is useful if an application usually provides line-based
output, but creates binary data or uses a curses based
frontend if called with a specific parameter. You can <br>
also use the --detectescape option for another way to do
this without disabling the logging functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--detectescape=bool <br>
This option can be used to switch escape-sequence detection
on or off. With escape-sequence detection logapp will
automatically enable char-based stream handling as soon <br>
as an escape-sequence is part of the specific stream. This
behavior can be useful if you are working with an
application that is usually line-based, but starts other
ap&acirc; <br>
plications which may be using escape sequences to format the
screen. This option will prevent the terminal from being
messed up in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dumbterm=bool <br>
With this option set to true there will be no terminal
output coloring for stdout and stderr. Normally this option
is disabled and logapp tries to detect &quot;dumb&quot;
terminals <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usepty=bool <br>
This option is only available if logapp has been compiled
with PTY support. If PTY support is enabled with this option
set to true, logapp will open a pseudo terminal for <br>
stdout. This helps wenn running logapp with applications
that usually need a real terminal for output. You can
disable this option for most line based applications like
<br>
make, CVS or Subversion. Other applications like telnet or
picocom may produce strange results when used without PTY
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ptyremovecr=bool <br>
This option is only available if logapp has been compiled
with PTY support. When using a pseudo terminal for getting
the application output you will always get CR-LF line <br>
endings, which is usually not desired when working in UNIX
environments. With this option enabled, logapp will
automatically translate all CR-LF line endings in LF line
<br>
endings. This option is enabled as default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdout_blen=bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stderr_blen=bytes <br>
The line buffer size can be adjusted for stdout and stderr
independently with this option. If the value is too small,
lines will be split up if the buffer is full. The de&acirc;
<br>
fault is 2048 byte which should be big enough for most
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdout_charbased=bool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stderr_charbased=bool <br>
If you want to use logapp with applications that do not
produce line based output you can enable this options for
stdout and stderr independently. With this option enabled
<br>
logapp won&rsquo;t expect complete lines and will handle
data as it comes in. By default all single data packets are
written to a new line if this option is enabled, this can be
<br>
changed with the --alignlog option. If the result will be
usable depends on what kind of data is generated by the
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--extended-regexp=bool <br>
If this option is enabled logapp will interpret provided
regular expression patterns as extended regular expressions.
The default is to use basic regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING OPTIONS <br>
This section contains options that affect the logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --logfile=file <br>
This option can be used to change the file that is used for
storing the logged application data. If an empty string is
provided, logging is disabled and no logfile will be <br>
created. The default is that logapp creates a logfile called
logapp.log in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --appendlog=bool <br>
This option specifies if the logfile will be truncated or if
the data will be appended to an existing file on logapp
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maxlogsize=kibyte <br>
To limit the maximum size of the logfile you can set this
option to a value between 10 and 4000000 kiBytes. The
default is 0 which disables the logfile size limit. There
<br>
are different ways implemented how the logfile is limited.
Have a look at the options --logrename and --circularlog to
learn more. The default way is that the extension <br>
.old is added to the logfile and a new logfile is
started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logrename=bool <br>
This option specifies the behavior when a logfile is to be
truncated. If --logrename is enabled the logfile is renamed.
The new filename will be the same as before with <br>
the extension defined with --oldlogext added. The default
extension is .old. This option is used together with the
value of --appendlog and --maxlogsize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--circularlog=bool <br>
If this option is enabled together with a logfile size limit
set with --maxlogsize, the logfile will be used in a
circular way. This means if the maximum size is reached,
<br>
the file pointer is set to the beginning of the file and the
old content is overwritten from the beginning. There are
tags added to the logfile to help navigating in the <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--oldlogext=extension <br>
This defines the extion that is used when logapp is renaming
a logfile. The --logrename option defines if logapp will
rename the file and the default extension is .old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--locklogfile=bool <br>
With this option active the logfile is locked in order to
prevent it to be overwritten by another task. This is useful
if otherwise an unreadable mix up of different con&acirc;
<br>
tents would be the result. Depending on the value of the
--maxaltlogfiles option another logfile is chosen with the
same name and a number added. Logfile locking is acti&acirc;
<br>
vated by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--warnlogfilelock=bool <br>
This options defines if there should be a warning printed to
the console if the chosen logfile is already locked or in
other means not accessible. In this case there will <br>
be a message before the application is started and directly
after its execution where the name of the alternative
logfile is mentioned. This option is enabled by default.
<br>
Also have a look at the --printlogname where you can define
to always get the current logfile reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--printlogname=bool <br>
This option defines if the name of the used logfile should
be printed after the application has finished its execution.
This option is disabled by default. Also have a <br>
look at the --warnlogfilelock where you can enable/disable a
warning if the logfile name is changed because of a locked
logfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maxaltlogfiles=number <br>
This options defines the maximum number that can be added to
the logfile name, if the original file is not accessible. On
logapp startup it will be checked if the current&acirc; <br>
ly defined logfile is writeable, if this is not the case
automatically a number is added to the filename. If the
alternative file is also not accessible this number is
in&acirc; <br>
creased until a file is writable or the value of
maxaltlogfiles is reached. In the latter case the
application will exit with an error. If a value of 0 is used
only the <br>
original logfile name is tried. Also have a look at the
--warnlogfilelock and --printlogname options to define if
there should be messages about the currently used log&acirc;
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignlog=bool <br>
This option is used together with --stdout_charbased and
--stderr_charbased and defines if data packets are written
to the logfile as they come or if they are each written <br>
to a new line. The default is that each data packet is
written to a new line, set this option to false to disable
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alignlinebreaks=bool <br>
This option is used together with --stdout_charbased and
--stderr_charbased and aligns the lines to the left in the
logfile with regard to prefix and timestamp. This op&acirc;
<br>
tion is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jointimeout=time <br>
This option is used together with --stdout_charbased and
--stderr_charbased and defines a ms timeout for joining
single packets to one. This means if for example two chars
<br>
get written within the timeout, they are treated as one
packet. This is best used together with --alignlog and
--logtime. Use this option if the data packets have lost
<br>
their coherency for some reason (e.g. if the data comes
through a serial line). This feature is disabled by default
and can be enabled by setting time to a value bigger <br>
than 0 ms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --logtime=bool <br>
This option can be enabled to add a ms timestamp to each
line of the logfile. Normally the time since the application
start is used, but this can be changed with the --lo&acirc;
<br>
greltime option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logreltime=bool <br>
If this option is set this to true, the --logreltime option
will use the relative time since the last line for the
logged timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--logenv=bool <br>
With this option set to true logapp will add a list of all
active environment variables to the logfile. This option is
disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p,
--stdout_lineprefix=prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --stderr_lineprefix=prefix
<br>
To be able to distinguish stdout and stderr output in the
logfile logapp can prefix each line with a string that
indicates if the line belongs to a specific data stream.
<br>
Those strings can be changed with this option. The default
is that stdout does not have a prefix and stderr is prefixed
with STDERR:.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSOLE OUTPUT OPTIONS <br>
This section contains options that affect the visual output
on the console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dumbterm=bool <br>
This option disables output coloring. This is usually done
automatically if a dumb terminal is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --print_summary=bool <br>
If this option is set to true, then a short summary will be
printed after the application has terminated. This option is
disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --stdout_fgcol=color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --stderr_fgcol=color <br>
This options define the foreground color for the specific
data stream. The value can be one of the entries in the
console color table at the end of this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --stdout_bold=bool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --stderr_bold=bool <br>
This options define if the font for the specific data stream
should be printed bold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --stdout_regexp=regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --stderr_regexp=regular
expression <br>
The regular expression that can be defined with this option
is applied to every line of the specific data stream. On a
match the background color changes to the value pro&acirc;
<br>
vided with the --stdout_regexp_bgcol respectively
--stderr_regexp_bgcol option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdout_regexp_bgcol=color</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stderr_regexp_bgcol=color <br>
This options define the background color for the specific
data stream for the case that the appropriate regular
expression provided with --stdout_regexp or --stderr_regexp
<br>
matches. The value can be one of the entries in the console
color table at the end of this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --stdout_clip=width</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --stderr_clip=width <br>
This options define at which column the output should be
clipped for the specific stream to reduce the amount of data
written to the console. If a value of -1 is provided <br>
clipping is disabled for the stream. A value of -2 sets the
clipping to the current console width. It is also possible
to use disable and auto instead of the numeric val&acirc;
<br>
ues. The default is that stdout is limited to the console
width and that clipping is deactivated for stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND EXECUTION OPTIONS <br>
This section contains options that configure the execution
of commands on regular expression matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exitonexecfail=BOOL <br>
This option defines if logapp should exit and end the
wrapped application if the return value of an executed
command indicates a failure. As default this option is
dis&acirc; <br>
abled and logapp ignores the return state of executed
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preexec=command <br>
The command that can be provided with this option is
executed directly before the application is started. At this
time the header is already written to the logfile and can
<br>
be parsed by the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--postexec=command <br>
The command that can be provided with this option is
executed directly after the application has exited. At this
time the logfile is already closed for writing so all
ap&acirc; <br>
plication output and the footer are already included and can
be processed by the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --stdout_execregexp=regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --stderr_execregexp=regular
expression <br>
The regular expression that can be defined with this option
is applied to every line of the specific data stream. On a
match the command provided with the --stdout_exec&acirc;
<br>
command respectively --stderr_execcomand option is executed.
An empty value for this option disables the regular
expression matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x,
--stdout_execcommand=command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --stderr_execcommand=command
<br>
This option defines the command that is executed on a
regular expression match. The regular expression can be
defined separately for the stdout and stderr stream with the
<br>
--stdout_execregexp respectively --stderr_execregexp
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS <br>
Regular expressions are patterns that describe strings.
Logapp uses this patterns to execute actions based on
strings found in the data stream. The implementation is
identical to <br>
the one that is used by grep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logapp understands the
&quot;basic&quot; and &quot;extended&quot; syntax of regular
expressions as defined by POSIX. The default is to use the
basic set, but you can switch to extended patterns with <br>
the --extended-regexp parameter. Please have a look at the
grep(1) and regex(7) manpage for detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
String Matches &quot;String&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^String <br>
Matches &quot;String&quot; at the beginning of a line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String$ <br>
Matches &quot;String&quot; at the end of a line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^String$ <br>
Line contains only &quot;String&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Ss]tring <br>
Matches &quot;String&quot; or &quot;string&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Str.ng The dot matches all
characters, so this matches for example &quot;String&quot;
or &quot;Strong&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Str.*ng <br>
The dot together with star matches any number of characters,
so this matches for example &quot;String&quot; or
&quot;Streaming&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">^[A-Z] * <br>
Matches any one of the characters from A to Z at the
beginning of a line followed by zero or any number of
spaces</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">StringWord <br>
Matches &quot;String&quot; or &quot;Word&quot; when working
with basic regular expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String|Word <br>
Matches &quot;String&quot; or &quot;Word&quot; when working
with extended regular expressions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TERM This variable is checked to see which type of console
logapp is running in. Currently only the value dumb is
handled in a special way &acirc; by disabling console
colors. If the <br>
TERM variable is missing also a dumb terminal is assumed.
The setting can be overridden by enabling/disabling the dumb
terminal mode using the --dumbterm option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.logapprc, /etc/logapp.conf, /etc/logapp/logapp.conf <br>
Configuration file locations that are tried if no
--configfile option is provided.</p>
