<p>GUP(1) General Commands Manual GUP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gup - A Group Update Program that accepts commands by mail
to edit a newsgroup subscription file for subsequent use by
news systems such as INN and C-News.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
gup [-hvP] -a active_path [-d home_directory] [-l log_path]
<br>
[-m reply_headers] [-n newsgroups_path] <br>
[-s sites_directory] [-M Mail_command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sole purpose of gup is to automate the tedious process
of editing group selection patterns defined in the news
configuration files (eg:
&lsquo;&lsquo;newsfeeds&rsquo;&rsquo; for INN and
&lsquo;&lsquo;sys&rsquo;&rsquo; for <br>
C-News).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gup is of use to news
administrators who spend an inordinate amount of time
editing their news config files at the behest of the sites
they feed. In fact, once gup is installed, <br>
it is quite likely that manual edits of your
&lsquo;&lsquo;newsfeeds&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;sys&rsquo;&rsquo; file will become a thing of
the past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gup is designed to be installed
as a mail-server program that is fed an inbound mail via
stdin. Gup is usually invoked from a .forward file. Eg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;|/.../bin/gup
-options....&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each site has an entry in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file containing password
and mail address details and a group selection file called
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo;, see CONFIG, and GROUPS
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The news administrator of each
site mails commands to gup. There are commands to include
and exclude group patterns, list the current patterns for
that site and list the avail&acirc; <br>
able newsgroups; see COMMANDS, for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The results are normally mailed
back to the site&rsquo;s configured administrator. However
under some circumstances, the results are mailed to the
originator or the local administra&acirc; <br>
tor; see PROCESSING, for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Gup does not directly change the
news system&rsquo;s control files (eg,
&lsquo;&lsquo;newsfeeds&rsquo;&rsquo; for INN). Instead a
trivial shell script must be run to concatenate all of the
changed &lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
files together into an appropriately formatted file for your
particular news system. (One is provided in the source kit
for INN).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since each site has to be
specifically configured in gup&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file, access can be
restricted to administrator&rsquo;s capable of managing
their own group patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options can appear in any order on the command line. The
most important point to note is that all of the paths and
directories defined will normally be absolute paths unless
you <br>
are intimately familiar with the way in which gup changes
directories as it processes a mail (the possible exception
here is the Sites_directory).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a active_path <br>
The path of the active file for your news system. Before
accepting any newsgroup identified in a command, gup
validates the group against the active file. The command is
<br>
rejected if no match is found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d home_directory <br>
Defines gup&rsquo;s home directory. Gup changes to this
directory as soon as possible after starting up. If this
option is not present, the current directory is used. Gup
<br>
looks for the &lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file in
it&rsquo;s home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print out a help message
showing the command line options, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l log_path <br>
A record of all significant requests are written to this
file. If the path is relative, then it will be relative to
gup&rsquo;s home directory; see the -d option). Gup must be
<br>
able to write to this file. If the -l option is not used,
then gup uses stderr. This is useful for testing purposes,
but is unlikely to be of use in a .forward file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m reply_headers <br>
When gup generates a mail response it only generates the
&lsquo;&lsquo;To: &rsquo;&rsquo; header line. This option
defines the path of a file that contains other RFC882
conformant header lines <br>
that are piped to the mail program (see the -M option). In
fact, if this file contains a body following the headers,
then that will precede any text generated by gup. If <br>
this path is not an absolute path, then it will be treated
as relative to gup&rsquo;s home directory (see the -d
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Mail_command <br>
Gup pipes the rfc822 headers and the body of the mail to the
nominated mail program. Normally, this is configured when
gup is installed, but it can be over-ridden with <br>
this option. The mail command must be able to determine the
recipient addresses from the rfc822 headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n newsgroups_path <br>
If present, the newsgroups file is used to try and find a
matching description of newsgroup when listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Do not prune superfluous
patterns from a site&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file. Before writing the
updated &lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file, gup applies
a fairly rigorous test to the patterns, pruning <br>
any nonsensical or un-necessary patterns. This pruning
process can be quite CP intensive to the extent that it may
have a deleterious effect on your system - thus the <br>
ability to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Sites_directory <br>
Each site&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;exclude&rsquo;&rsquo; file are located in a
unique directory for each site. These site directories are
located in the directory defined with this option. <br>
If this is given as a relative path then it will be relative
to gup&rsquo;s home directory (see the -d option). Gup will
try and create this directory if it does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print out the version number
and various compile-time variables, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Gup scans the body of the mail for commands. Blank lines are
ignored and any data after the &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo;
character is considered a comment. No continuation is
allowed. Many of the com&acirc; <br>
mands accept a pattern as a parameter. This pattern is
identical to the format of the wildmat() pattern; see
wildmat (3) ). In fact, Gup purposely uses the wildmat
routine from <br>
INN to ensure that the pattern matching characteristics are
identical.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">site sitename password <br>
This must be the first command in the mail. sitename and
password must match an entry in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file. Only one site
command is allowed per mail. Aliases: &quot;open&quot; <br>
and &quot;host&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quit This command stops gup from
processing the rest of the mail. This is useful if your mail
User Agent tends to automatically append a signature file to
your mail. Alias: <br>
&quot;q&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include pattern <br>
The pattern is checked against the active file. If it
matches at least one newsgroup, the pattern is placed at the
end of the site&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;group&rsquo;&rsquo;
file as an include entry. <br>
Only one pattern per include command is allowed. If the
pattern matches anything in the site&rsquo;s exclusion list
(see EXCLUSIONS) then the include will fail. Aliases:
&quot;+&quot; <br>
and &quot;inc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exclude pattern <br>
The pattern is checked against the active file. If it
matches at least one newsgroup, the pattern is placed at the
end of the site&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;group&rsquo;&rsquo;
file as an exclude entry. <br>
Only one pattern per exclude command is allowed. Aliases:
&quot;-&quot; and &quot;exc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">poison pattern <br>
If the pattern matches at least one crossposted newsgroup
the article will not be accepted even if allowed by an
include statement. Only one pattern per poison command is
<br>
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Generate a small help
message that briefly describes each command. There is an
implied quit with the help command so there is no point in
placing commands after the help <br>
command. Alias: &quot;h&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list list all of the current
include and exclude patterns in the sites
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file. The output is in a
format suitable for feeding back into gup at a later stage
if need <br>
be. Alias: &quot;l&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete pattern <br>
Delete all include, exclude and poison patterns in the
site&rsquo;s &lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file that
match the pattern. &lsquo;&lsquo;delete *&rsquo;&rsquo; is
an effective way of clearing all current patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newsgroups pattern <br>
This command lists out all available newsgroups from the
active file that match the pattern. The list includes the
description from the newsgroups file as well as an <br>
indication if the site is currently subscribed to that
group. Only one pattern per newsgroups command is allowed.
Alias: &quot;news&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROCESSING <br>
Gup has a number of processing stages. The initialization
stage consists of changing to the home directory (see the -d
option) and opening the logfile (see the -l option). At <br>
this time, gup sets the tentative reply-to mail address to
the &lsquo;&lsquo;backstop&rsquo;&rsquo; mail address
defined when gup was compiled (typically the local news
administrator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next stage consists of
scanning the inbound mail, noting interesting mail headers.
The most interesting ones are &quot;To:&quot; and
&quot;Reply-To:&quot;. When a &quot;To:&quot; header is
found it <br>
becomes the tentative reply-to mail address. If a
&quot;Reply-To:&quot; header is found it over-rides any
&quot;To:&quot; address to become the new tentative reply-to
mail address. A few others are <br>
noted and logged to help track changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After all the headers have been
processed, the body of the mail is examined for commands.
The first command must be the site command. Any other data
results in an error mail sent <br>
to the tentative reply-to mail address. If the site command
contains a name that matches an entry in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file, then the tentative
reply-to mail address is replaced <br>
with the mail address in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason for these contortions
with tentative reply-to mail addresses is simply to deal
with the problem of working out who to send a mail to in the
event of an error. Ideally <br>
they should all go back to the mail address in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file, but that
information is not known for quite a significant part of
gup&rsquo;s initial processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a valid site command has
been accepted, gup changes to that site&rsquo;s directory in
Sites_directory (see the -s option) making the
Sites_directory and site&rsquo;s directory as neces&acirc;
<br>
sary. The site&rsquo;s directory name is the same as the
site&rsquo;s name. In the absence of the -s option this will
be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/sites/$site</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where $HOME is gup&rsquo;s home
directory and $site is the name of the site being processed.
Gup locks the site then loads the site&rsquo;s current
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file and any xclusion
list if <br>
present (see EXCLUSIONS for more details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From this point on gup accepts
any command in any order until either the end of the mail, a
quit command a help command or a serious error during
processing. After all commands <br>
have been processed, gup update&rsquo;s the site&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file if changes have been
made. This update includes pruning any superfluous patterns
(unless the -P option is used). <br>
Gup writes the new patterns to
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups.new&rsquo;&rsquo;. It then renames
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;group.old&rsquo;&rsquo; and finally renames
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups.new&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo;. The result of all this
processing is <br>
mailed to the site administrator defined in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG <br>
Access to gup is controlled by the
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file in gup&rsquo;s home
directory (see the -d option). This file contains one line
per site. Each line contains three white-space sepa&acirc;
<br>
rated tokens. The site&rsquo;s name, password and mail
address of the administrator. Blank lines are allowed and
comments follow the &lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; character.
Gup uses a very simple tok&acirc; <br>
enizer, thus no quoting or continuation is allow in this
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The site name and password are
used to check an inbound site command. The password can be
crypted or in plain-text so permissions should be carefully
set to restrict access. <br>
Here&rsquo;s an example of a
&lsquo;&lsquo;config&rsquo;&rsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">werple Fert5566a__$1
andrew@werple.apana.org.au <br>
torps 34fkr_&amp;&amp;11)Zz zaph@torps.apana.org.au <br>
uunet R_S_1@@*(A-&nbsp; news@uunet.uu.net <br>
.test flapper markd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hopefully this is intuitively
obvious...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROUPS <br>
Each site has it&rsquo;s own file of patterns. This file is
called &lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; and is located in
the site&rsquo;s own directory below the Sites_directory
(see the -s option). This file con&acirc; <br>
tains one pattern per line. Exclusion lists have a preceding
&lsquo;&lsquo;!&rsquo;&rsquo; character. Here&rsquo;s an
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apana.* <br>
!apana.lists.* <br>
!apana.fido.* <br>
!apana.vortex.* <br>
alt.bbs.waffle <br>
alt.cult-movies <br>
alt.galactic-guide <br>
alt.sport.bowling <br>
aus.* <br>
!aus.ai <br>
!aus.religion <br>
!aus.radio <br>
!aus.stats.s <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally this file should only
be changed by gup, but assuming you cater for locking, there
is no reason why some other process cannot change it too.
Whenever gup has to apply <br>
changes, it renames this file to
&lsquo;&lsquo;groups.old&rsquo;&rsquo; prior to re-writing
the &lsquo;&lsquo;groups&rsquo;&rsquo; file. This gives you
some measure of recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXCLUSIONS <br>
For whatever reason, you may wish to exclude particular
groups from a site&rsquo;s selection list. You can do this
by creating the file &lsquo;&lsquo;exclude&rsquo;&rsquo; in
the site&rsquo;s directory. This file <br>
contains newsgroup patterns, one per line, that are used to
filter the &lsquo;&lsquo;active&rsquo;&rsquo; file when
verifying group patterns. The effect of this is that gup
believes that such groups do <br>
not really exist, therefore a site cannot possibly include
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All error conditions are record in the log file and possibly
the resultant mail - depending on the nature of the error. A
particular problem that is hard to detect is when the <br>
.forward file invokes gup incorrectly. If gup is not invoked
due to such an error, then notification depends on the
mailer. This should only be a problem to watch out for when
<br>
first installing gup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Gup does not understand &lsquo;&lsquo;Distribution
patterns&rsquo;&rsquo;. Any such patterns must be generated
and maintained independently of gup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Gup does not know when the popen(1) fails when Mail_command
is invoked. This is a limitation of popen(1). If the
Mail_command is bogus, then the error will be pretty obscure
and <br>
dependent on your mailer. stderr is redirected to the
logfile prior to invoking the Mail_Command so hopefully
/bin/sh (used by popen) has generated an appropriate
message.</p>
