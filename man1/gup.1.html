gup - A <i>G</i>roup <i>U</i>pdate <i>P</i>rogram that accepts commands by mail
  to edit a newsgroup subscription file for subsequent use by news systems such
  as <i>INN</i> and <i>C-News</i>.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The sole purpose of <i>gup</i> is to automate the tedious process of editing
  group selection patterns defined in the news configuration files (eg:
  ``newsfeeds'' for <i>INN</i> and ``sys'' for <i>C-News</i>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Gup</i> is of use to news administrators who spend an inordinate amount of
  time editing their news config files at the behest of the sites they feed. In
  fact, once <i>gup</i> is installed, it is quite likely that manual edits of
  your ``newsfeeds'' or ``sys'' file will become a thing of the past.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Gup</i> is designed to be installed as a mail-server program that is fed an
  inbound mail via stdin. <i>Gup</i> is usually invoked from a .forward file.
  Eg:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
	&quot;|/.../bin/gup -options....&quot;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each site has an entry in the ``config'' file containing password and mail
  address details and a group selection file called ``groups'', see
  <b>CONFIG</b>, and <b>GROUPS</b> for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The news administrator of each site mails commands to <i>gup</i>. There are
  commands to include and exclude group patterns, list the current patterns for
  that site and list the available newsgroups; see <b>COMMANDS</b>, for more
  details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The results are normally mailed back to the site's configured administrator.
  However under some circumstances, the results are mailed to the originator or
  the local administrator; see <b>PROCESSING</b>, for further details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Gup</i> does not directly change the news system's control files (eg,
  ``newsfeeds'' for INN). Instead a trivial shell script must be run to
  concatenate all of the changed ``groups'' files together into an appropriately
  formatted file for your particular news system. (One is provided in the source
  kit for INN).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since each site has to be specifically configured in <i>gup</i>'s ``config''
  file, access can be restricted to administrator's capable of managing their
  own group patterns.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Options can appear in any order on the command line. The most important point to
  note is that all of the paths and directories defined will normally be
  absolute paths unless you are intimately familiar with the way in which
  <i>gup</i> changes directories as it processes a mail (the possible exception
  here is the Sites_directory).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b><i> active_path</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The path of the active file for your news system. Before
      accepting any newsgroup identified in a command, <i>gup</i> validates the
      group against the active file. The command is rejected if no match is
      found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b><i> home_directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Defines <i>gup</i>'s home directory. <i>Gup</i> changes to
      this directory as soon as possible after starting up. If this option is
      not present, the current directory is used. <i>Gup</i> looks for the
      ``config'' file in it's home directory.</dd>
</dl>

  <dd class="It-tag">A record of all significant requests are written to this
      file. If the path is relative, then it will be relative to <i>gup</i>'s
      home directory; see the -d option). <i>Gup</i> must be able to write to
      this file. If the <b>-l</b> option is not used, then <i>gup</i> uses
      stderr. This is useful for testing purposes, but is unlikely to be of use
      in a .forward file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b><i> reply_headers</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When <i>gup</i> generates a mail response it only generates
      the ``To: '' header line. This option defines the path of a file that
      contains other RFC882 conformant header lines that are piped to the mail
      program (see the -M option). In fact, if this file contains a body
      following the headers, then that will precede any text generated by
      <i>gup</i>. If this path is not an absolute path, then it will be treated
      as relative to <i>gup</i>'s home directory (see the -d option).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-M</b><i> Mail_command</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>Gup</i> pipes the rfc822 headers and the body of the
      mail to the nominated mail program. Normally, this is configured when
      <i>gup</i> is installed, but it can be over-ridden with this option. The
      mail command must be able to determine the recipient addresses from the
      rfc822 headers.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b><i> newsgroups_path</i></dt>

  <dd class="It-tag">Do <i>not</i> prune superfluous patterns from a site's
      ``groups'' file. Before writing the updated ``groups'' file, <i>gup</i>
      applies a fairly rigorous test to the patterns, pruning any nonsensical or
      un-necessary patterns. This pruning process can be quite CP intensive to
      the extent that it may have a deleterious effect on your system - thus the
      ability to disable it.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b><i> Sites_directory</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Each site's ``groups'' and ``exclude'' file are located in
      a unique directory for each site. These site directories are located in
      the directory defined with this option. If this is given as a relative

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<i>Gup</i> scans the body of the mail for commands. Blank lines are ignored and
  any data after the ``#'' character is considered a comment. No continuation is
  allowed. Many of the commands accept a pattern as a parameter. This pattern is
  identical to the format of the wildmat() pattern; see <b>wildmat (3)</b> ). In
  fact, <i>Gup</i> purposely uses the <b>wildmat</b> routine from INN to ensure
  that the pattern matching characteristics are identical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Valid commands are:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PROCESSING"><a class="selflink" href="#PROCESSING">PROCESSING</a></h1>
<i>Gup</i> has a number of processing stages. The initialization stage consists
  of changing to the home directory (see the -d option) and opening the logfile
  (see the -l option). At this time, <i>gup</i> sets the tentative reply-to mail
  address to the ``backstop'' mail address defined when <i>gup</i> was compiled
  (typically the local news administrator).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The next stage consists of scanning the inbound mail, noting <i>interesting</i>
  mail headers. The most interesting ones are &quot;To:&quot; and
  &quot;Reply-To:&quot;. When a &quot;To:&quot; header is found it becomes the
  tentative reply-to mail address. If a &quot;Reply-To:&quot; header is found it
  over-rides any &quot;To:&quot; address to become the new tentative reply-to
  mail address. A few others are noted and logged to help track changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After all the headers have been processed, the body of the mail is examined for
  commands. The first command <b>must</b> be the <i>site</i> command. Any other
  data results in an error mail sent to the tentative reply-to mail address. If
  the <i>site</i> command contains a name that matches an entry in the
  ``config'' file, then the tentative reply-to mail address is replaced with the
  mail address in the ``config'' file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reason for these contortions with tentative reply-to mail addresses is
  simply to deal with the problem of working out who to send a mail to in the
  event of an error. Ideally they should all go back to the mail address in the
  ``config'' file, but that information is not known for quite a significant
  part of <i>gup</i>'s initial processing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a valid <i>site</i> command has been accepted, <i>gup</i> changes to that
  site's directory in Sites_directory (see the -s option) making the
  Sites_directory and site's directory as necessary. The site's directory name
  is the same as the site's name. In the absence of the -s option this will be:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	$HOME/sites/$site
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Where $HOME is <i>gup</i>'s home directory and $site is the name of the site
  being processed. <i>Gup</i> locks the site then loads the site's current
  ``groups'' file and any xclusion list if present (see <b>EXCLUSIONS</b> for
  more details).
<div class="Pp"></div>
From this point on <i>gup</i> accepts any command in any order until either the
  end of the mail, a quit command a help command or a serious error during
  processing. After all commands have been processed, <i>gup</i> update's the
  site's ``groups'' file if changes have been made. This update includes pruning
  any superfluous patterns (unless the -P option is used). <i>Gup</i> writes the
  new patterns to ``groups.new''. It then renames ``groups'' to ``group.old''
  and finally renames ``groups.new'' to ``groups''. The result of all this
  processing is mailed to the site administrator defined in the ``config'' file.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIG"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIG">CONFIG</a></h1>
Access to <i>gup</i> is controlled by the ``config'' file in <i>gup</i>'s home
  directory (see the -d option). This file contains one line per site. Each line
  contains three white-space separated tokens. The site's name, password and
  mail address of the administrator. Blank lines are allowed and comments follow
  the ``#'' character. <i>Gup</i> uses a very simple tokenizer, thus no quoting
  or continuation is allow in this file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The site name and password are used to check an inbound <i>site</i> command. The
  password can be crypted or in <i>plain-text</i> so permissions should be
  carefully set to restrict access. Here's an example of a ``config'' file.
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	werple	Fert5566a__$1	andrew@werple.apana.org.au
	torps	34fkr_&amp;&amp;11)Zz	zaph@torps.apana.org.au
	uunet	R_S_1@@*(A-\	news@uunet.uu.net
	.test	flapper		markd
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Hopefully this is intuitively obvious...
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GROUPS"><a class="selflink" href="#GROUPS">GROUPS</a></h1>
Each site has it's own file of patterns. This file is called ``groups'' and is
  located in the site's own directory below the Sites_directory (see the -s
  option). This file contains one pattern per line. Exclusion lists have a
  preceding ``!'' character. Here's an example:
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
apana.*
!apana.lists.*
!apana.fido.*
!apana.vortex.*
alt.bbs.waffle
alt.cult-movies
alt.galactic-guide
alt.sport.bowling
aus.*
!aus.ai
!aus.religion
!aus.radio
!aus.stats.s
...
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
Normally this file should only be changed by <i>gup</i>, but assuming you cater
  for locking, there is no reason why some other process cannot change it too.
  Whenever <i>gup</i> has to apply changes, it renames this file to
  ``groups.old'' prior to re-writing the ``groups'' file. This gives you some
  measure of recovery.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXCLUSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXCLUSIONS">EXCLUSIONS</a></h1>
For whatever reason, you may wish to exclude particular groups from a site's
  selection list. You can do this by creating the file ``exclude'' in the site's
  directory. This file contains newsgroup patterns, one per line, that are used
  to filter the ``active'' file when verifying group patterns. The effect of
  this is that <i>gup</i> believes that such groups do not really exist,
  therefore a site cannot possibly include them.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
All error conditions are record in the log file and possibly the resultant mail
  - depending on the nature of the error. A particular problem that is hard to
  detect is when the .forward file invokes <i>gup</i> incorrectly. If <i>gup</i>
  is not invoked due to such an error, then notification depends on the mailer.
  This should only be a problem to watch out for when first installing
  <i>gup</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESTRICTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</a></h1>
<i>Gup</i> does not understand ``Distribution patterns''. Any such patterns must
  be generated and maintained independently of <i>gup</i>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<i>Gup</i> does not know when the <i>popen</i>(1) fails when <i>Mail_command</i>
  is invoked. This is a limitation of <i>popen</i>(1). If the
  <i>Mail_command</i> is bogus, then the error will be pretty obscure and
  dependent on your mailer. stderr is redirected to the logfile prior to
  invoking the <i>Mail_Command</i> so hopefully /bin/sh (used by popen) has
  generated an appropriate message.
