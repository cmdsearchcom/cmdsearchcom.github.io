<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lintex - removes TeX-related garbage files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lintex [ -i ] [ -r ] [ -b ext ] [ -p ] [ -k ] [ -o ] [ -q ]
[ -v ] [ -d ] [ dir [ dir ... ]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lintex is a program that removes TeX-related auxiliary
files, normally not needed after a successful TeX run (i.e.
log, aux, dvi, ... files); they are actually removed only if
<br>
their modification timestamp is more recent than the one of
the related TeX source and if they aren&rsquo;t readonly. In
addition, all the backup files that your favorite editor has
<br>
generated are also removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i Asks the user permission before actually removing any
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r The given directories are
scanned recursively; i.e., if they contain any subdirectory
structure, all the tree will be cleaned up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b ext ext is the trailer string
(the &Acirc;&acute;extension&Acirc;&acute;) that identifies
the backup files generated by your editor, e.g. -b .bak; ext
defaults to ~ (the tilde character), i.e. to the <br>
emacs convention. If ext includes characters having a
special meaning for the shell, it must be enclosed in
quotes: e.g. -b &quot;~&quot; (equivalent to the default).
Specifying <br>
the null string, as in -b &quot;&quot;, inhibits the cleanup
of any special file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Pretends, show what files
would be removed but don&rsquo;t actually remove them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Keeps final documents (.pdf,
.ps, .dvi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Permits the removal of files
older than their sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet, only prints error
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose, prints which files
were removed and which weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debug, prints the answers to
all of life&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
dir The name(s), separated by whitespace, of one or more
directories to be cleaned; if missing, the default is the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENSIONS THAT GET REMOVED <br>
All files ending in the following extensions may be removed
when appropriate:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.aux, .bbl, .bcf, .blg, .dvi,
.idx, .ilg, .ind, .lof, .log, .lot, .nav, .out, .pdf, .ps,
.snm, .thm, .toc, .toc.old, .synctex.gz, .xyc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The HOME environment variable determines the location of the
configuration file, see FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Users can create a configuration file $HOME/.lintexrc which
optionally contains the keys remove-exts and keep-exts, each
followed by a Python style list of extensions to addi&acirc;
<br>
tionally remove or keep, respectively. Each extension must
be preceded by a period, e.g. &quot;.pdf&quot; and not
&quot;pdf&quot;. The keep-exts key is only used when the
keep option (-k) is <br>
passed. Note that the extensions listed in the keep-exts
field replace the defaults used by the -k option. The
keep-exts option also takes precedence over remove-exts: no
file <br>
ending in an extension removed by default or listed in
remove-exts will be deleted if its extension is listed in
keep-exts and the -k option was passed. For example, the
configu&acirc; <br>
ration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep-exts = [&quot;.pdf&quot;,
&quot;.ps&quot;, &quot;.log&quot;]; <br>
remove-exts = [&quot;.txt&quot;, &quot;.1&quot;];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will keep any file ending in
&quot;.pdf&quot;, &quot;.ps&quot; or &quot;.log&quot; when
lintex is called with the -k option (but not files ending in
&quot;.dvi&quot;), and adds &quot;.txt&quot; and
&quot;.1&quot; to the list of extensions <br>
to check for removal. The following configuration file
provides lintex with its default behaviour:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keep-exts = [&quot;.pdf&quot;,
&quot;.ps&quot;, &quot;.dvi&quot;]; <br>
remove-exts = [];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
lintex cannot handle extensions containing periods, for
example, &quot;.toc.old&quot; and &quot;.synctex.gz&quot;,
since it splits filenames at the last period to find the
extension, treating <br>
&quot;foo.toc.old&quot; as the file &quot;foo.toc&quot; with
the extension &quot;.old&quot;.</p>
