<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
llvm-cov - emit coverage information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
llvm-cov command [args...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The llvm-cov tool shows code coverage information for
programs that are instrumented to emit profile data. It can
be used to work with gcov-style coverage or with
clang&rsquo;s instru&acirc; <br>
mentation based profiling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is invoked with a
base name of gcov, it will behave as if the llvm-cov gcov
command were called. Otherwise, a command should be
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCOV COMMAND <br>
SYNOPSIS <br>
llvm-cov gcov [options] SOURCEFILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The llvm-cov gcov tool reads code coverage data files and
displays the coverage information for a specified source
file. It is compatible with the gcov tool from version 4.2
of <br>
GCC and may also be compatible with some later versions of
gcov.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use llvm-cov gcov, you must
first build an instrumented version of your application that
collects coverage data as it runs. Compile with the
-fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage <br>
options to add the instrumentation. (Alternatively, you can
use the --coverage option, which includes both of those
other options.) You should compile with debugging
information <br>
(-g) and without optimization (-O0); otherwise, the coverage
data cannot be accurately mapped back to the source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the time you compile the
instrumented code, a .gcno data file will be generated for
each object file. These .gcno files contain half of the
coverage data. The other half of <br>
the data comes from .gcda files that are generated when you
run the instrumented program, with a separate .gcda file for
each object file. Each time you run the program, the
exe&acirc; <br>
cution counts are summed into any existing .gcda files, so
be sure to remove any old files if you do not want their
contents to be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the .gcda files are
written into the same directory as the object files, but you
can override that by setting the GCOV_PREFIX and
GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP environment vari&acirc; <br>
ables. The GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP variable specifies a number of
directory components to be removed from the start of the
absolute path to the object file directory. After stripping
<br>
those directories, the prefix from the GCOV_PREFIX variable
is added. These environment variables allow you to run the
instrumented program on a machine where the original object
<br>
file directories are not accessible, but you will then need
to copy the .gcda files back to the object file directories
where llvm-cov gcov expects to find them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have generated the
coverage data files, run llvm-cov gcov for each main source
file where you want to examine the coverage results. This
should be run from the same <br>
directory where you previously ran the compiler. The results
for the specified source file are written to a file named by
appending a .gcov suffix. A separate output file is also
<br>
created for each file included by the main source file, also
with a .gcov suffix added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic content of an .gcov
output file is a copy of the source file with an execution
count and line number prepended to every line. The execution
count is shown as - if a <br>
line does not contain any executable code. If a line
contains code but that code was never executed, the count is
displayed as #####.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --all-blocks <br>
Display all basic blocks. If there are multiple blocks for a
single line of source code, this option causes llvm-cov to
show the count for each block instead of just one <br>
count for the entire line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --branch-probabilities <br>
Display conditional branch probabilities and a summary of
branch information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --branch-counts <br>
Display branch counts instead of probabilities (requires
-b).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --function-summaries <br>
Show a summary of coverage for each function instead of just
one summary for an entire source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display available options
(--help-hidden for more).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --long-file-names <br>
For coverage output of files included from the main source
file, add the main file name followed by ## as a prefix to
the output file names. This can be combined with the <br>
--preserve-paths option to use complete paths for both the
main file and the included file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-output <br>
Do not output any .gcov files. Summary information is still
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o=&lt;DIR|FILE&gt;,
--object-directory=&lt;DIR&gt;, --object-file=&lt;FILE&gt;
<br>
Find objects in DIR or based on FILE&rsquo;s path. If you
specify a particular object file, the coverage data files
are expected to have the same base name with .gcno and .gcda
<br>
extensions. If you specify a directory, the files are
expected in that directory with the same base name as the
source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --preserve-paths <br>
Preserve path components when naming the coverage output
files. In addition to the source file name, include the
directories from the path to that file. The directories <br>
are separate by # characters, with . directories removed and
.. directories replaced by ^ characters. When used with the
--long-file-names option, this applies to both the <br>
main file name and the included file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unconditional-branches
<br>
Include unconditional branches in the output for the
--branch-probabilities option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Display the version of llvm-cov.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
llvm-cov gcov returns 1 if it cannot read input files.
Otherwise, it exits with zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHOW COMMAND <br>
SYNOPSIS <br>
llvm-cov show [options] -instr-profile PROFILE BIN [-object
BIN,...] [[-object BIN]] [SOURCES]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The llvm-cov show command shows line by line coverage of the
binaries BIN,... using the profile data PROFILE. It can
optionally be filtered to only show the coverage for the
<br>
files listed in SOURCES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use llvm-cov show, you need a
program that is compiled with instrumentation to emit
profile and coverage data. To build such a program with
clang use the -fprofile-instr-gen&acirc; <br>
erate and -fcoverage-mapping flags. If linking with the
clang driver, pass -fprofile-instr-generate to the link
stage to make sure the necessary runtime libraries are
linked in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The coverage information is
stored in the built executable or library itself, and this
is what you should pass to llvm-cov show as a BIN argument.
The profile data is generated <br>
by running this instrumented program normally. When the
program exits it will write out a raw profile file,
typically called default.profraw, which can be converted to
a format <br>
that is suitable for the PROFILE argument using the
llvm-profdata merge tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-show-line-counts <br>
Show the execution counts for each line. This is enabled by
default, unless another -show option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show-expansions <br>
Expand inclusions, such as preprocessor macros or textual
inclusions, inline in the display of the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show-instantiations <br>
For source regions that are instantiated multiple times,
such as templates in C++, show each instantiation separately
as well as the combined summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show-regions <br>
Show the execution counts for each region by displaying a
caret that points to the character where the region
starts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-show-line-counts-or-regions
<br>
Show the execution counts for each line if there is only one
region on the line, but show the individual regions if there
are multiple on the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-use-color[=VALUE] <br>
Enable or disable color output. By default this is
autodetected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arch=&lt;name&gt; <br>
If the covered binary is a universal binary, select the
architecture to use. It is an error to specify an
architecture that is not included in the universal binary or
to <br>
use an architecture that does not match a non-universal
binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name=&lt;NAME&gt; <br>
Show code coverage only for functions with the given
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name-regex=&lt;PATTERN&gt; <br>
Show code coverage only for functions that match the given
regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-format=&lt;FORMAT&gt; <br>
Use the specified output format. The supported formats are:
&quot;text&quot;, &quot;html&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tab-size=&lt;TABSIZE&gt; <br>
Replace tabs with &lt;TABSIZE&gt; spaces when preparing
reports. Currently, this is only supported for the html
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-output-dir=PATH <br>
Specify a directory to write coverage reports into. If the
directory does not exist, it is created. When used in
function view mode (i.e when -name or -name-regex are used
<br>
to select specific functions), the report is written to
PATH/functions.EXTENSION. When used in file view mode, a
report for each file is written to <br>
PATH/REL_PATH_TO_FILE.EXTENSION.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xdemangler=&lt;TOOL&gt;|&lt;TOOL-OPTION&gt;
<br>
Specify a symbol demangler. This can be used to make reports
more human-readable. This option can be specified multiple
times to supply arguments to the demangler (e.g <br>
-Xdemangler c++filt -Xdemangler -n for C++). The demangler
is expected to read a newline-separated list of symbols from
stdin and write a newline-separated list of the <br>
same length to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-line-coverage-gt=&lt;N&gt; <br>
Show code coverage only for functions with line coverage
greater than the given threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-line-coverage-lt=&lt;N&gt; <br>
Show code coverage only for functions with line coverage
less than the given threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-region-coverage-gt=&lt;N&gt;
<br>
Show code coverage only for functions with region coverage
greater than the given threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-region-coverage-lt=&lt;N&gt;
<br>
Show code coverage only for functions with region coverage
less than the given threshold.</p>
