<p>PMDAMMV(1) General Commands Manual PMDAMMV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmdammv - memory mapped values performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv/pmdammv [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U
username]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmdammv is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
exports application level performance metrics using memory
mapped files. It offers an extremely low overhead
instru&acirc; <br>
mentation facility that is well-suited to long running,
mission critical applications where it is desirable to have
performance metrics and availability information permanently
<br>
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mmv PMDA exports
instrumentation that has been added to an application using
the MMV APIs (refer to mmv_stats_init(3) and mmv(5) for
further details). These APIs can be <br>
called from several languages, including C, C++, Perl,
Python and Java (via the separate
&lsquo;&lsquo;Parfait&rsquo;&rsquo; class library).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A brief description of the
pmdammv command line options follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d It is absolutely crucial that
the performance metrics domain number specified here is
unique and consistent. That is, domain should be different
for every PMDA on the one <br>
host, and the same domain number should be used for the same
PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Location of the log file. By
default, a log file named mmv.log is written in the current
directory of pmcd(1) when pmdammv is started, i.e.
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log <br>
file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
to the standard error instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U User account under which to
run the agent. The default is the unprivileged
&quot;pcp&quot; account in current versions of PCP, but in
older versions the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) <br>
was used by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
If you want access to the names, help text and values for
the mmv performance metrics, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv <br>
# ./Install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the default mechanism
for sharing memory mapped values between instrumented
applications and the mmv PMDA involves the creation of a
world-writeable $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv <br>
directory with the sticky-bit set (similar to /tmp and
/var/tmp, for example). This suffices to allow any
application, running under any user account, to communicate
with the <br>
PMDA (which runs under the &quot;pcp&quot; account by
default). This may not be desirable for every environment,
and one should consider the security implications of any
directory setup <br>
like this (similar classes of issues exist as those that
affect the system temporary file directories).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The installation process will
not overwrite any existing $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory. Thus
it is possible to implement an alternate permissions
strategy with no world-writable <br>
directory for sharing files - any directory readable by user
or group &quot;pcp&quot; will suffice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to undo the
installation, do the following as root:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv <br>
# ./Remove</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmdammv is launched by pmcd(1)
and should never be executed directly. The Install and
Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH <br>
command line options used to launch pmdammv <br>
$PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv <br>
directory housing memory mapped value files <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv/help <br>
default help text file for the mmv metrics <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv/Install <br>
installation script for the pmdammv agent <br>
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv/Remove <br>
undo installation script for the pmdammv agent <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mmv.log <br>
default log file for error messages and other information
from pmdammv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
