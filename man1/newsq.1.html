<p>newsq(1) Leafnode user&rsquo;s manual newsq(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
newsq - view the leafnode news queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
newsq [-f]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
newsq outputs a summary of news that is in leafnode&rsquo;s
out.going queue (or failed.postings directory, with -f). The
out.going queue contains news that has been posted locally
on <br>
your site and has not yet been uploaded to the upstream news
server. The failed.postings directory contains news articles
that have been rejected by upstream servers -- these <br>
will not be retried automatically. You can hoewver move them
to the out.going queue manually -- with the mv(1) command --
to have fetchnews retry them the next time. This is
use&acirc; <br>
ful if the posting failed because the upstream server had
temporary difficulties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The queue is printed in the
order it is read from the disk. The output is not explicitly
sorted. (This matches GNU &quot;ls -U&quot; behaviour.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f print the contents of the failed.postings directory
instead. This option was introduced with leafnode
v1.9.20.</p>
