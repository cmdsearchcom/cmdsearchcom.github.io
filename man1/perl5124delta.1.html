perl5124delta - what is new for perl v5.12.4
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.3 release and the 5.12.4
  release.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.2, first read
  perl5123delta, which describes differences between 5.12.2 and 5.12.3. The
  major changes made in 5.12.0 are described in perl5120delta.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.3. If any exist, they
  are bugs and reports are welcome.

  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
When strict &quot;refs&quot; mode is off, &quot;%{...}&quot; in rvalue context
  returns &quot;undef&quot; if its argument is undefined. An optimisation
  introduced in Perl 5.12.0 to make &quot;keys %{...}&quot; faster when used as
  a boolean did not take this into account, causing &quot;keys %{+undef}&quot;
  (and &quot;keys %$foo&quot; when $foo is undefined) to be an error, which it
  should be so in strict mode only [perl #81750].
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;lc&quot;, &quot;uc&quot;, &quot;lcfirst&quot;, and &quot;ucfirst&quot; no
  longer return untainted strings when the argument is tainted. This has been
  broken since perl 5.8.9 [perl #87336].
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read from
  when parsing a here document.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Modules_and_Pragmata"><a class="selflink" href="#Modules_and_Pragmata">Modules

Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.43 to 2.50.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Testing"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing">Testing</a></h1>
The <i>cpan/CGI/t/http.t</i> test script has been fixed to work when the
  environment has HTTPS_* environment variables, such as HTTPS_PROXY.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Documentation"><a class="selflink" href="#Documentation">Documentation</a></h1>
Updated the documentation for <i>rand()</i> in perlfunc to note that it is not
  cryptographically secure.

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program
  included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
  sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of &quot;perl
  -V&quot;, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
  porting team.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
  inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
  to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
  unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
  to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
  co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
  platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
  security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
  CPAN.
