<p>PERL5124DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5124DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5124delta - what is new for perl v5.12.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.3
release and the 5.12.4 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.12.2, first read perl5123delta,
which describes differences between 5.12.2 and 5.12.3. The
major changes made in 5.12.0 are <br>
described in perl5120delta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.3.
If any exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
When strict &quot;refs&quot; mode is off, &quot;%{...}&quot;
in rvalue context returns &quot;undef&quot; if its argument
is undefined. An optimisation introduced in Perl 5.12.0 to
make &quot;keys %{...}&quot; faster <br>
when used as a boolean did not take this into account,
causing &quot;keys %{+undef}&quot; (and &quot;keys
%$foo&quot; when $foo is undefined) to be an error, which it
should be so in strict mode <br>
only [perl #81750].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;lc&quot;, &quot;uc&quot;,
&quot;lcfirst&quot;, and &quot;ucfirst&quot; no longer
return untainted strings when the argument is tainted. This
has been broken since perl 5.8.9 [perl #87336].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fixed a case where it was
possible that a freed buffer may have been read from when
parsing a here document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.43 to
2.50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
The cpan/CGI/t/http.t test script has been fixed to work
when the environment has HTTPS_* environment variables, such
as HTTPS_PROXY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Updated the documentation for rand() in perlfunc to note
that it is not cryptographically secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Notes <br>
Linux <br>
Support Ubuntu 11.04&rsquo;s new multi-arch library
layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.12.4 represents approximately 5 months of development
since Perl 5.12.3 and contains approximately 200 lines of
changes across 11 files from 8 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.12.4:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Andy Dougherty, David Golden,
David Leadbeater, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz,
Jesse Vincent, Leon Brocard, Zsban Ambrus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who be able to help assess the impact of
<br>
issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this
<br>
address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
