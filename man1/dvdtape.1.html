<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dvdtape - Write a DLT tape for manufacturing a Digital
Versatile Disc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dvdtape --inputfile=file [options]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dvdtape should be used to write directly to a Digital Linear
Tape to send to a DVD factory for manufacturing. It writes
all of the extra data that the factory needs in just the
<br>
format that is expected. This includes ANSI tape headers,
DDP information, DDPMS information, &quot;lead in&quot;, and
the DVD data itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--combined-length=length <br>
When producing the first layer of a two layer opposite
spiral track DVD, the dvdtape needs to know the combined
length of both layers to record the length of the second
<br>
layer in the leadin area of the first layer (opposite track
DVD&rsquo;s only have one leadin area for both tracks). This
parameter provides a way to specify that value. If <br>
this value is not specified and is needed, it is inferred
from the image contents, based on the assumption that the
data being written is a &quot;fat&quot; ISO-9660 file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--controlfile=file <br>
The file from which the DVD leadin data should be read. The
DVD leadin data is normally 32,768 bytes of data that
contains information about the physical layout of the <br>
DVD-ROM, such as the number of layers, number of sides, and
so on. This information does not appear as data sectors to
programs reading the DVD-ROM, but is used inter&acirc; <br>
nally by the DVD-ROM drive. If this parameter is not
specified, dvdtape will attempt to create its own leadin
data by a possibly incorrect algorithm written from
experi&acirc; <br>
ments on a proprietary program that creates leadin data.
Note also that leadin deliberately omitted for the second
layer of an oppositely oriented dvd track.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diameter=8cm or
--diameter=12cm <br>
The physical diameter of the disc being made. 12 centimeters
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--inputfile=file <br>
The file from which the DVD contents should be read. This
file usually contains an ISO-9660 or UDF file system. This
parameter is mandatory. It has no default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--layer=0 or --layer=1 <br>
The layer number being written. The 4.7 gigabyte first layer
is layer 0. The optional 3.7 gigabyte second layer is layer
1. Note that you must create a separate physi&acirc; <br>
cal tape for each layer. (DLT tapes have enough space to
hold both layers, but the standard specifies two tapes.) The
default is layer=0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--layers=1 or --layers=2 <br>
The total number of layers that the finished disc will
comprise. The tape itself only contains information about
one layer, but the total number of layers is stored in <br>
the header information on each tape. The default behavior is
to guess the number of layers by assuming that the image is
a &quot;fat&quot; ISO-9660 file system, determining the <br>
file system size, and setting layers=1 if the image will fit
on one layer, and layers=2 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--length=NNNNNNNN <br>
The number of bytes to write for this layer of the DVD file
system. This data will be padded with nulls to make its size
a multiple of 32768 (the required block size for <br>
the image section of the tape). If length is not specified,
the default is to read the length, based on the assumption
that the data is a &quot;fat&quot; ISO-9660 file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--master-id=string <br>
Set the master ID to the specified string, which can be up
to 48 characters in length. This string is a field in the
tape header information, which sometimes displayed on <br>
the operator&rsquo;s console when the disc is being made. It
is useful for identifying tapes at the factor, and
apparently has no other purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--offset=NNNNNNNN <br>
Skip this many bytes before starting to read the DVD image.
This is usually used for continuing a file system image on a
second layer. The default offset is 0 if layer=0 <br>
and 4699979776 (the size of layer 0) if layer=1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--outputfile=tape_device <br>
Write the output to tape_device. You can write the output to
a plain file, but the size of the tape blocks are 128 bytes
in some sections and 32768 bytes in others, so <br>
you cannot write a proper tape later by simplying copying
that file to a tape device. The default is /dev/st0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--owner=string <br>
Fill in the &quot;owner&quot; field in the tape. This option
appears to be useful only if you want some specific
information to appear before the operator who is running the
disc <br>
manufacturing equipment. The default is an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--readout-speed=2 or
--readout-speed=5 or --readout-speed=10 <br>
The leadin data contains a parameter that specifies a
minimum required readout speed for the DVD-ROM. It can be
2.52, 5.04 or 10.08 megabits per second, which you can <br>
select by setting this argument to 2, 5, or 10,
respectively. The default is 2.52 megabits per second. As
far as this author can tell, there does not appear to be a
way <br>
in the leadin format to specify no minimum readout speed.
This argument is only used when dvdtape generates its own
leadin data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--side=0 or --side=1 <br>
The side number being written. The first side is side 0.
Note that you must create a separate physical tape for each
side. (DLT tapes have enough space to hold both <br>
sides, but the standard is two tapes.) The default value is
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sides=1 or --sides=2 <br>
The total number of sides that the finished disc will
comprise. The tape itself only contains information about
one side, but the total number of sides is stored in the
<br>
header information on each tape. The default value is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--track-path=directionfR <br>
The direction of translation of the second layer in the DVD.
This argument should have no effect for a single layer DVD,
although it does fill in the corresponding field <br>
in the DVD header information. For the standard parallel
layer arrangement, direction can be specified by the
synonyms &quot;opposite&quot;, &quot;out&quot; or
&quot;outward&quot;. For opposite track <br>
arrangment, direction can be &quot;parallel&quot;,
&quot;in&quot; or &quot;inward&quot;. The default is
parallel if there is only one layer and opposite if there
are two layers. The legality of oppo&acirc; <br>
site orientation and only one layer is unclear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--usertext=string <br>
Fill in the &quot;user text&quot; field in the tape. This
option appears to be useful only if you want some specific
information to appear before the operator who is running the
<br>
disc manufacturing equipment. The default value is an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
dvdtape --inputfile=mydvd.iso-image <br>
Writes layer 0 to the tape on /dev/st0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvdtape
--inputfile=mydvd.iso-image --side=1 <br>
Writes layer 1 to the tape on /dev/st0. You only need to do
this for an image that is too large to fit on one layer.</p>
