dvdtape should be used to write directly to a Digital Linear Tape to send to a
  DVD factory for manufacturing. It writes all of the extra data that the
  factory needs in just the format that is expected. This includes ANSI tape
  headers, DDP information, DDPMS information, &quot;lead in&quot;, and the DVD
  data itself.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--combined-length=length</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">When producing the first layer of a two layer opposite
      spiral track DVD, the dvdtape needs to know the combined length of both
      layers to record the length of the second layer in the leadin area of the
      first layer (opposite track DVD's only have one leadin area for both
      tracks). This parameter provides a way to specify that value. If this
      value is not specified and is needed, it is inferred from the image
      contents, based on the assumption that the data being written is a
      &quot;fat&quot; ISO-9660 file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--controlfile=file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file from which the DVD leadin data should be read. The
      DVD leadin data is normally 32,768 bytes of data that contains information
      about the physical layout of the DVD-ROM, such as the number of layers,
      number of sides, and so on. This information does not appear as data
      sectors to programs reading the DVD-ROM, but is used internally by the
      DVD-ROM drive. If this parameter is not specified, dvdtape will attempt to
      create its own leadin data by a possibly incorrect algorithm written from
      experiments on a proprietary program that creates leadin data. Note also
      that leadin deliberately omitted for the second layer of an oppositely
      oriented dvd track.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--diameter=8cm or --diameter=12cm</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The physical diameter of the disc being made. 12
      centimeters is the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--inputfile=file</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file from which the DVD contents should be read. This
      file usually contains an ISO-9660 or UDF file system. This parameter is
      mandatory. It has no default value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--layer=0 or --layer=1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The layer number being written. The 4.7 gigabyte first
      layer is layer 0. The optional 3.7 gigabyte second layer is layer 1. Note
      that you must create a separate physical tape for each layer. (DLT tapes
      have enough space to hold both layers, but the standard specifies two
      tapes.) The default is layer=0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--layers=1 or --layers=2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The total number of layers that the finished disc will
      comprise. The tape itself only contains information about one layer, but
      the total number of layers is stored in the header information on each
      tape. The default behavior is to guess the number of layers by assuming
      that the image is a &quot;fat&quot; ISO-9660 file system, determining the
      file system size, and setting layers=1 if the image will fit on one layer,
      and layers=2 otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--length=NNNNNNNN</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of bytes to write for this layer of the DVD file
      system. This data will be padded with nulls to make its size a multiple of
      32768 (the required block size for the image section of the tape). If
      length is not specified, the default is to read the length, based on the
      assumption that the data is a &quot;fat&quot; ISO-9660 file system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--master-id=string</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set the master ID to the specified string, which can be up
      to 48 characters in length. This string is a field in the tape header
      information, which sometimes displayed on the operator's console when the
      disc is being made. It is useful for identifying tapes at the factor, and
      apparently has no other purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--offset=NNNNNNNN</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Skip this many bytes before starting to read the DVD image.
      This is usually used for continuing a file system image on a second layer.
      The default offset is 0 if layer=0 and 4699979776 (the size of layer 0) if
      layer=1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--outputfile=tape_device</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Write the output to tape_device. You can write the output
      to a plain file, but the size of the tape blocks are 128 bytes in some
      sections and 32768 bytes in others, so you cannot write a proper tape
      later by simplying copying that file to a tape device. The default is
      /dev/st0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--owner=string</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Fill in the &quot;owner&quot; field in the tape. This
      option appears to be useful only if you want some specific information to
      appear before the operator who is running the disc manufacturing
      equipment. The default is an empty string.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--readout-speed=2 or --readout-speed=5 or
    --readout-speed=10</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The leadin data contains a parameter that specifies a
      minimum required readout speed for the DVD-ROM. It can be 2.52, 5.04 or
      10.08 megabits per second, which you can select by setting this argument
      to 2, 5, or 10, respectively. The default is 2.52 megabits per second. As
      far as this author can tell, there does not appear to be a way in the
      leadin format to specify no minimum readout speed. This argument is only
      used when dvdtape generates its own leadin data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--side=0 or --side=1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The side number being written. The first side is side 0.
      Note that you must create a separate physical tape for each side. (DLT
      tapes have enough space to hold both sides, but the standard is two
      tapes.) The default value is 0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--sides=1 or --sides=2</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The total number of sides that the finished disc will
      comprise. The tape itself only contains information about one side, but
      the total number of sides is stored in the header information on each
      tape. The default value is 1.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--track-path=directionfR</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The direction of translation of the second layer in the
      DVD. This argument should have no effect for a single layer DVD, although
      it does fill in the corresponding field in the DVD header information. For
      the standard parallel layer arrangement, direction can be specified by the
      synonyms &quot;opposite&quot;, &quot;out&quot; or &quot;outward&quot;. For
      opposite track arrangment, direction can be &quot;parallel&quot;,
      &quot;in&quot; or &quot;inward&quot;. The default is parallel if there is
      only one layer and opposite if there are two layers. The legality of
      opposite orientation and only one layer is unclear.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--usertext=string</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Fill in the &quot;user text&quot; field in the tape. This
      option appears to be useful only if you want some specific information to
      appear before the operator who is running the disc manufacturing
