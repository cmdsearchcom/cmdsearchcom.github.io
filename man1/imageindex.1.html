imageindex - a digital photo gallery tool
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
Imageindex is a digital picture gallery program. It provides automatic
  generation of thumbnails and other size views of the images and video files,
  and W3C compliant HTML to allow viewing of the thumbnails and images or
  videos. It also creates montages of all images in a given directory to be used
  in directory entries within the HTML.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Imageindex has evolved from a simple thumbnail-generation program into a
  full-blown gallery application. With it you can create static thumbnails and
  &quot;medium&quot; views (good for dial-up web viewers) along with static HTML
  which presents the images in chronological order (based upon the date in the
  Exif header or date stamp of the file itself). Support has now been added for
  animated GIFs and video files (we support whatever file formats your
  installation of mplayer supports).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Imageindex creates static rather than dynamic content for many reasons. First
  and foremost it is much easier to archive pictures onto CD-ROMs on a periodic
  basis when the content is just &quot;there&quot; rather than
  &quot;trapped&quot; in a database of some sort. You create your own
  &quot;database&quot; with your own directories and let imageindex handle the
  presentation of the images to the world. Imageindex will use
  &quot;montages&quot; (or thumbnails of all your thumbnails crammed together)
  of subdirectories if they occur alongside images (see the the sample pages on
  the imageindex website - http://www.edwinh.org/imageindex/sample.html).
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are four basic &quot;views&quot; that imageindex creates (enabled by
  default). The &quot;index&quot; view shows thumbnails of all images in a
  directory in a basic table format (defaults to 3 columns). Within each cell of
  the table basic information such as the date/time of the picture are given as
  well as any comment (or caption) present in the image. Links to the various
  sizes of image and other views for the image are also presented by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second view presented is the &quot;slide show&quot; view. In this view the
  &quot;medium&quot; sized image is presented along with information such as
  date/time, any caption embedded in the image, etc. Currently for video files,
  the 'medium' slides only point to the actual video file processed. Future
  versions will allow for direct playback inside the browser (much like
  YouTube). There are &quot;previous&quot; and &quot;next&quot; links on each
  page which let the viewer quickly cycle through each &quot;medium&quot; image
  without having to constantly invoke the browser's &quot;back&quot; button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Captions for video files can be created by creating a file with the same
  basename as the original video file but having &quot;.txt&quot; as the
  extension. The contents of this file will be used just like captions embedded
  in formats like JPG when processing the resultant HTML.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In conjunction with the &quot;slide show&quot; view there is a &quot;frame
  view&quot;. When enabled a link to the frame view appears at the top of the
  index view's page. When the frame view is visited, the browser's pane splits
  into two portions. On the left all the thumbnails are lined up close together.
  On the right hand portion the same &quot;slide show&quot; pages are loaded. As
  the user clicks on a thumbnail on the left, it's &quot;slide&quot; view
  (including the &quot;medium&quot; image) is displayed in the right had side of
  the frame. This creates a very convenient mechanism for browsing through many
  images.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally a &quot;details&quot; view exists. This details view is much like the
  index view as the thumbnails (reduced in size further) are presented in a
  table format, but much more information is presented in each cell. This is
  very useful for images that come from digital cameras where Exif headers have
  filled with lots of neat information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The HTML output of imageindex can be customized by creating a
  &quot;.imageindexrc&quot; in your $HOME directory and placing certain
  variables (see VARIABLES section) in that file and editing to your taste. One
  of the variables controls the output of a cascading style sheet which
  ultimately directs your browser how to render the HTML. All color, font,
  indenting, etc. changes you wish to make can be done in this style sheet
  variable.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#VARIABLES">VARIABLES</a></h1>
When you create your &quot;.imageindexrc&quot; file in your $HOME directory, you
  can put any or all of the following variables in there and tweak as needed.
  This is Perl code itself and is subsequently &quot;included&quot; into
  imageindex as it runs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You <b>must</b> end the file by putting a &quot;1;&quot; at the end of it. It's
  a Perl thing!
<div class="Pp"></div>
The values you see in these examples are the program defaults. If you like the
  default value of a particular variable you don't need to include it in your
  &quot;.imageindexrc&quot; file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Name of the directory that holds thumbnail images
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $thumbnail_dir = 'thumbnail';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Size of the thumbnail images in the &quot;x&quot; direction (pixels). Note that
  imageindex preserves the aspect ratio of an image when it is reduced from its
  original size to form a thumbnail image. So, if the &quot;x&quot; dimension is
  smaller than the &quot;y&quot; dimension, a thumbnail might have an
  &quot;x&quot; size smaller than $default_thumbnail_x.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $default_thumbnail_x = 200;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Size of the thumbnail images in the &quot;y&quot; direction (pixels). Again,
  note that imageindex preserves the aspect ratio of an image when it is reduced
  from its original size to form a thumbnail image. So, if the &quot;y&quot;
  dimension is smaller than the &quot;x&quot; dimension, a thumbnail might have
  an &quot;y&quot; size smaller than $default_thumbnail_y.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $default_thumbnail_y = 200;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If both dimensions of the original are within this much of the thumbnail
  dimensions we will skip the thumbnail and just use the original as the
  &quot;thumbnail.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $thumbnail_threshold = 1.0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Size of the &quot;medium&quot; images in the &quot;x&quot; direction (pixels).
  Note that imageindex preserves the aspect ratio of an image when it is reduced
  from its original size to form a &quot;medium&quot; image. So, if the
  &quot;x&quot; dimension is smaller than the &quot;y&quot; dimension, a
  &quot;medium&quot; image might have an &quot;x&quot; size smaller than $med_x.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $med_x = 800;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Size of the &quot;medium&quot; images in the &quot;y&quot; direction (pixels).
  Note that imageindex preserves the aspect ratio of an image when it is reduced
  from its original size to form a &quot;medium&quot; image. So, if the
  &quot;y&quot; dimension is smaller than the &quot;x&quot; dimension, a
  &quot;medium&quot; image might have an &quot;y&quot; size smaller than $med_y.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $med_y = 600;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Name of the directory that holds &quot;medium&quot; images
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $med_dir = 'medium';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If both dimensions of the original are within this much of the
  &quot;medium&quot; dimensions we will skip creating the medium-size format and
  just use the original. This saves needless creating a &quot;medium&quot; image
  if it's close in size to the original already.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $med_threshold = 1.6;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Automatically recurse into subdirectories? Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_recurse = 0;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generate &quot;medium&quot; images at all? Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_medium = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generate the &quot;slide show&quot; and frame view? Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_slide = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generate the &quot;details&quot; view? Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_captions = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use/display caption info stored in images? Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_detail = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Process subdirectories as entries in the normal &quot;index&quot; and
  &quot;details&quot; views? Set to 1 to enable. If an entire directory
  hierarchy has been processed with $do_montage set to 1 (see below), the
  montage file for a given directory will be used as the &quot;thumbnail&quot;
  for a subdirectory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_dirs = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Create a montage of all the images? When enabled all of the images that are
  processed are turned into an NxM montage of very small thumbnails in a tiled
  pattern. The resulting image is shrunk to the $default_thumbnail_x x
  $default_thumbnail_y dimensions and stored in the $thumbnail_dir directory.
  The size of the tiles grows as the number of images in a directory increase,
  but can be bounded by variables outlined below. Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_montage = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Map ASCII &quot;smiley&quot; patterns embedded within an image's comment into
  real &quot;emoticon&quot; images? When enabled the ASCII smiley faces such as
  :) and :-), the winks ;) and ;-), and the frowns :( and :-( are mapped to
  small PNG images that display the emotion conveyed. Set to 1 to enable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_emoticons = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sort timestamps in reverse order.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_reverse = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Process video files. This relies on a fairly recent version of mplayer being
  installed on your system. We've tested with up to 0.99.8. The kind of video
  files that are supported are up to the codecs that are compiled and used with
  mplayer installation on your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_video_files = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Overlay a small icon into one of the corners of the thumbnail and medium views
  when processing the first frame of a video file. This gives a &quot;visual
  cue&quot; that the file being represented in your browser is a video file and
  not a still image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $do_video_thumbnail_icons = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the following as a regular expression to identify video files by their
  extension. For certain technical reasons it was more feasible to rely upon
  this quick and effective method. If files from your camera (or whatever) end
  in a different extension, just put that extension here too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $video_regexp = '(avi|mov|mpg|mpeg|mjpeg|m1v|m2v|wmv|fli|nuv|vob|ogm|vcd|svcd|mp4|qt)';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you enable the &quot;visual cue&quot; icons for video files mentioned above,
  the following variable determines which corner it is placed. Acceptable values
  are: SouthWest, NorthWest, NorthEast, SouthEast (case sensitive!).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $video_icon_gravity = 'SouthWest';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you enable the &quot;visual cue&quot; icons for video files mentioned above,
  there are two to pick from (currently). Set to 1 (default) for a yellow dot
  with a 'play' arrow. Set to 2 for a purplish icon of a video camera. More of
  these will be created in further releases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $video_icon = 1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following three variables control what hyperlinks in the HTML output
  &quot;point&quot; to. They can be set to the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 index : points to the name reference for an image in the index view
 fullsize : points to the actual image itself
 medium : points to the &quot;medium&quot; version of an image
 thumbnail : points to the thumbnail version of an image
 slide : points to the &quot;slide show&quot; HTML page written for an image
 details : points to the name reference for an image in the details
           view
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The folling variable controls what the hyperlink for the thumbnail image in the
  index view points to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $index_linkto = 'slide';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The folling variable controls what the hyperlink for the thumbnail image in the
  details view points to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $details_linkto = 'index';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The folling variable controls what the hyperlink for the &quot;medium&quot;
  image in the slide view points to:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $slide_linkto = 'fullsize';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Default number of columns to use in the index and detail views
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $default_columns = 3;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Set the orientation of slide frame - 'horizontal' or 'vertical'. When 'vertical'
  the browser pane will split vertically with all the thumbnails towards the
  left. When 'horizontal' the browser pane splits horizontally with the
  thumbnails arranged in the upper portion
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $frame_orient = 'vertical';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following two variables can be set to any of the following three values:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  top : put the item in question at the top of the page when rendered
  bottom : put the item in question at the bottom of the page when
           rendered
  none : omit the item from the HTML output
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Controls if an image caption (or comment) embedded in the image will be
  retrieved and written into the HTML output. By default it is written above the
  &quot;medium&quot; image presented in the &quot;slide&quot; view.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $slide_caption = 'top';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Controls if the date/time of an image is written into the HTML output. By
  default it is written below the &quot;medium&quot; image presented in the
  &quot;slide&quot; view.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $slide_date = 'bottom';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the &quot;detail&quot; view, the thumbnail images are shrunk to a size
  smaller than the normal thumbnails (to conserve valueable space). This sets
  the number of times they are shrunk. By default it is shrunk by a factor of 2.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $detailshrink = 2;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The thumbnail and &quot;medium&quot; images are written out as JPEG files (even
  if the original images were not JPEG's). The following two variables control
  the &quot;quality&quot; for generated images. The value can range from 0 to
  100 where 100 means &quot;don't lose any quality in favor of file size.&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adjust the quality of the thumbnails being written out
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $thumb_quality = 50;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adjust the quality of the &quot;medium&quot; images written out
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $med_quality = 80;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adjust the minimum number of tiles that will be found in a montage image. If the
  number of images in a directory is lower than this value, images will either
  be repeated or blanks will be inserted (see $montage_fill).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $montage_min = 4;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adjust the maximum number of tiles that will be found in a montage. If the
  number of images in a directory is higher than this number, the montage will
  be made by &quot;evenly picking&quot; $montage_max images in the directory and
  only using those.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $montage_max = 36;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Adjust the space between montage images (pixels).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $montage_whitespace = 2;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When there is not a &quot;even&quot; number of images in a directory and a
  complete NxM tile montage cannot be formed, images can be used again or empty
  space can be used. Set to 'repeat' to re-use images and 'blank' to use empty
  space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $montage_fill = 'blank';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following variable controls all aspects of how the HTML output is rendered
  in standards compliant browsers. The contents of this variable will be written
  out into a cascading style sheet and the properties found within it will
  govern how the HTML is rendered. All color, font, size, alignment, etc.
  property changes can take place. This might require some knowledge of
  cascading style sheets. A good primer can be found here:
<div class="Pp"></div>

Adjust what is presented in &quot;empty&quot; table cells when there are not an
  &quot;even&quot; number of images in a directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $emptycell = &quot;&lt;I&gt;empty&lt;/I&gt;&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the text of a hyperlink to a parent directory. If you do not desire that
  this link be present in the index and &quot;details&quot; views
  &quot;undef&quot; the variable (undef $updirtext;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $updirtext = &quot;up one directory&quot;;

  &quot;undef&quot; the variable (undef $framelinktext;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $framelinktext = &quot;slideshow view (frames)&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the text of a hyperlink to the detail view. If you do not desire that

<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $detaillinktext = &quot;details index&quot;;

  $indexlinktext;)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $indexlinktext = &quot;main index&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the default TITLE string written out in the HTML for a given directory.
  This is most usually given on a per-directory basis via the command line and
  &quot;remembered&quot; within META data inside the index HTML file itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
     $default_titletext  = &quot;Image directory&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following five variables control the TITLE attribute on anchor constructs in
  the index and frame views. When TITLE attributes are given they are usually
  rendered as &quot;tooltip&quot; bubbles that show text when a cursor hovers
  and stops over the active link. We use them here to give a visual cue about
  the image. These variables work much like <i>printf</i>(1) strings. The values
  that can be interpolated for a given image are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 %f =&gt; replaced with the filename of the image
 %d =&gt; replaced with the date/time of the image (or mtime of the file)
 %s =&gt; replaced with the size of the file (in Kb)
 %r =&gt; replaced with the resolution (XxY) of the original image
 %c =&gt; replaced with the image's caption (if stored with one)
 %% =&gt; replaced with a literal '%' character
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following codes are interpolated when directories are processed and a
  montage of that directory is used as the thumbnail of the subdirectory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 %n =&gt; replaced with number of images in a directory
 %b =&gt; replaced with the &quot;begin&quot; date from a directory of images
 %e =&gt; replaced with the &quot;end&quot; date from a directory of images
 %t =&gt; replaced with the &quot;title&quot; from a directory of images
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other characters (including spaces) are literal. &quot;undef&quot; these in your
  &quot;.imageindexrc&quot; file if you don't want the TITLE attributes to be
  written into the HTML. The &quot;date/time&quot; related constructs are
  interpolated using the date/time format variables defined below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the TITLE attributes for hyperlinks to thumbnail images within the frame
  view. The default is &quot;&lt;filename&gt; - &lt;date&gt;&quot; for an image
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $framethumbtitle  = &quot;%f - %d&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the TITLE attributes for hyperlinks to thumbnail images within the index
  view. The default is &quot;&lt;filename&gt; (&lt;size&gt;)&quot; for an image
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $indexthumbtitle  = &quot;%f (%s)&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the TITLE attributes for hyperlinks to thumbnail images within the slide
  view. The default is &quot;&lt;filename&gt; (&lt;size&gt;)&quot; for an image
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $slidethumbtitle  = &quot;%f (%s)&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the TITLE attributes for hyperlinks to thumbnail images within the
  detail view. The default is caption (or comment) of an image if one was
  embedded within it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $detailthumbtitle = &quot;%c&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control the TITLE attributes for hyperlinks to montage images within the index
  view when a subdirectory is being presented. The default is to show how many
  images the subdirectory had and the date range that is spanned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $montagetitle = &quot;%n images %b through %e&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Control which charset the generated html pages should have. This defaults to
  UTF-8, but can either be ISO-8859-1 or any other encoding:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    $file_charset = &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;;

The following eight variables control how dates and times are formatted when
  written into the HTML. Again we're using <i>printf</i>(1)-like variables where
  codes are interpolated according to a user's taste.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The definitions of the escape sequences come from the POSIX <i>strftime</i>(3)
  definitions. NOT ALL of <i>strftime</i>(3) are supported for obvious reasons.
<div class="Pp"></div>

As an example, suppose you just want to change some date/time format strings. A
  complete &quot;.imageindexrc&quot; file in this case would be:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $framedateformat = &quot;%F&quot;;
  $frametimeformat = &quot;%R&quot;;
  $indexdateformat = &quot;%F&quot;;
  $indextimeformat = &quot;%R&quot;;
  $slidedateformat = &quot;%F&quot;;
  $slidetimeformat = &quot;%R&quot;; 
  $detaildateformat = &quot;%m/%y&quot;;
  1; # don't for get this as the last line in the file!

We would like to thank Larry Wall, creator of Perl for his &quot;swiss army
  chainsaw&quot; of a scripting language (as well as all those who have hacked
  on Perl throughout the years). We would also like to thank all who have
  contributed to ImageMagick and its companion module PerlMagick. Without
  PerlMagick this software would be exceedingly less robust. Additionally we
  would like to thank the creators of mplayer (and all contributors). Without
  mplayer the support introduced for video files would never have come about.
