<p>GLIMPSESERVER(1) General Commands Manual
GLIMPSESERVER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
glimpseserver - a server version of the glimpse searching
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
Glimpse is an indexing and query system that allows you to
search through all your files very quickly. The use of
glimpse in servers that handle frequent queries is growing,
<br>
which is why we wrote glimpseserver to make searches more
efficient. Glimpseserver starts a process that listens to
queries, runs glimpse, and sends the answers back. The main
<br>
advantage is that the index is read only once into memory
saving a lot of IO. Glimpse communicates with glimpseserver
through a given port number. See the warning about
secu&acirc; <br>
rity below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
glimpseserver [ -H dir -K port -J host. ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
-H dir specifies the directory of the index. Similar to the
-H option of glimpse. The default directory is the value of
the environment variable $HOME if that is set, otherwise
<br>
it is the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K port <br>
this is the TCP port for communication: glimpseserver waits
for requests on this port and clients that want to search
using the index in specified by the -H option must <br>
use this port (by calling glimpse -K). The defaults port
number is 2001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J host <br>
the name of the host. The default is the host where
glimpseserver is running, which is probably the only
possibility anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTARTING <br>
If a new index is created by running glimpseindex every
night, restarting a new glimpseserver is now easier: simply
send a SIGUSR2 (signal #31 - i.e., &quot;kill -31 pid&quot;)
to <br>
glimpseserver; it then re-reads the NEW index and is ready
to serve requests again. (A SIGHUP, i.e., signal #1, can
also be sent instead of SIGUSR2 to make the glimpseserver
re- <br>
read the new index.) The recommended way to do a fresh
indexing while the server is still running is: <br>
send SIGSTOP to glimpseserver <br>
do the indexing <br>
send SIGUSR2 to glimpseserver <br>
send SIGCONT to glimpseserver (to ask it to continue after
stop) <br>
The SIGSTOP is required so that glimpseserver doesn&rsquo;t
answer any queries while the indexing is going on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING <br>
Glimpseserver should be used only for public servers. Any
client that knows the port number can get any information
available in the index (and port numbers are not that <br>
secret). When glimpse is run as a standalone application it
requires read permission of the index and all the files.
When glimpse uses the -C option to communicate with <br>
glimpseserver, glimpse (the client) does not require any
permission, because glimpseserver does all the searching.
So, we recommend not to run glimpseserver on any data that
<br>
should be protected. Glimpseserver is meant to be used for
public data.</p>
