<p>EPYDOCGUI(1) General Commands Manual EPYDOCGUI(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
epydocgui - graphical interface to epydoc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
epydocgui [project.prj | modules...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epydoc -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epydoc -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
epydocgui is a graphical interface to epydoc, which
generates API documentation for Python modules and packages,
based on their docstrings. A lightweight markup language
called <br>
epytext can be used to format docstrings, and to add
information about specific fields, such as parameters and
instance variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The API documentation produced
by epydocgui consists of a set of HTML files. Two
subdirectories are created for the public and private
documentation. Within each subdirecto&acirc; <br>
ries, every class and module is documented in its own file.
An index file, a trees file, and a help file are also
created. If you select the frames option, then a
frames-based <br>
table of contents is also produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
project.prj <br>
The name of a project file that was saved with epydocgui.
Project files record a list of related modules, and the
options that should be used to generate the documenta&acirc;
<br>
tion for those modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modules... <br>
The list of the modules that should be documented. Modules
can be specified using module names (such as os.path),
filenames (such as epydoc/epytext.py), or directory <br>
names (such as epydoc/). Directory names specify packages,
and are expanded to include all sub-modules and
sub-packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help, --usage, -? <br>
Display a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the version of Epydoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML FILES <br>
The API documentation produced by epydoc consists of the
following files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">index.html <br>
The standard entry point for the documentation. Normally,
index.html is a frame index file, which defines three
frames: two frames on the left side of the browser <br>
contain a table of contents, and the main frame on the right
side of the window contains documentation pages. But if the
--no-frames option is used, then index.html <br>
will redirect the user to the project&rsquo;s top page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m-module.html <br>
The API documentation for a module. module is the complete
dotted name of the module, such as sys or
epydoc.epytext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c-class.html <br>
The API documentation for a class, exception, or type. class
is the complete dotted name of the class, such as
epydoc.epytext.Token or array.ArrayType.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trees.html <br>
The module and class hierarchies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indices.html <br>
The term and identifier indices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help.html <br>
The help page for the project. This page explains how to use
and navigate the webpage produced by epydoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toc.html <br>
The top-level table of contents page. This page is displayed
in the upper-left frame, and provides links to
toc-everything.html and the toc-m-module.html files. <br>
toc.html is not generated if the --no-frames option is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toc-everything.html <br>
The table of contents for the entire project. This page is
displayed in the lower-left frame, and provides links to
every class, type, exception, function, and vari&acirc; <br>
able defined by the project. toc-everything.html is not
generated if the --no-frames option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">toc-m-module.html <br>
The table of contents for a module. This page is displayed
in the lower-left frame, and provides links to every class,
type, exception, function, and variable defined <br>
by the module. module is the complete dotted name of the
module, such as sys or epydoc.epytext. toc-m-module.html is
not generated if the --no-frames option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epydoc.css <br>
The CSS stylesheet used to display all HTML pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, epydoc creates two
subdirectories in the output directory: public and private.
Each directory contains all of the files specified above.
But if the --no-private <br>
option is used, then no subdirectories are created, and the
public documentation is written directly to the output
directory. ivided into five categories: import errors;
epytext <br>
errors; epytext warnings; field warnings; and inspection
errors. Whenver epydoc encounters an error, it issues a
warning message that describes the error, and attempts to
con&acirc; <br>
tinue generating documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import errors indicate that
epydoc was unable to import a module. Import errors
typically prevent epydoc from generating documentation for
the module in question. Epydoc can <br>
generate the following import errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad module name module <br>
Epydoc attempted to import module, but module is not a valid
name for a Python module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could not find a UID for
link-target <br>
Epydoc was unable to find the object referred to by an
inline link construction (L{...}). This is usually caused by
a typo in the link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could not import module <br>
Epydoc attempted to import module, but it failed. This
typically occurs when module raises an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file does not exist <br>
Epydoc attempted to import the module contained in file, but
file does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Epytext errors are caused by
epytext docstrings that contain invalid markup. Whenever an
epytext error is detected, the docstring in question is
treated as a plaintext doc&acirc; <br>
string. Epydoc can generate the following epytext
errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad link target. <br>
The target specified for an inline link contruction (L{...})
is not well-formed. Link targets must be valid python
identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bad uri target. <br>
The target specified for an inline uri contruction (U{...})
is not well-formed. This typically occurs if inline markup
is nested inside the URI target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fields must be at the top level.
<br>
The list of fields (@param, etc.) is contained by some other
block structure (such as a list or a section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fields must be the final
elements. <br>
The list of fields (@param, etc.) is not at the end of a
docstring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Headings must occur at top
level. <br>
The heading is contianed in some other block structure (such
as a list).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improper doctest block
indentation. <br>
The doctest block dedents past the indentation of its
initial prompt line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improper heading indentation.
<br>
The heading for a section is not left-aligned with the
paragraphs in the section that contains it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Improper paragraph indentation.
<br>
The paragraphs within a block are not left-aligned. This
error is often generated when plaintext docstrings are
parsed using epytext.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invalid escape. <br>
An unknown escape sequence was used with the inline escape
construction (E{...}).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lists must be indented. <br>
An unindented line immediately following a paragraph starts
with a list bullet. Epydoc is not sure whether you meant to
start a new list item, or meant for a para&acirc; <br>
graph to include a word that looks like a bullet. If you
intended the former, then indent the list. If you intended
the latter, then change the word-wrapping of the <br>
paragraph, or escape the first character of the word that
looks like a bullet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbalanced &rsquo;{&rsquo;. <br>
The docstring contains unbalanced braces. Epytext requires
that all braces must be balanced. To include a single
unbalanced brace, use the escape sequences E{lb} <br>
(left brace) and E{rb} (right brace).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unbalanced &rsquo;}&rsquo;. <br>
The docstring contains unbalanced braces. Epytext requires
that all braces must be balanced. To include a single
unbalanced brace, use the escape sequences E{lb} <br>
(left brace) and E{rb} (right brace).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown inline markup tag. <br>
An unknown tag was used with the inline markup construction
( x{...} ).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wrong underline character for
heading. <br>
The underline character used for this section heading does
not indicate an appopriate section level. The &quot;=&quot;
character should be used to underline sections;
&quot;-&quot; for <br>
subsections; and &quot;~&quot; for subsubsections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Epytext warnings are caused by
epytext docstrings that contain questionable or suspicious
markup. Epytext warnings do not prevent the docstring in
question from being parsed. <br>
Epydoc can generate the following epytext warnings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible mal-formatted field
item. <br>
Epytext detected a line that looks like a field item, but is
not correctly formatted. This typically occurs when the
trailing colon (&quot;:&quot;) is not included in the field
<br>
tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possible heading typo. <br>
Epytext detected a pair of lines that looks like a heading,
but the number of underline characters does not match the
number of characters in the heading. The number <br>
of characters in these two lines must match exactly for them
to be considered a heading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Field warnings are caused by
epytext docstrings containing invalid fields. The contents
of the invalid field are generally ignored. Epydoc can
generate the following field <br>
warnings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@param for unknown parameter
param. <br>
A @param field was used to specify the type for a parameter
that is not included in the function&rsquo;s signature. This
is typically caused by a typo in the parameter <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag did not expect an argument.
<br>
The field tag tag was used with an argument, but it does not
take one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tag expected an argument. <br>
The field tag tag was used without an argument, but it
requires one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@type for unknown parameter
param. <br>
A @type field was used to specify the type for a parameter
that is not included in the function&rsquo;s signature. This
is typically caused by a typo in the parameter name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@type for unknown variable var.
<br>
A @type field was used to specify the type for a variable,
but no other information is known about the variable. This
is typically caused by a typo in the variable <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unknown field tag tag. <br>
A docstring contains a field with the unknown tag tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redefinition of field. <br>
Multiple field tags define the value of field in the same
docstring, but field can only take a single value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inspection errors are generated
if epydoc encounters problems while attempting to inspect
the properties of a documented object. Most of inspection
errors do not prevent epydoc <br>
from documenting the object in question. Epydoc can generate
the following inspection errors:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parameters of inhmethod do
not match basemethod. <br>
The parameters of the undocumented method inhmethod do not
match the parameters of the base class method basemethod
that it overrides. As a result, inhmethod does not <br>
inherit documentation from basemethod. If the difference in
parameters is intentional, then you can eliminate the
warning by adding a (possibly empty) docstring to <br>
inhmethod.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Docmap cannot add a type <br>
Epydoc attempted to document an object with an unknown type.
This error is typically generated by packages and modules
that manipulate the import mechanism, such that <br>
importing a module produces some other type of object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UID conflict detected: uid <br>
Two different objects were assigned the same unique
identifier by epydoc. This can cause epydoc to substitute
the documentation of one object with the documentation <br>
of another object that is assigned the same unique
identifier. However, this will usually only cause problems
if the two objects with the same unique identifiers are <br>
both modules or classes, in which case the API documentation
page for one object will overwrite the API documentation
page for the other object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object appears in multiple
builtin modules <br>
While attempting to determine which module defines the
builtin object object, epydoc encountered multiple
candidates, and was unable to decide which candidate was
cor&acirc; <br>
rect. In this case, epydoc arbitrarily chooses the first
candidate that it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object appears in multiple .py
modules <br>
While attempting to determine which module defines the
builtin object object, epydoc encountered multiple
candidates, and was unable to decide which candidate was
cor&acirc; <br>
rect. In this case, epydoc arbitrarily chooses the first
candidate that it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">object appears in multiple .so
modules <br>
While attempting to determine which module defines the
builtin object object, epydoc encountered multiple
candidates, and was unable to decide which candidate was
cor&acirc; <br>
rect. In this case, epydoc arbitrarily chooses the first
candidate that it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Could not find a module for
object <br>
Epydoc was unable to determine which module defines object.
If object is a function, then this will prevent epydoc from
generating any documentation for object, since <br>
it does not know what page to put the documentation on.
Otherwise, this will prevent the documentation for object
from including a link to its containing module.</p>
