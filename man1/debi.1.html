<p>DEBI(1) General Commands Manual DEBI(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
debi - install current version of generated Debian
package</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
debi [options] [changes file] [package ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
debi figures out the current version of a package and
installs it. If a .changes file is specified on the command
line, the filename must end with .changes, as this is how
the <br>
program distinguishes it from package names. If not, then
debi has to be called from within the source code directory
tree. In this case, it will look for the .changes file <br>
corresponding to the current package version (by determining
the name and version number from the changelog, and the
architecture in the same way as dpkg-buildpackage(1) does).
<br>
It then runs debpkg -i on every .deb archive listed in the
.changes file to install them, assuming that all of the .deb
archives live in the same directory as the .changes file.
<br>
Note that you probably don&rsquo;t want to run this program
on a .changes file relating to a different architecture
after cross-compiling the package!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a list of packages is given
on the command line, then only those debs with names in this
list of packages will be installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since installing a package
requires root privileges, debi calls debpkg rather than dpkg
directly. Thus debi will only be useful if it is either
being run as root or debpkg can <br>
be run as root. See debpkg(1) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory name checking <br>
In common with several other scripts in the devscripts
package, debi will climb the directory tree until it finds a
debian/changelog file. As a safeguard against stray files
<br>
causing potential problems, it will examine the name of the
parent directory once it finds the debian/changelog file,
and check that the directory name corresponds to the package
<br>
name. Precisely how it does this is controlled by two
configuration file variables DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
and DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX, and their corresponding
<br>
command-line options --check-dirname-level and
--check-dirname-regex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL
can take the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Never check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Only check the directory name
if we have had to change directory in our search for
debian/changelog. This is the default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Always check the directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The directory name is checked by
testing whether the current directory name (as determined by
pwd(1)) matches the regex given by the configuration file
option <br>
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX or by the command line option
--check-dirname-regex regex. Here regex is a Perl regex (see
perlre(3perl)), which will be anchored at the beginning <br>
and the end. If regex contains a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, then it
must match the full directory path. If not, then it must
match the full directory name. If regex contains the string
&Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE&rsquo;, <br>
this will be replaced by the source package name, as
determined from the changelog. The default value for the
regex is: &Acirc;&acute;PACKAGE(-.+)?&rsquo;, thus matching
directory names such as <br>
PACKAGE and PACKAGE-version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-adebian-architecture, -tGNU-system-type <br>
See dpkg-architecture(1) for a description of these options.
They affect the search for the .changes file. They are
provided to mimic the behaviour of dpkg-buildpackage <br>
when determining the name of the .changes file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debs-dir directory <br>
Look for the .changes and .deb files in directory instead of
the parent of the source directory. This should either be an
absolute path or relative to the top of the <br>
source directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --multi <br>
Search for a multiarch .changes file, as created by
dpkg-cross.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --upgrade <br>
Only upgrade packages already installed on the system,
rather than installing all packages listed in the .changes
file. Useful for multi-binary packages when you don&rsquo;t
<br>
want to have all the binaries installed at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-level N <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-dirname-regex regex <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--with-depends <br>
Attempt to satisfy the Depends of a package when installing
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tool tool <br>
Use the specified tool for installing the dependencies of
the package(s) to be installed. By default, apt-get is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help, --version <br>
Show help message and version information respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBRELEASE_DEBS_DIR <br>
This specifies the directory in which to look for the
.changes and .deb files, and is either an absolute path or
relative to the top of the source tree. This corresponds
<br>
to the --debs-dir command line option. This directive could
be used, for example, if you always use pbuilder or
svn-buildpackage to build your packages. Note that it <br>
also affects debrelease(1) in the same way, hence the
strange name of the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_LEVEL,
DEVSCRIPTS_CHECK_DIRNAME_REGEX <br>
See the above section Directory name checking for an
explanation of these variables. Note that these are
package-wide configuration variables, and will therefore
affect <br>
all devscripts scripts which check their value, as described
in their respective manpages and in devscripts.conf(5).</p>

debpkg(1), devscripts.conf(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
debi was originally written by Christoph Lameter
&lt;clameter@debian.org&gt;. The now-defunct script debit
was originally written by James R. Van Zandt
&lt;jrv@vanzandt.mv.com&gt;. They <br>
have been moulded into one script together with debc(1) and
parts extensively modified by Julian Gilbey
&lt;jdg@debian.org&gt;.</p>
