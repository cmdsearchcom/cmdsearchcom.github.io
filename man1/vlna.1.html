<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vlna - adds tilde after each non-syllabic preposition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
vlna [options] [filenames]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREFACE <br>
There exists a special Czech and Slovak typographical rule:
you cannot leave the non-syllabic preposition on the end of
one line and continue writting text on next line. For <br>
example, you cannot write down the text &quot;v lese&quot;
(in a forest) like &quot;v&lt;new-line&gt;lese&quot;. The
program vlna adds the asciitilde between such preposition
and the next word and removes <br>
the space(s) in this place. It means, the program converts
&quot;v lese&quot; to &quot;v~lese&quot;. You can use this
program as a preporcessor before TeXing. Moreower, you can
set another sequence <br>
to store instead asciitilte (see the -x option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program vlna processes one or more files, searches the
non-syllabic prepositions followed by space(s) in these
files and converts this/these space(s) to asciitilde for
each <br>
such occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the processed file, the
activity of the program can be blocked by %~- sequence and
the activity can be restored again by the %~+ sequence.
These sequences can include spaces, <br>
it means that % ~- is a correct sequence too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rule to recognize a
preposition follows: The arbitrary number of opening
parentheses can be written before the preposition and before
these (optional) parentheses must be the <br>
space, tabelator or new-line. The preposition itself is
one-letter word, the letters have to be from this set:
{KkSsVvZzOoUuAI}. See the -v option if you want to change
this set <br>
of letters. From version 1.2, the TeX sequence can be
written before preposition and before the brace. Example:
&quot;&lt;new-line&gt;([V lese&quot; is converted to
&quot;&lt;new-line&gt;([V~lese&quot;. <br>
Another example: &quot;v{V lese}&quot; is converted to
&quot;v{V~lese}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One or more blank-spaces have to
be included after preposition before next word. The
blank-space means space or tabelator. One &lt;new-line&gt;
can be here too. All these characters <br>
are removed and replaced by asciitilde (or by another
string, see -x option). If &lt;new-line&gt; is deleted,
another &lt;new-line&gt; is created before preposition (and
before optional <br>
parentheses) in order to the number of lines is kept
unchanged. Example: &quot;...
V&lt;new-line&gt;&lt;tabelator&gt;lese&quot; is converted to
&quot;...&lt;new-line&gt;V~lese&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program checks the
consintence of TeX&rsquo;s math environments (if -m option
isn&rsquo;t used). For example the &quot;$...$$...$&quot;
sequence (it means the display mode switch inside the text-
<br>
math mode) generates a warning. Empty line inside display
mode generates a warning too and the program processes next
text like in normal (non-math) mode. The existence of the
<br>
&quot;$&quot; inside display mode are accepted because the
constructions like $$..x{..$..$}..$$ are allowed and
common.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The consistence of verbatim mode
is checked on the end of the file. If the file ends but the
verbatim mode does not end the warning is printed. This
behavior can be switched <br>
off by -n or -w options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program suppresses the tilde
changing after letters like prepositions but they are not
prepositions because the TeX or eX sequence precedes.
Example: &quot;vlastnosti TeX u <br>
jsou&quot; is not converted to &quot;vlastnosti TeX
u~jsou&quot;, because this text is printed (after TeX
processing) like &quot;vlastnosti TeXu jsou&quot;. The
letter &quot;u&quot; is a suffix here, no <br>
preposition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The options are optional and can be written in arbitrarty
order separated by space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Filter. The [filenames] are
treated as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlna -f filename1 filename2 <br>
Input is filename1, output is filename2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlna -f filename1 <br>
Input is filename1, output is stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlna -f <br>
Input is stdin, output is stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlna filename1 [filename2
[filename3 ...]] <br>
If the -f option is omitted then each file is processed
independently and it is re-written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s The silent mode. No messages,
warnings, statistics are printed. Only errors which
terminates the program untimely are printed. If this
parameter is omitted then banner, <br>
warnings and statistics are printed to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Do not create the backups.
The option -r is irrelevant if the -f option is used. If the
-f and -r options aren&rsquo;t used then each re-written
file is stored with its original <br>
contents to a backup file (the name of backup file is the
same as filename, only the tilde is used instead of the last
character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v characters <br>
The set of characters treated as non-syllabic prepositions
is declared by this option. Default: -v KkSsVvZzOoUuAI. The
space between -v and characters is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x code <br>
The code is a string written in hexadecimal notation (even
hexa digits is required). This string will be saved after
prepositions instead asciitilde which is default. The <br>
example: -x C2A0 two bytes are stored after each
non-syllabic preposition, first byte has C2 code and second
byte has A0 code. This example means that NO-BREAK SPACE in
<br>
UTF8 encoding will be used after prepositions. Another
example: -x 00A0 the NO-BREAK SPACE in UTF16 encoding.
Another example: -x 48454C4C4F the string HELLO will be <br>
used. The space between -x and code is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m The math-modes ($...$ and
$$...$$) are ignored. It means that non-syllabic
prepositions is searched in math-mode too. Default (without
-m option): no changes in math <br>
modes are done because (for example) &quot;v&quot; is
variable in math-mode, no preposition. g t t . . . \ n d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The verbatim mode
(b&lt;char&gt;...&lt;char&gt;, td, it means t ) i s i g n o
r the program can do a changes in verbatim environment.
Default (without -n option): no <br>
changes in verbatim mode are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l The LaTeX mode. The following
environments are g i n { d i s p l a y } . . . \ n d { d i s
treated as display mode: pquation} and the following
environment l a y } a n d q u a t i o n } . . . \ n d { <br>
is treated as verbatim mode: g i nrbatim}...\nd{verbatim}. {
v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w The web mode (Knuth&rsquo;s
web, no www:-). The following sequences are treated as
verbatim: @&lt;, @d...@*, @space or @&gt;|. It means program
code is unchanged in *.w or *.web <br>
files, only web-comments are processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
vlna -m -n -s -r file <br>
The program has a behavior similar to the old vlnka
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlna *.tex <br>
All files with .tex suffix in current directory will be
processed (and possibly changed). (The &quot;*&quot; is
UNIX-shell feautre).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vlna -f file &gt; /dev/null <br>
Only the consistence checking of math and verbatim modes is
processed. No changes are done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Petr Olsak &lt;olsak@math.feld.cvut.cz&gt;. Man page (Czech
original) and Makefile is created by Rulolf Cejka</p>
