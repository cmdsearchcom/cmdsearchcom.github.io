<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xorrecord - Emulation of CD/DVD/BD program cdrecord by
program xorriso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xorrecord [ options ] dev=device [track_source]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xorrecord writes preformatted data to CD, DVD, and BD
media.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It understands some options of
program cdrecord from cdrtools by Joerg Schilling. Its
implementation is part of program xorriso which shares no
source code with cdrtools, but <br>
rather makes use of libburn for communicating with the
drive. <br>
Another, more complete cdrecord emulator is program cdrskin
which uses the same burn functions as xorrecord, but is able
to burn audio CDs and to handle CD-TEXT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MMC, Session, Track, Media
types: <br>
MMC is a standard out of the SCSI family which defines the
interaction between computers and optical drives. Since more
than a decade all CD, DVD, or BD recorders obey this <br>
standard regardless by what bus cabling they are attached to
the computer. libburn relies on this standard compliance and
on the capability of the operating system to perform <br>
SCSI transactions over the particular bus cabling. <br>
A Session is a data region on an optical disc which usually
gets written in a single sweep. It contains at least one
Track which is a contiguous string of readable blocks. <br>
xorrecord produces a single session with a single data track
which consists of blocks with 2048 bytes each. It chooses
the write mode automatically according to media type, <br>
medium state, and option -multi. <br>
On CD media there are other track types, like audio, and
particular write modes like TAO and SAO. CD and DVD- media
can put more than one track into a session. Some of these
<br>
features can be addressed by program cdrskin. <br>
MMC describes several recordable media types which roughly
form two families. <br>
Sequentially recordable media are CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-R
DL, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, BD-R. Except DVD-R DL they can
store more than one session if there is still unwritten <br>
space and if the previous session was written with option
-multi. CD-RW and DVD-RW can be blanked in order to be
re-usable from scratch. <br>
Overwritable media are DVD-RAM, DVD+RW, formatted DVD-RW,
BD-RE. They offer a single session with a single track for
random access writing. There is no need to blank <br>
overwritable media before re-use. <br>
DVD-RW media are sold in sequentially recordable state but
can be formatted once to become overwritable. See options
blank=format_overwrite and blank=deformat. <br>
If ISO 9660 filesystems are to be stored on overwritable
media, then it is possible to emulate multiple sessions, by
using option --grow_overwriteable_iso. In this case, the
need <br>
for blanking before re-use is emulated too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drive preparation and
addressing: <br>
The drives, CD, DVD, or BD burners, are accessed via file
addresses which are specific to libburn and the operating
system. Those addresses get listed by a run of xorrecord
<br>
--devices or xorriso -device_links. <br>
On GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD, the user needs
rw-permission for the device file. On Solaris, the user
needs r-permission and privilege &quot;sys_devices&quot;,
which is usually gained <br>
by running xorrecord via command pfexec. <br>
These permissions or privileges are needed already for
listing a drive. So it might be necessary to get the
overview as superuser or via pfexec. <br>
xorrecord does not perform cdrecord option -scanbus and does
not accept the addresses of form Bus,Target,Lun which are
told by -scanbus. If support for these addresses is <br>
necessary, consider to use program cdrskin. <br>
It is possible to let xorrecord work on emulated drives.
Their addresses begin by prefix &quot;stdio:&quot; followed
by a file address. The emulated media behavior depends on
the file <br>
type. See man xorriso for details. <br>
If standard output is chosen as emulated drive, then all
program result texts, which usually appear on standard
output, will get redirected to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relation to program xorriso:
<br>
xorrecord is actually a command mode of program xorriso,
which gets entered either by xorriso command &quot;-as
cdrecord&quot; or by starting the program by one of the
names &quot;xorrecord&quot;, <br>
&quot;cdrecord&quot;, &quot;wodim&quot;, or
&quot;cdrskin&quot;. <br>
This command mode can be left by argument &quot;--&quot;
which leads to generic xorriso command mode. See man xorriso
for its description. Other than in xorriso command mode, the
sequence <br>
of the cdrecord emulation options does not matter. All
pending actions get performed in a fixed sequence before the
program run ends or before cdrecord emulation ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Addressing the drive:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--devices <br>
Print the list of accessible CD, DVD, or BD drives to
standard output. Drives might be inaccessible if the user
lacks of permissions to use them or if the drive is in use
<br>
by another program. <br>
Each accessible drive is shown by a line like: <br>
0 -dev &rsquo;/dev/sr0&rsquo; rwrw-- :
&rsquo;TSSTcorp&rsquo; &rsquo;CDDVDW SH-S203B&rsquo; <br>
The libburn address of this drive is &rsquo;/dev/sr0&rsquo;.
&rsquo;TSSTcorp&rsquo; is the name of the vendor (in this
case: Toshiba Samsung Storage Technologies Corporation),
&rsquo;CDDVDW SH-S203B&rsquo; <br>
is the model name (in this case: a DVD burner). <br>
Afterwards end emulation without performing any further
drive operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev=drive_address <br>
Set the libburn address of the drive to be used. <br>
E.g. on GNU/Linux: dev=/dev/sr0 <br>
E.g. on FreeBSD: dev=/dev/cd0 <br>
E.g. on NetBSD: dev=/dev/rcd0d <br>
E.g. on Solaris: dev=/dev/rdsk/c2t2d0s2 <br>
See also above &quot;Drive preparation and addressing&quot;.
<br>
The medium in the drive should not be mounted or be
otherwise in use. <br>
This option will only get into effect if a track source, a
blank= option, or a drive inquiry option is given. Else it
will lead to a SORRY event and normally cause a <br>
non-zero exit value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inquiring drive and media:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inq Print to standard output:
vendor, model name, and firmware revision of the drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-checkdrive <br>
Print unconditionally that the drive supports burnfree, SAO,
and TAO. Also print the output of option -inq.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-atip Print the output of
-checkdrive, the most capable profile of the medium in the
drive, the list of profiles which are supported by the
drive, whether it is erasable (i.e. <br>
can be blanked), the media manufacturer, and the medium
product name. <br>
Profiles are usage models, which are often tied to a
particular media type (e.g. CD-RW), but may also apply to a
family of media. E.g. profile CD-ROM applies to all CD <br>
media which contain data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-toc Print a table of content of
the medium in the drive. The output is not compatible to
cdrecord option -toc, but rather the one of xorriso command
-toc. It lists the <br>
address, vendor, model name, and firmware revision of the
drive. <br>
About the medium it tells product name and manufacturer,
whether there is already content written, and if so, whether
the medium is closed or appendable. Appendable media <br>
can take another session. The amount of readable and
writable data is told. If there are sessions, then their
start block address and size is reported. If a session <br>
contains an ISO 9660 filesystem, then its Volume Id is
reported. If the medium is writable, then the next writable
block address is reported. <br>
If not option --grow_overwriteable_iso is given or no ISO
9660 file system is present on the medium, then overwritable
media are reported as being blank. This is due to <br>
the fact that they can be written from scratch without
further preparation, and that MMC does not distinguish
between data written by the most previous burn run and older
<br>
data which have not been overwritten by that burn run.
Consequently, these media are reported with 0 readable
blocks, although all their writable blocks normally are <br>
readable, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-msinfo <br>
Print the argument text for option -C of programs mkisofs,
genisoimage, or xorrisofs. It consists of two numbers
separated by a comma. <br>
The first number tells the first block of the first track of
the last recorded session. This is also the address used by
default when operating systems mount a medium with <br>
e.g. ISO 9660 filesystem. <br>
The second number tells the next writable address, where
xorrecord will begin to write the next session. <br>
This option is only valid for written, appendable media. In
all other cases it will yield no output text but will abort
the program with non-zero exit value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings for the burn run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A burn run requires exactly one
track source address argument, which tells from where to
read the data which shall be put into the upcomming session.
The medium state must be <br>
either blank or appendable. <br>
Track source may be &quot;-&quot; for standard input or the
address of a readable file of any type except directories.
Nearly all media types accept a track source with
unpredictable byte <br>
count, like standard input or named pipes. Nevertheless,
DVD-R DL and DVD-RW blanked by mode deformat_quickest demand
exact in-advance reservation of the track size, so that <br>
they either need to be read from a source of predictable
length, or need to be accompanied by option tsize= or by
option -isosize. <br>
Several options expect a size value as argument. A number
with a trailing letter &quot;b&quot; or without a trailing
letter is a plain byte count. Other trailing letters cause
<br>
multiplication of the given number by a scaling factor: <br>
&quot;k&quot; or &quot;K&quot; = 1024 , &quot;m&quot; or
&quot;M&quot; = 1024k , &quot;g&quot; or &quot;G&quot; =
1024m , &quot;s&quot; or &quot;S&quot; = 2048 <br>
E.g. tsize=234567s means a size of 234567 * 2048 = 480393216
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blank=mode <br>
Blank a CD-RW or DVD-RW to make it re-usable from scratch.
Format a DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, BD-R, or BD-RE if not yet
formatted. <br>
This operation normally makes any recorded data on the
medium unreadable. It is combinable with burning in the same
run of xorrecord, or it may be performed without a <br>
track source, leaving the medium empty. <br>
The mode given with blank= selects the particular
behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">as_needed <br>
Try to make the media ready for writing from scratch. If it
needs formatting, then format it. If it is not blank, then
try to apply blank=fast. It is a reason to <br>
abort if the medium cannot assume thoroughly writeable
state, e.g. if it is a non-blank write-once. <br>
This leaves unformatted DVD-RW in unformatted blank state.
To format DVD-RW use blank=format_overwrite. Blank
unformatted BD-R stay unformatted. <br>
(Note: blank=as_needed is not an original cdrecord
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all <br>
Blank an entire CD-RW or an unformatted DVD-RW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fast <br>
Minimally blank an entire CD-RW or blank an unformatted
DVD-RW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deformat <br>
Like blank=all but with the additional ability to blank
overwriteable DVD-RW. This will destroy their formatting and
make them sequentially recordable. <br>
(Note: blank=deformat is not an original cdrecord
options)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deformat_quickest <br>
Like blank=deformat but blanking DVD-RW only minimally. This
is faster than full blanking but yields media incapable of
writing tracks of unpredicatable size. <br>
Multi-session will not be possible either. <br>
(Note: blank=deformat_quickest is not an original cdrecord
option.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format_overwrite <br>
Format a DVD-RW to &quot;Restricted Overwrite&quot;. The
user should bring some patience. <br>
Format unformatted DVD+RW, BD-RE or blank BD-R to their
default size. It is not mandatory to do this with DVD+RW and
BD-RE media, because they will get formatted <br>
automatically on the first write attempt. <br>
BD-R media may be written in unformatted state. This keeps
disabled the replacement of bad blocks and enables full
nominal write speed. Once BD-R media are written, <br>
they cannot be formatted any more. <br>
For re-formatting already formatted media or for formatting
with non-default size, use program xorriso with command
-format. <br>
(Note: blank=format_overwrite is not an original cdrecord
options)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help <br>
Print a short overview of blank modes to standard error
output. <br>
Afterwards end emulation without performing any drive
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-multi This option keeps CD,
unformatted DVD-R[W], DVD+R, or BD-R appendable after the
current session has been written. Without it the disc gets
closed and may not be written <br>
any more - unless it is a -RW and gets blanked, which causes
loss of its content. <br>
This option cannot be applied to DVD-R DL or to DVD-RW which
were blanked by mode &quot;deformat_quickest&quot;. Option
--multi_if_possible may automatically recognize and handle
<br>
this situation. <br>
In order to have all filesystem content accessible, the
eventual ISO-9660 filesystem of a follow-up session needs to
be prepared in a special way by the filesystem <br>
formatter program. mkisofs, genisoimage, and xorrisofs
expect particular info about the situation which can be
retrieved by xorrecord option -msinfo. <br>
With overwriteable DVD or BD media, -multi cannot mark the
end of the session. So when adding a new session, this end
has to be determined from the payload. Currently <br>
only ISO-9660 filesystems can be used that way. See option
--grow_overwriteable_iso.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dummy Try to perform the drive
operations without actually affecting the inserted media.
There is no warranty that this will work with a particular
combination of drive and <br>
media. Blanking is prevented reliably, though. To avoid
inadverted real burning, -dummy refuses burn runs on
anything but CD-R[W], DVD-R[W], or emulated
stdio-drives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-waiti Wait until input data is
available at stdin or EOF occurs at stdin. Only then begin
to access any drives. <br>
One should use this if xorrisofs is working at the end of a
pipe where the feeder process reads from the drive before it
starts writing its output into xorrisofs. Example: <br>
xorrisofs ... -C 0,12800 -M /dev/sr0 ... | xorrecord
dev=/dev/sr0 ... -waiti - <br>
This option works even if standard input is not the track
source. If no process is piping in, then the Enter key of
your terminal will act as trigger for xorrecord. Note <br>
that this input line will not be consumed by cdrskin if
standard input is not the track source. It will end up as
shell command, usually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tsize=size <br>
Announce the exact size of the track source. This is
necessary with DVD-R DL media and with quickest blanked
DVD-RW, if the size cannot be determined in advance from the
<br>
track source. E.g. if it is standard input or a named pipe.
<br>
If the track source does not deliver the predicted amount of
bytes, the remainder of the track is padded with zeros. This
is not considered an error. If on the other hand <br>
the track source delivers more than the announced bytes then
the track on media gets truncated to the predicted size and
xorrecord exits with non-zero value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-isosize <br>
Try to obtain the track size from the content of the track
source. This works only if the track source bears an ISO
9660 filesystem. Any other track source content will <br>
cause the burn run to abort. <br>
If the track source is not a regular file or block device,
then this option will work only if the program&rsquo;s fifo
size is at least 64k. See option fs=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">padsize=size <br>
Add the given amount of trailing zeros to the upcomming
track. This feature can be disabled by size 0. Default is
300 kB in order to work around a problem with GNU/Linux <br>
which often fails to read the last few blocks of a CD track
which was written in write mode TAO. TAO is used by
xorrecord if the track size cannot be predicted or if the
<br>
CD medium is not blank but appendable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nopad The same as
padsize=0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pad The same as padsize=15s.
This was once sufficient with older GNU/Linux kernels.
Meanwhile one should at least use padsize=128k, if not
padsize=300k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-data Explicitly announce that
the track source shall be recorded as data track, and not as
audio track. This option has no effect with xorrecord,
because there is no support <br>
for other track formats anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tao Explicitly demand that
write type TAO shall be used for CD, or Incremental for
DVD-R. Normally the program will choose the write type
according to the given medium state, <br>
option -multi, and track source. Demanding it explicitly
prevents the start of a write run, if it is not appropriate
to the situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sao Explicitly demand that
write type SAO shall be used for CD, or DAO for DVD-R. This
might prevent the write run, if it is not appropriate to the
situation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dao Alias of -sao.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fs=size <br>
Set the size of the program fifo buffer to the given value
rather than the default of 4m. <br>
The fifo buffers a temporary surplus of track source data in
order to provide the drive with a steady stream during times
of temporary lack of track source supply. <br>
Other than cdrecord, xorrecord enables drive buffer underrun
protection by default and does not wait with writing until
the fifo is full for a first time. On very old CD <br>
drives and slow computers, this might cause aborted burn
runs. In this case, consider to use program cdrskin for CD
burning. DVD and BD drives tolerate buffer underrun <br>
without problems. <br>
The larger the fifo, the longer periods of poor source
supply can be compensated. But a large fifo can deprive the
operating system of read cache for better filesystem <br>
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">speed=value <br>
Set the write speed. Default is 0 = maximum speed. Speed can
be given in media type dependent x-speed numbers or as a
desired throughput per second in MMC compliant kB (= <br>
1000) or MB (= 1000 kB). Media x-speed factor can be set
explicitly by appending &quot;c&quot; for CD, &quot;d&quot;
for DVD, &quot;b&quot; for BD. &quot;x&quot; is optional.
<br>
Example speeds: <br>
706k = 706kB/s = 4c = 4xCD <br>
5540k = 5540kB/s = 4d = 4xDVD <br>
If there is no hint about the speed unit attached, then the
medium in the drive will decide. Default unit is CD, 1x =
176,400 raw bytes/second. With DVD, 1x = 1,385,000 <br>
bytes/second. With BD, 1x = 4,495,625 bytes/second. <br>
MMC drives usually activate their own idea of speed and take
the speed value given by the burn program only as a hint for
their own decision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minbuf=percentage <br>
Equivalent to: <br>
modesty_on_drive=&lt;percentage&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-immed Equivalent to: <br>
modesty_on_drive=75 <br>
In cdrecord, this also controls use of the Immed bit. But
xorriso uses Immed where possible and appropriate, unless it
is disabled by option use_immed_bit=off .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-eject Eject the drive tray
after alll other work is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program version and
verbosity:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print to standard output a line beginning by <br>
&quot;Cdrecord 2.01-Emulation Copyright&quot; <br>
and further lines which report the version of xorriso and
its supporting libraries. They also state the license under
which the program is provided, and disclaim any <br>
warranty, to the extent permitted by law. <br>
Afterwards end emulation without performing any drive
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase program verbosity by
one level. There are four verbosity levels from nearly
silent to debugging verbosity. The both highest levels can
be enabled by repeated -v <br>
or by -vv or by -vvv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Log SCSI commands and drive
replies to standard error. This might be of interest if
xorrecord and a particular drive or medium do not cooperate
as expected, or if you <br>
just want to know how libburn interacts with the drive. To

SCSI specs SPC, SBC, and MMC. <br>
Please do not add such a log to a bug report on the first
hand, unless you want to point out a particular deviation
from said specs, or if you get asked for this log by a <br>
maintainer of xorrecord who feels in charge for your bug
report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print a sparse list of

Afterwards end emulation without performing any drive

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options not compatible to
cdrecord:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no_rc <br>
Only if used as first command line argument this option
prevents reading and interpretation of startup files. See
section FILES below.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">drive_scsi_dev_family=sr|sdc|sg|default
<br>
GNU/Linux specific: <br>
By default, cdrskin tries to map Linux drive addresses to
/dev/sr* before they get opened for operating the drive.
This coordinates well with other use cases of optical <br>
drives, like mount(8). But since year 2010 all /dev/sr*
share a global lock which allows only one drive to process
an SCSI command while all others have to wait for its <br>
completion. This yields awful throughput if more than one
drive is writing or reading simultaneously. <br>
The global lock is not applied to device files /dev/sg* and
also not with the system calls read(2), write(2). But
ioctl(SG_IO) is affected, which is needed to perform the
<br>
SCSI commands for optical burning. <br>
So for simultaneous burn runs on modern GNU/Linux it is
advisable to use drive_scsi_dev_family=&quot;sg&quot;. The
drive addresses may then well be given as /dev/sr* but will
<br>
nevertheless get used as /dev/sg*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grow_overwriteable_iso <br>
Enable emulation of multi-session writing on overwriteable
media which contain an ISO 9660 filesystem. This emulation
is learned from growisofs -M but adapted to the usage <br>
model of <br>
xorrecord -msinfo <br>
xorrisofs -C -M | xorrecord -waiti -multi - <br>
for sequential media. <br>
--grow_overwriteable_iso does not hamper the use of true
multi-session media. I.e. it is possible to use the same
xorrecord options with both kinds of media and to <br>
achieve similar results if ISO 9660 filesystem images are to
be written. This option implies option -isosize and
therefore demands that the track source is a ISO 9660 <br>
filesystem image. <br>
With overwriteable media and no option blank=fast|all
present it expands an eventual ISO 9660 filesystem on media.
It is assumed that this image&rsquo;s inner size description
<br>
points to the end of the valuable data. Overwriteable media
with a recognizable ISO 9660 size will be regarded as
appendable rather than as blank. I.e. options -msinfo <br>
and -toc will work. -toc will always show a single session
with its size increasing with every added ISO 9660
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--multi_if_possible <br>
Apply option -multi if the medium is suitable. Not suitable
are DVD-R DL and DVD-RW, which were blanked with mode
&quot;deformat_quickest&quot;. <br>
Not all drives correctly recognize such fast-blanked DVD-RW
which need &quot;on&quot;. If there is well founded
suspicion that a burn run failed due to -multi, then this
causes a <br>
re-try without -multi.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">stream_recording=&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|number
<br>
Mode &quot;on&quot; requests that compliance to the desired
speed setting is preferred over management of write errors.
With DVD-RAM and BD this can bring effective write speed
near <br>
to the nominal write speed of the media. But it will also
disable the automatic use of replacement blocks if write
errors occur. It might as well be disliked or ignored <br>
by the drive. <br>
If a number is given, then error management stays enabled
for all byte addresses below that number. Any number below
16s is the same as &quot;off&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">dvd_obs=&quot;default&quot;|&quot;32k&quot;|&quot;64k&quot;
<br>
Linux specific: Set the number of bytes to be transmitted
with each write operation to DVD or BD media. Tracks get
padded up to the next multiple of this write size. A <br>
number of 64 KB may improve throughput with bus systems
which show latency problems. The default depends on media
type, option stream_recording=, and on compile time <br>
options.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">modesty_on_drive=parameter[:parameters]
<br>
Control whether the drive buffer shall be kept from getting
completely filled. Parameter &quot;on&quot; (or
&quot;1&quot;) keeps the program from trying to write to the
burner drive while <br>
its buffer is in danger to be filled over a given limit. If
this filling is exceeded then the program will wait until
the filling reaches a given low percentage value. <br>
This can ease the load on operating system and drive
controller and thus help with achieving better input
bandwidth if disk and burner are not on independent
controllers <br>
(like hda and hdb). It may also help with simultaneous burns
on different burners with Linux kernels like 3.16, if one
has reason not to fix the problem by <br>
drive_scsi_dev_family=&quot;sg&quot;. On the other hand it
increases the risk of buffer underflow and thus reduced
write speed. <br>
Some burners are not suitable because they report buffer
fill with granularity too coarse in size or time, or expect
their buffer to be filled to the top before they go to <br>
full speed. <br>
Parameters &quot;off&quot; or &quot;0&quot; disable this
feature. <br>
The threshold for beginning to wait is given by parameter
&quot;max_percent=&quot;. Parameter &quot;min_percent=&quot;
defines the threshold for resuming transmission. Percentages
are <br>
permissible in the range of 25 to 100. Numbers in this range
without a prepended name are interpreted as
&quot;on:min_percent=&quot;. <br>
E.g.: modesty_on_drive=75 <br>
The optimal values depend on the buffer behavior of the
drive. <br>
Parameter &quot;timeout_sec=&quot; defines after which time
of unsuccessful waiting the modesty shall be disabled
because it does not work. <br>
Parameter &quot;min_usec=&quot; defines the initial sleeping
period in microseconds. If the drive buffer appears to be
too full for sending more data, the program will wait the
<br>
given time and inquire the buffer fill state again. If
repeated inquiry shows not enough free space, the sleep time
will slowly be increased to what parameter
&quot;max_usec=&quot; <br>
defines. <br>
Parameters, which are not mentioned with a modesty_on_drive=
option, stay unchanged. Default is: <br>
modesty_on_drive=off:min_percent=90:max_percent=95: <br>
timeout_sec=120:min_usec=5000:max_usec=25000</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_immed_bit=&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|&quot;default&quot;
<br>
Control whether several long lasting SCSI commands shall be
executed with the Immed bit, which makes the commands end
early while the drive operation is still going on. <br>
xorriso then inquires progress indication until the drive
reports to be ready again. If this feature is turned off,
then blanking and formatting will show no progress <br>
indication. <br>
It may depend on the operating system whether -use_immed_bit
is set to &quot;off&quot; by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">write_start_address=value <br>
Set the block address on overwritable media where to start
writing the track. With DVD+RW, DVD-RAM or BD-RE,
byte_offset must be aligned to 2 kiB blocks, but better is
32 <br>
kiB on DVD and 64 kiB on BD. With formatted DVD-RW 32 kiB
alignment is mandatory. <br>
Other media are not suitable for this option.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">stdio_sync=&quot;on&quot;|&quot;off&quot;|number
<br>
Set the number of bytes after which to force output to
emulated stdio: drives. This forcing keeps the memory from
being clogged with lots of pending data for slow <br>
devices. Default &quot;on&quot; is the same as
&quot;16m&quot;. Forced output can be disabled by
&quot;off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Overview of examples: <br>
Get an overview of drives and their addresses <br>
Get info about a particular drive or loaded media <br>
Prepare CD-RW or DVD-RW for re-use, BD-R for bad block
handling <br>
Format DVD-RW to avoid need for blanking before re-use <br>
De-format DVD-RW to make it capable of multi-session again
<br>
Write a single ISO 9660 filesystem image <br>
Write multiple ISO 9660 sessions <br>
Write ISO 9660 session on-the-fly <br>
Write compressed afio archive on-the-fly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get an overview of drives and
their addresses: <br>
$ xorrecord --devices</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Get info about a particular
drive and loaded media: <br>
$ xorrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -atip -toc
--grow_overwriteable_iso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Prepare CD-RW or DVD-RW for
re-use: <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=as_needed -eject</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format DVD-RW to avoid need for
blanking before re-use: <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=format_overwrite -eject
<br>
This command may also be used to format BD-R media before
first use, in order to enable handling of write errors.
Several hundred MB of spare blocks will be reserved and
write <br>
runs on such media will perform with less than half nominal
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">De-format DVD-RW to make it
capable of multi-session again: <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 blank=deformat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write a single ISO 9660
filesystem image: <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m blank=as_needed
-eject padsize=300k my_image.iso</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write multiple ISO 9660
sessions: <br>
This is possible with all media except minimally blanked
DVD-RW and DVD-R DL, which cannot do multi-session. <br>
The first session is written like in the previous example,
except that option -multi is used. It will contain the files
of hard disk directory ./tree1 under the ISO 9660 <br>
directory /dir1: <br>
$ xorrisofs -o image_1.iso -J -graft-points /dir1=./tree1
<br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m -multi
--grow_overwriteable_iso blank=as_needed -eject padsize=300k
image_1.iso <br>
For the second session xorrisofs needs to know the -msinfo
numbers of the medium. Further it will read data from the
medium by using the system&rsquo;s read-only CD-ROM driver.
<br>
It is advised to load the tray manually or via dd by the
CD-ROM driver, rather than letting xorrecord do this by its
own SCSI driver. Many system CD-ROM drivers do not take <br>
notice of xorrecord&rsquo;s activities. <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 count=1 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 <br>
Now get the -msinfo numbers: <br>
$ m=$(xorrecord dev=/dev/sr0 -msinfo) <br>
and use them with xorrisofs to add ./tree2 to the image as
/dir2: <br>
$ xorrisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m -o image_2.iso -J
-graft-points /dir2=./tree2 <br>
Now burn the new session onto the same medium. This time
without blanking: <br>
$ xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m -multi
--grow_overwriteable_iso -eject padsize=300k image_2.iso
<br>
Operating systems which mount this medium will read the
superblock of the second session and show both directories
/dir1 and /dir2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write ISO 9660 session
on-the-fly: <br>
It is possible to combine the run of xorrisofs and xorrecord
in a pipeline without storing the ISO 9660 image as file on
hard disk: <br>
$ xorrisofs -M /dev/sr0 -C $m -J -graft-points /dir2=./tree2
| xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12 fs=8m -waiti -multi
--grow_overwriteable_iso -eject padsize=300k - <br>
This is also the main use case of program xorriso itself,
where this run would look like: <br>
$ xorriso -dev /dev/sr0 -joliet on -speed 12 -fs 8m -map
./tree2 /dir2 -commit_eject all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write compressed afio archive
on-the-fly: <br>
This is possible with all media except minimally blanked
DVD-RW and DVD-R DL. Since the compressed output stream is
of very variable speed, a larger fifo is advised. <br>
Nevertheless, this example is not suitable for very old CD
drives which have no underrun protection and thus would
abort the burn run on temporary data shortage. <br>
$ find . | afio -oZ - | xorrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 speed=12
fs=64m -multi padsize=300k - <br>
afio archives do not contain references to absolute data
block addresses. So they need no special precautions for
multi-session. One may get the session start addresses by
option <br>
-toc, and then use dd option skip= to begin reading at one
of those addresses. E.g. for listing its content: <br>
$ dd if=/dev/sr0 bs=2048 skip=64046 | afio -tvZ - <br>
afio will know when the end of the archive is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Startup files: <br>
If not --no_rc is given as the first argument then xorrecord
attempts on startup to read and execute lines from the
following files: <br>
/etc/default/xorriso <br>
/etc/opt/xorriso/rc <br>
/etc/xorriso/xorriso.conf <br>
$HOME/.xorrisorc <br>
The files are read in the sequence given here, but none of
them is required to exist. The lines are not interpreted as
xorrecord options but as generic xorriso commands. See man
<br>
xorriso.</p>
