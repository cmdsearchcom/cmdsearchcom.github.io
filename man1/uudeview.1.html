UUDeview - a powerful decoder for binary files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>uudeview [options] [@<i>file</i>] <i>file(s)</i></b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>UUDeview</i> is a smart decoder for attachments that you have received in
  encoded form via electronic mail or from the usenet. It is similar to the
  standard <b>uudecode</b>(1) command, yet with more comfort and flexibility.
  <i>UUDeview</i> supports the <i>uuencoding, xxencoding, Base64, yEncoding</i>
  and <i>BinHex</i> encoding methods, and is able to handle split-files (which
  have been sent in multiple parts) as well as multiple files at once, thus
  greatly simplifying the decoding process. Usually, you will not have to
  manually edit files to prepare them for decoding.
<div class="Pp"></div>
After invoking <b>uudeview,</b> it will scan all given files for encoded data,
  sort them and their parts and then present you with the list of files that
  seem like they can be decoded properly. You can then pick files individually
  for decoding.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disables interactivity. After scanning the files and
      sorting everything out, the program will not promt you for whether a file
      shall be decoded or not, but batch-decodes all available files. This is
      the default when reading from standard input.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Autorename option. If a target file already exists, and
      this option is given, a dot and a unique sequence number is appended to

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An alternative incarnation of autorename. If a target file

    foo_1.gif.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Gives the OK to overwrite existing files when decoding. In
      interactive mode, the default is to prompt the user whether to overwrite,
      rename or skip the file. This option takes precedence over <b>-a.</b> In
      non-interactive mode (using <b>-f</b> ), the default is to overwrite files
      without asking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>+o</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Says it's not OK to overwrite files. This is useful in

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Autoclear. Remove all input files that were successfully
      decoded. Use with care! UUDeview only checks if any data was decoded from
      an input file, but does not care about any other contents of that input
      file, or whether a file also held an incomplete attachment.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Ignore file mode. Uuencoded and xxencoded files have the
      original file permissions stored on the begin line. Unless this option is

      sensible. With this option, the permissions are reset to a default of
      0666.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-z</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enforces stricter MIME adherance. Normally, the program
      tries to find encoded data even in &quot;text/plain&quot; plaintext parts
      of MIME messages. With this option given, <i>UUDeview</i> will limit this
      capability, and will not accept apparently incomplete encoded messages
      (for example, seemingly uuencoded data without begin or end lines). You
      can tighten this option even more by using it twice, or by using
      <b>-z2.</b> Then, <i>UUDeview</i> will not check plaintext sections of
      MIME messages for encoded data at all and behave fully MIME-compliant.
      Neither option affects the behavior on non-MIME input files. This option
      needs a better name, but I'm slowly running out of option letters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Uses fast mode for file scanning. The program assumes that
      each input file holds at most one part, which is usually true for files in
      a news spool directory. This option <b>breaks decoding</b> of input files
      with multiple articles. Also, certain sanity checks are disabled, probably
      causing erroneous files to be presented for decoding. Sometimes you'll get
      error messages when decoding, sometimes you'll just receive invalid files.
      Don't use <b>-f</b> if you can't live with these problems.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use plaintext messages. Usually, UUDeview only presents
      encoded data for decoding. Plaintext messages are only shown if they have
      an associated file name. With this option set, unnamed text parts from
      <i>MIME</i> messages and non-encoded messages are also offered. Unnamed
      messages are assigned a unique name in the form of a sequential four-digit
      number.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the program into desperate mode. It will then offer
      you to decode incomplete files. This is useful if you are missing the last
      part of a 50-parts posting, but in most cases the desperately-decoded
      files will simply be corrupt and unusable. The degree of usefulness of an
      incomplete file depends on the file type.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This changes <i>UUDeview's</i> &quot;bracket policy.&quot;
      <i>UUDeview</i> looks at a message's subject line, and reads numbers in
      brackets as the part number, as in (3/7), which is read as the third
      message in a series of seven. By default, numbers in parentheses () are
      preferred over numbers in brackets []. You can change this using either
      <b>-b</b> or, for clarity <b>-b</b><i>[].</i></dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Read &quot;minus smartness&quot;. This option turns off
      automatic part number detection from the subject line. Try this option if
      <i>UUDeview</i> fails to parse the subject line correctly and makes errors
      at guessing part numbers, resulting in incorrect ordering of the parts.
      With this option, parts are always put together sequentially (so the parts
      must be correctly ordered in the input file). Also, with this option, the
      program cannot detect that parts are missing. <b>Note:</b> The correct
      part number found in proper <i>MIME</i> files is still evaluated. If this
      option is given twice, the subject itself is ignored, too, and won't be
      used to group parts. Use if the messages that the parts come delivered in
      have different subject lines.</dd>

After all input files have been scanned, you are asked for each file what do do
  with it. Of course, the usual answer is to decode it, but there are other
  possibilities. You can use the following commands (each command is a single
  letter):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>d</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">(D)ecode the file and write the decoded file to disk, with

In verbose mode (that is, if you didn't disable verbosity with the -v option),
  progress messages will appear. They are extremely helpful in tracing what the
  program does, and can be used to figure out the reason why files cannot be
  decoded, if you understand them. This section explains how to interpret them.
  Understanding this section is not essential to operate the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
First, there are &quot;Loading&quot; messages, which begin with the string
  &quot;Loaded&quot;. Each line should feature the following items:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Source File</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The first item is the source file from which a part was
      loaded. Many parts can be detected within a single file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Subject Line</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The complete subject is reproduced in single quotes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Identifier</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The program derives a unique identification for this thread
      from the subject line, for grouping articles that look like they belong to
      the same file. The result of this algorithm is presented in braces.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Filename</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a filename was detected on the subject line or within
      the data (for example, on a begin line, or as part of the Content-Type
      information).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Part Number</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The part number derived from the subject line, or, in the
      case of properly MIME-formatted messages, from the &quot;part&quot;
      information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Begin/End</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a &quot;begin&quot; or &quot;end&quot; token was
      detected, it is printed here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Encoding Type</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If encoded data was detected within this part, either
      &quot;UUdata&quot;, &quot;Base64&quot;, &quot;XXdata&quot; or
      &quot;Binhex&quot; is printed here.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More messages are printed after scanning has completed. A single line will be
  printed for each group of articles. The contents of this line are best
  understood by looking at an example. Here is one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Found 'mailfile.gz' State 16 UUData Parts begin 1 2 3 4 5 end 6 OK</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This indicates that the file <i>mailfile.gz</i> has been found. The file was
  uuencoded (&quot;UUData&quot;) and consists of 6 parts. The &quot;begin&quot;
  token was found in the first part, and the &quot;end&quot; token was found in
  the sixth part. Because it looks like everything's there, this file is tagged
  as being &quot;OK&quot;. The <i>State</i> is a set of bits, where the
  following values may be or'ed:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Missing Part</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd class="It-tag">An error occured during decoding of the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>64</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">File was successfully decoded.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Because the program cannot receive terminal input when a file is being read from
  standard input, interactivity is automatically disabled in this case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
UUDeview is aware of MIME messages, but normally ignores strict MIME compliance
  in favor of finding unproperly encoded data within them, e.g. to succeed when
  individual parts of a uuencoded file have been sent with a MIME mailer as MIME
  messages. For that, it subjects all &quot;text/plain&quot; parts of a message
  to encoding detection. You can use the <b>-z</b> option (see above) for more
  strict RFC2045 compliance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The scanner tends to ignore short Base64 data (less than four lines) outside of
  MIME messages. Some checks for this condition are used in desperate mode, but
  they may cause misdetection of encoded data, resulting in some invalid files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Files are always decoded into a temporary file first, then this file is copied
  to the final location. This is to prevent accidentally overwriting existing
  files with data that turns out too late to be undecodeable. Thus be careful to
  have twice the necessary space available. Also, when reading from standard
  input, all the data is dumped to a temporary file before starting the usual
  scanning process on that file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>uudeview</b> tries to derive all necessary information from the Subject: line
  if present. If it holds garbage, or if the program fails to find a unique
  identification and the part number there, <b>uudeview</b> might still be able
  to decode the file using other heuristics, but you'll need major luck then.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Yet this is only a concern with split-files. If all encoded files only consist
  of single parts, don't worry.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you rename, copy or link the program to <b>uudecode</b>, it may act as a
  smart replacement for the standard, accepting the same command-line options.
  This has not been well-tested yet.

The program cannot fully handle partial multipart messages (MIME-style multipart

  &quot;decoded&quot; into a plain-text file, which must then be fed again to
  <b>uudeview.</b> Don't worry, these kinds of messages are rare.
