<p>UUDEVIEW(1) General Commands Manual UUDEVIEW(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
UUDeview - a powerful decoder for binary files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
uudeview [options] [@file] file(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
UUDeview is a smart decoder for attachments that you have
received in encoded form via electronic mail or from the
usenet. It is similar to the standard uudecode(1) command,
yet <br>
with more comfort and flexibility. UUDeview supports the
uuencoding, xxencoding, Base64, yEncoding and BinHex
encoding methods, and is able to handle split-files (which
have <br>
been sent in multiple parts) as well as multiple files at
once, thus greatly simplifying the decoding process.
Usually, you will not have to manually edit files to prepare
them <br>
for decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After invoking uudeview, it will
scan all given files for encoded data, sort them and their
parts and then present you with the list of files that seem
like they can be decoded <br>
properly. You can then pick files individually for
decoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
BEHAVIOR <br>
-i Disables interactivity. After scanning the files and
sorting everything out, the program will not promt you for
whether a file shall be decoded or not, but batch-decodes
<br>
all available files. This is the default when reading from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Autorename option. If a
target file already exists, and this option is given, a dot
and a unique sequence number is appended to the file name.
I.e., foo.gif becomes <br>
foo.gif.1 if decoded a second time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+a An alternative incarnation of
autorename. If a target file already exists, an underscore
and a unique sequence number is inserted into the filename
before the first dot, <br>
i.e., foo.gif becomes foo_1.gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Gives the OK to overwrite
existing files when decoding. In interactive mode, the
default is to prompt the user whether to overwrite, rename
or skip the file. This option <br>
takes precedence over -a. In non-interactive mode (using -f
), the default is to overwrite files without asking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+o Says it&rsquo;s not OK to
overwrite files. This is useful in non-interactive mode, so
that existing files are untouched. This has lesser
precedence than -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Autoclear. Remove all input
files that were successfully decoded. Use with care!
UUDeview only checks if any data was decoded from an input
file, but does not care about <br>
any other contents of that input file, or whether a file
also held an incomplete attachment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p path <br>
Sets the path where decoded files shall be written to. This
must be a valid pathname, or you&rsquo;ll get errors when
trying to decode anything. Defaults to the current working
<br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Ignore file mode. Uuencoded
and xxencoded files have the original file permissions
stored on the begin line. Unless this option is given,
UUDeview will restore them with&acirc; <br>
out checking if they are sensible. With this option, the
permissions are reset to a default of 0666.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TWEAKING <br>
-z Enforces stricter MIME adherance. Normally, the program
tries to find encoded data even in &quot;text/plain&quot;
plaintext parts of MIME messages. With this option given,
UUDeview <br>
will limit this capability, and will not accept apparently
incomplete encoded messages (for example, seemingly
uuencoded data without begin or end lines). You can tighten
<br>
this option even more by using it twice, or by using -z2.
Then, UUDeview will not check plaintext sections of MIME
messages for encoded data at all and behave fully MIME- <br>
compliant. Neither option affects the behavior on non-MIME
input files. This option needs a better name, but I&rsquo;m
slowly running out of option letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Uses fast mode for file
scanning. The program assumes that each input file holds at
most one part, which is usually true for files in a news
spool directory. This option <br>
breaks decoding of input files with multiple articles. Also,
certain sanity checks are disabled, probably causing
erroneous files to be presented for decoding. Sometimes <br>
you&rsquo;ll get error messages when decoding, sometimes
you&rsquo;ll just receive invalid files. Don&rsquo;t use -f
if you can&rsquo;t live with these problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Ignore reply messages, i.e.
all messages whose subject starts with Re:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Use plaintext messages.
Usually, UUDeview only presents encoded data for decoding.
Plaintext messages are only shown if they have an associated
file name. With this option <br>
set, unnamed text parts from MIME messages and non-encoded
messages are also offered. Unnamed messages are assigned a
unique name in the form of a sequential four-digit <br>
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Sets the program into
desperate mode. It will then offer you to decode incomplete
files. This is useful if you are missing the last part of a
50-parts posting, but in most <br>
cases the desperately-decoded files will simply be corrupt
and unusable. The degree of usefulness of an incomplete file
depends on the file type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b This changes UUDeview&rsquo;s
&quot;bracket policy.&quot; UUDeview looks at a
message&rsquo;s subject line, and reads numbers in brackets
as the part number, as in (3/7), which is read as the <br>
third message in a series of seven. By default, numbers in
parentheses () are preferred over numbers in brackets [].
You can change this using either -b or, for clarity <br>
-b[].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Read &quot;minus
smartness&quot;. This option turns off automatic part number
detection from the subject line. Try this option if UUDeview
fails to parse the subject line correctly <br>
and makes errors at guessing part numbers, resulting in
incorrect ordering of the parts. With this option, parts are
always put together sequentially (so the parts must be <br>
correctly ordered in the input file). Also, with this
option, the program cannot detect that parts are missing.
Note: The correct part number found in proper MIME files
<br>
is still evaluated. If this option is given twice, the
subject itself is ignored, too, and won&rsquo;t be used to
group parts. Use if the messages that the parts come
delivered <br>
in have different subject lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
-q (Quiet) Disables verbosity. Normally, the program prints
some status messages while reading the input files, which
can be very helpful if something should go wrong. Use if
<br>
these messages disturb you. Disables progress bars. See -n
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v (disables Verbosity) Disables
verbose messages, i.e. notes are not displayed, but does not
remove warnings and errors. Is not as quiet as the -q
(Quiet) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No progress bars. Normally,
UUDeview prints ASCII bars crawling up to 100 percent, but
does not check if your terminal is capable of displaying
them. Use this switch if <br>
your terminal isn&rsquo;t, or if you find the bars
annoying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+e exts <br>
Selects only the files with the given extensions for
decoding, others will be ignored. +e .gif.jpg would decode
all gif and jpeg files, but not tif or other files. The <br>
list of extensions works case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e exts <br>
The reverse of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will experience unwanted
results if you try to mix +e and -e options on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT OPTIONS <br>
file(s) <br>
The files to be scanned for encoded files. You can also give
a single hyphen &Acirc;&acute;-&Acirc;&acute; to read from
standard input. Any number of files may be given, but there
is usually a lim&acirc; <br>
itation of 128 options imposed by the shell. If you are
composing the list of files with wildcards, make sure you
don&rsquo;t accidentally feed the program with binary files.
<br>
This will result in undefined behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file Makes UUDeview read
further options from the file. Each line of the file must
hold exactly one option. The file is erased after the
program finishes. This feature may be <br>
used to specify an unlimited number of files to be scanned.
Combined with the powers of find(1), entire directory trees
(like the news spool directory) can be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may also be set in the
$UUDEVIEW environment variable, which is read before
processing the options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DECODING <br>
After all input files have been scanned, you are asked for
each file what do do with it. Of course, the usual answer is
to decode it, but there are other possibilities. You can
<br>
use the following commands (each command is a single
letter):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d (D)ecode the file and write
the decoded file to disk, with the given name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y (Y)es does the same as
(d).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x E(x)tract also decodes the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Decodes all remaining files
without prompting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Skips this file without
decoding it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Steps back to the previous
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Rename. You can choose a
different name for the file in order to save it under this
new name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Set the path where decoded
files shall be written to. This path can also be set with
the -p command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Displays info about the file,
if present. If a multipart posting had a zeroeth part, it is
printed, otherwise the first part up to the encoded data is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Execute a command. You can
enter any arbitrary command, possibly using the current file
as an argument. All dollar signs &rsquo;$&rsquo; in this
command line are replaced with the <br>
filename of the current file (speaking correctly, the name
of a temporary file). You should not background processes
using this temporary file, as programs might get con&acirc;
<br>
fused if their input file suddenly disappears.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l List a file. Use this command
only if you know that the file in question is a textfile,
otherwise, you&rsquo;ll get a load of junk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quits the program
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Prints a short description of
all these commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t enter a
command and simply hit return at the prompt, the default
command, decoding the file, is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUNTIME MESSGAGES <br>
In verbose mode (that is, if you didn&rsquo;t disable
verbosity with the -v option), progress messages will
appear. They are extremely helpful in tracing what the
program does, and <br>
can be used to figure out the reason why files cannot be
decoded, if you understand them. This section explains how
to interpret them. Understanding this section is not
essen&acirc; <br>
tial to operate the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, there are
&quot;Loading&quot; messages, which begin with the string
&quot;Loaded&quot;. Each line should feature the following
items:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source File <br>
The first item is the source file from which a part was
loaded. Many parts can be detected within a single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subject Line <br>
The complete subject is reproduced in single quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Identifier <br>
The program derives a unique identification for this thread
from the subject line, for grouping articles that look like
they belong to the same file. The result of this <br>
algorithm is presented in braces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename <br>
If a filename was detected on the subject line or within the
data (for example, on a begin line, or as part of the
Content-Type information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Part Number <br>
The part number derived from the subject line, or, in the
case of properly MIME-formatted messages, from the
&quot;part&quot; information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Begin/End <br>
If a &quot;begin&quot; or &quot;end&quot; token was
detected, it is printed here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encoding Type <br>
If encoded data was detected within this part, either
&quot;UUdata&quot;, &quot;Base64&quot;, &quot;XXdata&quot;
or &quot;Binhex&quot; is printed here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More messages are printed after
scanning has completed. A single line will be printed for
each group of articles. The contents of this line are best
understood by looking at an <br>
example. Here is one:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Found &rsquo;mailfile.gz&rsquo;
State 16 UUData Parts begin 1 2 3 4 5 end 6 OK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This indicates that the file
mailfile.gz has been found. The file was uuencoded
(&quot;UUData&quot;) and consists of 6 parts. The
&quot;begin&quot; token was found in the first part, and the
&quot;end&quot; <br>
token was found in the sixth part. Because it looks like
everything&rsquo;s there, this file is tagged as being
&quot;OK&quot;. The State is a set of bits, where the
following values may be <br>
or&rsquo;ed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Missing Part</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 No Begin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 No End</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 No encoded data found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">16 File looks Ok</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32 An error occured during
decoding of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">64 File was successfully
decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Because the program cannot receive terminal input when a
file is being read from standard input, interactivity is
automatically disabled in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUDeview is aware of MIME
messages, but normally ignores strict MIME compliance in
favor of finding unproperly encoded data within them, e.g.
to succeed when individual parts of <br>
a uuencoded file have been sent with a MIME mailer as MIME
messages. For that, it subjects all &quot;text/plain&quot;
parts of a message to encoding detection. You can use the -z
option <br>
(see above) for more strict RFC2045 compliance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scanner tends to ignore
short Base64 data (less than four lines) outside of MIME
messages. Some checks for this condition are used in
desperate mode, but they may cause mis&acirc; <br>
detection of encoded data, resulting in some invalid
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files are always decoded into a
temporary file first, then this file is copied to the final
location. This is to prevent accidentally overwriting
existing files with data that <br>
turns out too late to be undecodeable. Thus be careful to
have twice the necessary space available. Also, when reading
from standard input, all the data is dumped to a temporary
<br>
file before starting the usual scanning process on that
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uudeview tries to derive all
necessary information from the Subject: line if present. If
it holds garbage, or if the program fails to find a unique
identification and the part <br>
number there, uudeview might still be able to decode the
file using other heuristics, but you&rsquo;ll need major
luck then. <br>
Yet this is only a concern with split-files. If all encoded
files only consist of single parts, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you rename, copy or link the
program to uudecode, it may act as a smart replacement for
the standard, accepting the same command-line options. This
has not been well-tested <br>
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
To read a file whose name starts with a hyphen
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, prepend a path name, for example
&rsquo;./&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The checksums found in BinHex
data are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program cannot fully handle
partial multipart messages (MIME-style multipart messages
split over several mail messages). The individual parts are
recognized and concatenated, <br>
and the embedded multipart message is &quot;decoded&quot;
into a plain-text file, which must then be fed again to
uudeview. Don&rsquo;t worry, these kinds of messages are
rare.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UUDeview cannot decipher RFC
1522 headers.</p>
