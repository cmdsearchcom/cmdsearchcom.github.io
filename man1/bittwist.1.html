<p>BITTWIST(1) General Commands Manual BITTWIST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bittwist -- pcap based ethernet packet generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bittwist [ -dvh ] [ -i interface ] [ -s length ] [ -l loop ]
<br>
[ -c count ] [ -m speed ] [ -r rate ] [ -p sleep ] <br>
pcap-file(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes the bittwist program, the pcap(3)
based Ethernet packet generator. Bittwist is designed to
work under Ethernet II (IEEE 802.3) network with a MTU of up
to <br>
1500 bytes on 10Mbps (10Base-T Ethernet) or 100Mbps (Fast
Ethernet) link speed. Packets are generated from saved
tcpdump(1) capture file referred to as trace file in this
docu&acirc; <br>
ment. Some familiarity with tcpdump(1) and its basic options
are assumed in this document. Since bittwist uses functions
provided by pcap(3) library, e.g. pcap_open_live() and <br>
pcap_inject(), to write packets onto the network, it may
require that you have special privileges, e.g. read access
to /dev/bpf* on BSD or root access on Linux, to generate
pack&acirc; <br>
ets or to enumerate network devices with, for example, the
-d flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bittwist will, if not run with
the -s flag, inject each packet up to its actual length
(on-wire) instead of its captured length. If the captured
length is less than the actual <br>
length, bittwist will pad the packet with zeros up to its
actual length prior to injection. Bittwist will, if not run
with the -m, -r, or -p flag, inject packets from a trace
<br>
file based on the captured intervals, in particular, the
timestamp difference between two adjacent packets, except
for the first packet in a trace file, which is always
injected <br>
immediately. Bittwist is designed to not to interfere with
the packet data; it merely read a packet and inject it as is
onto the network. If modification is desired prior to <br>
injection of a packet, you can use the bittwiste(1) program,
which does just that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Print a list of network interfaces available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print timestamp for each
packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vv Print timestamp and hex data
for each packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i interface <br>
Send pcap-file(s) out onto the network through
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s length <br>
Packet length to send. Set length to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 to send the actual packet
length. This is the default. <br>
-1 to send the captured length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or any other value from 14 to
1514.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l loop <br>
Send pcap-file(s) out onto the network for loop times. Set
loop to 0 to send pcap-file(s) until stopped. To stop, type
Control-C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c count <br>
Send up to count packets. Default is to send all packets
from pcap-file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m speed <br>
Set interval multiplier to speed. Set speed to 0 or less to
send the next packet immediately. Minimum positive value for
speed is 0.000001.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rate <br>
Limit the sending to rate Mbps. Value for rate must be
between 1 to 1000. This option is meant to limit the maximum
packet throughput. If you want to send packets at line <br>
rate of 100Mbps, try -m 0 -r 100</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p sleep <br>
Set interval to sleep (in seconds), ignoring the actual
interval. Value for sleep must be between 1 to 2146.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print version information and
usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
File your bug report and send to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addy Yeow Chin Heng
&lt;ayeowch@gmail.com&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure you are using the
latest stable version before submitting your bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run bittwist with -m flag
set to 0 without limiting the throughput with -r flag,
pcap_inject() may return an error with the following error
string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">send: No buffer space
available</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We recommend that you specify
the -r flag to limit the packet throughput, e.g. -m 0 -r 100
to inject packets at a maximum rate of 100Mbps.</p>
