<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xmountains - A fractal landscape generator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xmountains [ bqgPdEmMrBnZIASTWFGCapcevfRltxsXYH ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
xmountains is a X11 based fractal landscape generator. It
generates random fractal surfaces and displays them in a
window. While the program is running the fractal is
continu&acirc; <br>
ously extended on the right and the image is scrolled from
right to left to expose the newly generated area.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags: <br>
-b <br>
Use the root window. <br>
-q <br>
Reset the root window when the program exits. This option is
ignored unless the program is using the root window. <br>
-g [string] <br>
Set the geometry of the window. <br>
-P [filename] <br>
Write the PID to the specified file. <br>
-d [string] <br>
Set the display. <br>
-E <br>
Toggle the way that window repainting is done. By default
the image pixmap is installed as the background pixmap of
the window and window repainting should be performed <br>
automatically by the X server. If this does not work on a
particular system then this flag can be used to enable
explicit expose event processing. In the default mode root
<br>
window images will remain in place after the program exits.
<br>
-m <br>
Display a map of the surface rather than a perspective view.
<br>
-M <br>
Produce reflections in the water. This may be a little
slower. <br>
-r [20] <br>
To reduce the load on the X server the program generates
several columns of pixels before scrolling the image. This
flag sets the number of columns. A negative value <br>
reverses the direction of scrolling. A value of zero makes
the program scan across the window without scrolling at all.
<br>
-B [80] <br>
Set the number of shades of each colour that the program
allocates. <br>
-n [245] <br>
Set a maximum number of colours to use. This is just a
different way of setting the number of shades of each
colour. <br>
-Z [10] <br>
Set the number of seconds that the program sleeps after
scrolling the screen. <br>
-I [40.0] <br>
Set the vertical angle of illumination. <br>
-A [0.0] <br>
Set the horizontal angle of illumination. <br>
-S [0.6] <br>
Set the vertical stretch of the surface. <br>
-T [0.5] <br>
Set the vertical shift of the surface. <br>
-W [0.5] <br>
Set the height where the water occurs. <br>
-F [1] <br>
Reduce the variation in the foreground height to ensure a
good view of the surface. This flag sets the number of
iterations for which the foreground height is constrained
<br>
to a constant value. <br>
-G [-1.0] <br>
Mean altitude for the for foreground. <br>
-C [0.3] <br>
Set the contour parameter. The base colour of a point
depends on its height and how flat the surface is. This
parameter controls the relative importance of these factors.
<br>
-a [2.5] <br>
Set the Altitude of the viewpoint. <br>
-p [4.0] <br>
Set the distance of the viewpoint from the front of the
surface. <br>
-c [1.0] <br>
Set the contrast parameter. Values too far from 1.0 will
give strange results <br>
-e [0.3] <br>
Set the ambient light level. This is a fractional value that
sets how bright shaded areas will be compared to fully
illuminated ground. <br>
-v [0.6] <br>
Set the vertical light level. The program also implements a
secondary light source shining from directly above the
surface. This flag sets how bright this light source is <br>
relative to the main light source. <br>
-f [0.65] <br>
Set the fractal dimension of the surface. This should be in
the range 0.5-1.0. <br>
-R [0] <br>
Set the seed for the random number generator. A value of 0
causes the seed to be set from the clock. <br>
-l [10] <br>
Set the width of the surface. Increasing this value by one
doubles the width of the surface. <br>
-t [2] <br>
Set the number of non-fractal iterations. Increasing this
value by one doubles the average number of mountains across
the width of the surface. <br>
-x <br>
Use cross updates (see under -H) <br>
-s [1] <br>
Control the regeneration steps used to reduce creasing.
There are three possible regeneration steps controlled by
the first 3 bits of this flag value. (see under -H) <br>
-X [0.0] <br>
regeneration step parameter (see under -H) <br>
-Y [0.0] <br>
regeneration step parameter (see under -H) <br>
-H <br>
Print a short description of the algorithm explaining the -x
-s -X and -Y parameters.</p>
