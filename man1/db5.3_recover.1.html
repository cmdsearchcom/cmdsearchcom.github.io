<p>DB5.3_RECOVER(1) General Commands Manual
DB5.3_RECOVER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_recover - Restore the database to a consistent
state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_recover [-ceVv] [-h home] [-P password] [-t
[[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_recover utility must be run after an unexpected
application, Berkeley DB, or system failure to restore the
database to a consistent state. All committed transactions
<br>
are guaranteed to appear after db5.3_recover has run, and
all uncommitted transactions will be completely undone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c Perform catastrophic recovery instead of normal
recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Retain the environment after
running recovery. This option will rarely be used unless a
DB_CONFIG file is present in the home directory. If a
DB_CONFIG file is not <br>
present, then the regions will be created with default
parameter values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify a home directory for
the database environment; by default, the current working
directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Recover to the time specified
rather than to the most current possible date. The timestamp
argument should be in the form [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] where
each pair of letters <br>
represents the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CC The first two digits of the
year (the century).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">YY The second two digits of the
year. If &quot;YY&quot; is specified, but &quot;CC&quot; is
not, a value for &quot;YY&quot; between 69 and 99 results in
a &quot;CC&quot; value of 19. Otherwise, a &quot;YY&quot;
<br>
value of 20 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MM The month of the year, from 1
to 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DD The day of the month, from 1
to 31.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hh The hour of the day, from 0
to 23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mm The minute of the hour, from
0 to 59.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SS The second of the minute,
from 0 to 61.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;CC&quot; and
&quot;YY&quot; letter pairs are not specified, the values
default to the current year. If the &quot;SS&quot; letter
pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Run in verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of catastrophic
recovery, an archival copy - or snapshot - of all database
files must be restored along with all of the log files
written since the database file <br>
snapshot was made. (If disk space is a problem, log files
may be referenced by symbolic links).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the failure was not
catastrophic, the files present on the system at the time of
failure are sufficient to perform recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If log files are missing,
db5.3_recover will identify the missing log file(s) and
fail, in which case the missing log files need to be
restored and recovery performed again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_recover utility uses a
Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h option, the
environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility was run
in a directory contain&acirc; <br>
ing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_recover should always be given the chance to detach
from the <br>
environment and exit gracefully. To cause db5.3_recover to
release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it
an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_recover utility exits
0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
