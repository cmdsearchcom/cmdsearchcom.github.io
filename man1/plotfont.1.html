<p>PLOTFONT(1) GNU Plotting Utilities PLOTFONT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
plotfont - produce character maps of fonts supported by the
plotting utilities</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
plotfont [ options ] fonts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
plotfont produces a character map for any font that is
supported by the plotting utilities, which include graph(1),
plot(1), pic2plot(1), tek2plot(1), and the GNU libplot 2-D
<br>
graphics export library (see plot(3)). Which fonts are
supported depends on the output format, which is specified
by the -T option. A listing of the fonts available in any
<br>
specified output format may be obtained with the
--help-fonts option (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The character map, or maps, will
be written to standard output in the specified format. For
example, the Times-Roman font is available when producing
Postscript output. The <br>
command plotfont -T ps Times-Roman &gt; charmap.ps will
yield a character map of the Times-Roman font, in a
Postscript format that can be viewed or edited with the
idraw(1) drawing <br>
editor. The Times-Roman font is also available when
producing Fig output, which can be viewed or edited with the
xfig(1) drawing editor. The command plotfont -T fig
Times-Roman <br>
&gt; charmap.fig will yield the same character map, but in
Fig format rather than in Postscript format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As another example, the Univers
font is available when producing PCL 5 output. The command
plotfont -T pcl Univers &gt; charmap.pcl will produce a
character map of the Univers <br>
font, in PCL 5 format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When producing output for the X
Window System, i.e., for a popped-up window, any scalable X
Window System font that has an XLFD (i.e., X Logical Font
Description) name is sup&acirc; <br>
ported. For example, the command plotfont -T X
utopia-medium-r-normal will pop up a window, and draw a
character map of the Utopia-Regular font.
&quot;utopia-medium-r-normal&quot; is a <br>
truncated version of the Utopia-Regular font&rsquo;s XLFD
name. The Utopia-Regular font is available on most X Window
System displays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
General Options <br>
-T type <br>
--output-format type <br>
Select type as the output format. It may be &quot;X&quot;,
&quot;png&quot;, &quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;,
&quot;svg&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;,
&quot;cgm&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;, &quot;pcl&quot;,
&quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, or
&quot;meta&quot; (the default). These <br>
refer respectively to the X Window System, PNG (Portable
Network Graphics) format, portable anymap format
(PBM/PGM/PPM), a pseudo-GIF format that does not use LZW
encod&acirc; <br>
ing, the new XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format, the
format used by Adobe Illustrator, Postscript or Encapsulated
Postscript (EPS) that can be edited with idraw(1), <br>
CGM format (by default, confirming to the WebCGM profile),
the format used by the xfig(1) drawing editor, the
Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printer language, the Hewlett-Packard
<br>
Graphics Language, ReGIS graphics format (which can be
displayed by the dxterm(1) terminal emulator or by a VT330
or VT340 terminal), Tektronix format (which can be
dis&acirc; <br>
played by the xterm(1) terminal emulator), and
device-independent GNU metafile format itself. Unless type
is &quot;X&quot;, an output file is produced and written to
standard out&acirc; <br>
put.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files in PNG, PNM, pseudo-GIF,
AI, or Fig format contain only a single page of graphics. So
if the -T png option, the -T pnm option, the -T gif option,
the -T ai option, <br>
or the -T fig option is used, the output file will contain a
character map for only the first-specified font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A listing of the fonts available
in any specified output format may be obtained with the
--help-fonts option (see below). If a requested font is
unavailable, a default <br>
font will be substituted. The default font is
&quot;Helvetica&quot; for &quot;X&quot;, &quot;svg&quot;,
&quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;cgm&quot;, and
&quot;fig&quot;, &quot;Univers&quot; for &quot;pcl&quot;,
and &quot;HersheySerif&quot; for &quot;png&quot;,
&quot;pnm&quot;, &quot;gif&quot;, <br>
&quot;hpgl&quot;, &quot;regis&quot;, &quot;tek&quot;, and
&quot;meta&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 <br>
--lower-half <br>
Generate a character map for the lower half of each
specified font. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 <br>
--upper-half <br>
Generate a character map for the upper half of each
specified font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o <br>
--octal <br>
Number the characters in octal rather than in decimal (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
--hexadecimal <br>
Number the characters in hexadecimal rather than in decimal
(the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--box Surround each character
with a box, showing its extent to left and right. The
default is not to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j row <br>
--jis-row row <br>
Generate a character map for row row of a Japanese font
arranged according to JIS [Japanese Industrial Standard]
X0208. The only such font currently available is the
Her&acirc; <br>
sheyEUC [Extended Unix Code] font. If used, this option
overrides the -1 and -2 options. The valid rows are 1...94.
In the JIS X0208 standard, Roman characters are <br>
located in row 3, and Japanese syllabic characters (Hiragana
and Katakana) are located in rows 4 and 5. Greek and
Cyrillic characters are located in rows 6 and 7. Japa&acirc;
<br>
nese ideographic characters (Kanji) are located in rows
16...84.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bg-color name <br>
Set the color used for the background to be name. This is
relevant only to plotfont -T X, plotfont -T png, plotfont -T
pnm, plotfont -T gif, plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T <br>
cgm, and plotfont -T regis. An unrecognized name sets the
color to the default, which is &quot;white&quot;. The
environment variable BG_COLOR can equally well be used to
specify <br>
the background color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -T png or -T gif option
is used, a transparent PNG file or a transparent pseudo-GIF,
respectively, may be produced by setting the
TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment <br>
variable to the name of the background color. If the -T svg
or -T cgm option is used, an output file without a
background may be produced by setting the background color
<br>
to &quot;none&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bitmap-size bitmap_size <br>
Set the size of the graphics display in which the character
map(s) will be drawn, in terms of pixels, to be bitmap_size.
The default is &quot;570x570&quot;. This is relevant only
<br>
to plotfont -T X, plotfont -T png, plotfont -T pnm, and
plotfont -T gif, all of which produce bitmaps. If you choose
a rectangular (non-square) window size, the fonts in <br>
the character map(s) will be scaled anisotropically, i.e.,
by different factors in the horizontal and vertical
directions. For plotfont -T X, this requires an X11R6
dis&acirc; <br>
play. Any font that cannot be scaled in this way will be
replaced by a default scalable font, such as the vector font
&quot;HersheySerif&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
BITMAPSIZE can equally well be used to specify the window
size. For backward compatibility, the X resource
Xplot.geometry may be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--emulate-color option <br>
If option is yes, replace each color in the output by an
appropriate shade of gray. This is seldom useful, except
when using plotfont -T pcl to prepare output for a PCL 5
<br>
device. (Many monochrome PCL 5 devices, such as monochrome
LaserJets, do a poor job of emulating color on their own.)
You may equally well request color emulation by <br>
setting the environment variable EMULATE_COLOR to
&quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--numbering-font name <br>
Set the font used for the numbering of the characters in the
character map(s) to be name, rather than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--page-size pagesize <br>
Set the size of size of the page on which the character
map(s) will be positioned. This is relevant only to plotfont
-T svg, plotfont -T ai, plotfont -T ps, plotfont -T <br>
cgm, plotfont -T fig, plotfont -T pcl, and plotfont -T hpgl.
The default is &quot;letter&quot;, which means an 8.5 inch
by 11 inch page. Any ISO page size in the range
&quot;a0&quot;...&quot;a4&quot; <br>
or ANSI page size in the range &quot;a&quot;...&quot;e&quot;
may be specified (&quot;letter&quot; is an alias for
&quot;a&quot; and &quot;tabloid&quot; is an alias for
&quot;b&quot;). &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;ledger&quot; are
recognized page sizes <br>
also. The environment variable PAGESIZE can equally well be
used to specify the page size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The graphics display in which
each character map is drawn will be a square region that
would occupy nearly the full width of the specified page. An
alternative size for <br>
the graphics display can be specified. For example, the page
size could be specified as
&quot;letter,xsize=4in,ysize=6in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,xsize=5.0cm,ysize=100mm&quot;. For all of the <br>
above except plotfont -T hpgl, the graphics display will, by
default, be centered on the page. For all of the above
except plotfont -T svg and plotfont -T cgm, the graph&acirc;
<br>
ics display may be repositioned manually, by specifying the
location of its lower left corner, relative to the lower
left corner of the page. For example, the page size <br>
could be specified as
&quot;letter,xorigin=2in,yorigin=3in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,xorigin=0.5cm,yorigin=0.5cm&quot;. It is also
possible to specify an offset vector. For example, the page
size <br>
could be specified as &quot;letter,xoffset=1in&quot;, or
&quot;letter,xoffset=1in,yoffset=1.2in&quot;, or
&quot;a4,yoffset=-1cm&quot;. In SVG format and WebCGM format
it is possible to specify the <br>
size of the graphics display, but not its position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rotation angle <br>
Rotate the graphics display by angle degrees. Recognized
values are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;, &quot;180&quot;,
and &quot;270&quot;. &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; are
equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;90&quot;,
respectively. The envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable ROTATION can also be used to specify a
rotation angle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pen-color name <br>
Set the pen color to be name. An unrecognized name sets the
pen color to the default, which is &quot;black&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options for Metafile Output <br>
The following option is relevant only if the -T option is
omitted or if -T meta is used. In this case the output of
plotfont will be in GNU graphics metafile format. It may be
<br>
translated to other formats by invoking plot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O <br>
--portable-output <br>
Output the portable (human-readable) version of GNU metafile
format, rather than the binary version (the default). The
format of the binary version is machine-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Informational Options <br>
--help Print a list of command-line options, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help-fonts <br>
Print a table of available fonts, and exit. The table will
depend on which output format is specified with the -T
option. plotfont -T X, plotfont -T svg, plotfont -T ai, <br>
plotfont -T ps, plotfont -T cgm, and plotfont -T fig each
support the 35 standard Postscript fonts. plotfont -T svg,
plotfont -T pcl, and plotfont -T hpgl support the 45 <br>
standard PCL 5 fonts, and the latter two support a number of
Hewlett-Packard vector fonts. All seven support a set of 22
Hershey vector fonts, as do plotfont -T png, <br>
plotfont -T pnm, plotfont -T gif, plotfont -T regis, and
plotfont -T tek. plotfont without a -T option in principle
supports any of these fonts, since its output must be <br>
translated to other formats by invoking plot(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-fonts <br>
Like --help-fonts, but lists the fonts in a single column to
facilitate piping to other programs. If no output format is
specified with the -T option, the full set of <br>
supported fonts is listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number of plotfont and the plotting
utilities package, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variables BITMAPSIZE, PAGESIZE, BG_COLOR,
EMULATE_COLOR, and ROTATION serve as backups for the options
--bitmap-size, --page-size, --bg-color, --emulate-color,
<br>
and --rotation, respectively. The remaining environment
variables are specific to individual output formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T X, which pops up a
window on an X Window System display for each character map,
checks the DISPLAY environment variable. Its value
determines the display that will <br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T png and plotfont -T
gif, which produce output in PNG format and pseudo-GIF
format respectively, are affected by the INTERLACE
environment variable. If its value is <br>
&quot;yes&quot;, the output will be interlaced. Also, if the
TRANSPARENT_COLOR environment variable is set to the name of
a color, that color will be treated as transparent in the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T pnm, which produces
output in portable anymap (PBM/PGM/PPM) format, is affected
by the PNM_PORTABLE environment variable. If its value is
&quot;yes&quot;, the output will be <br>
in a human-readable format rather than binary (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T cgm, which produces
output in CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) format, is
affected by the CGM_MAX_VERSION and CGM_ENCODING environment
variables. By default, it pro&acirc; <br>
duces a binary-encoded version of CGM version 3 format. For
backward compatibility, the version number may be reduced by
setting CGM_MAX_VERSION to &quot;2&quot; or &quot;1&quot;.
Irrespective of <br>
version, the output CGM file will use the human-readable
clear text encoding if CGM_ENCODING is set to
&quot;clear_text&quot;. However, only binary-encoded CGM
files conform to the WebCGM <br>
profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T pcl, which produces
PCL 5 output for Hewlett-Packard printers and plotters, is
affected by the environment variable PCL_ASSIGN_COLORS. It
should be set to &quot;yes&quot; when <br>
producing PCL 5 output for a color printer or other color
device. This will ensure accurate color reproduction by
giving the output device complete freedom in assigning
colors, <br>
internally, to its &quot;logical pens&quot;. If it is
&quot;no&quot; then the device will use a fixed set of
colored pens, and will emulate other colors by shading. The
default is &quot;no&quot; because <br>
monochrome PCL 5 devices, which are much more common than
colored ones, must use shading to emulate color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T hpgl, which produces
Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language output, is affected by
several environment variables. The most important is
HPGL_VERSION, which may be set to <br>
&quot;1&quot;, &quot;1.5&quot;, or &quot;2&quot; (the
default). &quot;1&quot; means that the output should be
generic HP-GL, &quot;1.5&quot; means that the output should
be suitable for the HP7550A graphics plotter and the <br>
HP758x, HP7595A and HP7596A drafting plotters (HP-GL with
some HP-GL/2 extensions), and &quot;2&quot; means that the
output should be modern HP-GL/2. If the version is
&quot;1&quot; or &quot;1.5&quot; then <br>
the only available fonts will be vector fonts, and all lines
will be drawn with a default width. Additionally, if the
version is &quot;1&quot; then the filling of arbitrary
curves with <br>
solid color will not be supported (circles and rectangles
aligned with the coordinate axes may be filled, though).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The position of the plotfont -T
hpgl graphics display on the page can be rotated 90 degrees
counterclockwise by setting the HPGL_ROTATE environment
variable to &quot;yes&quot;. This is <br>
not the same as the rotation obtained with the --rotation
option, since it both rotates the graphics display and
repositions its lower left corner toward another corner of
the <br>
page. Besides &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;, recognized
values for HPGL_ROTATE are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;90&quot;,
&quot;180&quot;, and &quot;270&quot;. &quot;no&quot; and
&quot;yes&quot; are equivalent to &quot;0&quot; and
&quot;90&quot;, respectively. &quot;180&quot; and
&quot;270&quot; <br>
are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot; (the
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, plotfont -T hpgl
will draw with a fixed set of pens. Which pens are present
may be specified by setting the HPGL_PENS environment
variable. If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1&quot;, <br>
the default value of HPGL_PENS is &quot;1=black&quot;; if
HPGL_VERSION is &quot;1.5&quot; or &quot;2&quot;, the
default value of HPGL_PENS is
&quot;1=black:2=red:3=green:4=yellow:5=blue:6=magenta:7=cyan&quot;.
The <br>
format should be self-explanatory. By setting HPGL_PENS you
may specify a color for any pen in the range #1...#31. All
color names recognized by the X Window System may be <br>
used. Pen #1 must always be present, though it need not be
black. Any other pen in the range #1...#31 may be
omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If HPGL_VERSION is &quot;2&quot;
then plotfont -T hpgl will also be affected by the
environment variable HPGL_ASSIGN_COLORS. If its value is
&quot;yes&quot;, then plotfont -T hpgl will not be <br>
restricted to the palette specified in HPGL_PENS: it will
assign colors to &quot;logical pens&quot; in the range
#1...#31, as needed. The default value is &quot;no&quot;
because other than color <br>
LaserJet printers and DesignJet plotters, not many HP-GL/2
devices allow the assignment of colors to logical pens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opaque filling and the drawing
of visible white lines are supported only if HPGL_VERSION is
&quot;2&quot; and the environment variable HPGL_OPAQUE_MODE
is &quot;yes&quot; (the default). If its <br>
value is &quot;no&quot; then white lines (if any), which are
normally drawn with pen #0, will not be drawn. This feature
is to accommodate older HP-GL/2 devices. HP-GL/2 pen
plotters, <br>
for example, do not support opacity or the use of pen #0 to
draw visible white lines. Some older HP-GL/2 devices may, in
fact, malfunction if asked to draw opaque objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">plotfont -T tek, which produces
output for a Tektronix terminal or emulator, checks the TERM
environment variable. If the value of TERM is a string
beginning with &quot;xterm&quot;, <br>
&quot;nxterm&quot;, or &quot;kterm&quot;, it is taken as a
sign that plotfont is running in an X Window System VT100
terminal emulator: a copy of xterm(1), nxterm(1), or
kterm(1). Before drawing <br>
graphics, plotfont -T tek will emit an escape sequence that
causes the terminal emulator&rsquo;s auxiliary Tektronix
window, which is normally hidden, to pop up. After the
graphics <br>
are drawn, an escape sequence that returns control to the
original VT100 window will be emitted. The Tektronix window
will remain on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the value of TERM is a string
beginning with &quot;kermit&quot;, &quot;ansi.sys&quot;, or
&quot;nansi.sys&quot;, it is taken as a sign that plotfont
is running in the VT100 terminal emulator provided by <br>
the MS-DOS version of kermit(1). Before drawing graphics,
plotfont -T tek will emit an escape sequence that switches
the terminal emulator to Tektronix mode. Also, some of the
<br>
Tektronix control codes emitted by plotfont -T tek will be
kermit-specific. There will be a limited amount of color
support, which is not normally the case (the 16
&lsquo;ansi.sys&rsquo; <br>
colors will be supported). After drawing graphics, plotfont
-T tek will emit an escape sequence that returns the
emulator to VT100 mode. The key sequence &lsquo;ALT
minus&rsquo; can be <br>
employed manually within kermit to switch between the two
modes.</p>
