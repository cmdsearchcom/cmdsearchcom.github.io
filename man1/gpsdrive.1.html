<p>GPSDRIVE(1) General Commands Manual GPSDRIVE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpsdrive - displays GPS position on a map</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpsdrive [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About this manual page <br>
This manual page explains the basic functions of GpsDrive
2.11 and additional information regarding map setup and
interfacing with support software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within GpsDrive nearly all
buttons have tooltips and there is also a HELP window
describing the usage of mouse buttons and keyboard
shortcuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For additional information
concerning advanced topics consult the specialized README
files, e.g. README.kismet, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
GpsDrive is a car (bike, ship, plane, foot) navigation
system. It will display your position on a map, record your
track, and a number of other handy functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GpsDrive connects to a GPS
receiver and displays your position on a zoomable map. The
maps are auto-selected depending on your position. You can
choose the preferred map scale, <br>
which the program then tries to match from the available
maps. Basic worldwide maps are provided and tools are
included to help you add your own localized maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GpsDrive will work with the vast
majority of GPS receivers which output NMEA sentences to a
serial device, and any USB GPS binary protocol known to the
Gpsd software, which han&acirc; <br>
dles the back-end communication for GpsDrive. See the Gpsd
website (http://gpsd.berlios.de) for an extensive list of
GPS receivers known to work with that software. In most
cases <br>
your GPS will &quot;just work&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Gpsd is a service daemon
that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a host computer
through serial or USB ports, making all data on the
location/course/velocity of the sensors <br>
available to be queried on a TCP port of the host computer.
With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications (such as
navigational and wardriving software) can share access to
GPSes <br>
without contention or loss of data.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You must install and launch gpsd
before running GpsDrive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCLAIMER <br>
Do not use GpsDrive as a primary means of navigation! <br>
Keep your eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is distributed in
the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PUR&acirc; <br>
POSE. See the GNU General Public License (GPL) for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-?, --help <br>
Displays a short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --embedded <br>
Don&rsquo;t show the GUI; for use in external GTK apps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force-position <br>
Force display of position even if the GPS fix is invalid.
Before a GPS has a fix it often reports its position as 0,0.
And if it has lost a fix some makes of GPS will <br>
repeat the last known position together with a fix-is-bad
indicator. Normally (without this flag) GpsDrive skips
plotting these points. Useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --ignore-checksum <br>
Ignore NMEA checksum. (risky, only for broken GPS
receivers)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --explore-mode <br>
Start in Explore Mode. This will let you explore around your
maps independently of your GPS position (or lack
thereof).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --nosplash <br>
Don&rsquo;t show the startup splash screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --touchscreen <br>
Set this special mode if you only have a single mouse
button, for example when using GpsDrive on a touchscreen
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Displays some basic debug information to the terminal as the
program runs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --use-DBUS <br>
Use DBUS for communication with gpsd; this disables socket
communication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --alt-offset=&lt;OFFSET&gt;
<br>
Adjust the displayed altitude by adding this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --gpsd-server=&lt;SERVER&gt;
<br>
Server name of the NMEA server. You can connect your GPS
receiver to a remote host which is running gpsd and display
the position on your local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --config-file=&lt;FILE&gt;
<br>
Set this if you wish to use an alternative configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --debug=&lt;LEVEL&gt; <br>
Set the debugging level. A level of 0 will show no debug
information, while a level of 100 will show a lot of
debugging information. If you have problems or program <br>
crashes, set this high enough to display relevant
information send this output to the authors. See also the
BUGS section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F,
--friends-server=&lt;SERVERFILE&gt; <br>
Select a friends server to exchange position information
with other people, e.g. friendsd.gpsdrive.de. You can also
set this from the Preferences/Friends menu. You can <br>
start your own friends server with the included friendsd
program. More details are in the FRIENDSD section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --geometry=&lt;GEOMETRY&gt;
<br>
Specify the window geometry, e.g. 800x600.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --gui-mode=[car|pda|desktop]
<br>
Set GUI mode. The default layout is &rsquo;desktop&rsquo;.
Car modes sets up the display in a fullscreen mode suitable
for use with a small LCD touchscreen. PDA mode dedicates
even <br>
more screen real-estate to the map, controls are hidden
behind tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --nmeaout=&lt;FILE&gt; <br>
Set a serial device, PTY master, or file to send NMEA
sentences to. This is useful if you use GpsDrive in
simulation mode to provide other GPS applications with test
<br>
data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --screenshot=&lt;PATH&gt;
<br>
Take auto-screenshots of different GUI windows then exit.
Image files will be saved to the specified path. Don&rsquo;t
touch gpsdrive while this is running!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --run-test <br>
Run some internal unit tests and then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Shows the program version together with the SVN revision of
the main gpsdrive.c source. If you send a bug report, also
include this output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display=&lt;DISPLAY&gt; <br>
The X-Window display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONNECTING A GPS RECEIVER <br>
Start GPSD <br>
This program runs as daemon in background and provides a
server which sends the GPS data on port number 2947. You can
download and learn more about gpsd at <br>
http://gpsd.berlios.de.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once gpsd is running you can
monitor the raw NMEA output of your GPS with telnet
localhost 2947 and after the connection is made hit the R
key to see the NMEA sentences. You can <br>
use the xgps program that comes with gpsd for a more
comprehensive test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have connected a GPS
receiver, and are successfully communicating with it, you
will see GpsDrive&rsquo;s signal strength indicator turn
from red to green. By clicking on the <br>
signal strength indicator you can open the Satellite Info
window which will show you information about the satellites
in view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To calculate a 2D position the
GPS must have at least 3 satellites in view. To calculate
altitude you need at least 4 satellites. The antenna of your
GPS receiver must have free <br>
sight to the sky, so you cannot expect to use it indoors.
More satellites gives you a better accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your receiver can not see
enough satellites with a usable signal, the signal level
indicator is red. If your signal is ok and gives a valid
position, the Satellite Info indi&acirc; <br>
cator is green.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can restart the connection
to gpsd in the GPS tab of the Preferences menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Start GpsDrive as a normal user with: gpsdrive from your
shell, if you want another language see the LOCALISATION
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some distributions you may
find a &quot;GpsDrive&quot; entry in your Gnome or KDE
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that you have
installed GpsDrive as root, so it can find the necessary
files. Don&rsquo;t start GpsDrive as root!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use GpsDrive without a
GPS device connected. GpsDrive can automatically start in
Simulation mode if no working GPS receiver is connected and
no gpsd is running. The GPS <br>
signal level indicator is replaced with a message indicating
the mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In simulation mode the pointer
will move by itself on the map towards the target position.
It may be switched permanently on or off in the Preferences
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modes Of Operation <br>
GpsDrive operates in three modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normal mode: <br>
This mode is entered if you have a GPS receiver connected.
The cursor is at the position your GPS receiver sends. <br>
Black and red arrows show your position on the map. The red
arrow points to your selected target (aka
&quot;Bearing&quot;), and the black arrow shows the
direction in which you are moving <br>
(aka &quot;Heading&quot;). <br>
When the GPS is not sending a valid position the arrows
blink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simulation mode <br>
If GpsDrive does not find a GPS receiver when the program
starts, it shows the last known position and the cursor will
move towards the target you set. You can set the target <br>
with a right-mouse click on the map or by selecting a
waypoint from the Find dialog. The target appears as a
cross-hair and is available in all modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Explore mode <br>
In this mode you can temporarily change the cursor position
for looking around and jumping to other positions (e.g. for
downloading maps). The lat/lon position shown in the
dash&acirc; <br>
board is that of the current mouse position. <br>
This mode is selected by ticking the &quot;Explore
mode&quot; box in the Map Control window, or if you
&quot;Jump to POI&quot; in the Find window. The Jump button
simply jumps to the current tar&acirc; <br>
get, so it is useful to move the target to a waypoint/POI
first by selecting one from the list. <br>
In this mode GpsDrive does not show your real position and
the positioning arrows are replaced with a box. <br>
You can relocate your position with a simple left-mouse
click on the map or with the arrow keys (including diagonals
on the keypad). Maps are automatically scrolled or load the
<br>
next map when you click near the border. <br>
To leave Explore Mode untick the &quot;Explore mode&quot;
entry in the Map Control window, or middle or right-mouse
click on the map. If a right-mouse click is used the target
is reset to <br>
that position in the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can change the preferred map
scale with mouse wheel, or if there is no mouse wheel, with
Shift-left and right mouse click. This works from any
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please have a look in the Help
menu in GpsDrive to learn more about available keyboard
shortcuts and mouse functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAPS <br>
OpenStreetMap Maps <br>
GpsDrive now supports OSM maps with the help of the Mapnik
renderer. To activate this mode you have to build GpsDrive
with the Mapnik option enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Map Download <br>
You can easily download maps from the internet with the
Download tool. This is found in the Options -&gt; Maps menu.
A preview of already downloaded maps near to the current
pre&acirc; <br>
ferred mapscale are shown as yellow rectangles drawn over
the map. The area to be downloaded is drawn as a green
rectangle over the map. Reposition the area to be downloaded
with <br>
a left-mouse click. Map scales given in the GUI for
OpenStreetMap tiles are only approximate, the true scale at
the selected latitude will be calculated when the map is
down&acirc; <br>
loaded - this can vary by up to 50% at high latitudes and is
a limitation of the popular Web Tile method. LANDSAT maps
use a WMS server and will match the requested scale <br>
exactly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have Mapnik set up you
can also use the gpsdrive_mapnik_gentiles utility to
pre-render maps of varying scale directly from your PostGIS
database. There is also a program <br>
called gpsfetchmap.pl provided with GpsDrive which can be
used to automatically download a series of maps covering a
larger area from a number of online map servers. <br>
Please consider the copyright information and terms of
service of map providers if you want to use their maps! Do
not misuse this service by downloading more maps than you
need! <br>
You will risk being blocked by these servers, and possibly
cause trouble for the GpsDrive project.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you must access the internet
via a proxy server, set the HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy
environment variable to a value like
http://proxy.provider.com:3128 where 3128 in this
exam&acirc; <br>
ple is the proxy port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About Maps <br>
GpsDrive stores an index of your maps in a file called
&quot;map_koord.txt&quot; in your ~/.gpsdrive/maps/
directory. You can use another directory for your maps if
you like, to change <br>
this set the appropriate directory in the Preferences
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a sample of its
contents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">top_WORLD.jpg 0.00000 0.00000
88226037 <br>
map_file0000.gif 53.60751 10.01145 3160000 <br>
map_file0001.gif 43.08210 12.24552 3160000 <br>
map_file0002.gif 49.81574 9.71454 7900000 <br>
map_file0003.gif 47.72837 14.46487 592500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first column is the
filename, then comes the latitude, the longitude and the
scale of the map. Typical scales for all of Europe might be
1:10,000,000, and 1:100,000 for a <br>
town. To see detailed streets in a city, choose a scale like
1:10,000 or 1:5,000.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can figure out the exact
&quot;scale&quot; factor by meters/pixel * 2817.947378. The
2817 number is derived from some ancient screen dpi
converted into pixels/meter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GpsDrive selects the map with
the best scale for your position. So you will want to get
maps of different scales. e.g. You should have maps for
Europe, Austria, and Vienna if you <br>
want to drive in Vienna.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">European decimal place: <br>
While the decimal points in way.txt must always be a dot
(&rsquo;.&rsquo;), in map_koord.txt &rsquo;.&rsquo; or
&rsquo;,&rsquo; are possible. If you download maps from
within the program, GpsDrive writes the <br>
map_koord.txt respecting your LC_NUMERIC setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can I use other maps? <br>
You can also use your own (self drawn, scanned, exported
from GIS, ...) maps. The maps must be in PNG, JPEG, GIF,
TIFF, or another common file format (the format must be
recog&acirc; <br>
nized by the gdk-pixbuf library). The lat/long coordinates
you write into the &quot;map_koord.txt&quot; file is
measured at the center of the map. The map must have a size
of 1280x1024 <br>
pixels!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important! The maps must be
named &quot;map_*&quot; for UTM-like projections (lat:lon =
1:cos(lat)) and &quot;top_*&quot; for lat/lon Plate
carr&Atilde;&copy;e projection (lat:lon = 1:1). The prefix
is given so <br>
that gpsdrive knows how to scale the maps correctly.
Alternatively the maps can be stored without prefix in
subdirectories of $HOME/.gpsdrive/maps/ which end in
&quot;_map&quot; or &quot;_top&quot;. <br>
The georeferencing information (center coordinate and scale
factor) for the maps in those subdirectories must be
recorded in the main &quot;map_koord.txt&quot; file,
typically stored in <br>
the ~/.gpsdrive/maps/ directory. To avoid distortion,
anything more global than 1:150k to 1:500k should use
&quot;top_*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Beware if you are using an image
originating from a map projection with a significant
deviation between true north and the map projection&rsquo;s
local +y direction (known as the Con&acirc; <br>
vergence Angle). GpsDrive assumes that true north is always
directly up! i.e. the Central Meridian of the map projection
is located at the map tile&rsquo;s center. For some map
projec&acirc; <br>
tions and areas of the country this can be a really bad
assumption and your map will be significantly rotated. This
effect is most visible at map scales covering a large area.
<br>
This does not affect lat/lon maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is an &quot;import
assistant&quot; built in. Use it to import your
non-georeferenced maps. If can be found in the menus under
Options -&gt; Maps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WAYPOINTS AND POI <br>
Importing waypoints <br>
The manual way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may create a file
&quot;way.txt&quot; in your ~/.gpsdrive directory which
looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DFN-Cert 53.577694 9.991263
FRITZ <br>
Finkenwerder 53.541765 9.842541 AIRPORT <br>
Fritz_Wohnung 53.582700 9.971390 FRITZ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rows are: {label latitude
longitude waypoint-type}. The label may not exceed 80
characters or contain spaces. Use underscores (_) in place
of spaces, these will automati&acirc; <br>
cally be converted into spaces by the program. A blank label
is denoted by a single underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Latitude and longitude may be in
decimal degrees or in the form of
DDDdMM&rsquo;SS&quot;[NSEW] or DDD:MM:SS[NSEW]. Seconds or
minutes and seconds may be omitted or in decimal form. Thus
the <br>
following are valid: 42d30&rsquo;55&quot;N, 75:30.6425W,
-46.25. In fact the delimiters can be anything except
numbers, &quot;.&quot;, or spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may omit the waypoint
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the waypoint-type are
(optionally) three space separated zeros, a proximity radius
(in integer meters), and a comment. Comments follow the same
space/underscore rules <br>
as label names, and are limited to 255 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can create any number of
way-*.txt files and chose between them from the Preferences
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no need to create the
way.txt file yourself, you can add the waypoints with
GpsDrive using the &quot;x&quot; key. See the Help menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add new waypoints <br>
Waypoints created by GpsDrive will be stored in a SQLite
database file locacted at ~/.gpsdrive/waypoints.db.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can add new waypoints in two
simple ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o To add a waypoint at the
current (GPS) position simply press CTRL and
RIGHT-mouse-click. You can also press the x key for
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o To add a waypoint at the mouse
position, simply press CTRL and LEFT-mouse-click. You can
also press the y key for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the popup window give the
waypoint a name (spaces will be converted to underscores)
and choose a waypoint type (see below for predefined
waypoint types).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Waypoint icons <br>
At the moment there a three different icon themes available,
but not all have distinct icons for every type. You can
choose the themes in the Preferences menu. The possible <br>
themes are: &quot;square.big&quot;, &quot;square.small&quot;
and &quot;classic&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SQL support <br>
For managing a larger number of waypoints SQL support is
essential. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, SQLite doesn&rsquo;t need
much in the way of resources, is very fast, and makes the
management <br>
(including selection of waypoint types) of the waypoints
much easier. In SQL mode you can select the waypoints to
display in the Preferences menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROUTES <br>
A route is a list of waypoints. GpsDrive guides you from one
waypoint to the next on the route.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can add waypoints to a route
using the Find waypoint (select target) window. Find some
POIs, then open the Route Listing window with the Edit Route
button in the Find window <br>
or from the button on the main window. When you click on
waypoints in the the Find window&rsquo;s Results list they
will be added to the Route List. Click &quot;Start
Route&quot; when you are <br>
ready to begin your journey. It is also possible to import a
complete route from a GPX file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can add comments to a
waypoint which will be spoken by the speech system and also
be shown in the map window as scrolling text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments for routes <br>
To add comments create a file with the same name as the
waypoint file, but change the suffix to .dsc, i.e
way-trip.txt and way-trip.dsc, then enter comments in the
way-*.dsc file <br>
in the manner of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$waypoint_name Text which is
displayed and spoken</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$next_waypoint_name Some more
text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Fritz_Wohnung Hier wohnt Fritz,
der Autor von diesem Programm. Er freut sich auf Besuch und
eine Einladung zu einem saftigen Steak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Hubertus Hier wohnt Hubertus,
ein Freund von Fritz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no limit of the length
of the comment. It is important is to start the line with
&rsquo;$name&rsquo; and the comment on the following
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Route planning <br>
There is no shortest-path route planning feature at the
moment. We are keenly watching developments over at the
OpenStreetMap project for utilizing software such as
pgRouting and <br>
DGLib.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KISMET support <br>
GpsDrive supports kismet. Kismet is a 802.11b wireless
network (WLAN) sniffer. If you have kismet running, gpsdrive
will detect it when the program starts and show new WLAN
<br>
access points in real-time on the map. It is necessary to
use SQL mode when using GpsDrive with Kismet. WLAN access
points which are already stored in the SQL database from
prior <br>
war-drivings are ignored. If you have enabled
GpsDrive&rsquo;s voice output, you will hear information
about the newly found access point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details have a look at
the README.kismet file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALISATION <br>
The program will display messages in English, German,
French, Italian, Dutch, Dansk, Hungarian, Slovak, Swedish,
Turkish or Spanish if your language is set either with LANG
or <br>
LANGUAGE. LANGUAGE overrides all other settings. Call
&quot;locale&quot; to see the settings and call
&quot;set&quot; if LANG or LANGUAGE is set. For German
do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export LANGUAGE=de <br>
and then call gpsdrive in this shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also start it with the
line LANGUAGE=de gpsdrive without setting the language for
the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is necessary use
LANG instead of LANGUAGE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your own language isn&rsquo;t
available, please contact the GpsDrive Development Team if
you want to make the translation. No programming experience
is necessary!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPEECH OUTPUT <br>
If you want speech output you have to install speech
dispatcher and at least one of the supported speech
synthesizers (festival, espeak, ...). <br>
See http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd for information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For German output you can use
espeak or the German festival from <br>

http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/phonetik/synthesis/index.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a functional
festival software call it as server with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">festival --server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you start GpsDrive it will
detect a running speechd and speak some status information.
When speech output is enabled an additional Mute button is
available to switch off <br>
sound output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GpsDrive tries to use the
correct language for your locale. If the voice used is not
correct, you can choose another one in the Preferences, if
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FRIENDSD server <br>
A server program called friendsd comes with GpsDrive. It
acts as a server for coordinating the position of your
friends. After enabling it in the Preferences menu you can
see the <br>
position of all GpsDrivers connected to this server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will see the position of
your friends as a car symbol on the map, including the name,
time, day of week and the speed of their last connection.
The blue arrow shows the last <br>
reported direction of your friend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The time is transmitted as UTC,
but shown on the display in your local time, so it is also
correct if your friend lives in another time zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The server uses port 50123
(UDP), so be sure that you open the port in your firewall.
The server needs no root privileges and should run as a
normal user or a special user with <br>
no privileges. The server has NOT been tested for
security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a friends server
running on friendsd.gpsdrive.de, you can try it if you
enable it in the settings menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also send messages to
other mobile targets (Options/Send Message)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAILING LIST <br>
The primary means of support and coordination of program
development happens on the GpsDrive mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Information about subscription
and a searchable archive can be found at
http://www.gpsdrive.de/support.shtml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Please send bug reports to the development team! If we
don&rsquo;t know about them we can&rsquo;t fix them and then
they remain unfixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File bug reports in our tracker
at http://bugzilla.gpsdrive.de/. You will need to create
yourself a SourceForge account at that site, it is rather
painless and only takes a <br>
minute. This ensures you get feedback about the bug and we
can communicate with you if we need further information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please report the version
(gpsdrive --version), screen size, platform, and as much
specific information about how to reproduce the bug as
possible. Whenever possible cut and <br>
paste exact error messages and take screenshots. It is
helpful to run gpsdrive for a minute with the -D debug level
option set high and send us the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If GpsDrive crashes with a
SegFault, we will need a backtrace of the program as well.
Assuming GpsDrive was built with debugging symbols and the
binaries were not stripped of <br>
them, create a backtrace by running the GpsDrive the GNU
debugging software as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdb &lsquo;which
gpsdrive&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inside the debugger do:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">run (if you use command line
arguments place these after the word run)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you get the SegFault type
in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bt full</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and send us this output. This
gives us an indication of exactly what the program was doing
when it broke.</p>
