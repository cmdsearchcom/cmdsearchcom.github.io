<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tcp6 tool allows the assessment of IPv6 implementations with
respect to a variety of attack vectors based on TCP/IPv6
segments. This tool is part of the SI6 Networks&rsquo; IPv6
Tool&acirc; <br>
kit: a security assessment suite for the IPv6 protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp6 can be employed to perform
specific TCP connection-establishment and
connection-termination sequences. For example, it can be
employed to simulate a TCP &quot;simultaneous open&quot;
<br>
scenario (see the &quot;--open-mode&quot; option) or to
simulate a TCP &quot;simultaneous close&quot; scenario (see
the &quot;--close-mode&quot; option). It can be employed to
perform a number of resource- <br>
exhaustion attacks against TCP, such as SYN-flooding
attacks, connection-flooding attacks (see the
&quot;--flood-sources&quot; and &quot;--flood-ports&quot;
options), etc. Additionally, it can be <br>
employed to exploit attack vectors based on the TCP window
(see the &quot;--window&quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp6 tool has two modes of
operation: active and listening. In active mode, the tool
attacks a specific target, while in listening mode the tool
listens to TCP traffic on the <br>
local network, and launches an attack in response to such
traffic. Active mode is employed if an IPv6 Destination
Address is specified. Listening mode is employed if the
&quot;-L&quot; <br>
option (or its long counterpart &quot;--listen&quot;) is
set. If both an attack target and the &quot;-L&quot; option
are specified, the attack is launched against the specified
target, and then the <br>
tool enters listening mode to respond incoming packets with
TCP segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp6 supports filtering of
incoming packets based on the Ethernet Source Address, the
Ethernet Destination Address, the IPv6 Source Address, and
the IPv6 Destination Address. <br>
There are two types of filters: &quot;block filters&quot;
and &quot;accept filters&quot;. If any &quot;block
filter&quot; is specified, and the incoming packet matches
any of those filters, the message is <br>
discarded (and thus no TCP segments are sent in response).
If any &quot;accept filter&quot; is specified, incoming
packets must match the specified filters in order for the
tool to respond <br>
with TCP segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
tcp6 takes itS parameters as command-line options. Each of
the options can be specified with a short name (one
character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g.
&quot;-i&quot;) or with <br>
a long name (a string preceded with two hyphen characters,
as e.g. &quot;--interface&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the tool is instructed to
e.g. flood the victim with TCP segments from different
sources (&quot;--flood-sources&quot; option), multiple
packets may need to be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcp6 supports IPv6 Extension
Headers, including the IPv6 Fragmentation Header, which
might be of use to circumvent layer-2 filtering and/or
Network Intrusion Detection Systems <br>
(NIDS). However, IPv6 extension headers are not employed by
default, and must be explicitly enabled with the
corresponding options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i INTERFACE, --interface
INTERFACE <br>
This option specifies the network interface that the tool
will use. The network interface must be specified (i.e., the
tool does not select any network interface &quot;by <br>
default&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S SRC_LINK_ADDR,
--src-link-address SRC_LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
link-layer Source Address of the probe packets. If left
unspecified, the link-layer Source Address of the packets is
set to the real link-layer <br>
address of the network interface. Note: this option is
meaningful only when the underlying link-layer technology is
Ethernet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D DST_LINK_ADDR,
--dst-link-address DST_LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
link-layer Destination Address of the probe packets. By
default, the link-layer Destination Address is automatically
set to the link-layer <br>
address of the destination host (for on-link destinations)
or to the link-layer address of the first-hop router. Note:
this option is meaningful only when the underlying <br>
link-layer technology is Ethernet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s SRC_ADDR, --src-address
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the IPv6
source address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the Source
Address of the attack packets. If the &quot;-F&quot;
(&quot;--flood-sources&quot;) option is speci&acirc; <br>
fied, this option includes an IPv6 prefix, from which random
addresses are selected. See the description of the
&quot;-F&quot; option for further information on how the
&quot;-s&quot; option <br>
is processed in that specific case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When operating in
&quot;listening&quot; mode, the Source Address is
automatically set to the Destination Address of the incoming
packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d DST_ADDR, --dst-address
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the IPv6
Destination Address of the victim. It can be left
unspecified only if the &quot;-L&quot; option is selected
(i.e., if the tool is to operate in &quot;lis&acirc; <br>
tening&quot; mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: When operating in
&quot;listening&quot; mode, the Destination Address is
automatically set to the Source Address of the incoming
packet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A HOP_LIMIT, --hop-limit
HOP_LIMIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the Hop
Limit to be used for the IPv6 packets. It defaults to
255.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u HDR_SIZE, --dst-opt-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that a
Destination Options header is to be included in the outgoing
packet(s). The extension header size must be specified as an
argument to this <br>
option (the header is filled with padding options). Multiple
Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
multiple &quot;-u&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U HDR_SIZE, --dst-opt-u-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies a
Destination Options header to be included in the
&quot;unfragmentable part&quot; of the outgoing packet(s).
The header size must be specified as an argument <br>
to this option (the header is filled with padding options).
Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by
means of multiple &quot;-U&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H HDR_SIZE, --hbh-opt-hdr
HDR_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that a
Hop-by-Hop Options header is to be included in the outgoing
packet(s). The header size must be specified as an argument
to this option (the <br>
header is filled with padding options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop
Options headers may be specified by means of multiple
&quot;-H&quot; options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y FRAG_SIZE, --frag-hdr
FRAG_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies that the
resulting packet must be fragmented. The fragment size must
be specified as an argument to this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P PAYLOAD_SIZE, --payload-size
PAYLOAD_SIZE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This options specifies the size
of the TCP payload. It defaults to 0 (i.e., empty TCP
segments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o SRC_PORT, --src-port
SRC_PORT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the TCP
Source Port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a DST_PORT, --dst-port
DST_PORT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
TCP/UDP Destination Port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X TCP_FLAGS, --tcp-flags
TCP_FLAGS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">his option is used to set
specific the TCP flags. The flags are specified as
&quot;F&quot; (FIN), &quot;S&quot; (SYN), &quot;R&quot;
(RST), &quot;P&quot; (PSH), &quot;A&quot; (ACK),
&quot;U&quot; (URG), &quot;X&quot; (no flags).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not set, and
the tool operates in listening mode, the flags of the
generated TCP segments are automatically set as follows: TCP
segments elicited by SYNs <br>
have both the SYN and ACK flags set. All other TCP segments
have the ACK bit set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q SEQ_NUMBER, --tcp-seq
SEQ_NUMBER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
Sequence Number of the TCP header. If left unspecified, the
Sequence Number is randomized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is left
unspecified and the tool is operating in listening mode, the
TCP Sequence Number is set to the Acknowledgement Number of
the packet that elicited <br>
the TCP segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q ACK_NUMBER, --tcp-ack
ACK_NUMBER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
Acknowledgment Number of the TCP segment. If left
unspecified, the Acknowledgment Number is randomized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is left
unspecified and the tool is operating in listening mode, the
TCP Sequence Number is set to the Acknowledgement Number of
the packet that elicited <br>
the TCP segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V URG_POINTER, --tcp-urg
URG_POINTER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the Urgent
Pointer of the TCP segment. If left unspecified, the Urgent
Pointer is set to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w TCP_WINDOW, --tcp-win
TCP_WINDOW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the value
of the TCP Window. If left unspecified, the Window is
randomized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W WIN_MODE, --window-mode
WIN_MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies how to
operate the TCP window by means of the WIN_MODE parameter.
Two modes are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ closed <br>
+ modulated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &quot;closed&quot; mode
is selected, the TCP window will be set to 0 (i.e.,
&quot;closed window&quot;). If the tool estabishes new TCP
connections, the initial window advertised dur&acirc; <br>
ing the TCP three-way handshake will be that specified with
the &rsquo;-w&rsquo; option. However, once the connection
has been established, the TCP window will be set to 0. This
<br>
allows for the implementation of the so-called Netkill
attack, discussed in Section 7.1.1 of the document
&quot;Security Assessment of the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP)&quot; <br>
(available at:
&lt;http://www.gont.com.ar/papers/tn-03-09-security-assessment-TCP.pdf&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the &quot;modulated&quot;
mode is selected, the TCP window will oscillate between
alternate between two different values. These values, along
the amount of time that each of <br>
them is &quot;active&quot;, can be specified by means of the
&rsquo;-M&rsquo; (&quot;--win-modulate&quot;) option. The
first of the aforementioned values is meant to close the
window (hence it will typi&acirc; <br>
cally be zero), while the second is meant to open the
window. The goal of alternating between these two values is
to circumvent a trivial mitigation against Zero-Window <br>
attacks implemented by some stacks where they enforce a
limit on the maximum amount of time that the TCP advertised
by a remote peer remains fully-closed (i.e., set to 0). <br>
By changing the advertised window to some other (small)
value every now and then, such a trivial
&quot;counter-measure&quot; can be easily circumvented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M WIN_MOD_MODE,
--win-modulation WIN_MOD_MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the two
values (and their respective duration) over which the TCP
window will alternate. The value WIN_MOD_MODE hast the
syntax <br>
&quot;WIN1:TIME1:WIN2:TIME2&quot;, where the WIN1 and WIN2
parameters specify the window size for each of these
periods, while the TIME1 and TIME2 parameters specify their
respec&acirc; <br>
tive time lengths. For example, setting
&quot;--win-modulation 0:60:10:30&quot; will cause tcp6 to
alternate between advertising a TCP window of 0 bytes for 60
seconds, and adver&acirc; <br>
tising a TCP window of 10 bytes for 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option will be typically
employed along with one of the flooding options
(&quot;--flood-sources&quot; an/or
&quot;--flood-ports&quot;) and the &quot;--data&quot;
option, such that multiple TCP <br>
connections are established, and the target TCPs keep their
retransmission buffer full. In this scenario, the TCP window
&quot;modulation&quot; option can be leveraged to evade <br>
trivial counter-measures implemented by some TCP stacks that
try to mitigate Zero-Window attacks by enforcing a limit on
the maximum amount of time the TCP window can be <br>
in the &quot;closed state&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c OPEN_MODE, --open-mode
OPEN_MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the
connection-establishment mode. The following modes are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ simultaneous <br>
+ passive <br>
+ abort</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the
&quot;simultaneous&quot; mode is selected, tcp6 will respond
to incoming SYN segments with other SYN segments, thus
simulating a &quot;simultaneous open&quot; scenario. When
the <br>
&quot;passive&quot; mode is selected, tcp6 will respond to
incoming SYN segments with the typical SYN/ACK segments,
thus leading to the traditional &quot;three-way
handshake&quot;. Finally, <br>
when the &quot;abort&quot; mode si selected, tcp6 wil
respond to incoming SYN segments with RST segments, thus
aborting the incoming connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the most part, this option
is useful for assessing the correct behavior of TCP
implementations (e.g., support for &quot;simultaneous
opens&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C CLOSE_MODE, --close-mode
CLOSE_MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the the
connection-termination mode. The following modes are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ simultaneous <br>
+ passive <br>
+ abort <br>
+ active <br>
+ FIN-WAIT-1 <br>
+ FIN-WAIT-2 <br>
+ LAST-ACK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the
&quot;simultaneous&quot; mode is selected, tcp6 will respond
to incoming FIN segments with FIN segments, thus simulating
a &quot;simultaneous close&quot; scenario. When the
&quot;passive&quot; <br>
mode is selected, tcp6 will respond to incoming FIN segments
with the typical FIN/ACK segments, thus leading to the
traditional TCP connection-termination sequence. When <br>
the &quot;abort&quot; mode is selected, tcp6 wil respond to
incoming FIN segments with RST segments, thus aborting the
corresponding connections. When the &quot;active&quot; mode
is selected, <br>
tcp6 will start the connection-termination sequence by
sending a FIN segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, and
LAST-ACK modes will result in connections in the FIN-WAIT-1,
FIN-WAIT-2, and LAST-ACK, respectively. It should be noted
that in order for <br>
the remote TCPs to transition to the FIN-WAIT-1 or
FIN-WAIT-2 states, the remote TCPs must perform the
&quot;active close&quot;. This can be trivially triggered
for application pro&acirc; <br>
tocols such as HTTP, but might not be feasible for other
protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z DATA, --data DATA</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is used to specify a
payload that should be sent as the first data segment once a
TCP connection has been established. It will typically
include an applica&acirc; <br>
tion-layer request. Note: the string used for the&quot; and
&quot;0 C-style escape DATA parameter can contain the &quot;
senquenced for representing &quot;carriage return&quot; and
&quot;line feed&quot; <br>
(respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, this option could
be employed to0r0&rsquo;. send an HTTP request if set as
&rsquo;--data &quot;GET / HTTP/1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --not-ack-data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs tcp6 not
to acknowledge the TCP payload of incoming segments (when
operating in listening mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: By default, tcp6 will
acknowledge both the payload and the flags of the incoming
TCP segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --not-ack-flags</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs tcp6 not
to acknowledge the TCP flags (SYN and/or FIN) of incoming
segments (when operating in listening mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: By default, tcp6 will
acknowledge both the payload and the flags of the incoming
TCP segments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j SRC_ADDR, --block-src
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-j prefix/pre&acirc; <br>
fixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified, a
prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 prefix, has <br>
been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k DST_ADDR, --block-dst
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Destination
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-k pre&acirc; <br>
fix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified,
a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 pre&acirc; <br>
fix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-J LINK_ADDR, --block-link-src
LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Source
Address. The option must be followed by a link-layer address
(currently, only <br>
Ethernet is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K LINK_ADDR, --block-link-dst
LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a block filter
for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer
Destination Address. The option must be followed by a
link-layer address (currently, <br>
only Ethernet is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b SRC_ADDR, --accept-src
SRC_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-b prefix/pre&acirc; <br>
fixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified, a
prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 prefix, has <br>
been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g DST_ADDR, --accept-dst
DST_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets a accept filter
for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Destination
Address. It allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in
the form &quot;-g pre&acirc; <br>
fix/prefixlen&quot;. If the prefix length is not specified,
a prefix length of &quot;/128&quot; is selected (i.e., the
option assumes that a single IPv6 address, rather than an
IPv6 pre&acirc; <br>
fix, has been specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B LINK_ADDR, --accept-link-src
LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer
Source Address. The option must be followed by a link-layer
address (currently, only <br>
Ethernet is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G LINK_ADDR, --accept-link-dst
LINK_ADDR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option sets an accept
filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer
Destination Address. The option must be followed by a
link-layer address (currently, <br>
only Ethernet is supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F N_SOURCES, --flood-sources
N_SOURCES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the tool
to send multiple TCP segments with different Source
Addresses. The number of different source addresses is
specified as &quot;-F number&quot;. The <br>
Source Address of each TCP segment is randomly selected from
the prefix specified by the &quot;-s&quot; option. If the
&quot;-F&quot; option is specified but the &quot;-s&quot;
option is left unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied, the Source Address of the packets is randomly selected
from the prefix ::/0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T N_PORTS, --flood-ports
N_PORTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the tool
to send multiple TCP segments with different Source Ports.
The Source Port of each TCP segment is randomly selected
from the whole port num&acirc; <br>
ber space (0-65535).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --loop</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the tcp6
tool to send periodic TCP segments to the victim node. The
amount of time to pause between sending TCP segments can be
specified by means of <br>
the &quot;-z&quot; option, and defaults to 1 second. Note
that this option cannot be set in conjunction with the
&quot;-L&quot; (&quot;--listen&quot;) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --sleep</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the amount
of time to pause between sending TCP segments (when the
&quot;--loop&quot; option is set). If left unspecified, it
defaults to 1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r RATE, --rate-limit RATE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option specifies the rate
limit to use when performing a remote address scan.
&quot;RATE&quot; should be specified as &quot;xbps&quot; or
&quot;xpps&quot; (with &quot;x&quot; being an unsigned
integer), for <br>
rate-limits in bits per second or packets per second,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L, --listen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This instructs the tcp6 tool to
operate in listening mode (possibly after attacking a given
node). Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction
with the &quot;-l&quot; <br>
(&quot;--loop&quot;) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PROBE_MODE, --probe-mode
PROBE_MODE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs tcp6 to
operate in probe mode. The specific probe mode is specified
as an argument to this option (currently, only
&quot;script&quot; mode is supported). In <br>
probe mode, tcp6 sends probe segments, and waits for
response packets. The response packets are decoded based on
the selected probe mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the &quot;script&quot; probe
mode, the tool decodes TCP segments as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESPONSE:RESPONSE_TYPE:RESPONSE_DECODE...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where the string RESPONSE is
fixed, and RESPONSE_TYPE indicates the response received. As
of this version of the tool, the following RESPONSE_TYPE
values are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ TCP6: Indicates that the tool
received a TCP/IPv6 packet <br>
+ TIMEOUT: Indicates that the tool received no response</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If RESPONSE_TYPE is TCP6,
RESPONSE code contains the TCP flags set in the receive TCP
segment. The TCP flags are encoded as &quot;F&quot; (FIN),
&quot;S&quot; (SYN), &quot;R&quot; (RST), &quot;P&quot;
(PSH), &quot;A&quot; <br>
(ACK), and &quot;U&quot; (URG).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Possibe output lines of the tool
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESPONSE:TIMEOUT: <br>
RESPONSE:TCP6:RA:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Future versions of the
tool will also decode ICMPv6 error messages, and will
include additional data regarding the incoming TCP segments
(e.g., ACK value, payload <br>
size, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs the tcp6
tool to be verbose. When the option is set twice, the tool
is &quot;very verbose&quot;, and the tool also informs which
packets have been accepted or <br>
discarded as a result of applying the specified filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print help information for the
tcp6 tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the
tcp6 tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcp6 -s fc00:1::/64 -d
fc00:1::1 -a 22 -X S -F 100 -l -z 1 -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example the tcp6 tool is
essentially employed to perform a SYN-flood attack against
port number 22 of the host fc00:1::1. The tool uses the
network interface &quot;eth0&quot; (as <br>
specified by the &quot;-i&quot; option), and sends SYN
segments (as specified by the &quot;-X&quot; option) from
the prefix fc00:1::/64 (as specified by the &quot;-s&quot;
option) to port 22 (specified by the <br>
&quot;-a&quot; option) at the destination address fc00:1::1
(specified by the &quot;-d&quot; option). The tool sends TCP
segments from 100 different addresses (as specified by the
&quot;-F&quot; option) every <br>
one second (as specified by the &quot;-l&quot; and
&quot;-z&quot; options). The tool will be verbose (as
specified by the &quot;-v&quot; option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcp6 -i eth0 -L -X RA -v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this example, the tcp6 tool
is employed to perform a TCP connection-reset attack against
all active TCP connections in the local network. The tool
listens (&quot;-L&quot;) on the <br>
interface eth0 (&quot;-i eth0&quot;), and responds to any
TCP segments with a RST packet (with both the RST and ACK
bits set). The tool will be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcp6 -i eth0 -d fc00:1::1 -a
80 -L -s fc00:1::/112 -l -r0r0 --close-mode last-ack 1pps -v
--data &quot;GET / HTTP/1.0 --flood-ports 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flood the target system
(fc00:1::1) with connections that stay in the LAST-ACK state
(on port 80), sending packets at a rate of one packet per
second. For each forged address, 10 <br>
different (forged) ports are used. For each connection, tcp6
will send an HTTP application request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcp6 -i eth0 -d fc00:1::1 -a
80 -L -s fc00:1::/112 -l -r0r0 1000pps --tcp-flags auto -v
--data &quot;GET / HTTP/1.0 --flood-ports 10 --window-mode
close</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flood the target node
(fc00:1::1) with TCP connections (on port 80). On each
connection that is established, an HTTP request is sent, and
the TCP window is immediately closed. <br>
For each forged IPv6 source address ten different TCP source
ports are randomized. The bandwidth of the attack is limited
to 1000 pps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example #5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># tcp6 -d fc00:1::1 -a 80
--tcp-flags A --dst-opt-hdr 8 --payload-size 50 --probe-mode
script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send a probe TCP segment to TCP
port 80 at fc00:1::1. The probe packet consists of an IPv6
packet with a Destination Options header of 8 bytes, and an
IPv6 payload consisting of <br>
a TCP segment with the ACK bit set, and 50 data bytes. The
probe mode is &quot;script&quot;.</p>
