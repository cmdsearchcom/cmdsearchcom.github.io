<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
DMitry - Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dmitry [Options] host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
DMitry (Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool) is a
UNIX/(GNU)Linux command line application with the ability to
gather as much information as possible about a host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic functionality of DMitry
allows for information to be gathered about a target host
from a simple whois lookup on the target to uptime reports
and TCP portscans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The application is considered a
tool to assist in information gathering when information is
required quickly by removing the need to enter multiple
commands and the timely <br>
process of searching through data from multiple sources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options should be passed to DMitry in the form of
&rsquo;-option&rsquo;. Only options known by DMitry will be
used and others will be ignored. If options are not passed
as a group block, <br>
the trailing options will be considered a host target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Create an ascii text output of the results to the filename
specified. If no output filename is specified then output
will be saved to &quot;target.txt&quot;. If this option is
not <br>
specified in any form output will be sent to the standard
output (STDOUT) by default. This option MUST trail all other
options, i.e. &quot;dmitry -winseo target&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Perform an Internet Number
whois lookup on the target IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Perform a whois lookup on the
host target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Retrieve netcraft.com data
concerning the host, this includes operating system, web
server release and uptime information where available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Perform a subdomain search on
the specified target. This will use serveral search engines
to attempt to locate subdomains in the form of sub.target.
There is no set <br>
limit to the level of subdomain that can be located,
however, there is a maximum string length of 40 characters
(NCOL 40) to limit memory usage. Possible subdomains are
<br>
then reversed to an IP address, if this comes back positive
then the resulting subdomain is listed. However, if the host
uses an asterisk in their DNS records all resolve <br>
subdomains will come back positive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Perform an e-mail address
search on the specified target. This modules works using the
same concept as the subdomain search by attempting to locate
possible e-mail <br>
addresses for a target host. The e-mail addresses may also
be for possible subdomains of the target host. There is a
limit to the length of the e-mail address set to 50 <br>
characters (NCOL 50) to limit memory usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Perform a TCP portscan on the
host target. This module will list open, closed and filtered
ports within a specific range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f This option will cause the
TCP portscan module to report/display output of filtered
ports. These are usually ports that have been filtered
and/or closed by a firewall at <br>
the specified host/target. This option requires that the
&rsquo;-p&rsquo; option be passed as a previous option. For
example, &quot;dmitry -pf target&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b This option will cause the
TCP portscan module to output banners if they are received
when scanning TCP ports. This option requires that the
&rsquo;-p&rsquo; option be passed as a <br>
previous option. For example, &quot;dmitry -pb
target&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t This sets the Time To Live
(TTL) of the portscan module when scanning individual ports.
This is set to 2 seconds by default. This is usually
required when scanning a <br>
host that has a firewall and/or has filtered ports which can
slow down a scan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This section presents some example queries that can be made
using dmitry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmitry -w mydomain.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will perform a named whois
(INIC-WHOIS) lookup on the target host, displaying results
to the standard output (STDOUT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmitry -winsepo sometextfile.txt
mydomain.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will perform all the basic
functions on the target host and store all the output into
&quot;sometextfile.txt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmitry -winsepo mydomain.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will perform all the basic
functions on the target host and store all the output into
&quot;mydomain.txt&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dmitry -winsepfbo 127.0.0.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will perform all the basic
functions on the target host and store all the output into
&quot;127.0.0.1.txt&quot;. This will also display banners
and show filtered ports.</p>
