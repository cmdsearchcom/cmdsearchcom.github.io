perlpodstyle - Perl POD style guide
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
These are general guidelines for how to write POD documentation for Perl scripts
  and modules, based on general guidelines for writing good UNIX man pages. All
  of these guidelines are, of course, optional, but following them will make
  your documentation more consistent with other documentation on the system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The name of the program being documented is conventionally written in bold
  (using B&lt;&gt;) wherever it occurs, as are all program options. Arguments
  should be written in italics (I&lt;&gt;). Function names are traditionally
  written in italics; if you write a function as <i>function()</i>, Pod::Man
  will take care of this for you. Literal code or commands should be in
  C&lt;&gt;. References to other man pages should be in the form
  &quot;manpage(section)&quot; or &quot;L&lt;manpage(section)&gt;&quot;, and
  Pod::Man will automatically format those appropriately. The second form, with
  L&lt;&gt;, is used to request that a POD formatter make a link to the man page
  if possible. As an exception, one normally omits the section when referring to
  module documentation since it's not clear what section module documentation
  will be in; use &quot;L&lt;Module::Name&gt;&quot; for module references
  instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
References to other programs or functions are normally in the form of man page
  references so that cross-referencing tools can provide the user with links and
  the like. It's possible to overdo this, though, so be careful not to clutter
  your documentation with too much markup. References to other programs that are
  not given as man page references should be enclosed in B&lt;&gt;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The major headers should be set out using a &quot;=head1&quot; directive, and
  are historically written in the rather startling ALL UPPER CASE format; this
  is not mandatory, but it's strongly recommended so that sections have
  consistent naming across different software packages. Minor headers may be
  included using &quot;=head2&quot;, and are typically in mixed case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The standard sections of a manual page are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">NAME</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Mandatory section; should be a comma-separated list of
      programs or functions documented by this POD page, such as:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    foo, bar - programs to do something
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Manual page indexers are often extremely picky about the format of this
      section, so don't put anything in it except this line. Every program or
      function documented by this POD page should be listed, separated by a
      comma and a space. For a Perl module, just give the module name. A single
      dash, and only a single dash, should separate the list of programs or
      functions from the description. Do not use any markup such as C&lt;&gt; or
      B&lt;&gt; anywhere in this line. Functions should not be qualified with
      &quot;()&quot; or the like. The description should ideally fit on a single
      line, even if a man program replaces the dash with a few tabs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SYNOPSIS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A short usage summary for programs and functions. This
      section is mandatory for section 3 pages. For Perl module documentation,
      it's usually convenient to have the contents of this section be a verbatim
      block showing some (brief) examples of typical ways the module is
    used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">DESCRIPTION</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Extended description and discussion of the program or
      functions, or the body of the documentation for man pages that document
      something else. If particularly long, it's a good idea to break this up
      into subsections &quot;=head2&quot; directives like:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    =head2 Normal Usage
    =head2 Advanced Features
    =head2 Writing Configuration Files
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    or whatever is appropriate for your documentation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For a module, this is generally where the documentation of the interfaces
      provided by the module goes, usually in the form of a list with an
      &quot;=item&quot; for each interface. Depending on how many interfaces
      there are, you may want to put that documentation in separate METHODS,
      FUNCTIONS, CLASS METHODS, or INSTANCE METHODS sections instead and save
      the DESCRIPTION section for an overview.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">OPTIONS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Detailed description of each of the command-line options
      taken by the program. This should be separate from the description for the
      use of parsers like Pod::Usage. This is normally presented as a list, with
      each option as a separate &quot;=item&quot;. The specific option string
      should be enclosed in B&lt;&gt;. Any values that the option takes should
      be enclosed in I&lt;&gt;. For example, the section for the option
      <b>--section</b>= <i>manext</i> would be introduced with:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    =item B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Synonymous options (like both the short and long forms) are separated by a
      comma and a space on the same &quot;=item&quot; line, or optionally listed
      as their own item with a reference to the canonical name. For example,
      since <b>--section</b> can also be written as <b>-s</b>, the above would
      be:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    =item B&lt;-s&gt; I&lt;manext&gt;, B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Writing the short option first is recommended because it's easier to read.
      The long option is long enough to draw the eye to it anyway and the short
      option can otherwise get lost in visual noise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RETURN VALUE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">What the program or function returns, if successful. This
      section can be omitted for programs whose precise exit codes aren't
      important, provided they return 0 on success and non-zero on failure as is
      standard. It should always be present for functions. For modules, it may
      be useful to summarize return values from the module interface here, or it
      may be more useful to discuss return values separately in the
      documentation of each function or method the module provides.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ERRORS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Exceptions, error return codes, exit statuses, and errno
      settings. Typically used for function or module documentation; program
      documentation uses DIAGNOSTICS instead. The general rule of thumb is that
      errors printed to &quot;STDOUT&quot; or &quot;STDERR&quot; and intended
      for the end user are documented in DIAGNOSTICS while errors passed
      internal to the calling program and intended for other programmers are
      documented in ERRORS. When documenting a function that sets errno, a full
      list of the possible errno values should be given here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">DIAGNOSTICS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">All possible messages the program can print out and what
      they mean. You may wish to follow the same documentation style as the Perl
      documentation; see <i>perldiag</i>(1) for more details (and look at the
      POD source as well).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If applicable, please include details on what the user should do to correct
      the error; documenting an error as indicating &quot;the input buffer is
      too small&quot; without telling the user how to increase the size of the
      input buffer (or at least telling them that it isn't possible) aren't very
      useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">EXAMPLES</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Give some example uses of the program or function. Don't
      skimp; users often find this the most useful part of the documentation.
      The examples are generally given as verbatim paragraphs.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Don't just present an example without explaining what it does. Adding a
      short paragraph saying what the example will do can increase the value of
      the example immensely.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">ENVIRONMENT</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Environment variables that the program cares about,
      normally presented as a list using &quot;=over&quot;, &quot;=item&quot;,
      and &quot;=back&quot;. For example:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    =over 6
    =item HOME
    Used to determine the user's home directory.  F&lt;.foorc&gt; in this
    directory is read for configuration details, if it exists.
    =back
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Since environment variables are normally in all uppercase, no additional
      special formatting is generally needed; they're glaring enough as it
    is.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">FILES</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">All files used by the program or function, normally
      presented as a list, and what it uses them for. File names should be
      enclosed in F&lt;&gt;. It's particularly important to document files that
      will be potentially modified.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">CAVEATS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Things to take special care with, sometimes called
      WARNINGS.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">BUGS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Things that are broken or just don't work quite right.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">RESTRICTIONS</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Bugs you don't plan to fix. :-)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">NOTES</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Miscellaneous commentary.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">AUTHOR</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Who wrote it (use AUTHORS for multiple people). It's a good
      idea to include your current e-mail address (or some e-mail address to
      which bug reports should be sent) or some other contact information so
      that users have a way of contacting you. Remember that program
      documentation tends to roam the wild for far longer than you expect and
      pick a contact method that's likely to last.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">HISTORY</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Programs derived from other sources sometimes have this.
      Some people keep a modification log here, but that usually gets long and
      is normally better maintained in a separate file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">For copyright
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    Copyright YEAR(s) YOUR NAME(s)
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    (No, (C) is not needed. No, &quot;all rights reserved&quot; is not needed.)
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For licensing the easiest way is to use the same licensing as Perl itself:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
    This library is free software; you may redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the same terms as Perl itself.
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This makes it easy for people to use your module with Perl. Note that this
      licensing example is neither an endorsement or a requirement, you are of
      course free to choose any licensing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">SEE ALSO</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Other man pages to check out, like <i>man</i>(1),
      <i>man</i>(7), <i>makewhatis</i>(8), or <i>catman</i>(8). Normally a
      simple list of man pages separated by commas, or a paragraph giving the
      name of a reference work. Man page references, if they use the standard
      &quot;name(section)&quot; form, don't have to be enclosed in L&lt;&gt;
      (although it's recommended), but other things in this section probably
      should be when appropriate.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the package has a mailing list, include a URL or subscription
      instructions here.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the package has a web site, include a URL here.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Documentation of object-oriented libraries or modules may want to use
  CONSTRUCTORS and METHODS sections, or CLASS METHODS and INSTANCE METHODS
  sections, for detailed documentation of the parts of the library and save the
  DESCRIPTION section for an overview. Large modules with a function interface
  may want to use FUNCTIONS for similar reasons. Some people use OVERVIEW to
  summarize the description if it's quite long.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Section ordering varies, although NAME must always be the first section (you'll
  break some man page systems otherwise), and NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, and
  OPTIONS generally always occur first and in that order if present. In general,
  SEE ALSO, AUTHOR, and similar material should be left for last. Some systems
  also move WARNINGS and NOTES to last. The order given above should be
  reasonable for most purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some systems use CONFORMING TO to note conformance to relevant standards and
  MT-LEVEL to note safeness for use in threaded programs or signal handlers.
  These headings are primarily useful when documenting parts of a C library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, as a general note, try not to use an excessive amount of markup. As
  documented here and in Pod::Man, you can safely leave Perl variables, function
  names, man page references, and the like unadorned by markup and the POD
  translators will figure it out for you. This makes it much easier to later
  edit the documentation. Note that many existing translators will do the wrong
  thing with e-mail addresses when wrapped in L&lt;&gt;, so don't do that.

  see either <i>man</i>(5) or <i>man</i>(7) depending on your system manual
  section numbering conventions.
