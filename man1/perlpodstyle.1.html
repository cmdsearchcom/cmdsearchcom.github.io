<p>PERLPODSTYLE(1) User Contributed Perl Documentation
PERLPODSTYLE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlpodstyle - Perl POD style guide</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
These are general guidelines for how to write POD
documentation for Perl scripts and modules, based on general
guidelines for writing good UNIX man pages. All of these
<br>
guidelines are, of course, optional, but following them will
make your documentation more consistent with other
documentation on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the program being
documented is conventionally written in bold (using
B&lt;&gt;) wherever it occurs, as are all program options.
Arguments should be written in italics <br>
(I&lt;&gt;). Function names are traditionally written in
italics; if you write a function as function(), Pod::Man
will take care of this for you. Literal code or commands
should be <br>
in C&lt;&gt;. References to other man pages should be in the
form &quot;manpage(section)&quot; or
&quot;L&lt;manpage(section)&gt;&quot;, and Pod::Man will
automatically format those appropriately. The second <br>
form, with L&lt;&gt;, is used to request that a POD
formatter make a link to the man page if possible. As an
exception, one normally omits the section when referring to
module <br>
documentation since it&rsquo;s not clear what section module
documentation will be in; use
&quot;L&lt;Module::Name&gt;&quot; for module references
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">References to other programs or
functions are normally in the form of man page references so
that cross-referencing tools can provide the user with links
and the like. It&rsquo;s <br>
possible to overdo this, though, so be careful not to
clutter your documentation with too much markup. References
to other programs that are not given as man page references
<br>
should be enclosed in B&lt;&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The major headers should be set
out using a &quot;=head1&quot; directive, and are
historically written in the rather startling ALL UPPER CASE
format; this is not mandatory, but it&rsquo;s <br>
strongly recommended so that sections have consistent naming
across different software packages. Minor headers may be
included using &quot;=head2&quot;, and are typically in
mixed case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The standard sections of a
manual page are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Mandatory section; should be a comma-separated list of
programs or functions documented by this POD page, such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo, bar - programs to do
something</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Manual page indexers are often
extremely picky about the format of this section, so
don&rsquo;t put anything in it except this line. Every
program or function documented by this <br>
POD page should be listed, separated by a comma and a space.
For a Perl module, just give the module name. A single dash,
and only a single dash, should separate the list <br>
of programs or functions from the description. Do not use
any markup such as C&lt;&gt; or B&lt;&gt; anywhere in this
line. Functions should not be qualified with &quot;()&quot;
or the like. The <br>
description should ideally fit on a single line, even if a
man program replaces the dash with a few tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
A short usage summary for programs and functions. This
section is mandatory for section 3 pages. For Perl module
documentation, it&rsquo;s usually convenient to have the
contents <br>
of this section be a verbatim block showing some (brief)
examples of typical ways the module is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Extended description and discussion of the program or
functions, or the body of the documentation for man pages
that document something else. If particularly long,
it&rsquo;s a <br>
good idea to break this up into subsections
&quot;=head2&quot; directives like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=head2 Normal Usage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=head2 Advanced Features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=head2 Writing Configuration
Files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or whatever is appropriate for
your documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a module, this is generally
where the documentation of the interfaces provided by the
module goes, usually in the form of a list with an
&quot;=item&quot; for each interface. <br>
Depending on how many interfaces there are, you may want to
put that documentation in separate METHODS, FUNCTIONS, CLASS
METHODS, or INSTANCE METHODS sections instead and <br>
save the DESCRIPTION section for an overview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Detailed description of each of the command-line options
taken by the program. This should be separate from the
description for the use of parsers like Pod::Usage. This is
<br>
normally presented as a list, with each option as a separate
&quot;=item&quot;. The specific option string should be
enclosed in B&lt;&gt;. Any values that the option takes
should be <br>
enclosed in I&lt;&gt;. For example, the section for the
option --section=manext would be introduced with:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=item
B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synonymous options (like both
the short and long forms) are separated by a comma and a
space on the same &quot;=item&quot; line, or optionally
listed as their own item with a reference <br>
to the canonical name. For example, since --section can also
be written as -s, the above would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=item B&lt;-s&gt;
I&lt;manext&gt;, B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Writing the short option first
is recommended because it&rsquo;s easier to read. The long
option is long enough to draw the eye to it anyway and the
short option can otherwise get <br>
lost in visual noise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
What the program or function returns, if successful. This
section can be omitted for programs whose precise exit codes
aren&rsquo;t important, provided they return 0 on success
<br>
and non-zero on failure as is standard. It should always be
present for functions. For modules, it may be useful to
summarize return values from the module interface here, <br>
or it may be more useful to discuss return values separately
in the documentation of each function or method the module
provides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS <br>
Exceptions, error return codes, exit statuses, and errno
settings. Typically used for function or module
documentation; program documentation uses DIAGNOSTICS
instead. The <br>
general rule of thumb is that errors printed to
&quot;STDOUT&quot; or &quot;STDERR&quot; and intended for
the end user are documented in DIAGNOSTICS while errors
passed internal to the calling <br>
program and intended for other programmers are documented in
ERRORS. When documenting a function that sets errno, a full
list of the possible errno values should be given <br>
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All possible messages the program can print out and what
they mean. You may wish to follow the same documentation
style as the Perl documentation; see perldiag(1) for more
<br>
details (and look at the POD source as well).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If applicable, please include
details on what the user should do to correct the error;
documenting an error as indicating &quot;the input buffer is
too small&quot; without telling the <br>
user how to increase the size of the input buffer (or at
least telling them that it isn&rsquo;t possible)
aren&rsquo;t very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Give some example uses of the program or function.
Don&rsquo;t skimp; users often find this the most useful
part of the documentation. The examples are generally given
as <br>
verbatim paragraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t just present an
example without explaining what it does. Adding a short
paragraph saying what the example will do can increase the
value of the example immensely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables that the program cares about, normally
presented as a list using &quot;=over&quot;,
&quot;=item&quot;, and &quot;=back&quot;. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=over 6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=item HOME</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used to determine the
user&rsquo;s home directory. F&lt;.foorc&gt; in this <br>
directory is read for configuration details, if it
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">=back</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since environment variables are
normally in all uppercase, no additional special formatting
is generally needed; they&rsquo;re glaring enough as it
is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
All files used by the program or function, normally
presented as a list, and what it uses them for. File names
should be enclosed in F&lt;&gt;. It&rsquo;s particularly
important to <br>
document files that will be potentially modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Things to take special care with, sometimes called
WARNINGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Things that are broken or just don&rsquo;t work quite
right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Bugs you don&rsquo;t plan to fix. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Miscellaneous commentary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Who wrote it (use AUTHORS for multiple people). It&rsquo;s a
good idea to include your current e-mail address (or some
e-mail address to which bug reports should be sent) or some
<br>
other contact information so that users have a way of
contacting you. Remember that program documentation tends to
roam the wild for far longer than you expect and pick a <br>
contact method that&rsquo;s likely to last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Programs derived from other sources sometimes have this.
Some people keep a modification log here, but that usually
gets long and is normally better maintained in a separate
<br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE <br>
For copyright</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copyright YEAR(s) YOUR
NAME(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(No, (C) is not needed. No,
&quot;all rights reserved&quot; is not needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For licensing the easiest way is
to use the same licensing as Perl itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This library is free software;
you may redistribute it and/or modify <br>
it under the same terms as Perl itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes it easy for people to
use your module with Perl. Note that this licensing example
is neither an endorsement or a requirement, you are of
course free to choose any <br>
licensing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Other man pages to check out, like man(1), man(7),
makewhatis(8), or catman(8). Normally a simple list of man
pages separated by commas, or a paragraph giving the name of
a <br>
reference work. Man page references, if they use the
standard &quot;name(section)&quot; form, don&rsquo;t have to
be enclosed in L&lt;&gt; (although it&rsquo;s recommended),
but other things in this <br>
section probably should be when appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the package has a mailing
list, include a URL or subscription instructions here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the package has a web site,
include a URL here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation of object-oriented
libraries or modules may want to use CONSTRUCTORS and
METHODS sections, or CLASS METHODS and INSTANCE METHODS
sections, for detailed <br>
documentation of the parts of the library and save the
DESCRIPTION section for an overview. Large modules with a
function interface may want to use FUNCTIONS for similar
<br>
reasons. Some people use OVERVIEW to summarize the
description if it&rsquo;s quite long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section ordering varies,
although NAME must always be the first section (you&rsquo;ll
break some man page systems otherwise), and NAME, SYNOPSIS,
DESCRIPTION, and OPTIONS generally <br>
always occur first and in that order if present. In general,
SEE ALSO, AUTHOR, and similar material should be left for
last. Some systems also move WARNINGS and NOTES to last.
<br>
The order given above should be reasonable for most
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some systems use CONFORMING TO
to note conformance to relevant standards and MT-LEVEL to
note safeness for use in threaded programs or signal
handlers. These headings are <br>
primarily useful when documenting parts of a C library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, as a general note, try
not to use an excessive amount of markup. As documented here
and in Pod::Man, you can safely leave Perl variables,
function names, man page <br>
references, and the like unadorned by markup and the POD
translators will figure it out for you. This makes it much
easier to later edit the documentation. Note that many <br>
existing translators will do the wrong thing with e-mail
addresses when wrapped in L&lt;&gt;, so don&rsquo;t do
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
For additional information that may be more accurate for
your specific system, see either man(5) or man(7) depending
on your system manual section numbering conventions.</p>
