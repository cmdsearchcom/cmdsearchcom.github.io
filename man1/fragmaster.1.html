 fragmaster [options]
 Create EPS and PDF files with embedded psfrag substitutions.
 Options:
  -h,--help          Brief usage guide.
  -m,--man           Show full man page (needs perldoc)
  --clean            Clean auto-generated $basename.{eps,pdf} files.
  --debug            Show more info and leave temporary files behind.
  --force            Rebuild everything ignoring modification times.
  --dirfm=file       Use given file as optional per-directory
                     fragmaster fm control file instead of default

<b>fragmaster</b> is a perl script that helps using psfrag constructs with
  <b>pdflatex</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>psfrag</b> is a LaTeX package which allows to replace text elements in
  included EPS graphics by arbitrary LaTeX output. Because <b>psfrag</b> uses
  PostScript for making the replacements, in principle you can't use
  <b>psfrag</b> with <b>pdflatex</b> which doesn't have any interfaces to
  PostScript.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fragmaster</b> produces a new EPS from your original EPS which already
  contains all those <b>psfrag</b> replacements. This new EPS graphic actually
  can be converted to PDF including all replacements. The resulting
  &quot;encapsulated&quot; PDF can then be used with pdflatex.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>fragmaster</b> will scan the current directory for files which end in
  <i>_fm</i> and have a <i>_fm.eps</i> counterpart. Looking at the modification
  dates, the script checks if the output files have to be rebuilt and does so if
  necessary (a little like &quot;make&quot; would do it).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In your LaTeX document you can include the produced graphics using
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 \includegraphics{&lt;graphics&gt;}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
conveniently omitting file extension. <b>latex</b> will choose the EPS,
  <b>pdflatex</b> will choose the PDF.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="fragmaster_control_file_and_other_related_files."><a class="selflink" href="#fragmaster_control_file_and_other_related_files."><b>fragmaster</b>
  control file and other related files.</a></h2>
To use the script you have to create two files per graphic:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    * &lt;graphics&gt;_fm.eps: the EPS file itself,
    * &lt;graphics&gt;_fm: a fragmaster control file.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
From these files the psfragged graphics will be created:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    * &lt;graphics&gt;.eps,
    * &lt;graphics&gt;.pdf
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>_fm</i> control file is basically a LaTeX file (with optionally special
  comments) and can look like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 % Just an ordinary comment
 %
 % Some special comments:
 % fmclass: book
 % fmclassopt: 11pt
 % fmopt: width=6cm
 %
 % Another special comment:
 % head:
 % \usepackage{amsmath}
 % end head
 % psfrag commands:
 \psfrag{x}{$x$}
 \psfrag{y}{$y = x^2$}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special comment &quot;fmclass:&quot; will make the script use given class
  instead of default &quot;article&quot; class.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Special comment &quot;fmclassopt:&quot; will make the script use given options
  as class options instead of default &quot;12pt&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special comment &quot;fmopt:&quot; will be evaluated such that the following
  text will by passed as optional argument to &quot;\includegraphics&quot;. This
  way you can e.g. adjust the relation between graphics size and font size using
  something like &quot;fmopt: width=6cm&quot;. No global default for this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The special comment construct &quot;head:/end head&quot; causes the lines in
  between to be included in the preamble of the LaTeX temporary document after
  having the leading comment characters &quot;%&quot; stripped off. This way,
  you can include LaTeX packages, as in &quot;\usepackage{amsmath}&quot;. No
  global default for this.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Per-directory_fragmaster_dir_control_file."><a class="selflink" href="#Per-directory_fragmaster_dir_control_file.">Per-directory
  <b>fragmaster</b> dir control file.</a></h2>
You can set per-directory &quot;fmclass:&quot;, &quot;fmclassopt:&quot;,
  &quot;fmopt:&quot; and &quot;head:/end head&quot; options by means of a
  per-directory fragmaster control file <i>fragmaster.dfm</i> with similar
  syntax as above. You can use another file by means of the <b>--dirfm</b>
  option. Note that options set this way are mutually exclusive, any option set
  in per-file <i>_fm</i> file will completely override associated option in
  per-directory file, and options set in per-directory file will override
  initial defaults (&quot;\documentclass[12pt]{article}&quot;). Empty options
  are ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is work in progress and still needs extensive checking. Double-check that
  modification date based rebuilds are working properly.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KNOWN_PROBLEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#KNOWN_PROBLEMS">KNOWN
  PROBLEMS</a></h1>
In case the EPS will be produced as landscape graphics, i.e. <b>gv</b> shows
  <i>Landscape</i> instead of <i>Portrait</i> in the menu bar, and the graphic
  will end up turned around 90 degrees in your document, then it is likely that
  your original EPS is wider than it is tall. In this case some (more recent)
  versions of <b>dvips</b> make the &quot;smart&quot; assumption that your
  graphic is landscape, even though the graphic's proportions don't tell
  anything about the orientation of its contents... This still can happen in
  case your input EPS matches a standard paper size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Anyway, you can make <b>dvips</b> behave nicer by specifying the following line
  in <i>/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.pdf</i> (or a local equivalent
  inside <i>/usr/local/share/texmf</i>):
<div class="Pp"></div>
@ custom 0pt 0pt
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the likely case that you're wondering why, I'd recommend the <b>dvipsk</b>
  sources warmly to you...
