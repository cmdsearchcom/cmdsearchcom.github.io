<p>XCircuit(1) General Commands Manual XCircuit(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xcircuit - Draw circuit schematics or almost anything; make
circuit netlists from schematics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xcircuit [filename[,...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program xcircuit is a generic drawing program tailored
especially for making publication-quality renderings of
circuit diagrams (hence the name). The output is pure
Post&acirc; <br>
Script, and the graphical interface attempts to maintain as
much consistency as possible between the X11 window
rendering and the final printer output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcircuit is mouse, menu, and
keyboard-driven, with the emphasis on single-character
keyboard macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
filename[,...] <br>
Begin running xcircuit by loading in the PostScript file
filename. If filename does not have a .ps extension,
xcircuit will attempt to look for both the filename as <br>
entered and, upon failure, with the .ps extension. The file
must be in xcircuit format. filename may also be a
comma-separated list of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASIC ELEMENTS <br>
There are five drawing elements. These are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a) polygon (multiple lines which
may or may not be closed and filled)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b) arc (ellipse segment which
may be closed and/or filled as above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c) label (any text)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d) curve (based on the
PostScript &quot;curveto&quot; algorithm)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e) object instance (see
below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two composite
elements, which are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f) path (a connected series of
polygons, arcs, and curves)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g) object (something containing
polygons, arcs, labels, curves, paths, and instances of
other objects)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MOUSE BUTTONS <br>
The mouse button system, the object library, and the paged
buffer system are loosely based on the Caltech
circuit-simulation program &quot;log&quot; (either
&quot;analog&quot; or &quot;diglog&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The general idea is to make the
most commonly-used functions the easiest to perform, and (to
the extent possible) to scale (inversely) the complexity of
performing a function <br>
with the frequency of that task. Because this program is
tailored to circuit drawing, the most common functions are
drawing lines and moving object instances. The next most
<br>
common function is selection of elements singly or in
groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse button 1 can be tapped to
start a connected chain of lines, the most common drawing
function. In addition, button 1 has a function called
&quot;grab&quot;, which occurs after the <br>
button has been continually pressed for a short length of
time (about 1/5 second). As the name implies,
&quot;grab&quot; grabs hold of an element which can then be
moved around the <br>
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button 2 can be used to select
an item if tapped, and if pressed and held down, a box will
be drawn and everything inside that box selected when the
button is released. In all <br>
other cases, button 2 will complete a command. For users who
have only two mouse buttons and do not emulate the middle
mouse button with the combination of buttons 1 and 3, use
<br>
the combination of the Shift key and mouse button 1 to
emulate mouse button 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Button 3 will normally abort a
command. During editing of an arc, spline, or polygon,
button 3 will revert back to the previous form, or abort if
there is no remaining edit his&acirc; <br>
tory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other commands are available
from the pulldown menus and/or from the keyboard using
single-key macros (with easy-to-remember mnemonics).
Keyboard commands are quicker, since <br>
they act on the present cursor position, whereas menu
commands require an extra step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUILT-IN LIBRARY <br>
The library is intended to provide a convenient way to store
and retrieve elements of a picture which will be used more
than once. For the application of circuit drawing, a <br>
built-in library provides basic objects such as transistors,
amplifiers, resistors, capacitors, arrows, circles, power
and ground symbols, and the like. This file is a composite
<br>
of several library files (such as &quot;builtins.lps&quot;,
&quot;analog.lps&quot;, and &quot;digital.lps&quot;) which
are called by the startup script (&quot;xcstartup.tcl&quot;)
The program first looks for the <br>
startup script in the current directory, and then searches
in the directory given by the environment variable
&quot;XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR&quot;, and finally, in the hard-coded
global directory <br>
(/usr/lib64) if it could not find it elsewhere. Thus each
user can add to or modify the file of builtins to reflect
personal taste. Since the PostScript output contains all
<br>
object definitions, these changes to the built-in functions
are inherently transferrable. Xcircuit will automatically
resolve conflicts between objects having the same name but
<br>
different contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The library is accesible from
the pull-down menu or with the &quot;l&quot; keyboard macro.
When inside the library, clicking the first mouse button on
an object &quot;grabs&quot; that object and <br>
returns the graphics state immediately to the page being
edited, so that the object will be placed when the mouse
button is released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZOOMING <br>
Xcircuit has unconstrained zooming and snap-to positioning.
Objects scale completely: line widths and text sizes will
increase/decrease proportionally with the zoom, as well as
<br>
dot/dash spacing and all other features. Xcircuit does have
a minimum integer grid in coordinate space, which translates
to 0.005 inches at an output scale of 1. The maximum <br>
zoom scale gives a screen size translating to about 100 by
100 inches at an output scale of 1. The effective scale can
be varied by changing the output scale (reached from the
<br>
&quot;File/Write&quot; menu selection) in order to fit a
drawing to a page or to get a grid matched to a specific
dimension. A separate scale parameter changes the scale of
the reported <br>
position relative to the output scale (as it will appear on
a printed page).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SNAP-TO GRID <br>
The snap-to grid is an all-important feature for circuit
drawing, wherein it is critical that elements line up
properly with one another. In xcircuit, there is no way to
get off <br>
the snap-to grid except by turning the snap function off and
physically pushing elements off the grid. Generally, it is
most convenient to leave the snap functon on and use key
<br>
macros &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; to double/halve it as
necessary. In any case, objects can always be returned to
the snap grid with the &quot;snap&quot; function (key macro
&quot;S&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTION MECHANISM <br>
Objects are selected using a variety of search methods. The
select box (formed by holding down mouse button 2 and
dragging the pointer) uses the simplest method, searching
for <br>
curve/polygon segment endpoints, arc centers, and label and
object bounding boxes falling within the select box frame.
General object selection is more complicated. Polygons, <br>
Arcs, and Curves are selected by their outer edges, not the
interiors. Currently this is also true for filled instances
of those types. A line is selected if the pointer is in <br>
a region describing a box around it, which is adusted
according to the scale (zoom factor). Every object has an
associated bounding box, which is rectangular but may be
rotated <br>
with respect to the top level window. An object instance is
selected if the pointer falls within its bounding box. Each
label also has a bounding box carefully calculated from <br>
the width of the text string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Often the selection mechanism
will find multiple elements in range of the pointer. In this
case, each object in turn will be presented, colored in blue
(or the specified &quot;query&acirc; <br>
color&quot; in the defaults file), and the user has the
option of accepting the highlighted element for selection
using the mouse button 1, or rejecting it with mouse button
3. When <br>
all the elements under consideration have been accepted or
rejected, the program proceeds to execute whatever function
was in progress. This selection method takes a little <br>
while to get used to, but is sensible and seems to work
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLOR <br>
Color in xcircuit is implemented with the idea of
&quot;color inheritance&quot;. Every page has a
&quot;default color&quot; of black. All elements which have
color value &quot;Inherit&quot; will inherit the <br>
default color, black. If an object instance is painted blue
(for instance), all components in that object which have
color value &quot;Inherit&quot; will inherit its color,
blue. The <br>
reason for this is that it allows different object instances
to be painted different colors (such as if one part of a
circuit is highlighted for emphasis), while making it
possi&acirc; <br>
ble for object instances to be multicolored, if necessary.
Changing the color of an object instance will have no
observable effect on the drawing if none of the components
of <br>
the object inherit that color. An object may have both
normally colored components and components which inherit
their color, in which case only those components with the
<br>
&quot;Inherit&quot; value will change color when the color
of the object instance is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCHEMATIC CAPTURE <br>
XCircuit implements a sophisticated schematic capture.
Unlike virtually all schematic capture software currently
available, xcircuit allows the designer to draw the circuit
in a <br>
&quot;natural&quot; way, making use both of schematic
hierarchies and simple hierarchies created simply by
grouping elements together. If the chosen netlist format is
hierarchical (like <br>
SPICE), both hierarchical forms will be retained in the
output. For element grouping, input/output ports connecting
into to the group will be determined automatically, from
con&acirc; <br>
text. A schematic capture tutorial is available from the
xcircuit website, <br>

http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/tutorial/tutorial2.html.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Netlist types currently
available are &quot;SPICE&quot;, &quot;sim&quot;, and
&quot;PCB&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD COMMANDS <br>
Basic keyboard commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Z Zoom in by a factor of 3/2. If
this key is pressed while a selection box is active (created
with the middle mouse button), then acts like Zoom Box
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Zoom out by a factor of
3/2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Pan the screen so that the
point under the mouse is brought to the center of the
program window. This function can also be conveniently
performed by clicking on the <br>
scrollbars. The scrollbars cannot be moved continuously due
to the slow time for screen refresh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cursors The arrow keys perform a
pan of one-half window size in the direction of the arrow
pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Go to the Library of built-in
objects. From the library, use mouse button1 to grab an
object and bring it back to the edit screen, or button3 to
return without <br>
selecting an object instance. While in the library screen,
the zoom and pan functions can be used to move around.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; Push into an on-screen
object in order to edit that object</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt; Return from editing an
object. Object pushes and pops can be stacked
indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">space Refresh the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">digits 0-9 Switch to one of the
first ten editing pages. Pages greater than 10 can be
reached from the &quot;Window/Goto Page&quot; menu
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ and - Change snap-to grid
spacing by a factor of two up or down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| : and _ (Bar, colon, and
underline) Change style on the currently selected object to
dashed, dotted, and solid, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h or ? Print a help page summary
of commands</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands to create elements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Arc. Center is fixed at the
initial position of the cursor. The mouse position changes
the radius of the circle. In snap-to mode the arc boundry
will pass through the snap <br>
point closest to the cursor. Mouse button 1 cycles from
controlling the radius to controlling the starting point,
the ending point, and separately controlling the minor axis
<br>
to create ellipse. Mouse button 2 completes the arc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Box. This is a convenience
function for generating rectangular closed polygons. Creates
a rectangle with one corner fixed at the position of the
cursor. Subsequent move&acirc; <br>
ment of the cursor defines the point diametrically opposed.
Mouse buttons 1 or 2 complete the box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Spline curve. The first
endpoint is defined by the initial cursor position. Mouse
position adjusts the other endpoint of the curve. Mouse
button 1 cycles from controlling <br>
position of the endpoint to controlling positions of the
curve control points and the curve starting point. Mouse
button 2 completes the curve.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Text. Text starts out
justified according to the styles chosen in the pull-down
menu. Text can be rejustified using the menu or by typing
the numbers on the keypad (shift- <br>
keypad-1 through shift-keypad-9). The position of the keys
on the keypad matches the justification. Subscripts,
superscripts, font changes, text size changes, underlining,
<br>
and overlining are all available from the pull-down menu.
Text edit mode recognizes Home and End keys to move to the
beginning and end of the string, respectively. If the <br>
X11 environment maps control key sequences to character
encodings (such as ISO-Latin1), these may be used to insert
non-ASCII text. Another method of inserting non-ASCII <br>
characters is the use of the backslash character, which
duplicates the action of the Text/Insert/Character menu
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M, m <br>
Make object. Takes all the elements currently selected and
compiles them into an object. The object is then placed in
the user library. The elements just selected are <br>
deleted from the screen and replaced by the new object. The
center point of the resulting object is chosen as the
closest snap-to point to the center of the object&rsquo;s
bound&acirc; <br>
ing box; if another center is desired, then the object can
be edited using the &quot;&gt;&quot; command and its
contents moved with respect to its origin. Note: Objects
cannot have the <br>
same name as PostScript commands or have the same name as
any other object in memory. If such a name is found, an
underscore (&quot;_&quot;) will be prepended to the name as
many <br>
times as is necessary to differentiate it from all other
known objects. The name also cannot contain special
PostScript characters such as slash; any such characters
found <br>
will be replaced with underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Major editing commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Delete. Select the nearest
element or elements and delete it/them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Undelete. Xcircuit saves up to
10 delete events to be recovered. Delete events are stored
in order of occurrence, and the most recent delete event is
the first to be recov&acirc; <br>
ered. When multiple elements are deleted at the same time,
all of them are stored as one delete event, and restored
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Deselect. Elements which have
been selected can be deselected on a per-item basis. In
order not to be too confusing, deselect does not query if
multiple items are found <br>
under the cursor; it just deselects them all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Copy. Make a copy of the
object(s) nearest the cursor. Object is automatically
grabbed for moving to a new position. The next button1 or
button2 press will place the ele&acirc; <br>
ment. Button2 will end the copy, and button1 will continue
the copy function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Edit. The action of Edit is
dependent on the type of element selected. These are
detailed below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label Returns to text editing
mode, starting with the cursor at the end of the string.
Mode is like regular text entry except that Button 3 returns
text to its original <br>
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polygon Grabs one point of a
polygon for repositioning. Button 1 cycles between points,
button 2 accepts the new polygon, and button 3 returns to
the previous state, unless <br>
there is no remaining edit history, in which case it aborts
the command. Key macros available during polygon edit
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;x&quot;---Breaks the
polygon at the given point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;e&quot;---Moves edit
position to the next point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;i&quot; or
&quot;Insert&quot;---Inserts a new point at the
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;d&quot; or
&quot;Delete&quot;---Deletes the current edit point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are four modes for polygon
editing; see the &quot;Polygon Edit&quot; section below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arc Allows resizing of the
radius. Mouse button 1 or the &quot;e&quot; key will cycle
between control of the radius, the endpoint angles, and the
ellipse minor axis. Mouse button <br>
2 accepts the new arc. Button 3 returns to the previous
editing state, unless there is no remaining edit history, in
which case it aborts the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Curve Allows repositioning of
one end of the curve. Originally, the starting angle of the
curve is kept fixed. Mouse button 1 or the &quot;e&quot; key
cycles between the four con&acirc; <br>
trol points of the curve, allowing control over the angle of
the curve at its endpoint and the shape of the curve. Mouse
button 2 accepts the new curve. Button 3 <br>
reverts back to the previous edit state unless there is no
remaining edit history, in which case it terminates the
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object instance <br>
Object instances have no properties to change except scale,
and do not respond to the &quot;edit&quot; command. Scale
can be changed by selecting &quot;Options/Other/Object
Size&quot; <br>
from the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minor editing commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Rotate the selected element(s)
or element under the cursor counterclockwise in 15 degree
intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Rotate the selected element(s)
or element under the cursor clockwise in 15 degree
intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O Rotate the selected element(s)
or element under the cursor counterclockwise by 5 degree
intervals. This is currently the smallest angle resolution
available to xcircuit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Rotate the selected element(s)
or element under the cursor clockwise by 5 degree
intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Flip an element around a
vertical axis defined by an object&rsquo;s origin for an
object instance, or across an axis defined by the pointer
position for arcs, polygons, and curves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Flip an element around a
horizontal axis defined similarly to the &quot;f&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X If two elements are selected,
their order is exchanged (this is only relevant if one
element occludes another). If one element is selected, it is
raised up one in the stack, <br>
and if it is already on top of the stack, it is shuffled to
the bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Snap the nearest object to the
snap-to grid. For curves the control and endpoints are
snapped; for polygons, each point is snapped; for arcs, the
centerpoint is snapped; for <br>
labels and object instances, the designated point of origin
is snapped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">j Join polygons together. This
only makes sense if it is possible to make a single
continuous (open or closed) polygon from the selected parts.
Otherwise a warning will be <br>
posted and the parts will remain separate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Attach an element to a
polygon, arc, or curve. The element to be attached must be
the one currently grabbed (either by a &quot;drag&quot;,
copy command, or edit command). Until it is <br>
released, it will be forced to align its center (object,
arc), endpoint (polygon, curve), or position (label) with
the closest polygon, arc, or curve. Note that this is a <br>
very powerful tool for generating, for example, lines
tangent to a curve, or objects arranged in a circle or along
a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Library editing commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D Delete. The selected objects
will be deleted from the library unless other library
objects or pages contain references to that object. Note:
Unlike deleting object <br>
instances with the &quot;d&quot; command, this command
deletes the actual object and releases all memory associated
with that object, so the object cannot be undeleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Copy. Makes a copy of an
object from either library page and places the new copy in
the user library. The new object will be renamed to avoid
naming conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Move. If one object has been
selected, it is moved to the position of the cursor. If two
objects have been selected, their positions in the library
are exchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E Edit label. Edit the object
name whose label is under the cursor. After editing, the
object name will be checked for conflicts with other object
names, and altered if nec&acirc; <br>
essary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H Hide object. If the object is
a sub-instance of another object, but is not meant to be
used by itself, it can be &quot;hidden&quot; so that it will
not appear by itself on the library <br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU COMMANDS <br>
Write Postscript (W) <br>
This command brings up a popup menu with a number of
options. First, it gives the name of the file if one exists,
or else it gives the default name of the buffer (usually
<br>
Page n, where n is the number of the buffer). Next, it gives
a preview of the picture scale and output styles, which
include Landscape/Portrait orientation and Encapu&acirc;
<br>
lated/Unencapsulated (full page) PostScript modes. The
former allows adjustment of the nominal size of the picture
when drawn in PostScript. The default scale is 1.00, <br>
which makes the text scale of 1.0 about 14 points on the
PostScript page. The width and height of the resulting
picture are also given, in inches, and any of the three
val&acirc; <br>
ues can be changed. The values of the other two will be
updated accordingly. Pages which have the same name will be
grouped together into a single file, allowing multiple <br>
pages to be stored in the same PostScript file. However, as
Encapsulated PostScript does not make sense for this kind of
file, it is not an option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Write File button writes the
current page to an output file. If the page has a name other
than the default, the file will automatically be saved under
that name. Other&acirc; <br>
wise, it is necessary to change the name of the buffer. If a
file of that name already exists on the disk, the button
will read Overwrite File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Read PostScript <br>
Reads in a file of Xcircuit format. The file name is
requested by a popup prompt, and an extension of
&quot;.ps&quot; will be added if necessary. The file is read
into the current <br>
page, which is cleared first if anything is in it. If the
file is a multiple-page file, the current page will be
overwritten with the first page from the file, but other
<br>
pages will be loaded into empty buffers. Xcircuit can also
read &quot;lgf&quot;-format files from the Chipmunk CAD
tools programs &quot;analog&quot; and
&quot;diglog&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import PostScript <br>
Acts like &quot;Read PostScript&quot; except that the page
is not reset first, so graphics are added on top of existing
graphics on the page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clear Page <br>
Clears the current page of all elements and resets the name.
The contents cannot be recovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt Color <br>
Switches between the two xcircuit color schemes. The color
schemes can be redefined through XDefaults (see below). The
default color schemes are black-on-white and white- <br>
on-black. The latter is less straining to the eyes, but the
former matches the black ink on white paper PostScript
output. Any color scheme other than black-on-white is not
<br>
recommended for drawings with color, as the actual output
does not match the observed xcircuit screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grid <br>
Turns the grid lines on and off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Axes <br>
Turns the axis lines on and off. The axes mark the origin
(0,0) of the page. On the top level (TopObject), the origin
has no particular relevance, since encapsulated output <br>
will define its own boundaries, and full-page
(unencapsulated) output will be centered on the output page,
not according to the Xcircuit coordinate system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grid spacing <br>
Changes the spacing of the grid lines. Default spacing is
1/6 inch, which is about the width of the letter
&rsquo;W&rsquo; in default text scale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grid type/display <br>
This is a submenu allowing the coordinates and coordinate
grid to be specified in alternate units. Listing of
coordinates in the top window can be in default fractional
<br>
inches, decimal inches, or centimeters. Default spacing of
grid lines is either one-quarter inch or one-half
centimeter. Selecting an A:B scale With option &quot;Drawing
Scale&quot; <br>
causes all listed coordinates to be multiplied by the scale.
Note: Xcircuit will make an attempt to keep objects on the
snap/grid spacing when switching between inch and <br>
centimeter scales. In order to do this, it will change the
output scale by the ratio of 2.54 to 2.5, thus keeping a
closer correspondence between inches and centimeters. To
<br>
get true centimeters on the output page, the output scale
(from the &quot;File/Write Xcircuit PS&quot;) can be reset
to 1.0 at the expense of having all objects intended for the
inch <br>
grid displaced off of the snap grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap-to <br>
Turns the snap-to grid on and off. When the grid is on,
movement and placement of elements is restricted to points
on the snap-to grid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap spacing <br>
Determines the spacing of the points in the snap-to grid.
Default is 1/12 inch, which is half the grid line
spacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linewidth <br>
Controls the default linewidth against which all linewidths
in the drawing are scaled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polygon Edit <br>
The options in this submenu control how the position of
lines are affected when a point in a polygon is selected for
editing. &quot;Rhomboid-X&quot; mode moves adjoining points
as <br>
necessary to keep all horizontal lines horizontal;
&quot;Rhomboid-Y&quot; mode acts similarly to keep all
vertical lines vertical. &quot;Rhomboid-A&quot; is similar
to Manhattan mode but also <br>
tracks non-Manhattan lines. The default mode is
&quot;Manhattan Box Edit&quot;, which is a combination of
Rhomboid-X and Rhomboid-Y. In &quot;Normal&quot; mode, only
the point being edited can <br>
be moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arc/Box/Curve Border <br>
The options under this menu determine the border style of
arcs, polygons, and curves. If an element is selected, it
will be modified; otherwise, if no objects are selected,
<br>
the style chosen is made default for all subsequent arcs,
polygons, and curves. Elements may be drawn with or without
borders (but for obvious reasons cannot be made both <br>
borderless and unfilled, which would be invisible) The
borders may be closed or unclosed. For an arc, closed means
that a chord is drawn connecting the two endpoints, if the
<br>
beginning and ending angles do not complete a full circle.
Borders may be solid, dashed, dotted, and of varying
width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arc/Box/Curve Fill <br>
The options under this menu determine the fill style of
arcs, polygons, and curves. Fill style may be solid, empty,
or one of 7 stipple patterns varying from light to dark,
<br>
which are drawn both in xcircuit and PostScript as stipple
patterns. Stipples can be transparent or opaque. Warning:
Transparent stipples are NOT inherent to PostScript <br>
and the hacks necessary to implement them cause slow
rendering on a printer or PostScript previewer. Due to the
device-dependent nature of the routines, patterns will look
<br>
abnormally large on PostScript previewers. This transparancy
feature has been added with the expectation that most
circuit schematics will not rely heavily upon halftoning.
<br>
Complicated color patterns can be created using transparent
colored, stippled elements on top of solid-color elements.
Note: Ordering of elements is according to order cre&acirc;
<br>
ated. A different ordering can be achieved using the
&quot;X&quot; (exchange) command. This method is not
especially easy to work with, and hopefully something better
will be imple&acirc; <br>
mented in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arc/Box/Curve Color <br>
See the COLOR section above for a discussion of color
inheritance. This menu shows all the colors available to
xcircuit with the option of adding more colors. Currently
the <br>
entry style for colors is by name or by RGB content in the
X11 style of #rrggbb where rr, gg, and bb are hex values
ranging from 00 to FF. The only limit to the number of <br>
colors is the X Server&rsquo;s colormap depth. If the
colormap is full, xcircuit attempts to allocate the closest
possible color to the one requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Zoom Box <br>
This zoom feature requests the user to create a box (using
either mouse button 1 or 2, expanding the box while holding
down the button). When the button is released, the <br>
view will zoom to the area of that box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full View <br>
This zoom feature calculates the bounding box of the entire
picture and adjusts the scale to make it fit comfortably
inside the program window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXT FEATURES <br>
Xcircuit&rsquo;s ability to handle text is arguably the most
complicated part of the program, and also of the PostScript
output. Careful attention to text justification and style is
<br>
the key to a good drawing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Size <br>
Alters the size of the labels. The value is a scale, with a
default of 1.0 which translates to 14 points on the
PostScript page if the default page scale of 1 is used. If a
<br>
label is selected, only that label is affected. If a label
is being edited, scale changes starting at the edit
position. Otherwise, it becomes the default size for all
sub&acirc; <br>
sequent labels. Size affects the entire text string. Text
size can be changed anywhere inside of a string. However,
text sizes inside a string are all given relative to <br>
the label size, not as an absolute point size. Sizes of
subscripts and superscripts are given relative to the
natural size of the subscript or superscript (2/3 the size
of <br>
the text for which it is a modifier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Font <br>
Standard printer fonts Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier, and
Symbol, are readily available. &quot;User-defined&quot;
fonts can also be added; however, support is currently
limited, and <br>
requires a font object (.lps) file and encoding (.xfe) file,
examples of which are found in the fonts subdirectory of the
xcircuit library directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Style <br>
Four standard font styles are available, matching the
standard printer font variations: Normal, Italic (or
oblique), Bold, and BoldItalic. PostScript matrix
manipulation <br>
allows slanted versions of any font, such as Symbol, for
which none is otherwise available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Insert <br>
The Insert menu allows insertion of special characters which
are otherwise not (necessarily) allowed from the keyboard.
These include tab-stop, tab-forward, tab-backward, <br>
kern, half-space, quarter-space, and &quot;Character&quot;.
The latter option brings up a page showing the 256-character
encoding vector for the font, allowing point-and-click entry
<br>
of any character in the font. &quot;Kern&quot; instructions
allow characters to be offset vertically or horizontally
relative to the rest of the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Encoding <br>
Two standard font encodings are available by default,
Standard (Adobe) Encoding, and ISO-Latin1 encoding.
ISO-Latin2 and ISO-Latin5 encodings exist in the library
directory, <br>
but require the use of the program &quot;ogonkify&quot; (not
included) to produce correct output on a printer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Super and Subscripts <br>
Superscript and subscript are designed to closely match
those in TeX output, though they lack the proper
context-dependent kerning and other fancy features of TeX. A
super&acirc; <br>
script following a subscript results in a superscripted
subscript. To get a superscript on top of a subscript, use
the backspace character (see below). The Normalscript <br>
style is the way to get out of a sub or superscript and
return to the normal size and position. Quick
super/sub/normalscripting is available from the keypad with
the &quot;+&quot; <br>
(plus), &quot;-&quot; (minus), and &quot;Enter&quot; keys,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overline and Underline <br>
Overlining and underlining styles remain in effect until the
next occurrence of a style or font change. Overlining is
lower if all the characters are lowercase and do not <br>
include the &quot;tall&quot; lowercase characters.
Overlining or underlining can be stopped at any time using
the No Line style. Over and Underlining is *always*
preferable to using <br>
a line. PostScript will adjust the over or underline to the
text size and extent and actually grab the &quot;_&quot;
character and compute its thickness in order to draw the
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tabbing <br>
From version 2.3, xcircuit allows embedded tab stops. Tab
stops must be defined before using tab-forward or
tab-backward. The &quot;Tab&quot; keyboard key inserts an
embedded tab- <br>
forward instruction into a label. Tab-stop and tab-backward
can be inserted using the Text-&gt;Insert menu. A
tab-forward instruction moves the cursor to the first
defined tab <br>
stop forward of the current position. A tab-backward
instruction moves the cursor to the first defined tab stop
backward of the current position. If no appropriate tab stop
<br>
exists, the instruction has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backspace <br>
The use of the backspace character is deprecated from
xcircuit version 2.3. The effect of an embedded backspace is
more reliably produced using tab-stop and tab-backward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Halfspace and Quarterspace <br>
These options allow fine control over spacing, particularly
useful when writing equations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Justification <br>
Text justification always starts with the default, chosen
from the options in the menu, but may be changed at any time
using the numbers on the keypad. The position of the <br>
keys on the keypad reflect the point of justification: 1, 4,
and 7 are right-justified, 7, 8, and 9 are bottom justified,
5 is centered in both directions. Since the letters <br>
drawn by xcircuit are optimized for the Helvetica font,
correct justification is the main way to get text to come
out on the PostScript page in the desired way, relative to
<br>
objects or boxes or whatever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain parameters of the
xcircuit program can be initialized from a file called
.xcircuitrc, which is first searched for in the current
directory, and then in the user&rsquo;s home <br>
directory as defined by the environment variable $HOME.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The startup file is written in
Tcl. The command-line interface can be found in the online
documentation on the website</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CRASH RECOVERY <br>
XCircuit implements a crash recovery system by which a copy
of the current file is made every 15 minutes (see Xdefaults,
below, for changing this value). XCircuit deletes this <br>
file upon a normal exit. If, however, XCircuit crashes or is
terminated by Control-C or other sudden death, the backup
copy will remain. On startup, XCircuit checks the /tmp <br>
directory for any XCircuit backup files belonging to the
user. If one is found, XCircuit will prompt the user for
recovery. Note that the backup is unique in that it contains
a <br>
copy of the entire user space at the time of the crash.
Filenames may get overwritten, as the backup will treat all
pages as belonging to the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
As noted above, keys can be bound and unbound through
command-line functions &quot;bind&quot; and
&quot;unbind&quot;. Default key bindings are used throughout
this manual page. Key names use the <br>
notation of /usr/X11R6/include/keysymdef.h, but with the
notation &quot;XK_&quot; being optional, and including the
addition of prefixes &quot;Shift_&quot;,
&quot;Control_&quot;, &quot;Capslock_&quot;, and
&quot;Alt_&quot;, <br>
which may be used in any combination. Note that
&quot;Shift_&quot; is not used for ASCII characters (e.g.,
&quot;A&quot; is used instead of &quot;Shift_a&quot;) unless
used in combination with other special <br>
keys (such as &quot;Control_Shift_A&quot; to distinguish
from &quot;Control_a&quot;, should that be desired).
&quot;Button1&quot;, &quot;Button2&quot;, and
&quot;Button3&quot; are also valid names indicating
functions attached <br>
to the mouse buttons in normal drawing mode. Valid functions
which may be bound are as follows, with their default values
given:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Function name Function performed

------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2-Button mouse users may find it
useful to forego the Shift-Button1 combination and instead
put the following commands in the startup script:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind(&rsquo;Escape&rsquo;,
&rsquo;Cancel&rsquo;) <br>
unbind(&rsquo;Button3&rsquo;, Cancel&rsquo;) <br>
bind(&rsquo;Button3&rsquo;, &rsquo;Finish&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will move the 3rd mouse
button bindings to the &quot;Escape&quot; key, and duplicate
the 2nd mouse button bindings onto the 3rd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X DEFAULTS <br>
The color scheme of xcircuit has a default setup, but
accepts alternate color schemes using the following keywords
which can be put in the X Defaults (.Xdefaults, .Xresources)
<br>
file, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! <br>
! Sample X defaults for xcircuit, black-on-white version
<br>
! <br>
xcircuit*foreground : Black <br>
xcircuit*background : White <br>
xcircuit*gridcolor : Gray85 <br>
xcircuit*snapcolor : Orange <br>
xcircuit*selectcolor : Blue <br>
xcircuit*querycolor : Green <br>
xcircuit*axescolor : NavajoWhite3 <br>
xcircuit*offbuttoncolor : Gray30 <br>
xcircuit*auxiliarycolor : MediumOrchid1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two color schemes are supported
at a time, ostensibly for those people who prefer the
lessened eye strain of a white-on-black scheme. The names of
the secondary colors are the <br>
same as those for the primary colors, but followed by
&quot;2&quot;, e.g., &quot;xcircuit*foreground2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One other resource defines the
number of minutes between automatic saves to the temporary
file (in case of a crash or emergency Ctrl-C exit):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcircuit.timeout : 15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xcircuit also recognizes the
core resources, such as width and height:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcircuit.width : 600 <br>
xcircuit.height : 500</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All xcircuit foreground and
background colors are taken from the Xdefaults foreground
and background. To get, for instance, white-on-black menus
and buttons with a black-on- <br>
white drawing area, use the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcircuit*foreground : White <br>
xcircuit*background : DarkSlateGray <br>
xcircuit.foreground : Black <br>
xcircuit.background : White <br>
This will ensure that only the drawing area is
black-on-white, but all other <br>
windows will appear in the less eye-straining
white-on-black. <br>
Five different fonts can be specified in the Xdefaults.
helpfont is <br>
the style of fonts on the help popup window. filefont is the
style <br>
of fonts in the list of files in the file selection popup
window. textfont <br>
is the style of font for entering text in the popup dialog
boxes. titlefont <br>
is the style of font for the cascade menu titles. All other
fonts take the <br>
type font. For example: <br>
xcircuit*font : *times-bold-r-normal--14* <br>
xcircuit*helpfont : *times-medium-r-normal--12* <br>
xcircuit*filefont : *times-medium-r-normal--14* <br>
xcircuit*textfont : *courier-medium-r-normal--14* <br>
xcircuit*titlefont : *times-bold-r-normal--18*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The file path used by xcircuit to find library files is
system-dependent (i.e., can be changed at compile time), and
can be overridden in many ways (in .xcircuitrc or by the
<br>
XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR environment variable), but by default
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/lib64</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcircps2.pro PostScript prolog
appended to each file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xcstartup.tcl This startup
script contains commands of the type library name number
which cause the designated library name to be immediately
loaded into library page number. <br>
The startup script is also responsible for loading fonts,
and may also be used to load colors on the color palette,
set other options, and execute commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">generic.lps, analog.lps,
digital.lps, avlsi.lps, analoglib2.lps <br>
Files containing pre-compiled circuit elements. The .lps
extension is unique for xcircuit libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fonts This subdirectory contains
font definition files for xcircuit&rsquo;s vector-drawn
fonts. Characters are defined by xcircuit objects and stored
in a .lps library. The <br>
encoding scheme and other font information is stored in a
.xfe (&quot;xcircuit font encoding&quot;) file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.xcircuitrc or ./xcircuitrc
<br>
Personal xcircuit initializer; commands are outlined above.
Libraries listed in this file will be appended to the
builtin libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
xcircuit understands the following environment
variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Directory for temporary
(e.g., backup) files (defaults to TEMP_DIR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR <br>
Directory where xcircuit libraries and startup files can be
found (defaults to BUILTINS_DIR).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XAPPLRESDIR Directory where the
xcircuit application defaults can be found (defaults to
RESOURCES_DIR)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME Directory where xcircuit
will look for startup files, after searching the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOST, HOSTNAME, USER <br>
Environment variables which xcircuit uses to fill in header
information in the PostScript output (HOST and HOSTNAME are
equivalent).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
PostScript printers have device-dependent limits on the
number of statements within a &quot;def&quot; definition. If
an object definition has an unusually large number of
components, <br>
xcircuit will flag a warning when writing the file. However,
there is no way to ensure that a file will be accepted by a
given printer. The best way to avoid the problem is to <br>
make sure that large drawings make good use of
hierarchically nested user-defined objects. Note that
printer errors arising from this problem have not been
observed in practice, <br>
and given the typical size of on-board memory on most modern
laser printers, probably never will be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of bugs can be found in
the Manifest file in the source directory.</p>
