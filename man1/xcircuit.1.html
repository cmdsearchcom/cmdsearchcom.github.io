The program xcircuit is a generic drawing program tailored especially for making
  publication-quality renderings of circuit diagrams (hence the name). The
  output is pure PostScript, and the graphical interface attempts to maintain as
  much consistency as possible between the X11 window rendering and the final
  printer output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>xcircuit</i> is mouse, menu, and keyboard-driven, with the emphasis on
  single-character keyboard macros.

There are five drawing elements. These are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>a)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">polygon (multiple lines which may or may not be closed and
      filled)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MOUSE_BUTTONS"><a class="selflink" href="#MOUSE_BUTTONS">MOUSE
  BUTTONS</a></h1>
The mouse button system, the object library, and the paged buffer system are
  loosely based on the Caltech circuit-simulation program &quot;log&quot;
  (either &quot;analog&quot; or &quot;diglog&quot;).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The general idea is to make the most commonly-used functions the easiest to
  perform, and (to the extent possible) to scale (inversely) the complexity of
  performing a function with the frequency of that task. Because this program is
  tailored to circuit drawing, the most common functions are drawing lines and
  moving object instances. The next most common function is selection of
  elements singly or in groups.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Mouse button 1 can be tapped to start a connected chain of lines, the most
  common drawing function. In addition, button 1 has a function called
  &quot;grab&quot;, which occurs after the button has been continually pressed
  for a short length of time (about 1/5 second). As the name implies,
  &quot;grab&quot; grabs hold of an element which can then be moved around the
  screen.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Button 2 can be used to select an item if tapped, and if pressed and held down,
  a box will be drawn and everything inside that box selected when the button is
  released. In all other cases, button 2 will complete a command. For users who
  have only two mouse buttons and do not emulate the middle mouse button with
  the combination of buttons 1 and 3, use the combination of the Shift key and
  mouse button 1 to emulate mouse button 2.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Button 3 will normally abort a command. During editing of an arc, spline, or
  polygon, button 3 will revert back to the previous form, or abort if there is
  no remaining edit history.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All other commands are available from the pulldown menus and/or from the
  keyboard using single-key macros (with easy-to-remember mnemonics). Keyboard
  commands are quicker, since they act on the present cursor position, whereas
  menu commands require an extra step.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUILT-IN_LIBRARY"><a class="selflink" href="#BUILT-IN_LIBRARY">BUILT-IN
  LIBRARY</a></h1>
The library is intended to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve
  elements of a picture which will be used more than once. For the application
  of circuit drawing, a built-in library provides basic objects such as
  transistors, amplifiers, resistors, capacitors, arrows, circles, power and
  ground symbols, and the like. This file is a composite of several library
  files (such as &quot;builtins.lps&quot;, &quot;analog.lps&quot;, and
  &quot;digital.lps&quot;) which are called by the startup script
  (&quot;xcstartup.tcl&quot;) The program first looks for the startup script in
  the current directory, and then searches in the directory given by the
  environment variable &quot;XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR&quot;, and finally, in the
  hard-coded global directory (/usr/lib64) if it could not find it elsewhere.
  Thus each user can add to or modify the file of builtins to reflect personal
  taste. Since the PostScript output contains all object definitions, these
  changes to the built-in functions are inherently transferrable. Xcircuit will
  automatically resolve conflicts between objects having the same name but
  different contents.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The library is accesible from the pull-down menu or with the &quot;l&quot;
  keyboard macro. When inside the library, clicking the first mouse button on an
  object &quot;grabs&quot; that object and returns the graphics state
  immediately to the page being edited, so that the object will be placed when
  the mouse button is released.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ZOOMING"><a class="selflink" href="#ZOOMING">ZOOMING</a></h1>
Xcircuit has unconstrained zooming and snap-to positioning. Objects scale
  completely: line widths and text sizes will increase/decrease proportionally
  with the zoom, as well as dot/dash spacing and all other features. Xcircuit
  does have a minimum integer grid in coordinate space, which translates to
  0.005 inches at an output scale of 1. The maximum zoom scale gives a screen
  size translating to about 100 by 100 inches at an output scale of 1. The
  effective scale can be varied by changing the output scale (reached from the
  &quot;File/Write&quot; menu selection) in order to fit a drawing to a page or
  to get a grid matched to a specific dimension. A separate scale parameter
  changes the scale of the reported position relative to the output scale (as it
  will appear on a printed page).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SNAP-TO_GRID"><a class="selflink" href="#SNAP-TO_GRID">SNAP-TO
  GRID</a></h1>
The snap-to grid is an all-important feature for circuit drawing, wherein it is
  critical that elements line up properly with one another. In <i>xcircuit</i>,
  there is no way to get off the snap-to grid except by turning the snap
  function off and physically pushing elements off the grid. Generally, it is
  most convenient to leave the snap functon on and use key macros &quot;+&quot;
  and &quot;-&quot; to double/halve it as necessary. In any case, objects can
  always be returned to the snap grid with the &quot;snap&quot; function (key
  macro &quot;S&quot;).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SELECTION_MECHANISM"><a class="selflink" href="#SELECTION_MECHANISM">SELECTION
  MECHANISM</a></h1>
Objects are selected using a variety of search methods. The select box (formed
  by holding down mouse button 2 and dragging the pointer) uses the simplest
  method, searching for curve/polygon segment endpoints, arc centers, and label
  and object bounding boxes falling within the select box frame. General object
  selection is more complicated. Polygons, Arcs, and Curves are selected by
  their outer edges, not the interiors. Currently this is also true for filled
  instances of those types. A line is selected if the pointer is in a region
  describing a box around it, which is adusted according to the scale (zoom
  factor). Every object has an associated bounding box, which is rectangular but
  may be rotated with respect to the top level window. An object instance is
  selected if the pointer falls within its bounding box. Each label also has a
  bounding box carefully calculated from the width of the text string.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Often the selection mechanism will find multiple elements in range of the
  pointer. In this case, each object in turn will be presented, colored in blue
  (or the specified &quot;querycolor&quot; in the defaults file), and the user
  has the option of accepting the highlighted element for selection using the
  mouse button 1, or rejecting it with mouse button 3. When all the elements
  under consideration have been accepted or rejected, the program proceeds to
  execute whatever function was in progress. This selection method takes a
  little while to get used to, but is sensible and seems to work well.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COLOR"><a class="selflink" href="#COLOR">COLOR</a></h1>
Color in xcircuit is implemented with the idea of &quot;color inheritance&quot;.
  Every page has a &quot;default color&quot; of black. All elements which have
  color value &quot;Inherit&quot; will inherit the default color, black. If an
  object instance is painted blue (for instance), all components in that object
  which have color value &quot;Inherit&quot; will inherit its color, blue. The
  reason for this is that it allows different object instances to be painted
  different colors (such as if one part of a circuit is highlighted for
  emphasis), while making it possible for object instances to be multicolored,
  if necessary. Changing the color of an object instance will have no observable
  effect on the drawing if none of the components of the object inherit that
  color. An object may have both normally colored components and components
  which inherit their color, in which case only those components with the
  &quot;Inherit&quot; value will change color when the color of the object
  instance is changed.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCHEMATIC_CAPTURE"><a class="selflink" href="#SCHEMATIC_CAPTURE">SCHEMATIC
  CAPTURE</a></h1>
XCircuit implements a sophisticated schematic capture. Unlike virtually all
  schematic capture software currently available, xcircuit allows the designer
  to draw the circuit in a &quot;natural&quot; way, making use both of schematic
  hierarchies and simple hierarchies created simply by grouping elements
  together. If the chosen netlist format is hierarchical (like SPICE), both
  hierarchical forms will be retained in the output. For element grouping,
  input/output ports connecting into to the group will be determined
  automatically, from context. A schematic capture tutorial is available from
  the xcircuit website,

http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/tutorial/tutorial2.html.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Netlist types currently available are &quot;SPICE&quot;, &quot;sim&quot;, and
  &quot;PCB&quot;.

<b>Commands to create elements:</b>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Arc. Center is fixed at the initial position of the cursor.
      The mouse position changes the radius of the circle. In snap-to mode the
      arc boundry will pass through the snap point closest to the cursor. Mouse
      button 1 cycles from controlling the radius to controlling the starting
      point, the ending point, and separately controlling the minor axis to
      create ellipse. Mouse button 2 completes the arc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>b</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Box. This is a convenience function for generating
      rectangular closed polygons. Creates a rectangle with one corner fixed at
      the position of the cursor. Subsequent movement of the cursor defines the
      point diametrically opposed. Mouse buttons 1 or 2 complete the box.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>s</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Spline curve. The first endpoint is defined by the initial
      cursor position. Mouse position adjusts the other endpoint of the curve.
      Mouse button 1 cycles from controlling position of the endpoint to
      controlling positions of the curve control points and the curve starting
      point. Mouse button 2 completes the curve.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>t</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Text. Text starts out justified according to the styles
      chosen in the pull-down menu. Text can be rejustified using the menu or by
      typing the numbers on the keypad ( <b>shift-keypad-1</b> through
      <b>shift-keypad-9</b>). The position of the keys on the keypad matches the
      justification. Subscripts, superscripts, font changes, text size changes,
      underlining, and overlining are all available from the pull-down menu.
      Text edit mode recognizes <b>Home</b> and <b>End</b> keys to move to the
      beginning and end of the string, respectively. If the X11 environment maps
      control key sequences to character encodings (such as ISO-Latin1), these
      may be used to insert non-ASCII text. Another method of inserting
      non-ASCII characters is the use of the backslash character, which
      duplicates the action of the Text/Insert/Character menu button.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>M, m</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Make object. Takes all the elements currently selected and
      compiles them into an object. The object is then placed in the user
      library. The elements just selected are deleted from the screen and
      replaced by the new object. The center point of the resulting object is
      chosen as the closest snap-to point to the center of the object's bounding
      box; if another center is desired, then the object can be edited using the
      &quot;&gt;&quot; command and its contents moved with respect to its
      origin. <i>Note:</i> Objects cannot have the same name as PostScript
      commands or have the same name as any other object in memory. If such a
      name is found, an underscore (&quot;_&quot;) will be prepended to the name
      as many times as is necessary to differentiate it from all other known
      objects. The name also cannot contain special PostScript characters such
      as slash; any such characters found will be replaced with underscores.

  <dd class="It-tag">This command brings up a popup menu with a number of

      gives the default name of the buffer (usually <b>Page</b> <i>n</i>, where
      <i>n</i> is the number of the buffer). Next, it gives a preview of the
      picture scale and output styles, which include Landscape/Portrait
      orientation and Encapulated/Unencapsulated (full page) PostScript modes.
      The former allows adjustment of the nominal size of the picture when drawn
      in PostScript. The default scale is 1.00, which makes the text scale of
      1.0 about 14 points on the PostScript page. The width and height of the
      resulting picture are also given, in inches, and any of the three values
      can be changed. The values of the other two will be updated accordingly.
      Pages which have the same name will be grouped together into a single
      file, allowing multiple pages to be stored in the same PostScript file.
      However, as Encapsulated PostScript does not make sense for this kind of

      stipple patterns varying from light to dark, which are drawn both in
      xcircuit and PostScript as stipple patterns. Stipples can be transparent
      or opaque. <i>Warning</i>: Transparent stipples are NOT inherent to
      PostScript and the hacks necessary to implement them cause slow rendering
      on a printer or PostScript previewer. Due to the device-dependent nature
      of the routines, patterns will look abnormally large on PostScript
      previewers. This transparancy feature has been added with the expectation
      that most circuit schematics will not rely heavily upon halftoning.
      Complicated color patterns can be created using transparent colored,
      stippled elements on top of solid-color elements. <i>Note</i>: Ordering of
      elements is according to order created. A different ordering can be
      achieved using the &quot; <b>X</b>&quot; (exchange) command. This method

  justification and style is the key to a good drawing.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Text Size</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Alters the size of the labels. The value is a scale, with a
      default of 1.0 which translates to 14 points on the PostScript page if the
      default page scale of 1 is used. If a label is selected, only that label
      is affected. If a label is being edited, scale changes starting at the
      edit position. Otherwise, it becomes the default size for all subsequent
      labels. Size affects the entire text string. Text size can be changed
      anywhere inside of a string. However, text sizes inside a string are all
      given relative to the label size, not as an absolute point size. Sizes of
      subscripts and superscripts are given relative to the natural size of the

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b><b>Text</b><b> Insert</b></b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Insert menu allows insertion of special characters
      which are otherwise not (necessarily) allowed from the keyboard. These
      include tab-stop, tab-forward, tab-backward, kern, half-space,
      quarter-space, and &quot;Character&quot;. The latter option brings up a
      page showing the 256-character encoding vector for the font, allowing
      point-and-click entry of any character in the font. &quot;Kern&quot;

      Standard (Adobe) Encoding, and ISO-Latin1 encoding. ISO-Latin2 and
      ISO-Latin5 encodings exist in the library directory, but require the use

  <dd class="It-tag">Superscript and subscript are designed to closely match
      those in TeX output, though they lack the proper context-dependent kerning
      and other fancy features of TeX. A superscript following a subscript
      results in a superscripted subscript. To get a superscript on top of a
      subscript, use the backspace character (see below). The Normalscript style
      is the way to get out of a sub or superscript and return to the normal
      size and position. Quick super/sub/normalscripting is available from the
      keypad with the &quot; <b>+</b>&quot; (plus), &quot;<b>-</b>&quot;

      the next occurrence of a style or font change. Overlining is lower if all
      the characters are lowercase and do not include the &quot;tall&quot;
      lowercase characters. Overlining or underlining can be stopped at any time
      using the No Line style. Over and Underlining is *always* preferable to
      using a line. PostScript will adjust the over or underline to the text
      size and extent and actually grab the &quot;_&quot; character and compute
      its thickness in order to draw the line.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Tabbing</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">From version 2.3, xcircuit allows embedded tab stops. Tab
      stops must be defined before using tab-forward or tab-backward. The
      &quot;Tab&quot; keyboard key inserts an embedded tab-forward instruction
      into a label. Tab-stop and tab-backward can be inserted using the
      Text-&gt;Insert menu. A tab-forward instruction moves the cursor to the
      first defined tab stop forward of the current position. A tab-backward
      instruction moves the cursor to the first defined tab stop backward of the
      current position. If no appropriate tab stop exists, the instruction has
      no effect.</dd>

      point of justification: 1, 4, and 7 are right-justified, 7, 8, and 9 are
      bottom justified, 5 is centered in both directions. Since the letters
      drawn by xcircuit are optimized for the Helvetica font, correct
      justification is the main way to get text to come out on the PostScript
      page in the desired way, relative to objects or boxes or whatever.</dd>

XCircuit implements a crash recovery system by which a copy of the current file
  is made every 15 minutes (see Xdefaults, below, for changing this value).
  XCircuit deletes this file upon a normal exit. If, however, XCircuit crashes
  or is terminated by Control-C or other sudden death, the backup copy will
  remain. On startup, XCircuit checks the /tmp directory for any XCircuit backup
  files belonging to the user. If one is found, XCircuit will prompt the user
  for recovery. Note that the backup is unique in that it contains a copy of the
  entire user space at the time of the crash. Filenames may get overwritten, as
  the backup will treat all pages as belonging to the same file.

As noted above, keys can be bound and unbound through command-line functions
  &quot;bind&quot; and &quot;unbind&quot;. Default key bindings are used
  throughout this manual page. Key names use the notation of

  used in combination with other special keys (such as
  &quot;Control_Shift_A&quot; to distinguish from &quot;Control_a&quot;, should
  that be desired). &quot;Button1&quot;, &quot;Button2&quot;, and

2-Button mouse users may find it useful to forego the Shift-Button1 combination
  and instead put the following commands in the startup script:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
bind('Escape', 'Cancel')
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
unbind('Button3', Cancel')
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
bind('Button3', 'Finish')
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This will move the 3rd mouse button bindings to the &quot;Escape&quot; key, and
  duplicate the 2nd mouse button bindings onto the 3rd.

The color scheme of xcircuit has a default setup, but accepts alternate color
  schemes using the following keywords which can be put in the X Defaults
  (.Xdefaults, .Xresources) file, such as:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
  !
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  ! Sample X defaults for xcircuit, black-on-white version
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  !
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*foreground     : Black
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*background     : White
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*gridcolor      : Gray85
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*snapcolor      : Orange
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*selectcolor    : Blue
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*querycolor     : Green
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*axescolor      : NavajoWhite3
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*offbuttoncolor : Gray30
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*auxiliarycolor : MediumOrchid1
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Two color schemes are supported at a time, ostensibly for those people who
  prefer the lessened eye strain of a white-on-black scheme. The names of the
  secondary colors are the same as those for the primary colors, but followed by
  &quot;2&quot;, e.g., &quot;xcircuit*foreground2&quot;.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
One other resource defines the number of minutes between automatic saves to the
  temporary file (in case of a crash or emergency Ctrl-C exit):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
  xcircuit.timeout		: 15
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Xcircuit also recognizes the core resources, such as width and height:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
  xcircuit.width		: 600
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit.height		: 500
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
All xcircuit foreground and background colors are taken from the Xdefaults
  foreground and background. To get, for instance, white-on-black menus and
  buttons with a black-on-white drawing area, use the following:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
  xcircuit*foreground		: White
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*background		: DarkSlateGray
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit.foreground		: Black
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit.background		: White
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This will ensure that only the drawing area is black-on-white, but all other
windows will appear in the less eye-straining white-on-black.
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
Five different fonts can be specified in the Xdefaults.  helpfont is
the style of fonts on the help popup window.  filefont is the style
of fonts in the list of files in the file selection popup window.  textfont
is the style of font for entering text in the popup dialog boxes.  titlefont
is the style of font for the cascade menu titles.  All other fonts take the
type font. For example:
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*font           : *times-bold-r-normal--14*
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*helpfont	  : *times-medium-r-normal--12*
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*filefont	  : *times-medium-r-normal--14*
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*textfont	  : *courier-medium-r-normal--14*
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
  xcircuit*titlefont	  : *times-bold-r-normal--18*
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
The file path used by xcircuit to find library files is system-dependent (i.e.,
  can be changed at compile time), and can be overridden in many ways (in
  .xcircuitrc or by the XCIRCUIT_LIB_DIR environment variable), but by default
  is:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
PostScript printers have device-dependent limits on the number of statements
  within a &quot;def&quot; definition. If an object definition has an unusually
  large number of components, xcircuit will flag a warning when writing the
  file. However, there is no way to ensure that a file will be accepted by a
  given printer. The best way to avoid the problem is to make sure that large
  drawings make good use of hierarchically nested user-defined objects. Note
  that printer errors arising from this problem have not been observed in
  practice, and given the typical size of on-board memory on most modern laser
  printers, probably never will be.
