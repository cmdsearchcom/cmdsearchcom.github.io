<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b
options as well as object files specified on the command
line. It then processes these inputs and if the -e option
<br>
has been specified it creates a exports file. If the -l
option has been specified it creates a library file and if
the -z option has been specified it creates a def file. Any
<br>
or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in one
invocation of dlltool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When creating a DLL, along with
the source for the DLL, it is necessary to have three other
files. dlltool can help with the creation of these
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first file is a .def file
which specifies which functions are exported from the DLL,
which functions the DLL imports, and so on. This is a text
file and can be created by <br>
hand, or dlltool can be used to create it using the -z
option. In this case dlltool will scan the object files
specified on its command line looking for those functions
which <br>
have been specially marked as being exported and put entries
for them in the .def file it creates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to mark a function as
being exported from a DLL, it needs to have an
-export:&lt;name_of_function&gt; entry in the .drectve
section of the object file. This can be done in C <br>
by using the asm() operator:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asm (&quot;.section
.drectve&quot;); <br>
asm (&quot;.ascii</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int my_func (void) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second file needed for DLL
creation is an exports file. This file is linked with the
object files that make up the body of the DLL and it handles
the interface between the <br>
DLL and the outside world. This is a binary file and it can
be created by giving the -e option to dlltool when it is
creating or reading in a .def file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third file needed for DLL
creation is the library file that programs will link with in
order to access the functions in the DLL (an &lsquo;import
library&rsquo;). This file can be <br>
created by giving the -l option to dlltool when it is
creating or reading in a .def file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -y option is specified,
dlltool generates a delay-import library that can be used
instead of the normal import library to allow a program to
link to the dll only as soon <br>
as an imported function is called for the first time. The
resulting executable will need to be linked to the static
delayimp library containing __delayLoadHelper2(), which in
<br>
turn will import LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress from
kernel32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dlltool builds the library file
by hand, but it builds the exports file by creating
temporary files containing assembler statements and then
assembling these. The -S command <br>
line option can be used to specify the path to the assembler
that dlltool will use, and the -f option can be used to pass
specific flags to that assembler. The -n can be used to <br>
prevent dlltool from deleting these temporary assembler
files when it is done, and if -n is specified twice then
this will prevent dlltool from deleting the temporary object
<br>
files it used to build the library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example of creating a
DLL from a source file dll.c and also creating a program
(from an object file called program.o) that uses that
DLL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gcc -c dll.c <br>
dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o <br>
gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll <br>
gcc program.o dll.lib -o program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dlltool may also be used to
query an existing import library to determine the name of
the DLL to which it is associated. See the description of
the -I or --identify option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The command line options have the following meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d filename <br>
--input-def filename <br>
Specifies the name of a .def file to be read in and
processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b filename <br>
--base-file filename <br>
Specifies the name of a base file to be read in and
processed. The contents of this file will be added to the
relocation section in the exports file generated by
dlltool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e filename <br>
--output-exp filename <br>
Specifies the name of the export file to be created by
dlltool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z filename <br>
--output-def filename <br>
Specifies the name of the .def file to be created by
dlltool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l filename <br>
--output-lib filename <br>
Specifies the name of the library file to be created by
dlltool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y filename <br>
--output-delaylib filename <br>
Specifies the name of the delay-import library file to be
created by dlltool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--export-all-symbols <br>
Treat all global and weak defined symbols found in the input
object files as symbols to be exported. There is a small
list of symbols which are not exported by default; see <br>
the --no-default-excludes option. You may add to the list of
symbols to not export by using the --exclude-symbols
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-export-all-symbols <br>
Only export symbols explicitly listed in an input .def file
or in .drectve sections in the input object files. This is
the default behaviour. The .drectve sections are <br>
created by dllexport attributes in the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-symbols list <br>
Do not export the symbols in list. This is a list of symbol
names separated by comma or colon characters. The symbol
names should not contain a leading underscore. This is <br>
only meaningful when --export-all-symbols is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-default-excludes <br>
When --export-all-symbols is used, it will by default avoid
exporting certain special symbols. The current list of
symbols to avoid exporting is DllMain@12, DllEntryPoint@0,
<br>
impure_ptr. You may use the --no-default-excludes option to
go ahead and export these special symbols. This is only
meaningful when --export-all-symbols is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S path <br>
--as path <br>
Specifies the path, including the filename, of the assembler
to be used to create the exports file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f options <br>
--as-flags options <br>
Specifies any specific command line options to be passed to
the assembler when building the exports file. This option
will work even if the -S option is not used. This <br>
option only takes one argument, and if it occurs more than
once on the command line, then later occurrences will
override earlier occurrences. So if it is necessary to pass
<br>
multiple options to the assembler they should be enclosed in
double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D name <br>
--dll-name name <br>
Specifies the name to be stored in the .def file as the name
of the DLL when the -e option is used. If this option is not
present, then the filename given to the -e option <br>
will be used as the name of the DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m machine <br>
-machine machine <br>
Specifies the type of machine for which the library file
should be built. dlltool has a built in default type,
depending upon how it was created, but this option can be
used <br>
to override that. This is normally only useful when creating
DLLs for an ARM processor, when the contents of the DLL are
actually encode using Thumb instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
--add-indirect <br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it
should add a section which allows the exported functions to
be referenced without using the import library. <br>
Whatever the hell that means!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U <br>
--add-underscore <br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it
should prepend an underscore to the names of all exported
symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-leading-underscore <br>
--leading-underscore <br>
Specifies whether standard symbol should be forced to be
prefixed, or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-stdcall-underscore <br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it
should prepend an underscore to the names of exported
stdcall functions. Variable names and non-stdcall function
<br>
names are not modified. This option is useful when creating
GNU-compatible import libs for third party DLLs that were
built with MS-Windows tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
--kill-at <br>
Specifies that @&lt;number&gt; suffixes should be omitted
from the names of stdcall functions that will be imported
from the DLL. This is useful when creating an import library
<br>
for a DLL which exports stdcall functions but without the
usual @&lt;number&gt; symbol name suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not change the naming
of symbols provided by the import library to programs linked
against it, but only the entries in the import table (ie the
.idata section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A <br>
--add-stdcall-alias <br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it
should add aliases for stdcall symbols without @
&lt;number&gt; in addition to the symbols with @
&lt;number&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p <br>
--ext-prefix-alias prefix <br>
Causes dlltool to create external aliases for all DLL
imports with the specified prefix. The aliases are created
for both external and import symbols with no leading <br>
underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x <br>
--no-idata4 <br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports and
library files it should omit the &quot;.idata4&quot;
section. This is for compatibility with certain operating
systems.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-nul-prefixed-import-tables
<br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports and
library files it should prefix the &quot;.idata4&quot; and
&quot;.idata5&quot; by zero an element. This emulates old
gnu import library <br>
generation of &quot;dlltool&quot;. By default this option is
turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
--no-idata5 <br>
Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports and
library files it should omit the &quot;.idata5&quot;
section. This is for compatibility with certain operating
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I filename <br>
--identify filename <br>
Specifies that dlltool should inspect the import library
indicated by filename and report, on &quot;stdout&quot;, the
name(s) of the associated DLL(s). This can be performed in
<br>
addition to any other operations indicated by the other
options and arguments. dlltool fails if the import library
does not exist or is not actually an import library. See
<br>
also --identify-strict.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--identify-strict <br>
Modifies the behavior of the --identify option, such that an
error is reported if filename is associated with more than
one DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i <br>
--interwork <br>
Specifies that dlltool should mark the objects in the
library file and exports file that it produces as supporting
interworking between ARM and Thumb code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--nodelete <br>
Makes dlltool preserve the temporary assembler files it used
to create the exports file. If this option is repeated then
dlltool will also preserve the temporary object <br>
files it uses to create the library file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t prefix <br>
--temp-prefix prefix <br>
Makes dlltool use prefix when constructing the names of
temporary assembler and object files. By default, the temp
file prefix is generated from the pid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Make dlltool describe what it is doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h <br>
--help <br>
Displays a list of command line options and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Displays dlltool&rsquo;s version number and then exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@file <br>
Read command-line options from file. The options read are
inserted in place of the original @file option. If file does
not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be <br>
treated literally, and not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in file are separated by
whitespace. A whitespace character may be included in an
option by surrounding the entire option in either single or
double quotes. Any <br>
character (including a backslash) may be included by
prefixing the character to be included with a backslash. The
file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
<br>
options will be processed recursively.</p>
