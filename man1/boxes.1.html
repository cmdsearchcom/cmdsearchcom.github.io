<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
boxes - text mode box and comment drawing filter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
boxes [-hlmrv] [-a format] [-d design] [-f file] [-i indent]
[-k bool] [-p pad] [-s size] [-t tabopts] [infile
[outfile]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Boxes is a text filter which can draw any kind of box around
its input text. Box design choices range from simple boxes
to complex ASCII art. A box can also be removed and <br>
repaired, even if it has been badly damaged by editing of
the text inside. Since boxes may be open on any side, boxes
can also be used to create regional comments in any
program&acirc; <br>
ming language. New box designs of all sorts can easily be
added and shared by appending to a free format configuration
file. <br>
boxes was originally intended to be used with the vim(1)
text editor, but it can be tied to any text editor which
supports filters, as well as called from the command line as
a <br>
standalone tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options offered by boxes are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a string <br>
Alignment/positioning of text inside box. This option takes
a format string argument which is read from left to right.
The format string may not contain whitespace and must <br>
consist of one or more of the following components:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hx - horizontal alignment of the
input text block inside a potentially larger box. Possible
values for x are l (ell, for left alignment), c (center), or
r (right). This <br>
does not affect the justification of text lines within the
input text block (use the j argument instead). <br>
vx - vertical alignment of the input text block inside a
potentially larger box. Possible values for x are t (for top
alignment), c (center), or b (bottom). <br>
jx - justification of lines within the input text block.
Possible values for x are l (ell, for left justification), c
(center), or r (right). This does not affect the <br>
alignment of the input text block itself within the box. Use
the h and v arguments for input text block positioning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Short hand notations (can be
combined with the above arguments): <br>
l (ell) - short for hlvcjl <br>
c - short for hcvcjc <br>
r - short for hrvcjr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The factory default setting for
-a is hlvt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c string <br>
Command line design definition for simple cases. The
argument of this option is the definition for the
&quot;west&quot; (W) shape. The defined shape must consist
of exactly one line, <br>
i.e. no multi-line shapes are allowed. The -c option is
intended as a shortcut for those cases where simple regional
comments are to be created, which only need a certain <br>
character or sequence of characters to be placed in front of
every line. In such cases, it is much more convenient to
simply specify -c than to do a complete design defini&acirc;
<br>
tion in one&rsquo;s config file, where the only shape
defined is the west shape. <br>
This option implies a -d and does not access the config
file. -c may of course be used in conjunction with any of
the other options. By default, -c is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d string <br>
Design selection. The one argument of this option is the
name of the design to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f string <br>
Use alternate config file. The one argument of this option
is the name of a valid boxes config file, containing new and
exciting designs!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print usage information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i string <br>
Indentation mode. Possible arguments are &quot;text&quot;
(indent text inside of box), &quot;box&quot; (indent box,
not text inside of box), or &quot;none&quot; (throw away
indentation). Arguments may <br>
be abbreviated. The default is to indent the box, but not
the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k bool <br>
Kill leading/trailing blank lines on removal. The value of
bool can be specified as on, yes, true, 1, or t, all meaning
yes, or off, no, false, 0, or f, which mean no. This <br>
is case-insensitive. This option only takes effect in
connection with -r. If set to yes, leading and trailing
blank lines will be removed from the output. If set to no,
<br>
the entire content of the former box is returned. The
default is no, if both the top and the bottom part of the
box are open, as is the case with most regional comments.
<br>
If the box&rsquo;s design defines a top part or a bottom
part, the default is yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (ell) List designs. Produces
a listing of all available box designs in the config file,
along with a sample box and information about it&rsquo;s
creator. Also checks syntax of <br>
the entire config file. If used in connection with -d,
displays detailed information about the specified
design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Mend box. This removes a
(potentially broken) box as with -r, and redraws it
afterwards. The mended box is drawn according to the options
given. This may be important to <br>
know when it comes to restoring padding, identation, etc.
for the mended box. Implies -k false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p string <br>
Padding. Specify padding in spaces around the input text
block for all sides of the box. The argument string may not
contain whitespace and must consist of a combination of <br>
the following characters, each followed by a number
indicating the padding in spaces: <br>
a - (all) give padding for all sides at once <br>
h - (horiz) give padding for both horizontal sides <br>
v - (vertical) give padding for both vertical sides <br>
b - (bottom) give padding for bottom (south) side <br>
l - (left) give padding for left (west) side <br>
t - (top) give padding for top (north) side <br>
r - (right) give padding for right (east) side <br>
Example: -p a4t2 would define the padding to be 4 characters
on all sides, except for the top of the box, where the input
text block will be only 2 lines away from the box. <br>
By default, unless specified otherwise in the config file,
no padding is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Remove box. Removes an
existing box instead of drawing it. Which design to use is
detected automatically. In order to save time or in case the
detection does not decide <br>
correctly, combine with -d to specify the design. The
default is to draw a new box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s widthxheight <br>
Box size. This option specifies the desired box size in
units of columns (for width) and lines (for height). If only
a single number is given as argument, this number <br>
specifies the desired box width. A single number prefixed by
&rsquo;x&rsquo; specifies only the box height. The actual
resulting box size may vary depending on the individual
shape <br>
sizes of the chosen design. Also, other command line options
may influence the box size (such as -p). <br>
By default, the smallest possible box is created around the
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t string <br>
Tab handling. This option controls how tab characters in the
input text are handled. The option string must always begin
with a uint number indicating the distance between <br>
tab stops. It is important that this value be set correctly,
or tabulator characters will upset your input text. The
correct tab distance value depends on the settings <br>
used for the text you are processing. A common value is 8.
<br>
Immediately following the tab distance, an optional
character can be appended, telling boxes how to treat the
leading tabs. The following options are available: <br>
e - expand tabs into spaces <br>
k - keep tabs as close to what they were as possible <br>
u - unexpand tabs. This makes boxes turn as many spaces as
possible into tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to maintain backwards
compatibility, the -t string can be just a number. In that
case, e is assumed for tab handling, which removes all tabs
and replaces them with <br>
spaces. The factory default for the -t option is simply 8,
which is just such a case. <br>
For example, you could specify -t 4u in order to have your
leading tabs unexpanded. In the box content, tabs are always
converted into spaces. The tab distance in this <br>
example is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print out current version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
Boxes will use the configuration file specified on the
command line (using -f). If no config file is specified on
the command line, boxes will check for the BOXES environment
<br>
variable, which may contain a filename to use. If BOXES is
not set, boxes will try to read $HOME/.boxes and use it as a
config file. Failing that, boxes will try to read the
sys&acirc; <br>
tem-wide config file (see FILES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of boxes config files
is described on the website (see below). They are quite
self-explanatory, though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
