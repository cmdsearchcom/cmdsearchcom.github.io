<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamtogif - convert a Netpbm image to a GIF image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamtogif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-interlace]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-sort]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-mapfile=mapfile]
[-transparent=[=]color]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-alphacolor=color]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-comment=text]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-nolzw]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-aspect=fraction]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-verbose] [netpbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options can be abbreviated
to their shortest unique prefix. You may use two hyphens
instead of one to designate an option. You may use either
white space or an equals sign <br>
between an option name and its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtogif reads a Netpbm image as
input and produces a GIF file as output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program creates only
individual GIF images. To combine multiple GIF images into
an animated GIF, use gifsicle
&acirc;&uml;http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/&acirc;&copy; (not
part of the Netpbm pack&acirc; <br>
age).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtogif creates either an
original GIF87 format GIF file or the newer GIF89 format. It
creates GIF89 when you request features that were new with
GIF89, to wit the -transparent <br>
or -comment options. Otherwise, it creates GIF87. Really old
GIF readers conceivably could not recognize GIF89.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GIF format is not capable of
representing an image with more than 256 colors in it (it
contains a color map with a maximum size of 256). If the
image you want to convert has <br>
more colors than that (ppmhist can tell you), you can use
pnmquant to reduce it to 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your input image is a PAM
with transparency information, ppmtogif uses one entry in
the GIF colormap specifically for the transparent pixels, so
you can have at most 255 <br>
opaque colors. In contrast, if you use the -transparent
option, one of the colors from the input becomes
transparent, so the limit is still 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamtogif was new in Netpbm 10.37
(December 2006). In older Netpbm, use ppmtogif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-interlace <br>
Produce an interlaced GIF file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sort Produce a GIF file with a
color map sorted in a predictable order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This does not produce the sorted
color map which is part of the GIF format. That kind of
sorted color map is one where the colors are sorted
according to how important <br>
they are, and the GIF header tells the viewer that it is
sorted that way. Its purpose is to allow the viewer to use
fewer colors than are in the color map if it is not <br>
capable of displaying all the colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What this option produces is a
color map sorted by red value, then green, then blue. That
can be useful in analyzing GIF images, particularly those
made with two versions <br>
of the program, because it removes some of the
variability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mapfile=mapfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the colors found in the file
mapfile to create the colormap in the GIF file, instead of
the colors from netpbmfile. mapfile can be any PPM file; all
that matters is <br>
the colors in it. If the colors in netpbmfile do not match
those in mapfile, pamtogif matches them to a &rsquo;best
match.&rsquo; You can obtain a much better result by using
pnm&acirc; <br>
remap to change the colors in the input to those in the map
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mapfile file is not a
palette file, just an image whose colors you want to use.
The order of colors in the GIF palette have nothing to do
with where they appear in <br>
the mapfile image, and duplication of colors in the image is
irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The map file&rsquo;s depth must
match the number of color components in the input (which is
not necessarily the same as the input&rsquo;s depth -- the
input might have an alpha plane <br>
in addition). If your map file does not, or it might not,
run your input through pnmremap using the same map file so
that it does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-transparent=color <br>
pamtogif marks the specified color as transparent in the GIF
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t specify
-transparent, pamtogif does not mark any color transparent
(except as indicated by the transparency information in the
input file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (color) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the color you specify is not
present in the image, pamtogif selects instead the color in
the image that is closest to the one you specify. Closeness
is measured as a <br>
Cartesian distance between colors in RGB space. If multiple
colors are equidistant, pamtogif chooses one of them
arbitrarily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if you prefix your
color specification with &rsquo;=&rsquo;, e.g.
-transparent==red, only the exact color you specify will be
transparent. If that color does not appear in <br>
the image, there will be no transparency. pamtogif issues an
information message when this is the case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify -transparent,
pamtogif ignores explicit transparency information (the
&rsquo;alpha channel&rsquo;) in the input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alpha=pgmfile <br>
There is no -alpha option. pamtogif&rsquo;s predecessor had
such an option because it was not capable of taking PAM
input that contains a transparency (alpha) plane, so one
<br>
used this option to supply a transparency plane as a
separate PGM file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option names a PGM file
that contains an alpha mask for the image. pamtogif creates
fully transparent pixels wherever the alpha mask indicates
transparency greater <br>
than 50%. The color of those pixels is that specified by the
-alphacolor option, or black by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To do this, pamtogif creates an
entry in the GIF colormap in addition to the entries for
colors that are actually in the image. It marks that
colormap entry as transpar&acirc; <br>
ent and uses that colormap index in the output image to
create a transparent pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The alpha image must be the same
dimensions as the input image, but may have any maxval.
White means opaque and black means transparent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot specify both
-transparent and -alpha.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alphacolor=color <br>
This specifies the foreground color for transparent pixels.
A viewer may use the foreground color for a transparent
pixel if it chooses not to have another color &rsquo;show
<br>
through.&rsquo;. The default is black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This applies only to pixels that
are transparent in the GIF because they are transparent in
the Netpbm input. If a GIF pixel is transparent because of
the -transparent <br>
option, the foreground color is the color indicated by that
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in GIF, all
transparent pixels have the same foreground color. (There is
only one entry in the GIF colormap for transparent
pixels).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify the color (color) as
described for the argument of the ppm_parsecolor() library
routine &acirc;&uml;libppm.html#colorname&acirc;&copy; .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-comment=text <br>
Include a comment in the GIF output with comment text
text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without this option, there are
no comments in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in a command shell,
you&rsquo;ll have to use quotation marks around text if it
contains characters (e.g. space) that would make the shell
think it is multiple argu&acirc; <br>
ments: <br>
$ pamtogif -comment &quot;this is a comment&quot;
&lt;xxx.ppm &gt;xxx.gif</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nolzw</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is mainly of
historical interest -- it involves use of a patent that is
now expired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option causes the GIF
output, and thus pamtogif, not to use LZW (Lempel-Ziv)
compression. As a result, the image file is larger and,
before the patent expired, no <br>
royalties would be owed to the holder of the patent on LZW.
See the section LICENSE below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LZW is a method for combining
the information from multiple pixels into a single GIF code.
With the -nolzw option, pamtogif creates one GIF code per
pixel, so it is not <br>
doing any compression and not using LZW. However, any GIF
decoder, whether it uses an LZW decompressor or not, will
correctly decode this uncompressed format. An LZW <br>
decompressor would see this as a particular case of LZW
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if someone uses an LZW
decompressor such as the one in giftopnm or pretty much any
graphics display program to process the output of pamtogif
-nolzw , he is then <br>
using the LZW patent. But the patent holder expressed far
less interest in enforcing the patent on decoding than on
encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-aspect=fraction <br>
This is the aspect ratio of the pixels of the image. Its
only effect is to record that information in the GIF for use
by whatever interprets the GIF. Note that this fea&acirc;
<br>
ture of GIF is hardly ever used and most GIF decoders ignore
this information and assume pixels are square.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pixels in a Netpbm image do not
have aspect ratios; there is always a one-one correspondence
between GIF pixels and Netpbm pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The aspect ratio is the quotient
of width divided by height. GIF allows aspect ratios from
0.25 (1:4) to 4 (4:1) in increments of 1/64. pamtogif
implements a natural <br>
extension of GIF that allows an aspect ratio up to 4 14/64.
If you specify anything outside this range, pamtogif fails.
pamtogif rounds fraction to the nearest 1/64.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is square (1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.38 (March 2007). Before that, the pixels are always
square.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
This option causes pamtogif to display information about the
conversion process and the image it produces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamtogif was new in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006). It
replaced ppmtogif, which created GIF images for
Pbmplus/Netpbm users since 1989.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main outward change in the
conversion from ppmtogif to pamtogif was that pamtogif was
able to use transparency information (&rsquo;alpha
channel&rsquo;) in PAM input, whereas with ppm&acirc; <br>
togif, one had to supply the transparency mask in a separate
pseudo-PGM image (via the -alpha option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jef Poskanzer wrote ppmtogif in
1989, and it has always been a cornerstone of Pbmplus/Netpbm
because GIF is such a popular image format. Jef based the
LZW encoding on GIFENCOD <br>
by David Rowley &lt;mgardi@watdcsu.waterloo.edu&gt;. Jef
included GIFENCOD&rsquo;s GIFCOMPR.C file pretty much whole.
Rowley, in turn, adapted the LZW compression code from
classic Unix <br>
compress, which used techniques described in IEEE Computer,
June 1984.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jef&rsquo;s ppmtogif notably
lacked the ability to use a transparency mask with it. You
could create transparent pixels in a GIF, but only with the
-transparent option, which allowed <br>
one to specify that all pixels of a certain color in the
input were to be transparent. Bryan Henderson added the
-alpha option in July 2001 so you could supply a mask image
that <br>
indicates exactly which pixels are to be transparent, and
those pixels could have the same color as other opaque
ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bryan Henderson added another
significant piece of code and function in October 2001: the
ability to generate a GIF without using the LZW patent -- an
uncompressed GIF. This was <br>
very important to many people at the time because the GIF
patent was still in force, and this allowed them to make an
image that any GIF viewer could display, royalty-free. <br>
Bryan adapted code from the Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s
djpeg for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no code in pamtogif
from Jef&rsquo;s original, but Jef may still hold copyright
over it due to the way in which it evolved. Virtually all of
the code in pamtogif was written <br>
by Bryan Henderson and contributed to the public domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LICENSE <br>
If you use pamtogif without the -nolzw option, you are using
a patent on the LZW compression method which is owned by
Unisys. The patent has expired (in 2003 in the US and in
<br>
2004 elsewhere), so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. While the
patent was in force, most people who used pamtogif and
similar programs did so without a license from Unisys to do
so. Unisys <br>
typically asked $5000 for a license for trivial use of the
patent. Unisys never enforced the patent against trivial
users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rumor has it that IBM also owns
or owned a patent covering pamtogif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A replacement for the GIF format
that never required any patents to use is the PNG
format.</p>
