<p>ATF-TEST-PROGRAM(1) BSD General Commands Manual
ATF-TEST-PROGRAM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
atf-test-program &acirc; common interface to ATF test
programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
atf-test-program [-r resfile] [-s srcdir] [-v var1=value1
[.. -v varN=valueN]] test_case <br>
atf-test-program -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Test programs written using the ATF libraries all share a
common user interface, which is what this manual page
describes. NOTE: There is no binary known as
atf-test-program; what <br>
is described in this manual page is the command-line
interface exposed by the atf-c, atf-c++ and atf-sh
bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first synopsis form, the
test program will execute the provided test case and print
its results to the standard output, unless otherwise stated
by the -r flag. Optionally, <br>
the test case name can be suffixed by
&acirc;:cleanup&acirc;, in which case the cleanup routine of
the test case will be executed instead of the test case
body; see atf-test-case(4). Note <br>
that the test case is executed without isolation, so it can
and probably will create and modify files in the current
directory. To execute test cases in a controller manner,
refer <br>
to atf-run(1), which is the preferred way to run test cases.
You should only execute test cases by hand for debugging
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second synopsis form, the
test program will list all available test cases alongside
their meta-data properties in a format that is machine
parseable. This list is processed <br>
by atf-run(1) to know how to execute the test cases of a
given test program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Lists available test cases
alongside a brief description for each of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r resfile Specifies the file
that will receive the test case result. If not specified,
the test case prints its results to stdout. If the result of
a test case needs to be <br>
parsed by another program, you must use this option to
redirect the result to a file and then read the resulting
file from the other program. Note: do not try to <br>
process the stdout of the test case because your program may
break in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s srcdir The path to the
directory where the test program is located. This is needed
in all cases, except when the test program is being executed
from the current direc&acirc; <br>
tory. The test program will use this path to locate any
helper data files or utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v var=value Sets the
configuration variable var to the value value.</p>
