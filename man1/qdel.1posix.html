<p>QDEL(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
QDEL(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
qdel &acirc; delete batch jobs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
qdel job_identifier...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A batch job is deleted by sending a request to the batch
server that manages the batch job. A batch job that has been
deleted is no longer subject to management by batch
ser&acirc; <br>
vices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qdel utility is a
user-accessible client of batch services that requests the
deletion of one or more batch jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qdel utility shall request a
batch server to delete those batch jobs for which a batch
job_identifier is presented to the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qdel utility shall delete
batch jobs in the order in which their batch job_identifiers
are presented to the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the qdel utility fails to
process any batch job_identifier successfully, the utility
shall proceed to process the remaining batch
job_identifiers, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qdel utility shall delete
each batch job by sending a Delete Job Request to the batch
server that manages the batch job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qdel utility shall not exit
until the batch job corresponding to each successfully
processed batch job_identifier has been deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The qdel utility shall accept one or more operands that
conform to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see
Section 3.3.1, Batch Job Identifier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of qdel:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGNAME Determine the login name
of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
An implementation of the qdel utility may write informative
messages to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
In addition to the default behavior, the qdel utility shall
not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server <br>
indicates that the batch job_identifier does not exist on
the server. Whether or not the qdel utility waits to output
the diagnostic message while attempting to locate the job on
<br>
other servers is implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The qdel utility allows users and administrators to delete
jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The qdel utility provides
functionality that is not otherwise available. For example,
the kill utility of the operating system does not suffice.
First, to use the kill utility, <br>
the user might have to log in on a remote node, because the
kill utility does not operate across the network. Second,
unlike qdel, kill cannot remove jobs from queues. Lastly,
<br>
the arguments of the qdel utility are job identifiers rather
than process identifiers, and so this utility can be passed
the output of the qselect utility, thus providing users <br>
with a means of deleting a list of jobs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because a set of jobs can be
selected using the qselect utility, the qdel utility has not
been complicated with options that provide for selection of
jobs. Instead, the batch <br>
jobs to be deleted are identified individually by their job
identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the qdel utility
has been a component of NQS, the existing practice on which
it is based. However, the qdel utility defined in this
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not <br>
provide an option for specifying a signal number to send to
the batch job prior to the killing of the process; that
capability has been subsumed by the qsig utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A discussion was held about the
delays of networking and the possibility that the batch
server may never respond, due to a down router, down batch
server, or other network <br>
mishap. The DESCRIPTION records this under the words
&lsquo;&lsquo;fails to process any job
identifier&rsquo;&rsquo;. In the broad sense, the network
problem is also an error, which causes the failure <br>
to process the batch job identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
The qdel utility may be removed in a future version.</p>
