<p>PERLSEC(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLSEC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlsec - Perl security</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Perl is designed to make it easy to program securely even
when running with extra privileges, like setuid or setgid
programs. Unlike most command line shells, which are based
on <br>
multiple substitution passes on each line of the script,
Perl uses a more conventional evaluation scheme with fewer
hidden snags. Additionally, because the language has more
<br>
builtin functionality, it can rely less upon external (and
possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT
INFORMATION <br>
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in
Perl, please email perl5-security-report@perl.org with
details. This points to a closed subscription, unarchived
<br>
mailing list. Please only use this address for security
issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS
<br>
Taint mode <br>
Perl automatically enables a set of special security checks,
called taint mode, when it detects its program running with
differing real and effective user or group IDs. The <br>
setuid bit in Unix permissions is mode 04000, the setgid bit
mode 02000; either or both may be set. You can also enable
taint mode explicitly by using the -T command line flag.
<br>
This flag is strongly suggested for server programs and any
program run on behalf of someone else, such as a CGI script.
Once taint mode is on, it&rsquo;s on for the remainder of
your <br>
script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While in this mode, Perl takes
special precautions called taint checks to prevent both
obvious and subtle traps. Some of these checks are
reasonably simple, such as verifying <br>
that path directories aren&rsquo;t writable by others;
careful programmers have always used checks like these.
Other checks, however, are best supported by the language
itself, and it <br>
is these checks especially that contribute to making a
set-id Perl program more secure than the corresponding C
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may not use data derived
from outside your program to affect something else outside
your program--at least, not by accident. All command line
arguments, environment <br>
variables, locale information (see perllocale), results of
certain system calls (&quot;readdir()&quot;,
&quot;readlink()&quot;, the variable of
&quot;shmread()&quot;, the messages returned by
&quot;msgrcv()&quot;, the <br>
password, gcos and shell fields returned by the
&quot;getpwxxx()&quot; calls), and all file input are marked
as &quot;tainted&quot;. Tainted data may not be used
directly or indirectly in any <br>
command that invokes a sub-shell, nor in any command that
modifies files, directories, or processes, with the
following exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Arguments to
&quot;print&quot; and &quot;syswrite&quot; are not checked
for taintedness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Symbolic
methods</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$obj-&gt;$method(@args);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and symbolic sub references</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&amp;{$foo}(@args); <br>
$foo-&gt;(@args);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">are not checked for taintedness.
This requires extra carefulness unless you want external
data to affect your control flow. Unless you carefully limit
what these symbolic <br>
values are, people are able to call functions outside your
Perl code, such as POSIX::system, in which case they are
able to run arbitrary external code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hash keys are
never tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For efficiency reasons, Perl
takes a conservative view of whether data is tainted. If an
expression contains tainted data, any subexpression may be
considered tainted, even if <br>
the value of the subexpression is not itself affected by the
tainted data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because taintedness is
associated with each scalar value, some elements of an array
or hash can be tainted and others not. The keys of a hash
are never tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$arg = shift; # $arg is tainted
<br>
$hid = $arg, &rsquo;bar&rsquo;; # $hid is also tainted <br>
$line = &lt;&gt;; # Tainted <br>
$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; # Also tainted <br>
open FOO, &quot;/home/me/bar&quot; or die $!; <br>
$line = &lt;FOO&gt;; # Still tainted <br>
$path = $ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;}; # Tainted, but see below
<br>
$data = &rsquo;abc&rsquo;; # Not tainted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system &quot;echo $arg&quot;; #
Insecure <br>
system &quot;/bin/echo&quot;, $arg; # Considered insecure
<br>
# (Perl doesn&rsquo;t know about /bin/echo) <br>
system &quot;echo $hid&quot;; # Insecure <br>
system &quot;echo $data&quot;; # Insecure until PATH set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$path =
$ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;}; # $path now tainted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;} =
&rsquo;/bin:/usr/bin&rsquo;; <br>
delete @ENV{&rsquo;IFS&rsquo;, &rsquo;CDPATH&rsquo;,
&rsquo;ENV&rsquo;, &rsquo;BASH_ENV&rsquo;};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$path =
$ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;}; # $path now NOT tainted <br>
system &quot;echo $data&quot;; # Is secure now!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO, &quot;&lt;
$arg&quot;); # OK - read-only file <br>
open(FOO, &quot;&gt; $arg&quot;); # Not OK - trying to
write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open(FOO,&quot;echo
$arg|&quot;); # Not OK <br>
open(FOO,&quot;-|&quot;) <br>
or exec &rsquo;echo&rsquo;, $arg; # Also not OK</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$shout = &lsquo;echo
$arg&lsquo;; # Insecure, $shout now tainted</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unlink $data, $arg; # Insecure
<br>
umask $arg; # Insecure</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec &quot;echo $arg&quot;; #
Insecure <br>
exec &quot;echo&quot;, $arg; # Insecure <br>
exec &quot;sh&quot;, &rsquo;-c&rsquo;, $arg; # Very
insecure!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@files = &lt;*.c&gt;; # insecure
(uses readdir() or similar) <br>
@files = glob(&rsquo;*.c&rsquo;); # insecure (uses readdir()
or similar)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># In Perl releases older than
5.6.0 the &lt;*.c&gt; and glob(&rsquo;*.c&rsquo;) would <br>
# have used an external program to do the filename
expansion; but in <br>
# either case the result is tainted since the list of
filenames comes <br>
# from outside of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$bad = ($arg, 23); # $bad will
be tainted <br>
$arg, &lsquo;true&lsquo;; # Insecure (although it
isn&rsquo;t really)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you try to do something
insecure, you will get a fatal error saying something like
&quot;Insecure dependency&quot; or &quot;Insecure
$ENV{PATH}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exception to the principle
of &quot;one tainted value taints the whole expression&quot;
is with the ternary conditional operator &quot;?:&quot;.
Since code with a ternary conditional</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$result = $tainted_value ?
&quot;Untainted&quot; : &quot;Also untainted&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is effectively</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ( $tainted_value ) { <br>
$result = &quot;Untainted&quot;; <br>
} else { <br>
$result = &quot;Also untainted&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for
$result to be tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Laundering and Detecting Tainted
Data <br>
To test whether a variable contains tainted data, and whose
use would thus trigger an &quot;Insecure dependency&quot;
message, you can use the &quot;tainted()&quot; function of
the Scalar::Util <br>
module, available in your nearby CPAN mirror, and included
in Perl starting from the release 5.8.0. Or you may be able
to use the following &quot;is_tainted()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub is_tainted { <br>
local $@; # Don&rsquo;t pollute caller&rsquo;s value. <br>
return ! eval { eval(&quot;#&quot; .
substr(join(&quot;&quot;, @_), 0, 0)); 1 }; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This function makes use of the
fact that the presence of tainted data anywhere within an
expression renders the entire expression tainted. It would
be inefficient for every <br>
operator to test every argument for taintedness. Instead,
the slightly more efficient and conservative approach is
used that if any tainted value has been accessed within the
<br>
same expression, the whole expression is considered
tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But testing for taintedness gets
you only so far. Sometimes you have just to clear your
data&rsquo;s taintedness. Values may be untainted by using
them as keys in a hash; otherwise <br>
the only way to bypass the tainting mechanism is by
referencing subpatterns from a regular expression match.
Perl presumes that if you reference a substring using $1,
$2, etc., <br>
that you knew what you were doing when you wrote the
pattern. That means using a bit of thought--don&rsquo;t just
blindly untaint anything, or you defeat the entire
mechanism. It&rsquo;s <br>
better to verify that the variable has only good characters
(for certain values of &quot;good&quot;) rather than
checking whether it has any bad characters. That&rsquo;s
because it&rsquo;s far too <br>
easy to miss bad characters that you never thought of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a test to make sure
that the data contains nothing but &quot;word&quot;
characters (alphabetics, numerics, and underscores), a
hyphen, an at sign, or a dot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ($data =~ /^([-@192 <br>
$data = $1; # $data now untainted <br>
} else { <br>
die &quot;Bad data in &rsquo;$data&rsquo;&quot;; # log this
somewhere <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is fairly secure because
&quot;/3120/&quot; would <br>
have been insecure in theory because it lets everything
through, but Perl doesn&rsquo;t check for that. The lesson
is that when untainting, you must be exceedingly careful
with your <br>
patterns. Laundering data using regular expression is the
only mechanism for untainting dirty data, unless you use the
strategy detailed below to fork a child of lesser <br>
privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example does not untaint
$data if &quot;use locale&quot; is in effect, because the
characters matched by &quot;1776 <br>
untrustworthy because they contain data from outside the
program. If you are writing a locale-aware program, and want
to launder data with a regular expression containing
&quot;24 <br>
put &quot;no locale&quot; ahead of the expression in the
same block. See &quot;SECURITY&quot; in perllocale for
further discussion and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switches On the &quot;#!&quot;
Line <br>
When you make a script executable, in order to make it
usable as a command, the system will pass switches to perl
from the script&rsquo;s #! line. Perl checks that any
command line <br>
switches given to a setuid (or setgid) script actually match
the ones set on the #! line. Some Unix and Unix-like
environments impose a one-switch limit on the #! line, so
you <br>
may need to use something like &quot;-wU&quot; instead of
&quot;-w -U&quot; under such systems. (This issue should
arise only in Unix or Unix-like environments that support #!
and setuid or setgid <br>
scripts.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taint mode and @INC <br>
When the taint mode (&quot;-T&quot;) is in effect, the
&quot;.&quot; directory is removed from @INC, and the
environment variables &quot;PERL5LIB&quot; and
&quot;PERLLIB&quot; are ignored by Perl. You can still
adjust <br>
@INC from outside the program by using the &quot;-I&quot;
command line option as explained in perlrun. The two
environment variables are ignored because they are obscured,
and a user <br>
running a program could be unaware that they are set,
whereas the &quot;-I&quot; option is clearly visible and
therefore permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another way to modify @INC
without modifying the program, is to use the &quot;lib&quot;
pragma, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl -Mlib=/foo program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The benefit of using
&quot;-Mlib=/foo&quot; over &quot;-I/foo&quot;, is that the
former will automagically remove any duplicated directories,
while the later will not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if a tainted string is
added to @INC, the following problem will be reported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insecure dependency in require
while running with -T switch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cleaning Up Your Path <br>
For &quot;Insecure $ENV{PATH}&quot; messages, you need to
set $ENV{&rsquo;PATH&rsquo;} to a known value, and each
directory in the path must be absolute and non-writable by
others than its owner and <br>
group. You may be surprised to get this message even if the
pathname to your executable is fully qualified. This is not
generated because you didn&rsquo;t supply a full path to the
<br>
program; instead, it&rsquo;s generated because you never set
your PATH environment variable, or you didn&rsquo;t set it
to something that was safe. Because Perl can&rsquo;t
guarantee that the <br>
executable in question isn&rsquo;t itself going to turn
around and execute some other program that is dependent on
your PATH, it makes sure you set the PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PATH isn&rsquo;t the only
environment variable which can cause problems. Because some
shells may use the variables IFS, CDPATH, ENV, and BASH_ENV,
Perl checks that those are <br>
either empty or untainted when starting subprocesses. You
may wish to add something like this to your setid and
taint-checking scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV
BASH_ENV)}; # Make %ENV safer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also possible to get
into trouble with other operations that don&rsquo;t care
whether they use tainted values. Make judicious use of the
file tests in dealing with any user- <br>
supplied filenames. When possible, do opens and such after
properly dropping any special user (or group!) privileges.
Perl doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from opening tainted
filenames <br>
for reading, so be careful what you print out. The tainting
mechanism is intended to prevent stupid mistakes, not to
remove the need for thought.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl does not call the shell to
expand wild cards when you pass &quot;system&quot; and
&quot;exec&quot; explicit parameter lists instead of strings
with possible shell wildcards in them. <br>
Unfortunately, the &quot;open&quot;, &quot;glob&quot;, and
backtick functions provide no such alternate calling
convention, so more subterfuge will be required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl provides a reasonably safe
way to open a file or pipe from a setuid or setgid program:
just create a child process with reduced privilege who does
the dirty work for you. <br>
First, fork a child using the special &quot;open&quot;
syntax that connects the parent and child by a pipe. Now the
child resets its ID set and any other per-process
attributes, like <br>
environment variables, umasks, current working directories,
back to the originals or known safe values. Then the child
process, which no longer has any special permissions, does
<br>
the &quot;open&quot; or other system call. Finally, the
child passes the data it managed to access back to the
parent. Because the file or pipe was opened in the child
while running <br>
under less privilege than the parent, it&rsquo;s not apt to
be tricked into doing something it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a way to do
backticks reasonably safely. Notice how the &quot;exec&quot;
is not called with a string that the shell could expand.
This is by far the best way to call something <br>
that might be subjected to shell escapes: just never call
the shell at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use English
&rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;; <br>
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t fork: $!&quot; unless defined($pid =
open(KID, &quot;-|&quot;)); <br>
if ($pid) { # parent <br>
while (&lt;KID&gt;) { <br>
# do something <br>
} <br>
close KID; <br>
} else { <br>
my @temp = ($EUID, $EGID); <br>
my $orig_uid = $UID; <br>
my $orig_gid = $GID; <br>
$EUID = $UID; <br>
$EGID = $GID; <br>
# Drop privileges <br>
$UID = $orig_uid; <br>
$GID = $orig_gid; <br>
# Make sure privs are really gone <br>
($EUID, $EGID) = @temp; <br>
die &quot;Can&rsquo;t drop privileges&quot; <br>
unless $UID == $EUID &amp;&amp; $GID eq $EGID; <br>
$ENV{PATH} = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;; # Minimal PATH. <br>
# Consider sanitizing the environment even more. <br>
exec &rsquo;myprog&rsquo;, &rsquo;arg1&rsquo;,
&rsquo;arg2&rsquo; <br>
or die &quot;can&rsquo;t exec myprog: $!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar strategy would work
for wildcard expansion via &quot;glob&quot;, although you
can use &quot;readdir&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Taint checking is most useful
when although you trust yourself not to have written a
program to give away the farm, you don&rsquo;t necessarily
trust those who end up using it not to <br>
try to trick it into doing something bad. This is the kind
of security checking that&rsquo;s useful for set-id programs
and programs launched on someone else&rsquo;s behalf, like
CGI <br>
programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is quite different,
however, from not even trusting the writer of the code not
to try to do something evil. That&rsquo;s the kind of trust
needed when someone hands you a program <br>
you&rsquo;ve never seen before and says, &quot;Here, run
this.&quot; For that kind of safety, you might want to check
out the Safe module, included standard in the Perl
distribution. This <br>
module allows the programmer to set up special compartments
in which all system operations are trapped and namespace
access is carefully controlled. Safe should not be <br>
considered bullet-proof, though: it will not prevent the
foreign code to set up infinite loops, allocate gigabytes of
memory, or even abusing perl bugs to make the host <br>
interpreter crash or behave in unpredictable ways. In any
case it&rsquo;s better avoided completely if you&rsquo;re
really concerned about security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security Bugs <br>
Beyond the obvious problems that stem from giving special
privileges to systems as flexible as scripts, on many
versions of Unix, set-id scripts are inherently insecure
right <br>
from the start. The problem is a race condition in the
kernel. Between the time the kernel opens the file to see
which interpreter to run and when the (now-set-id)
interpreter <br>
turns around and reopens the file to interpret it, the file
in question may have changed, especially if you have
symbolic links on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fortunately, sometimes this
kernel &quot;feature&quot; can be disabled. Unfortunately,
there are two ways to disable it. The system can simply
outlaw scripts with any set-id bit set, <br>
which doesn&rsquo;t help much. Alternately, it can simply
ignore the set-id bits on scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the kernel set-id
script feature isn&rsquo;t disabled, Perl will complain
loudly that your set-id script is insecure. You&rsquo;ll
need to either disable the kernel set-id <br>
script feature, or put a C wrapper around the script. A C
wrapper is just a compiled program that does nothing except
call your Perl program. Compiled programs are not subject
<br>
to the kernel bug that plagues set-id scripts. Here&rsquo;s
a simple wrapper, written in C:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#define REAL_PATH
&quot;/path/to/script&quot; <br>
main(ac, av) <br>
char **av; <br>
{ <br>
execv(REAL_PATH, av); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compile this wrapper into a
binary executable and then make it rather than your script
setuid or setgid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In recent years, vendors have
begun to supply systems free of this inherent security bug.
On such systems, when the kernel passes the name of the
set-id script to open to the <br>
interpreter, rather than using a pathname subject to
meddling, it instead passes /dev/fd/3. This is a special
file already opened on the script, so that there can be no
race <br>
condition for evil scripts to exploit. On these systems,
Perl should be compiled with
&quot;-DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW&quot;. The Configure
program that builds Perl tries to figure <br>
this out for itself, so you should never have to specify
this yourself. Most modern releases of SysVr4 and BSD 4.4
use this approach to avoid the kernel race condition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Protecting Your Programs <br>
There are a number of ways to hide the source to your Perl
programs, with varying levels of &quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First of all, however, you
can&rsquo;t take away read permission, because the source
code has to be readable in order to be compiled and
interpreted. (That doesn&rsquo;t mean that a CGI <br>
script&rsquo;s source is readable by people on the web,
though.) So you have to leave the permissions at the
socially friendly 0755 level. This lets people on your local
system only <br>
see your source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some people mistakenly regard
this as a security problem. If your program does insecure
things, and relies on people not knowing how to exploit
those insecurities, it is not <br>
secure. It is often possible for someone to determine the
insecure things and exploit them without viewing the source.
Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs
<br>
instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can try using encryption via
source filters (Filter::* from CPAN, or Filter::Util::Call
and Filter::Simple since Perl 5.8). But crackers might be
able to decrypt it. You <br>
can try using the byte code compiler and interpreter
described below, but crackers might be able to de-compile
it. You can try using the native-code compiler described
below, <br>
but crackers might be able to disassemble it. These pose
varying degrees of difficulty to people wanting to get at
your code, but none can definitively conceal it (this is
true <br>
of every language, not just Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re concerned about
people profiting from your code, then the bottom line is
that nothing but a restrictive license will give you legal
security. License your software and <br>
pepper it with threatening statements like &quot;This is
unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp. Your access to
it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; You <br>
should see a lawyer to be sure your license&rsquo;s wording
will stand up in court.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode <br>
Unicode is a new and complex technology and one may easily
overlook certain security pitfalls. See perluniintro for an
overview and perlunicode for details, and &quot;Security
<br>
Implications of Unicode&quot; in perlunicode for security
implications in particular.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Algorithmic Complexity Attacks
<br>
Certain internal algorithms used in the implementation of
Perl can be attacked by choosing the input carefully to
consume large amounts of either time or space or both. This
can <br>
lead into the so-called Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hash Function -
the algorithm used to &quot;order&quot; hash elements has
been changed several times during the development of Perl,
mainly to be reasonably fast. In Perl 5.8.1 also <br>
the security aspect was taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perls before 5.8.1 one could
rather easily generate data that as hash keys would cause
Perl to consume large amounts of time because internal
structure of hashes would <br>
badly degenerate. In Perl 5.8.1 the hash function is
randomly perturbed by a pseudorandom seed which makes
generating such naughty hash keys harder. See
&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot; in <br>
perlrun for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.8.1 the random
perturbation was done by default, but as of 5.8.2 it is only
used on individual hashes if the internals detect the
insertion of pathological data. If <br>
one wants for some reason emulate the old behaviour (and
expose oneself to DoS attacks) one can set the environment
variable PERL_HASH_SEED to zero to disable the protection
<br>
(or any other integer to force a known perturbation, rather
than random). One possible reason for wanting to emulate the
old behaviour is that in the new behaviour <br>
consecutive runs of Perl will order hash keys differently,
which may confuse some applications (like Data::Dumper: the
outputs of two different runs are no longer identical).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl has never guaranteed any
ordering of the hash keys, and the ordering has already
changed several times during the lifetime of Perl 5. Also,
the ordering of hash keys <br>
has always been, and continues to be, affected by the
insertion order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also note that while the order
of the hash elements might be randomised, this
&quot;pseudoordering&quot; should not be used for
applications like shuffling a list randomly (use <br>
List::Util::shuffle() for that, see List::Util, a standard
core module since Perl 5.8.0; or the CPAN module
Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle), or for generating
permutations <br>
(use e.g. the CPAN modules Algorithm::Permute or
Algorithm::FastPermute), or for any cryptographic
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Regular
expressions - Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine is so
called NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton), which among
other things means that it can rather easily consume <br>
large amounts of both time and space if the regular
expression may match in several ways. Careful crafting of
the regular expressions can help but quite often there
really <br>
isn&rsquo;t much one can do (the book &quot;Mastering
Regular Expressions&quot; is required reading, see
perlfaq2). Running out of space manifests itself by Perl
running out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Sorting - the
quicksort algorithm used in Perls before 5.8.0 to implement
the sort() function is very easy to trick into misbehaving
so that it consumes a lot of time. <br>
Starting from Perl 5.8.0 a different sorting algorithm,
mergesort, is used by default. Mergesort cannot misbehave on
any input.</p>
