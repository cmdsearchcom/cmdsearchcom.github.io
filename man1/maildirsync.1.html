<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple two-way
synchronization:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildirsync.pl -rvv -a md5
desktop:Maildir Maildir lib/sync_desk_note.bz2 <br>
maildirsync.pl -rvv -a md5 Maildir desktop:Maildir
lib/sync_note_desk.bz2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
maildirsync is a utility for online Maildir-synchronization.
It is designed to be used on live maildir folders, be
fail-safe and optimized for minimal bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW IT WORKS <br>
If you call the program once, it will propagate the changes
from the source side to the target side. Two-way
synchronization requires two state-file and two call for the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This propagation is basically
two different operations from the source side:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New file is
created or an existing file is moved to a new location (e.g
flags are changed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A file is
deleted in the source side. (Will be deleted in the target
side also).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the first phase, the source
side reads the state file (which stores the state of the
last synchronization) and compares it to the current state.
It collects the changes and <br>
sends them the target side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The target side checks every
file, which is marked new in the source file, and decides
if:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The file needs
to be downloaded fully</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Its header needs
to be downloaded</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; We have this
file already, so we need no data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After it decides, it sends back
the requests for new files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then the source side will send
the files to the target side, which stores them into the
Maildir structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the send operation is
completed, both operation agrees upon the commit operation.
Then the source side saves the new state into the state
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note if we forget saving the
state, or the program exits before it, the operation can be
restarted without data loss and inconsistency, because all
operations can be redone <br>
without errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE OPERATION <br>
Maildir can be used in remote mode, so it can synchronize
Maildir folders between computers. If you want to use it
this way, you have to provide the host name before either
the <br>
source or the target, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildirsync.pl ...
desktop:Maildir Maildir lib/maildirsync.bz2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildirsync.pl ... Maildir
desktop:Maildir lib/maildirsync.bz2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In remote mode, the target side
must have maildirsync installed also. (See the --maildirsync
command-line argument).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The state-file must be in the
same system as the source, so the source file in the first
example is searched in the &quot;desktop&quot; computer, and
in the local computer in the second <br>
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At least source or the
destination must be local, so you cannot sync maildirs on
two different remote hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES <br>
Some command line switches has two form: a short form and a
longer form. In the short form, the switches can be grouped,
like: -vvvr. Short options with parameters also can be <br>
grouped, but the parameter must be the following
command-line argument, like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildirsync.pl -rvvvbR
Maildir/Trash/cur ssh ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is the same as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maildirsync.pl --recursive
--verbose --verbose --verbose --backup Maildir/Trash/cur
--rsh ssh ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long options can use
&rsquo;=&rsquo; for assigning the parameter, or they can use
the syntax above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s see what switches we
have:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--recursive, -r <br>
Process the base folder as the recursive collection of
Maildir folders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup dir, -b dir <br>
The deleted files are backed up to the specified directory
(this directory does not needs to be a maildir folder). The
directory is relative to the start-up directory, not <br>
the target base folder! The directory is created if it does
not exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup-tree, -B <br>
This option is only useful when used in conjunction with the
--backup option. If set, deleted messages are moved to a
Maildir folders tree inside the backup directory with <br>
the same relative path. The resulting backup directory can
be used with any Maildir-capable application (MUAs, MTAs,
etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bzip2 bzip2 <br>
Path to the bzip2 utility (used only when the state file has
.bz2 extension). Note that using bzip2 is turned out to be
quite unstable, it sometimes leave the state file <br>
empty or corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gzip gzip <br>
Path to the gzip utility (used only when the state file has
.gz extension).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--maildirsync maildirsync.pl
<br>
Path to the maildirsync utility on the remote machine (if we
use maildirsync in remote mode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rsh ssh <br>
Path to the utility, which can be used to connect to the
remote side. It defaults to &quot;ssh&quot;. Note that the
protocol, which is used in remote mode, does not contain
<br>
compression, but the data can be compressed well, so I
suggest using the ssh compression for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--destination <br>
If it is provided, then it does transformation in the file
names. The transformations are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; win: Converts
&quot;:&quot; to &quot;&amp;#58;&quot; (since windows
don&rsquo;t allow colon in the filename).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; lin: Converts
&quot;&amp;#58;&quot; to &quot;:&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v <br>
Adds more verbosity to the operation. There are currently 6
different verbosity level:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No information at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Main operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Files sent, received, deleted,
moved, md5 calculations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Directories read and
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Options + command echo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Misc info about file
transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--alg md5, -a md5 <br>
Selects the synchronization algorithm. Currently two
algorithms are provided:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id (default) <br>
The messages are synchronized only by the ID of a message
(the ID can be determined by the message filename).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">md5 This method is recommended
for low bandwidth operations. This mode can reduce the file
transfers by checking the message moves on the target side.
This mode requires an <br>
MD5 sum on the body of the message, so the first use of this
mode can be quite time-consuming on both sides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information about the
algorithms, read the chapter about that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-before, -d <br>
Normally the delete operations on the target side is done
after the transfers. Use this switch if you don&rsquo;t have
too much space on your hard disk. Note that using this
switch <br>
can reduce the chance of detecting the message moves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude, -x <br>
Excludes a directory regexp from the transfer and removes it
from the state file. This option can be used more than once
to specify more than one directories. Note, that the <br>
directory, which is matched against these regexps are the
relative path of the folders with a leading &rsquo;/&rsquo;,
so if you want to exclude your Trash folder in the root of
your <br>
synchronization, then you have to use the following
form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude=^/Trash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The excluded paths are used in
either source or the target side also. So if you exclude a
very large directory, you will notice speedup in the source
and target side also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this regexp is matched
for every directory that is read from the filesystem, and
every directory what is found in the state file. So if you
provide the exclude <br>
pattern as ^/Trash$, then it will skip the Trash directory
when traversing the directory structure, but it WON&rsquo;T
skip files from the Trash/cur directory when reading from
the <br>
state file! So be careful if you use the exclude pattern
with existing state file!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-source,
--exclude-target <br>
These parameters can be used to exclude files only from one
side of the synchronization. Can be useful with the rename
options (below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename <br>
Can be used to rename files when transferred from one side
to another. A perl expression is the parameter for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use this option, use it
with care, because you have to provide exactly the opposite
of the name-transformation if you sync to the other side,
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In one side, you can use (A to
B):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rename=&quot;s{^/Saved/}{/ToBeSaved/}&quot;
--exclude-target=&quot;^/Saved/&quot; <br>
In the other side, you can use (B to A):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-source=&quot;^/Saved/&quot;
--rename=&quot;s{^/ToBeSaved/}{/Saved/}&quot; <br>
In this case, the Saved folder in the A side will be
synchronized with the ToBeSaved folder in the B side, and
the Saved folder in the B side will be excluded from the
<br>
synchronization. This scenario can be used when you
don&rsquo;t want to store your emails in the server, but you
want to use the &quot;Saved&quot; folder in the server too.
In this case, the <br>
emails will be downloaded from the server (A side) to your
laptop (B side), then you can move them to the Saved folder
in B with a script. If this is done, then you can <br>
resynchronize, then the saved files will disappear from the
server also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHMS <br>
Currently the program has two algorithms, which can be used
for synchronization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id (default) <br>
This algorithm is based on the message-id-s of the messages.
It assumes that a message-id exists only once in both
repositories with the same id. The id can be determined <br>
form the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this algorithm, you can
trace the flag changes or the deletion of a message and
these changes can be propagated to the other side also. It
also handles if a message is <br>
copied from the &quot;new&quot; directory to the
&quot;cur&quot; directory without retransmit the files over
the network.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This algorithm is recommended if
you want a simple and quite fast operation, and if you have
a not-so-slow internet connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">md5 This algorithm does further
calculations. It stores the size of the header and the md5
sum of the message body for each message besides the data
that the &quot;id&quot; algorithm <br>
stores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By using this algorithm, you can
track the copies and moves of a message, so you don&rsquo;t
need to retransmit large files if you move them to a new
folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you copy or move a message
from one folder to another, the header is sometimes changed
by the mail-reader program. This is why we cannot simply
calculate the MD5 sum of <br>
the whole message. A new message in a folder will have a new
identifier also, so it doesn&rsquo;t violate the law that a
message-id is unique.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you copy or move a message
from your INBOX to your &quot;Save&quot; folder (for
example), the new message is analyzed in the source side,
header-size and md5 sum is calculated on <br>
the new message, and from the md5-hash, the source side can
tell the target side what messages has the same hash-value,
so the target side can copy the body from the other <br>
message. If the target side has successfully copied the body
from one of those provided messages, then only the header
needs to be transmitted across the network. If the <br>
target-side did not find the messages, then it requests for
the body also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ONLINE OPERATION <br>
Online operation means that the software can be used in an
online mailbox also. It assumes that the Maildir folder can
be changed when the program is working, so it tries to be
<br>
as fail-safe as can be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every new file is opened in the
&quot;tmp&quot; directory, and moved to the target place
only when the file is fully downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This mode of operation was the
first priority, because this feature is missing from most
synchronizer software, including my &quot;drsync&quot;
utility also.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPEED <br>
I am using this program to synchronize my Mailboxes. I have
9700 emails in my mailbox and the state file (bzipped) is
283K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first time of a two-way
synchronization between a P166 server and a PIII/1200
notebook over a Cable network, where the starting position
is an already synchronized directory, <br>
tooks about 10 minutes. This time is used for
md5-calculation and message-id propagation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The next two-way run tooks about
40 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These things are measured in
Debian GNU/Linux testing/unstable operating system (08 Oct
2002).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are only the overhead of
the software, not the real transfer. If you got a very big
email, it needs to be transferred at least one time on the
network. But if you have it <br>
in both sides, then it does not require any more transfer if
you save it to different folders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
I am currently happy with this feature set, but if I have
time, I will implement these features into the software.
Anyway if you have time and willingness, I accept patches
also:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Message-size
limit. By limiting the maximum transmitted message, you can
effectively use this software if you have very low
bandwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Config-file and
cron-safe operation.</p>
