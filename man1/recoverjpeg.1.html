<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
recoverjpeg - recover jpeg pictures from a filesystem
image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
recoverjpeg [options] device</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Recoverjpeg tries to identify jpeg pictures from a
filesystem image. To achieve this goal, it scans the
filesystem image and looks for a jpeg structure at blocks
starting at 512 <br>
bytes boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Salvaged jpeg pictures are
stored by default under the name imageXXXXX.jpg where XXXXX
is a five digit number starting at zero. If there are more
than 100,000 recovered pic&acirc; <br>
tures, recoverjpeg will start using six figures numbers and
more as soon as needed, but the 100,000 first ones will use
a five figures number. Options -f and -i can override <br>
this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recoverjpeg stores the recovered
pictures into the current directory. If you want it to store
them elsewhere, just go to the directory you want
recoverjpeg to save the images <br>
into (using the cd command at the shell prompt) and start
recoverjpeg from there, or use the -o option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that device is not
necessarily a physical device. It may also be a file
containing a copy of the faulty device in order to reduce
the actual processing time and the stress <br>
imposed to an already defective hardware. dd(1) or
ddrescue(1) may be used to create such a working copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display an help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b blocksize <br>
Set the size of blocks in bytes. On most file systems,
setting it to 512 (the default) will work fine as any large
file will be stored on 512 bytes boundaries. Setting <br>
it to 1 maximize the chances of finding very small files if
the filesystems aggregates them (UFS for example) at the
expense of a much longer running time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d formatstring <br>
Set the directory format string (printf-style, default: use
the current directory). When used, 0 will be used for the
100 first images, 1 for the 100 next images, and so <br>
on. The goal of this option is to circumvent the directory
size limit imposed by some file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f formatstring <br>
Set the file name format string (printf-style, default:
&quot;image%05d.jpg&quot;). It is used with the image index
as an integer argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i integerindex <br>
Set the initial index value for image numbering (default:
0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m maxsize <br>
Maximum size of extract jpeg files. If a file would be
larger than that, it is discarded. The default is 6 MiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o directory <br>
Change the working directory before restoring files. Use
this option to restore files into a directory with enough
space instead of the current directory. This option <br>
can be repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Be quiet and do not display
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r readsize <br>
Set the readsize in bytes. By default, this is 128 MiB.
Using a large readsize reduces the number of system calls
but consumes more memory. The readsize will automati&acirc;
<br>
cally be adjusted to be a multiple of the system page size.
It must be greater than the maxsize parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s cutoffsize <br>
Set the cutoff size in bytes. Files smaller than that will
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S skipsize <br>
Set the number of bytes to skip at the beginning of the
filesystem image. This can be used to resume an interrupted
session, in conjunction with -i. The number of bytes <br>
may be rounded down to be a multiple of a memory page size
in order to improve performances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose and describes the
process of jpeg identification. By default, if this flag is
not used, recoverjpeg will print a progress bar showing how
much it has analyzed <br>
already and how many jpeg pictures have been recovered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Display program version and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the sizes may be suffixed by
a k, m, g, or t letter to indicate KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB.
For example, 6m correspond to 6 MiB (6291456 bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Recover as many pictures as possible from the memory card
located in /dev/sdc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recoverjpeg /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do the same thing but ignore
files smaller than one megabyte:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recoverjpeg -s 1m /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recover as many pictures as
possible from a crashed ReiserFS file system (which does not
necessarily store pictures at block boundaries) in
/dev/sdb1:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recoverjpeg -b 1 /dev/sdb1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do the same thing in a memory
constrained environment where no more than 16MB of RAM can
be used for the operation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">recoverjpeg -b 1 -r 16m
/dev/sdb1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If recoverjpeg saves your day
and you liked it, you are welcome to send me the best
rescued ones by email (please send only 800x600 versions of
the pictures) and authorize me to <br>
put them online (indicate which contact information you want
me to use for credits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN BUGS <br>
Recoverjpeg does not include a complete jpeg parser. You may
need to use sort-pictures afterwards to identify bogus
pictures. Some pictures may be corrupted but have a correct
<br>
structure; in this case, the image may be garbled. There is
no automated way to detect those pictures with a 100%
success rate.</p>
