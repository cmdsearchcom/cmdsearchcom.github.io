<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jack_iodelay - JACK toolkit client to measure roundtrip
latency</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jack_iodelay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jack_iodelay will create one input and one output port, and
then measures the latency (signal delay) between them. For
this to work, the output port must be connected to its <br>
input port. The measurement is accurate to a resolution of
greater than 1 sample.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expected use is to connect
jack_iodelay&rsquo;s output port to a hardware playback
port, then use a physical loopback cable from the
corresponding hardware output connector to an <br>
input connector, and to connect that corresponding hardware
capture port to jack_iodelay&rsquo;s input port. This
creates a roundtrip that goes through any analog-to-digital
and digi&acirc; <br>
tal-to-analog converters that are present in the audio
hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although the hardware loopback
latency is the expected use, it is also possible to use
jack_iodelay to measure the latency along any fully
connected signal path, such as those <br>
involving other JACK clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once jack_iodelay completes its
measurement it will print the total latency it has detected.
This will include the JACK buffer length in addition to any
other latency in the sig&acirc; <br>
nal path. It will continue to print the value every 0.5
seconds so that if you wish you can vary aspects of the
signal path to see their effect on the measured latency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no incoming signal is
detected from the input port, jack_iodelay will print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signal below threshold... .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">every second until this changes
(e.g. until you establish the correct connections).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the value measured by
jack_iodelay with the -I and -O arguments of a JACK backend
(also called Input Latency and Output Latency in the setup
dialog of qjackctl), you must <br>
subtract the JACK buffer size from the result. The buffer
size is determined by multiplying the number of frames per
period (given to the jackd backend by the -p or --period
<br>
option) by the number of periods per buffer (given to the
jackd backend by the -n or --nperiods option). Note that
JACK2 will add an implicit additional period when using the
<br>
default asynchronous mode, so for JACK1 or JACK2 in
synchronous mode, the buffer size is n*p, but for JACK2 in
asynchronous mode the buffer size is (n+1)*p. Once the JACK
buffer <br>
size is subtracted from the measured latency, the result is
the &quot;extra&quot; latency due to the interface hardware.
Then, if you believe that the latency is equally distributed
<br>
between the input and output parts of your audio hardware
(extremely likely), divide the result by two and use that
for input and output latency values. Doing this measurement
<br>
will enable JACK clients that use the JACK latency API to
accurately position/delay audio to keep signals synchronized
even when there are inherent delays in the end-to-end
sig&acirc; <br>
nal pathways.</p>
