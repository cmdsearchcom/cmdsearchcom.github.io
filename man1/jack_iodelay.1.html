jack_iodelay - JACK toolkit client to measure roundtrip latency
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>jack_iodelay</b>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>jack_iodelay</b> will create one input and one output port, and then measures
  the latency (signal delay) between them. For this to work, the output port
  must be connected to its input port. The measurement is accurate to a
  resolution of greater than 1 sample.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The expected use is to connect jack_iodelay's output port to a hardware playback
  port, then use a physical loopback cable from the corresponding hardware
  output connector to an input connector, and to connect that corresponding
  hardware capture port to jack_iodelay's input port. This creates a roundtrip
  that goes through any analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters that
  are present in the audio hardware.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although the hardware loopback latency is the expected use, it is also possible
  to use jack_iodelay to measure the latency along any fully connected signal
  path, such as those involving other JACK clients.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once jack_iodelay completes its measurement it will print the total latency it
  has detected. This will include the JACK buffer length in addition to any
  other latency in the signal path. It will continue to print the value every
  0.5 seconds so that if you wish you can vary aspects of the signal path to see
  their effect on the measured latency.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no incoming signal is detected from the input port, jack_iodelay will print
<div class="Pp"></div>
 Signal below threshold... .
<div class="Pp"></div>
every second until this changes (e.g. until you establish the correct
  connections).
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use the value measured by jack_iodelay with the -I and -O arguments of a JACK
  backend (also called Input Latency and Output Latency in the setup dialog of
  qjackctl), you must subtract the JACK buffer size from the result. The buffer
  size is determined by multiplying the number of frames per period (given to
  the jackd backend by the -p or --period option) by the number of periods per
  buffer (given to the jackd backend by the -n or --nperiods option). Note that
  JACK2 will add an implicit additional period when using the default
  asynchronous mode, so for JACK1 or JACK2 in synchronous mode, the buffer size
  is n*p, but for JACK2 in asynchronous mode the buffer size is (n+1)*p. Once
  the JACK buffer size is subtracted from the measured latency, the result is
  the &quot;extra&quot; latency due to the interface hardware. Then, if you
  believe that the latency is equally distributed between the input and output
  parts of your audio hardware (extremely likely), divide the result by two and
  use that for input and output latency values. Doing this measurement will
  enable JACK clients that use the JACK latency API to accurately position/delay
  audio to keep signals synchronized even when there are inherent delays in the
  end-to-end signal pathways.
