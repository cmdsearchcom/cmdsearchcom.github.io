<p>BRSCCLA(1) BP executables BRSCCLA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
brsccla - BRSC-based BP convergence layer adapter (input and
output) task</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
brsccla server_hostname[:server_port_nbr]_own_node_nbr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
BRSC is the &quot;client&quot; side of the Bundle Relay
Service (BRS) convergence layer protocol for BP. It is
complemented by BRSS, the &quot;server&quot; side of the BRS
convergence layer <br>
protocol for BP. BRS clients send bundles directly only to
the server, regardless of their final destinations, and the
server forwards them to other clients as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsccla is a background
&quot;daemon&quot; task comprising three threads: one that
connects to the BRS server, spawns the other threads, and
then handles BRSC protocol output by <br>
transmitting bundles over the connected socket to the BRS
server; one that simply sends periodic &quot;keepalive&quot;
messages over the connected socket to the server (to assure
that <br>
local inactivity doesn&rsquo;t cause the connection to be
lost); and one that handles BRSC protocol input from the
connected server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output thread connects to
the server&rsquo;s TCP socket at server_hostname and
server_port_nbr, sends over the connected socket the
client&rsquo;s own_node_nbr (in SDNV representation) <br>
followed by a 32-bit time tag and a 160-bit HMAC-SHA1 digest
of that time tag, to authenticate itself; checks the
authenticity of the 160-bit countersign returned by the
server; <br>
spawns the keepalive and receiver threads; and then begins
extracting bundles from the queues of bundles ready for
transmission via BRSC and transmitting those bundles over
the <br>
connected socket to the server. Each transmitted bundle is
preceded by its length, a 32-bit unsigned integer in network
byte order. The default value for server_port_nbr, if <br>
omitted, is 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reception thread receives
bundles over the connected socket and passes them to the
bundle protocol agent on the local ION node. Each bundle
received on the connection is <br>
preceded by its length, a 32-bit unsigned integer in network
byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keepalive thread simply
sends a &quot;bundle length&quot; value of zero (a 32-bit
unsigned integer in network byte order) to the server once
every 15 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that brsccla is not a
&quot;promiscuous&quot; convergence layer daemon: it can
transmit bundles only to the BRS server to which it is
connected, so scheme configuration directives <br>
that cite this outduct need only provide the protocol name
and the BRSC outduct name as specified on the command line
when brsccla is started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsccla is spawned automatically
by bpadmin in response to the &rsquo;s&rsquo; (START)
command that starts operation of the Bundle Protocol, and it
is terminated by bpadmin in response to an <br>
&rsquo;x&rsquo; (STOP) command. brsccla can also be spawned
and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that
pertain specifically to the BRSC convergence layer
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; brsccla terminated normally, for reasons noted
in the ion.log file. If this termination was not commanded,
investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file
and <br>
use bpadmin to restart the BRSC protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;1&quot; brsccla terminated
abnormally, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.
Investigate and solve the problem identified in the log
file, then use bpadmin to restart the BRSC <br>
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
No configuration files are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsccla can&rsquo;t attach to
BP. <br>
bpadmin has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such brsc induct. <br>
No BRSC induct with duct name matching server_hostname,
own_node_nbr, and server_port_nbr has been added to the BP
database. Use bpadmin to stop the BRSC convergence-layer
<br>
protocol, add the induct, and then restart the BRSC
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLI task is already started for
this duct. <br>
Redundant initiation of brsccla.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No such brsc outduct. <br>
No BRSC outduct with duct name matching server_hostname,
own_node_nbr, and server_port_nbr has been added to the BP
database. Use bpadmin to stop the BRSC convergence-layer
<br>
protocol, add the outduct, and then restart the BRSC
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t connect to server.
<br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Can&rsquo;t register with
server. <br>
Configuration error. Authentication has failed, probably
because (a) the client and server are using different
HMAC/SHA1 keys or (b) the clocks of the client and server
<br>
differ by more than 5 seconds. Update security policy
database(s), as necessary, and assure that the clocks are
synchronized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsccla can&rsquo;t create
receiver thread <br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">brsccla can&rsquo;t create
keepalive thread <br>
Operating system error. Check errtext, correct problem, and
restart BRSC.</p>
