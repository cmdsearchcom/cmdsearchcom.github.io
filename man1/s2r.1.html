<p>S2R(1) ALLIANCE USER COMMANDS S2R(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
s2r - Process mapping from symbolic layout to physical
layout</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
s2r [-tc1rv] source [result]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The goal of s2r is to perform the translation from the
symbolic layout to physical layout for the foundry. s2r uses
a technolgy file whose name is defined by the environnement
<br>
variable RDS_TECHNO_NAME. <br>
Some cells, like I/O pads, are specific to a given foundry.
In the symbolic methodology, these cells are phantom cells.
It means that only their abutment box and and connectors
<br>
are present. s2r wil substitute physical cells to the
symbolic phamtom cells. Beware, this implies that the
manufacturer cells must be modified by hand to ensure the
abutment <br>
box is a symbolic grid step multiple, and that the real
connectors are centered on symbolic grid. <br>
In order for the replacement to work well, the physicals
cells must have the abutment box lower left corner at
coordinate (0,0) The name of cells to be replaced are
written in <br>
the catalog file with the G attribute, see catal(5) for
details on that file. See also ring(1) for more on pads.
Ouput can be generated in either cif or gds formats, to fit
the <br>
manufacturer requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mainly two kinds of users are
concerned with s2r :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">experts they should be able to
parametrize the technology file for a new process technology
file is described in techno(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">designers they are not directly
concerned with the target process, but need to be able to
compute real capacitances for simulation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source argument is the name
of the symbolic layout file to be translated. The optional
result argument indicates the name to be given to the real
layout output. This name <br>
is also the name of the top level model of the layout
hierarchy. If result name is omitted, then source name is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Six environment variables must
be set for proper usage of s2r, all of them having default
values, thus ensuring the possibility of using it
&lsquo;&lsquo;as it is&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_IN_PH The input format for
symbolic layout is given by this environment variable. The
possible values are cp, ap. Default is cp. See MBK_IN_PH(1)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_CATA_LIB Sets the
directories that are to be searched thru for reading files.
The seaching mecanism first look in MBK_WORK_LIB(1)
MBK_WORK_LIB defines the path where <br>
the generated file is saved. Make sure the write permissions
are set up correctly, otherwise no save will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MBK_CATAL_NAME This indicates
the name of the catalog file used for pad substitution. For
the appropriate syntax of this file, see catal(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RDS_IN Defines the format to be
used as input for cell substitution. The available ones are
cif and gds (default one). The cells to be parsed must not
containt 45 <br>
degrees wires. If an unknown layer is encountered, the
entire cell will be skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RDS_OUT Gives the format of the
output file. This may be either cif or gds (default is
gds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RDS_TECHNO_NAME This points to
the technology file to be used for symbolic to real
translation. This file is in general shared between all the
designers. it is the full <br>
path name to the file location, with the extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Without option, s2r should produce a layout that fits for
the foundry. Nevertheless, its behaviour can be modified
when invoked with the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Suppress the denotching
phase. s2r performs gap filling, denotching in order to
avoid DRC errors. This operation is time consuming. It is
mandatory for the <br>
foundry but not really useful for capacitance
evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Deletes connectors and node
names at all hierarchy level. Theses objects link the
physical view and the logical view of a chip. If simulation
is to be done <br>
after physical mapping, connectors must appear, so that the
extractors and simulators can use them. This must not be
used when preparing a final layout for <br>
the foundry. <br>
For the factory, the top level connectors are forbidden,
since they do not represent any physical reality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Creates the top level cell
with the instances as black boxes. This may be useful for
hierarchical extractors, since the file size may be greatly
reduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r does not replace black boxes.
Cells flagged with the G attribute in the catal(5) file will
not be replaced by their equivalent layout loaded from
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose mode on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
You should first have a correct execution environment : <br>
It is recommanded to put it in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;.cshrc&rsquo;&rsquo; file if in c shell, as in
the example below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setenv MBK_IN_PH ap <br>
setenv MBK_WORK_LIB ~fred/mbk/layout <br>
setenv MBK_CATA_LIB ~franck/s2r:/alliance/cells <br>
setenv MBK_CATAL_NAME catalog <br>
setenv RDS_TECHNO_NAME /labo/etc/prol15.rds <br>
setenv RDS_IN gds <br>
setenv RDS_OUT gds <br>
s2r -c na2_y <br>
This invocation will produce the cell na2_y from the
standard cell library in real layout, without connectors,
scotches if needed, in gds format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mbk(1), ring(1), MBK_IN_PH(1), MBK_CATA_LIB(1),
MBK_WORK_LIB(1), MBK_CATAL_NAME(1), RDS_IN(1), RDS_OUT(1),
RDS_TECHNO_NAME(1), techno(5), catal(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The actual version of the gds parser and driver
doesn&rsquo;t translate neither connectors, nor node names.
If an extraction on s2r output is needed, cif format will
create the con&acirc; <br>
nectors using cif extension 4X, and the node names with
4N.</p>
