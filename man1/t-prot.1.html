<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
t-prot - TOFU Protection - Display Filter for RFC 5322
messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
t-prot [OPTIONS]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is a filter to improve the readability of
internet messages (emails and usenet posts) by *hiding* some
annoying parts, e.g. mailing list footers, signatures, and
<br>
TOFU (see definition below), as well as squeezing sequences
of blank lines or punctuation. The program also detects TOFU
or a high quoting ratio in a message (so you may take <br>
appropriate action, e.g. when submitting messages to a
mailing list or a news server). <br>
The filter is written in Perl and relies on input to be a
single message conforming to RFC 822 or its successors, RFC
2822 and RFC 5322. In messages conforming to MIME (RFCs <br>
2045-2049) t-prot handles text/plain parts, others are not
touched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Already reformatted messages are
handled well: the script was initially designed to cope with
the output of the MUA mutt (which is the reason for not
using standard CPAN modules <br>
for handling messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T-prot offers example
configuration files for mutt and its fork mutt-kz, Heirloom
mailx and metamail. Also coming with the t-prot package is
the example S-Lang macro t-prot.sl <br>
for using t-prot from within slrn. There is a
proof-of-concept filter for INN2, which you will have to
adapt to the needs of the news site you host. For use with
sendmail&rsquo;s <br>
alias(5) file, please see below (the option -p provides an
example line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If you do not specify any options, t-prot does ... nothing.
Every feature you want must be turned on explicitly.
Admittedly, we have quite a number of options for t-prot. To
<br>
limit confusion they are grouped into five sections:
Input/Output Options, Advertisement And Mailing List
Footers, Filtering Options, Detection Options, and Other
Options. While <br>
the others should be quite clear, filtering and detection
might deserve a word (or two).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to tune the
appearance of your mail from within your MUA (or news
messages from within your NUA), then go for the Filtering
Options section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use t-prot to
check on mails before they are submitted to mailing lists,
fed to your news server, or delivered by your MDA, then have
a peek at the Detection <br>
Options section. You may accept or reject/bounce messages
depending on t-prot&rsquo;s result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT/OUTPUT OPTIONS <br>
-i FILE <br>
Defines an input file; default is &rsquo;-&rsquo; i.e.
STDIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o FILE <br>
Defines the output file; default is STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--body Input consists just of
the message&rsquo;s body. There are no RFC 5322 header
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This does not work with
--pgp-short, and multipart messages will not be detected due
to missing headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lax-security <br>
Allow insecure writing method. DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU REALLY
KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. (This ugly workaround is needed for
some early mutt versions and should NEVER be used <br>
as a default, otherwise it will probably turn into a
security issue.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this option safely
to enable -o /dev/null (or other files which cannot be
changed with the user&rsquo;s privileges).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-lines=x <br>
Maximum number of lines a message may count (with headers).
If the message is longer than x lines, the message will not
be processed but printed unmodified. Exit status <br>
will be EX_DATAERR except when called with -Mmutt or
-Mmutt-kz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVERTISEMENT AND MAILING LIST
FOOTERS <br>
-a &quot;commercial signature&quot;: Hides
&quot;footers&quot; (signatures) from commercial email
providers. <br>
This option compares the last lines of the message body with
any footer file found in the directory specified with -A
DIRECTORY (which is mandatory for this option). The <br>
comparison is done by perl&rsquo;s index() function (please
try perldoc -f index for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option is not needed
if --ftr-ad is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftr-ad <br>
&quot;enable aggressive ad footer matching&quot;: With this
option enabled, t-prot makes footer detection really greedy:
We assume that commercial email providers aren&rsquo;t even
<br>
frightened to append changing texts *under* their ads which
are appended to the message body. Because these texts even
have changing lengths we simply detect the lines of <br>
the footer *anywhere* in the body of the message and assume
that everything below belongs to the footer. (Man, if life
where always that easy! ;) <br>
With this option even GMX ads should be easy to hide -- you
buy this with a slight performance hit (which is the reason
this option is disabled by default), and with the <br>
possibility that sometimes the algorithm is just a little
*too* greedy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This requires a directory
with footer files to be given with option -A DIRECTORY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A DIRECTORY <br>
&quot;ad footer directory&quot;: Defines the directory which
contains the advertisement list footers (one footer per
file) which are to be tested when removing them with options
-a <br>
or --ftr-ad. <br>
This option is also needed if you do not want signature
lengths to be counted wrong or fullquotes get undetected
when an ad footer is appended at the bottom of the message
<br>
(especially when using -S or -t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &quot;list signature&quot;:
Hides &quot;footers&quot; (signatures) from mailing lists.
Footer detection works like the -a option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This requires a directory
with footer files to be given with option -L DIRECTORY. -l
is not needed if --ftr-ml is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ftr-ml <br>
&quot;enable aggressive mailing list footer matching&quot;:
With this option enabled t-prot makes footer detection
really greedy: Should be helpful with broken list servers,
or even <br>
if your email provider munges the bodies of your messages.
<br>
Works similar to --ftr-ad, just that it is intended for
mailing list footers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This requires a directory
with footer files to be given with option -L DIRECTORY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L DIRECTORY <br>
&quot;list footer directory&quot;: Defines the directory
which contains the mailing list footers (one footer per
file) which are to be tested when removing them with the
options -l <br>
or --ftr-ml. <br>
This option is also needed if you do not want signature
lengths to be counted wrong or fullquotes get undetected
when a mailing list footer is appended at the bottom of <br>
the message (especially when using -S or -t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILTER OPTIONS <br>
--bigq[=n[,x]] <br>
&quot;shrink big quotes&quot;: Blocks of quotes with more
than n lines will be shrunk to x lines. Defaults are 30 for
n and 10 for x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c[n] &quot;compress&quot;:
Squeezes a sequence of blank lines to just n blank lines. n
defaults to 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff Tolerate unified diff
(see diff(1) and patch(1)) appended after the signature
(which usually makes the signature too long to be
valid).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, protect diff standard
output from hiding (which would otherwise be easy prey for
-t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &quot;ellipsis&quot;:
Squeezes a sequence of four or more dots, exclamation marks,
or question marks to only three dots or marks,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fixind <br>
Fix broken quotes to adhere to RFC 3676 by removing spaces
between quote characters and adding a space after them. <br>
NOTE: This may produce false positives if spaces in between
quote characters are intended (thus changing the quoting
level, see RFC 3676 for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--groupwise <br>
Hides TOFU as produced by Novell Groupwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k &quot;anti Kammquote&quot;:
Tries (not too aggressively) to fix those broken
zig-zag-shaped lines wrapped around by some MUAs which are
known as &quot;Kammquoting&quot; in German.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This option is considered
stable by now. However, sometimes Kammquotes should have
been removed but weren&rsquo;t. Please send a bug report if
this happens to you (after <br>
carefully reading the BUGS and REPORTING BUGS section of
this man page, that is).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please also note that enabling
this option is quite a performance hit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kdiff=n <br>
Minimum length difference between two lines for wrapped line
detection on Kammquotes. For details, please see the source
code. <br>
Anyway, lower values make the algorithm more aggressive,
higher values make Kammquotes harder to detect. Default is
20.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kmaxl=n <br>
Maximum line length for wrapped line detection on
Kammquotes. For details, please see the source code. <br>
Anyway, higher values make the algorithm more aggressive,
lower values make Kammquotes harder to detect. Default is
80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--kminl=n <br>
Minimum line length for wrapped line detection on
Kammquotes. For details, please see the source code. <br>
Anyway, lower values make the algorithm more aggressive,
higher values make Kammquotes harder to detect. Default is
65.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires -k.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--locale=LOCALE <br>
Specify which locale to use for correct parsing of your
MUA&rsquo;s formatting of the displayed message (usually it
is the locale your MUA uses). Right now this option is only
<br>
used when -Mmutt or -Mmutt-kz is specified, but this may
change in future. You need the Perl module Locale::gettext
for this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If you use mutt, mutt-kz
or gnupg with locales, t-prot will only work correctly if
you specify the corresponding locale string. Alternatively,
you can use the envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variables LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, or LANG to specify
the locale string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE also: You also have to make
sure you are running t-prot with matching gnupg and mutt /
mutt-kz versions. T-prot detects gnupg and mutt / mutt-kz
locales of the recent <br>
stable versions of those programs, earlier versions might
not work well with a recent version of t-prot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --muaMUA <br>
&quot;mail user agent&quot;: Turn on special treatment for
some mail user agents. (Right now only mutt(1) and
mutt-kz(1) are supported, but more might be added in
future.) Caveat: <br>
If your MUA is supported by this feature you must ensure
t-prot makes use of it when called from within your MUA to
work as desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &quot;Microsoft TOFU&quot;:
Hides TOFU as given by some Microsoft mailers. (You all
surely know these fullquotes beginning with <br>
&quot;----- Original Message -----&quot; <br>
and some header lines...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ms-smart <br>
Burn CPU cycles trying to be smart with MS style TOFU: If
there are PGP signed parts inside the TOFU, the text still
might conceal other message parts and therefore should <br>
not be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that this is
probably just a waste of time because most MS Outlook users
who do produce this kind of TOFU won&rsquo;t care about
making their messages the least bit <br>
readable or even predictable. So this option will probably
just be interesting for mutt message hooks (to activate it
on demand when you know the sender tries to write <br>
legible messages).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Requires -Mmutt / -Mmutt-kz and
-m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp-move <br>
Move PGP and SSL verification output to bottom; requires
-Mmutt / -Mmutt-kz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp-move-vrf <br>
Move PGP and SSL verification output to bottom only if
verification shows a good signature and the signature could
be verified as authentic (using a trust path). If there <br>
is any problem with the signature, the PGP output should not
be moved so the user is more likely to notice. Requires
-Mmutt / -Mmutt-kz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If gpg is terminated
before finished (e.g. hitting Ctrl-C, or using kill(1)), we
cannot always detect if the check was interrupted. Though
t-prot tries to be smart, <br>
there will be false positives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pgp-short <br>
Hide non-relevant PGP key uids; requires -Mmutt /
-Mmutt-kz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r &quot;rip header off&quot;:
Hides all mail header lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reply <br>
Subject lines with multiple reply prefixes (Re: and
translations into other languages) get squeezed to only one
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S[n] &quot;suppression of
overlong signatures&quot;: Signatures are to be n lines (not
including the one containing dash-dash-space) or less. If
there are more, it is probably not that <br>
spirited after all. So with this option you trade it for a
truely nice line. <br>
If no n is given, default is 4. (We do not recommend using a
value other than 4. Consider this old-fashioned, but we
actually do *like* RFC conformance.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The line containing
&quot;-- &quot; ist not counted when testing for an overlong
signature, but it is included when displaying how many lines
were deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &quot;signature
deletion&quot;: Hides signatures, i.e. all lines after a
&quot;signature dashes&quot; line, i.e. a line with three
characters: dash-dash-space (no more, no less).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sani Sanitize headers
&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;From:&quot; and &quot;Subject:&quot;:
Quoted-printable gets fixed to the corresponding chars.
German Umlauts are translated to their &quot;ae&quot;,
&quot;oe&quot;, &quot;ue&quot; pendants. <br>
Useful e.g. for searching by subject within MUAs like
Berkeley mailx.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sigsmax[=n] <br>
&quot;maximum number of tolerated signatures&quot;: Here you
can define how many signatures you accept to be treated as
such. (Most significant behaviour is when microsoft style
<br>
quotes are removed. Experts please see the code for the more
subtle implications of this option.) <br>
Leave empty or specify zero to have an unlimited number of
sigs. Default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--spass <br>
&quot;SpamAssassin workaround&quot;: SpamAssassin (available
at http://spamassassin.org/) often is configured that it
adds some lines to the message body containing information
<br>
about the spam criteria which were found matching for the
message. This option enables an extra test to avoid false
positives for Microsoft style TOFU on such messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &quot;TOFU deletion&quot;:
Hides &quot;traditional style&quot; TOFU, where each line
begins with the indent string &quot;&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &quot;whitespace
deletion&quot;: Hides trailing whitespace (sequences of
space and tab). CAVEAT: This may lead to interesting effects
with crossposts between mailing lists or with <br>
undetected signature attempts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DETECTION OPTIONS <br>
-P MESSAGE <br>
&quot;user defined bounce message for picky delivery&quot;:
You may specify your own bounce message to be returned when
we try to deliver an email and bounce it because there is
<br>
TOFU inside. See -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [ADDRESS] <br>
&quot;picky delivery&quot;: If we really find some TOFU,
abort with exit code EX_UNAVAILABLE. Otherwise redirect the
message to ADDRESS if given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Intended for use from within
mail delivery agents (MDAs) or mail transport agents (MTAs),
or even from within INN, so the message bounces if TOFU is
detected, and does not <br>
get on *your* nerves. :)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example for usage with
sendmail, put this line into your alias file and invoke
newaliases:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notofu:
|&quot;/usr/local/bin/t-prot -mt -p=user@mydomain&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will bounce messages for
&lt;notofu@domainname&gt; if any TOFU is detected inside the
message, and deliver it to &lt;user@mydomain&gt; otherwise.
Note that TOFU is only detected <br>
if you specify -t respectively -m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLEASE be careful not to bounce
messages to mailing lists!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check[=FLAGS] <br>
Run checks. If successful, print an error message and quit
with an appropriate exit code. Useful e.g. for rejecting
messages from within INN2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags are separated by commas
(no whitespaces), and can be the following (right now just
one flag):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ratio[=n] <br>
If the quoting ratio is n or more, the message is rejected.
Must be between 0 and 1, or else it is entirely disabled.
Default is 0.75 (i.e., 75% of the message lines are <br>
quotes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --debug <br>
Print envelope info to syslog when bouncing TOFU
contaminated email. Default syslog facility is mail.debug.
Requires -p.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Displays a short help text with a summary on all options,
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Prints the current version number and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variables LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and LANG are
read and respected when interpreting output by mutt /
mutt-kz or gnupg (unless they are overruled by the --locale
<br>
option). T-prot&rsquo;s own output is English regardless of
any locale setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
On program exit, t-prot uses exit codes from
/usr/include/sysexits.h and thus behaves in a manner that
sendmail and others understand when calling t-prot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently, the codes used are
<br>
EX_OK <br>
EX_USAGE <br>
EX_DATAERR <br>
EX_UNAVAILABLE <br>
EX_SOFTWARE <br>
EX_IOERR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If, however, perl fails to
compile and execute t-prot, perl&rsquo;s normal exit codes
will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TOFU? <br>
TOFU is an abbreviation which mixes German and English
words; it expands to &quot;text oben, full-quote unten&quot;
which means &quot;text above - full quote below&quot; and
describes the style of <br>
so many users who let their mailer or newsreader quote
everything of the previous message and just add some text at
the top; obviously they think that quoted text must not be
<br>
changed at all. This is quite annoying as it needlessly
sends a lot of data even when it is not required. Some
editing of messages is desired. Please point these people to
the <br>
page http://www.river.com/users/share/etiquette/edit.html -
thank you!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE <br>
There are several ways to fine-tune t-prot&rsquo;s
performance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some command line options are
quite grave a performance hit -- do not use -k and
especially --ms-smart if you are content without them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checking for special footers is
very costly as well. Put as few footer files as absolutely
needed in any footer directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All PGP related options are
eating up lots of CPU time. Try to avoid them on unsigned
and unencrypted messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When calling t-prot from within
mutt (or mutt-kz), you might use mutt&rsquo;s folder-hook
and message-hook facilities to turn options on only when
needed, e.g. to set up a different <br>
footer directory for each mailing list folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TROUBLESHOOTING <br>
Q: I want to make my mailing list footer files match more
different mailing list footers. Can I use regular
expressions, or how can I accomplish that?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Nope, regexp&rsquo;s do not
work here. The comparison is made by the perl builtin
index() function (see perldoc for more detailed info), so
you must exactly match the beginning <br>
of the line. The longer the line you specify, the more
precise the match; if your line is empty you match
unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I use the options -l and -L
to suppress mailing list footers when displaying messages in
mutt(1). This does work sometimes, but sometimes it does
not: the footer is not <br>
detected, and therefore full quotes are not deleted and
signatures are detected as too long (which they
aren&rsquo;t).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: This might occur if the
message is badly encoded, so mutt cannot resolve all encoded
characters, e.g. if you have an encoded message on a mailing
list, and majordomo <br>
appends a mailing list footer in a different encoding (or
even plain us-ascii). &quot;-- &quot; simply does not match
&quot;--=20&quot;. <br>
Another problem are non-us-ascii characters. Just avoid
them, and everything should work fine. <br>
See the preceding Q+A for a solution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I want to write a message
which contains parts that should *not* be deleted even when
filtered with t-prot. Is this possible?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Yes, but please do not spread
word of it. Make unobstrusive use of the verbatim
instruction:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#v+ <br>
This line is protected from being filtered by t-prot !!!!!!!
<br>
#v- <br>
Text coming now is not.</p>

There is a problem when mutt gives a PGP verified or even a
multipart message to t-prot: The information where the PGP
encrypted/signed data or even attachments begin and end is
<br>
plainly embedded in the text, not really cleanly
recognizable for t-prot. The problem should be worked around
by now, please send a bug report if it does not work for
you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORTING BUGS <br>
Please note that t-prot development happens on current
stable perl versions only. If you do run t-prot on earlier
(or unstable) perl versions, you might encounter perl
compiler <br>
bugs (or funny t-prot behaviour). One solution is to upgrade
your perl, another is simply to write a bug report. If you
do not run a current perl version, please include this <br>
information in your bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please do not report a bug if
<br>
* you found it in the TODO file coming with the
distribution. We do know those and try to fix them as soon
as possible. <br>
* you have an old t-prot version. If you encounter a
problem, first see if there is a new t-prot version which
fixes the issue. If you upgraded to the latest version and
it <br>
still occurs, a bug report is just great.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you noticed a bug when
processing a message and want to provide the t-prot team
with some useful info, please: <br>
* if invoking t-prot by mutt&rsquo;s display_filter
facility, just set display_filter to something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;tee ~/foobar | t-prot
&lt;your options&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and include ~/foobar in the bug
report -- this way we might reproduce the bug much easier if
you are using a different environment than we do. <br>
* provide information on what command line options you use
t-prot with, what perl version t-prot runs on your system,
and what else might be important to enable us reproducing
<br>
the bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send your bug report to
&lt;t-prot-bugs@tolot.escape.de&gt;. Thank you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
Fix bugs (see the BUGS section). Beside that, all main
features should be implemented by now. See the TODO file for
more information.</p>
