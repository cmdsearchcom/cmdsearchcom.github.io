<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
v.net is used for network preparation and maintenance. Its
main use is to create a vector network from vector lines
(arcs ) and points (nodes) by creating nodes from
intersec&acirc; <br>
tions in a map of vector lines (node operator), by
connecting a vector lines map with a points map (connect
operator), and by creating new lines between pairs of vector
points <br>
(arcs operator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A GIS network consists of
topologically correct lines (arcs). That is, the lines must
be connected by shared vertices where real connections
exist. In GRASS GIS you also can add <br>
nodes to the network. These are specially designated
vertices used for analyzing network properties or computing
cost/distance measures. That is, not all vertices are
treated as <br>
nodes by default. Only v.net.path can use a network without
nodes, they are required for all the other network modules.
In GRASS, network arcs are stored in one data layer <br>
(normally layer 1) and nodes are stored in a different data
layer (normally layer 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v.net offers two ways to add
nodes to a network of arcs and one method to add arcs to a
set of nodes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Use the connect operation to
create nodes from a vector points file and add these nodes
to an existing vector network of arcs (i.e.,
lines/boundaries). This is useful when <br>
the goal is to analyze a set of places (points) in relation
to a network--for example travel costs between places. Only
points within the thresh (threshold) distance to a <br>
line/boundary will be connected as network nodes. There are
two ways to connect nodes. By default, v.net will create new
lines connecting each point to the closest line of <br>
the network. If you use the -s flag, however, the new nodes
will be added on the closest line of the network at the
point closest to the point you wish to add. When using <br>
the connect operation, some lines will share the same
category. In order to assign unique costs to each line, a
new layer needs to be created with <br>
v.category map=yourmap option=add cat=1 step=1 layer=3
output=newmap <br>
followed by <br>
v.db.addtable map=newmap layer=3 table=tablename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Create nodes and arcs from a
vector line/boundary file using the node operation. This is
useful if you are mostly interested in the network itself
and thus you can use <br>
intersections of the network as start and end points. Nodes
will be created at all intersections of two or more lines.
For an arc that consists of several segments con&acirc; <br>
nected by vertices (the typical case), only the starting and
ending vertices are treated as network nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Create straight-line arcs
between pairs of nodes with the arcs option. This produces
networks like those of airline flights between airports. It
is also similar to the <br>
kind of network created with social networking software,
making it possible to create georeferenced social
networks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the arcs created with
v.net will retain any attribute information associated with
the input vector line/boundary file in data layer 1, nodes
created and stored in data <br>
layer 2 will not have any associated attribute
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For nodes created using the
connect and arcs operations (methods 1 and 3 above), the
nodes can be reconnected to the attribute table of the input
vector points file using the <br>
attribute table manager (&quot;manage layers&quot; tab) or
by running v.db.connect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For nodes created using the
nodes operation (method 2 above), it is possible to create
an attribute table for the new nodes in layer 2 using the
attribute table manager and con&acirc; <br>
nect it to layer 2 (&quot;manage layers&quot; tab) or to
create a table with v.db.addtable, connect it to layer 2
with v.db.connect, and update the new table with cat values
with v.to.db.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The turntable operation creates
a turntable with the costs for every possible turn on every
possible node (intersection, crossroad) in given layer
(arc_layer). U-turns are taken <br>
in account too. Turntable is created in turn_layer and
turn_cat_layer. Building the turntable allows you to model
e.g. traffic code, where some turns may be prohibited. If
<br>
features in analyzed network are changed, the turntable must
be created again (e.g. it includes v.net connect operation).
Turntable name consists of output vector map name + <br>
&quot;_turntable_&quot; + &quot;t&quot; + &quot;_&quot; +
turn_layer + &quot;_&quot; + &quot;tuc&quot; + &quot;_&quot;
+ turn_cat_layer + &quot;_&quot; + &quot;a&quot; +
&quot;_&quot; + arc_layer e. g.
roads_turntable_t_3_tuc_4_a_1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These modules are able to work
with the turntable: v.net.alloc, v.net.iso, v.net.path,
v.net.salesman For more information about turns in the
vector network analyses see wiki <br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a vector network has been
created, it can be analyzed in a number of powerful ways
using the suite of v.net.* modules. The shortest route
between two nodes, following arcs, <br>
can be computed (v.net.path), as can the shortest route that
will pass through a set of nodes and return to the starting
node (v.net.salesman). Least cost routes through the <br>
network can be calculated on the basis of distance only or
on the basis of distance weighted by an attribute associated
with each arc (for example, travel speed along a network
<br>
segment). A network can be divided into concentric zones of
equal travel cost around one or more nodes (v.net.iso) or
subdivided so that each node is surrounded by a zone in <br>
which all arcs can be reached with the same travel costs as
all arcs surrounding each other node (v.net.alloc). In
addition to the modules listed above, the GRASS vector
net&acirc; <br>
working suite includes numerous other modules for analysis
of network costs and connectivity. These include:
v.net.allpairs, v.net.bridge, v.net.centrality,
v.net.components, <br>
v.net.distance, v.net.flow, v.net.spanningtree,
v.net.steiner, v.net.timetable, and v.net.visibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
For a vector map prepared for network analysis in GRASS,
nodes are represented by the grass-internal geometry type
node and arcs by the geometry type line. If vector editing
is <br>
required to modify the graph, g.gui.vdigit or v.edit can be
used. See also the Linear Referencing System available in
GRASS GIS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The examples are North Carolina dataset based.</p>
