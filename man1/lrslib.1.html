<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lrslib - Convert between represetations of convex
polyhedra.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lrs input.ine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrs input.ine | lrsbuffer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrsfourier file.ine

<p style="margin-top: 1em">redund input.ine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A polyhedron can be described by a list of inequalities
(H-representation) or as by a list of its vertices and
extreme rays (V-representation). lrs is a C program that
converts <br>
a H-representation of a polyhedron to its V-representation,
and vice versa. These problems are known respectively at the
vertex enumeration and convex hull problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fukuda&rsquo;s FAQ page[1]
contains a more detailed introduction to the problem, along
with many useful tips for the new user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lrsbuffer can remove some
duplicate output. redund finds redundant inequalities in the
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE FORMATS <br>
File formats were developed jointly with Komei Fukuda and
are compatible with cdd[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input for lrs is a H- or V-
representation of a polytope.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name <br>
{representation line} <br>
{options} <br>
{linearities[3]} <br>
begin <br>
m n rational <br>
{input matrix} <br>
end <br>
{options}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name is a user supplied name for
the polytope. Comments may appear before the begin or after
the end, and to avoid interpretation as an option, should
begin with a special <br>
character such as &quot;*&quot; or &quot;#&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name is a user supplied name for
the polytope. representation line is either
&quot;H-representation&quot; or
&quot;V-representation&quot;. If is omitted,
H-representation is assumed. The input <br>
coefficients are read in free format, and are not checked
for type. Coefficients are separated by white space. m is
the number of rows and n the number of columns of the input
<br>
matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H-representation <br>
The integer m is the number of inequalities, and the integer
n is the dimension of the input +1. A list of inequalities
contains the coefficients of inequalities of the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a0 + a1x1+ ... + an-1 xn-1 &gt;=
0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This inequality is input as the
line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a0 a1... an-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The coefficients can be entered
as integers or rationals in the format x/y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V-representation <br>
The integer m is the number of vertices and rays, and the
integer n is the dimension of the input +1. Each vertex is
given in the form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 v0 v 1... vn-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each ray is given in the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 r0 r 1... rn-1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where r0 r 1... rn-1is a point
on the ray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There must be at least one
vertex in each file. For bounded polyhedra there will be no
rays entered. The coefficients can be entered as integers or
rationals in the format x/y.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note for cdd users: lrs uses
essentially the same file format as cdd. Files prepared for
cdd should work with little or no modification. Note that
the V-representation <br>
corresponds to the &quot;hull&quot; option in cdd. Options
specific to cdd can be left in the input files and will be
ignored by lrs. Note the input files for lrs are read in
free format, <br>
after the line m n rational, lrs will look for exactly m*n
rationals or integers separated by white space (blank,
carriage return, tab etc.). lrs will not &quot;drop&quot;
extra columns <br>
of input if n is less than the number of columns
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic Options <br>
Almost all options are placed after the end statement,
maintaining compatibility with cdd. Where this is not the
case, it will be mentioned explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">allbases This option instructs
lrs to list each vertex (or facet) for each of its bases.
Output Duplication[4].[5] This option is often combined with
printcobasis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bound x Use with
H-representation - for lrs or nash Either the maximize or
minimize option should be selected. x is an integer or
rational. For maximization (resp. <br>
minimization) the reverse search tree is truncated whenever
the current objective value is less (resp. more) than x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cache nlrs stores the latest n
dictionaries in the reverse search tree. This speeds up the
backtracking step, but requires more memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug startingbasis
endingbasisPrint out cryptic but detailed trace,
dictionaries etc. starting at #B=startingbasis and ending at
#B=endingbasis. debug 0 0 gives a complete <br>
trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">digits n placed before the begin
statement n is the maximum number of decimal digits to be
used. If this is exceeded the program terminates with a
message (it can usually be <br>
restarted). The default is set to about 100 digits. At the
end of a run a message is given informing the user of the
maximum integer size encountered. This may be used to <br>
optimize memory usage and speed on subsequent runs (if doing
estimation for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dualperturb If lrs is executed
with the maximize or minimize option, the reverse search
tree is rooted at an optimum vertex for this function.If
there are mulitiple optimum <br>
vertices, the output will often not be complete. This option
gives a small perturbation to the objective to avoid this. A
warning message is given if the starting dictionary is <br>
dual degenerate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">estimates k Estimate the output
size. Used in conjunction with maxdepth - see
Estimation.[6]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">geometric // H-representation or
voronoi option only // With this option, each ray is printed
together with the vertex with which it is incident. For more
information see <br>
Geometric Rays in Hints and Comments[5] .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">incidenceThis option
automatically switches on printcobasis , so see below for a
description of this option first. Can be used with
printcobasis n. (Ver 4.2b) .PP For input <br>
H-representation, indices of all input inequalities that
contain the vertex/ray that is about to be output. For a
simplicial face, there is no new output, since these indices
are <br>
already listed. Otherwise, the additional tight inequalities
are listed after a colon. .PP For input V-representation,
indices of all input vertices/rays that lie on the facet
<br>
that is about to be output. A starred indexindicates that
this vertex is also in the cobasis, but is not contained in
the facet. It arises due to the lifting operation used with
<br>
input V-representations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#incidenceThe same as
printcobasis. Included for compatability with cdd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">linearity k i1i2 i ... ikThe
input contains k linearities in rows i1i2i ... ikof the
input file are equations. See Linearities.[3]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxdepth k The search will be
truncated at depth k. All bases with depth less than or
equal to k will be computed. k is a non-negative integer,
and this option is used for <br>
estimates - see Estimation.[6]Note: For H-representations,
rays at depth k will not be reported. For V-representations,
facets at depth k will not be reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maximize a0 a1... an-1 //
H-representation only //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minimize a0 a1... an-1 //
H-representation only //</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If used with lrs the starting
vertex maximizes (or minimizes) the function a0 + a1x1+ ...
+ an-1 xn-1.The dualperturb option may be needed to avoid
dual degeneracy.See Nash <br>
Equilibria and Linear Programming[7]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxoutput n Limits number of
output lines produced (either vertices+rays or facets) to
n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mindepth k Backtracking will be
terminated at depth k, for k a non-negative integer. This
can be used for running reverse search on subtrees as
separate processes, e.g. in a <br>
distributed computing environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nonnegative // This option must
come before the begin statement// //H-representation only //
Bug: Can only be used if the origin is a vertex of the
polyhedron For problems <br>
where the input is an H-representation of the form
b+Ax&gt;=0, x&gt;=0 (ie. all variables non-negative, all
constraints inequalities) it is not necessary to give the
non-negative <br>
constraints explicitly if the nonnegative option is used.
This option cannot be used for V-representations, or with
the linearity option (in which case the linearities will be
<br>
treated as inequalities). This option may be used with
redund , but the implied nonnegativity constraints are not
tested themselves for redundancy. To test everything it is
<br>
necessary to enter the nonnegativity constraints explicitly
in the input file. (In Ver 4.1, the origin must be a
vertex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printcobasis k;Modified in lrs
4.0 Every k&rsquo;th cobasis is printed. If k is omitted,
the cobasis is printed for each vertex/ray/facet that is
output. For a long run it is useful <br>
to print the cobasis occasionally so that the program can be
restarted if necessary. H-representation: If the input is an
H-representation the cobasis is a list the indices of <br>
the inequalities from the input file that define the current
vertex or ray. See option incidence above for more
information. For rays, a cobasis is also printed. In this
case <br>
the cobasis is the cobasis of the vertex from which the ray
emanates. One of the indices is starred, this indicates the
inequality to be dropped from the cobasis to define the <br>
ray. Alternatively, if the allbasesoption is used, all
cobases will be printed out. V-representation: If the input
is a V-representation, the cobasis is a list of the input
<br>
vertices /rays that define the current facet. See option
incidence above for more information. To initiate lrs from
this facet all 4 indices must be given in this order (omit
the <br>
*).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">printslack New in Ver 4.2 ; //
Use with H-representation // lrs prints a list of the
indices of the input inequalities that are satisfied
strictly for the current vertex, ie. <br>
corresponding slack variable is positive. If nonnegative is
set, the list will also include indices n+i for each
decision variable xi which is positive. project Used by <br>
lrsfourier[8] only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">restart V# R# B# depth {facet #s
or vertex/ray #s} Modified in lrs4.0 lrs can be restarted
from any known cobasis. The calculation will proceed to
normal termination. All of the <br>
information is contained in the output from a printcobasis
option. The order of the indices is very important, enter
them exactly as they appear in the output from the <br>
previously aborted run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">startingcobasis i1i2i ... in-1
This allows the user to specify a known cobasis for
beginning the reverse search. i1i2i ... in-1 is a list of
the inequalities (for <br>
H-representation) or vertices/rays (for V-representation)
that define a cobasis. If it is invalid, or this option is
not specified, lrs will find its own starting cobasis. The
<br>
reverse search tree is truncated(pruned) whenever a new
vertex is encountered. Note: This does note necessarily
produce the set of all vertices adjacent to the optimum
vertex in <br>
the polyhedron, but just a subset of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbosePrint slightly more
detailed information about the run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volume // V-representation only
// Compute volume - see section Volume Computation.[9]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">voronoi // V-representation only
- place immediately after end statement // Compute Voronoi
diagram - see section Voronoi Diagrams.[10]</p>
