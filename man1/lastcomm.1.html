<p>LASTCOMM(1) General Commands Manual LASTCOMM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lastcomm - print out information about previously executed
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lastcomm <br>
[ command-name ... ] <br>
[ user-name ... ] <br>
[ terminal-name ... ] <br>
[ OPTION ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
lastcomm prints out information about previously executed
commands. If no arguments are specified, lastcomm will print
info about all of the commands in acct (the record file).
<br>
If called with one or more of command-name, user-name, or
terminal-name, only records containing those items will be
displayed. For example, to find out which users used command
<br>
&lsquo;a.out&rsquo; and which users were logged into
&lsquo;tty0&rsquo;, type: <br>
lastcomm a.out tty0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will print any entry for
which &lsquo;a.out&rsquo; or &lsquo;tty0&rsquo; matches in
any of the record&rsquo;s fields (command, name, or
terminal). If you want to find only items that match *all*
of the <br>
arguments on the command line, you must use the
&rsquo;-strict-match&rsquo; option. For example, to list all
of the executions of command a.out by user root on terminal
tty0, type: <br>
lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty
tty0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The order of the arguments is
not important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each entry the following
information is printed: <br>
+ command name of the process <br>
+ flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines: <br>
S -- command executed by super-user <br>
F -- command executed after a fork but without a following
exec <br>
C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)
<br>
D -- command terminated with the generation of a core file
<br>
X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM <br>
+ the name of the user who ran the process <br>
+ time the process started</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--strict-match <br>
Print only entries that match *all* of the arguments on the
command line. <br>
--print-controls <br>
Print control characters. <br>
--user name <br>
List records for user with name. This is useful if
you&rsquo;re trying to match a username that happens to be
the same as a command (e.g., ed ). <br>
--command name <br>
List records for command name. <br>
--tty name <br>
List records for tty name. <br>
--forwards <br>
Read file forwards instead of backwards. This avoids trying
to seek on the file and can be used to read from a pipe.
This must be specified prior to any -f arguments. <br>
-f filename, --file filename <br>
Read from the file filename instead of acct. A filename of
&quot;-&quot; will result in reading from stdin. This must
either be the first -f option, or --forwards must precede
all <br>
-f options. <br>
--ahz hz <br>
Use this flag to tell the program what AHZ should be (in
hertz). This option is useful if you are trying to view an
acct file created on another machine which has the <br>
same byte order and file format as your current machine, but
has a different value for AHZ. <br>
-p, --show-paging <br>
Print paging statistics <br>
--debug <br>
Print verbose internal information. <br>
-V, --version <br>
Print the version number of lastcomm. <br>
-h, --help <br>
Prints the usage string and default locations of system
files to standard output and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
acct <br>
The system wide process accounting file. See acct(5) (or
pacct(5)) for further details. /var/log/account <br>
This directory contains pacct files which contain the binary
process accounting data as written by the kernel. AUTHOR
