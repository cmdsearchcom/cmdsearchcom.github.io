<p>HARMINV(1) harminv HARMINV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
harminv - extract mode frequencies from time-series data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
harminv [OPTION]... [freq-min-freq-max]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
harminv is a program designed to solve the problem of
&quot;harmonic inversion&quot;: given a time series
consisting of a sum of sinusoids (&quot;modes&quot;),
extract their frequencies and ampli&acirc; <br>
tudes. It can also handle the case of exponentially-decaying
sinusoids, in which case it extracts their decay rates as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">harminv is often able to achieve
much greater accuracy and robustness than Fourier-transform
methods, essentially because it assumes a specific form for
the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It uses a low-storage
&quot;filter-diagonalization method&quot; (FDM), as
described in V. A. Mandelshtam and H. S. Taylor,
&quot;Harmonic inversion of time signals,&quot; J. Chem.
Phys. 107, 6756 <br>
(1997). See also erratum, ibid 109, 4128 (1998).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br>
harminv reads in a sequence of whitespace-separated real or
complex numbers from standard input, as well as command-line
arguments indicating one or more frequency ranges to <br>
search, and outputs the modes that it extracts from the
data. (It preferentially finds modes in the frequency range
you specify, but may sometimes find additional modes outside
<br>
of that range.) The data should correspond to equally-spaced
time intervals, but there is no constraint on the number of
points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Complex numbers in the input
should be expressed in the format RE+IMi (no whitespace).
Otherwise, whitespace is ignored. Also, comments beginning
with &quot;#&quot; and extending to the <br>
end of the line are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical invocation is
something like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">harminv -t 0.02 1-5 &lt;
input.dat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which reads a sequence of
samples, spaced at 0.02 time intervals (in ms, say,
corresponding to 50 kHz), and searches for modes in the
frequency range 1-5 kHz. (See below on <br>
units.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
harminv writes six comma-delimited columns to standard
output, one line for each mode: frequency, decay constant,
Q, amplitude, phase, and error. Each mode corresponds to a
<br>
function of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amplitude * exp[-i (2 pi
frequency t - phase) - decay t]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here, i is sqrt(-1), t is the
time (see below for units), and the other parameters in the
output columns are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">frequency <br>
The frequency of the mode. If you don&rsquo;t recognize that
from the expression above, you should recall Euler&rsquo;s
formula: exp(i x) = cos(x) + i sin(x). Note that for complex
<br>
data, there is a distinction between positive and negative
frequencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">decay constant <br>
The exponential decay constant, indicated by decay in the
above formula. The inverse of this is often called the
&quot;lifetime&quot; of the mode. The &quot;half-life&quot;
is ln(2)/decay.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q A conventional, dimensionless
expression of the decay lifetime: Q = pi |frequency| /
decay. Q, which stands for &quot;quality factor&quot;, is
the number of periods for the <br>
&quot;energy&quot; in the mode (the squared amplitude) to
decay by exp(-2 pi). Equivalently, if you look at the power
spectrum (|Fourier transform|^2), 1/Q is the fractional
width <br>
of the peak at half maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">amplitude <br>
The (real, positive) amplitude of the sinusoids. The
amplitude (and phase) information generally seems to be less
accurate than the frequency and decay constant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">phase The phase shift (in
radians) of the sinusoids, as given by the formula
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error A crude estimate of the
relative error in the (complex) frequency. This is not
really an error bar, however, so you should treat it more as
a figure of merit (smaller is <br>
better) for each mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPURIOUS MODES <br>
Typically, harminv will find a number of spurious solutions
in addition to the desired solutions, especially if your
data are noisy. Such solutions are characterized by large
<br>
errors, small amplitudes, and/or small Q (large decay rates
/ broad linewidths). You can omit these from the output by
the error/Q/amplitude screening options defined below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, modes with error
&gt; 0.1 and Q &lt; 10 are automatically omitted, but it is
likely that you will need to set stricter limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNITS <br>
The frequency (and decay) values, both input and output, are
specified in units of 1/time, where the units of time are
determined by the sampling interval dt (the time between
<br>
consecutive inputs). dt is by default 1, unless you specify
it with the -t dt option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, pick some units
(e.g. ms in the example above) and use them to express the
time step. Then, be consistent and use the inverse of those
units (e.g. kHz = 1/ms) <br>
for frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the frequency is the
usual 1/period definition; it is not the angular
frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display help on the command-line options and usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version number and
copyright info for harminv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Enable verbose output,
printed to standard output as comment lines (starting with a
&quot;#&quot; character). Also, any &quot;#&quot; comments
in the input are echoed to the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Specify period-ranges instead
of frequency-ranges on the command line (in units of time
corresponding to those specified by -t). The output is still
frequency and not <br>
period, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Specify angular frequencies
instead of frequencies, and output angular frequency instead
of frequency. (Angular frequency is frequency multiplied by
2 pi).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Flip the sign of the
frequency (and phase) convention used in harminv. (The sign
of the frequency is only important if you have
complex-valued input data, in which case <br>
the positive and negative frequency amplitudes can
differ.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t dt Specify the sampling
interval dt; this determines the units of time used
throughout the input and output. Defaults to 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d d Specify the spectral
&quot;density&quot; d to search for modes, where a density
of 1 indicates the usual Fourier resolution. That is, the
number of basis functions (which sets an <br>
upper bound on the number of modes) is given by d times
(freq-max - freq-min) times dt times the number of samples
in your dataset. A maximum of 300 is used, however, to <br>
prevent the matrices from getting too big (you can force a
larger number with -f, below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the frequency
resolution of the outputs is not limited by the spectral
density, and can generally be much greater than the Fourier
resolution. The density <br>
determines how many modes, at most, to search for, and in
some sense is the density with which the bandwidth is
initially &quot;searched&quot; for modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default density is 0.0,
which means that the number of basis functions is determined
by -f (which defaults to 100). This often corresponds to a
much larger density <br>
than the usual Fourier resolution, but the resulting
singularities in the system matrices are automatically
removed by harminv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f nf Specify a lower bound nf
on the number of spectral basis functions (defaults to 100),
setting a lower bound on the number of modes to search for.
This option is often a <br>
more convenient way to specify the number of basis functions
than the -d option, above, which is why it is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f also allows you to employ
more than 300 basis functions, but careful: the computation
time scales as O(N nf) + O(nf^3), where N is the number of
samples, and very large <br>
matrices can also have degraded accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sort <br>
Specify how the outputs are sorted, where sort is one of
frequency/error/Q/decay/amplitude. (Only the first character
of sort matters.) All sorts are in ascending order. <br>
The default is to sort by frequency.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e err Omit any modes with error
(see above) greater than err times the largest error among
the computed modes. Defaults to no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E err Omit any modes with error
(see above) greater than err. Defaults to 0.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Omit any modes with
frequencies outside the specified range. (Such modes are not
necessarily spurious, however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a amp Omit any modes with
amplitude (see above) less than amp times the largest
amplitude among the computed modes. Defaults to no
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A amp Omit any modes with
amplitude (see above) less than amp. Defaults to no
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q q Omit any modes with |Q|
(see above) less than q. Defaults to 10.</p>
