<p>PMSTAT(1) General Commands Manual PMSTAT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pcp-vmstat, pmstat - high-level system performance
overview</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pcp [pcp options] vmstat [interval [samples]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmstat [-gLlPxz] [-A align] [-a
archive] [-h host] [-H file] [-n pmnsfile] [-O offset] [-p
port] [-S starttime] [-s samples] [-T endtime] [-t interval]
[-Z timezone]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmstat provides a one line summary of system performance
every interval unit of time (the default is 5 seconds).
pmstat is intended to monitor system performance at the
highest <br>
level, after which other tools may be used to examine
subsystems in which potential performance problems may be
observed in greater detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pcp-vmstat is a simple wrapper
for use with the pcp(1) command, providing a more familiar
command line format for some users. It also enables the
extended reporting option by <br>
default, see the -x option below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple hosts may be monitored
by supplying more than one host with multiple -h flags (for
live monitoring) or by providing a name of the hostlist
file, where each line contain <br>
one host name, with -H, or multiple -a flags (for
retrospective monitoring from sets of archives).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -t option may be used to
change the default reporting interval. The interval argument
follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in the
simplest form may be an <br>
unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pmstat fetches
metrics by connecting to the Performance Metrics Collector
Daemon (PMCD) on the local host. If the -L option is
specified, then pmcd(1) is bypassed, <br>
and metrics are fetched from PMDAs on the local host using
the standalone PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL variant of pmNewContext(3).
When the -h option is specified, pmstat connects to the <br>
pmcd(1) on host and fetches metrics from there. As mentioned
above, multiple hosts may be monitored by supplying multiple
-h flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, if the -a option
is used, the metrics are retrieved from the Performance
Co-Pilot archive log files identified by archive, which is a
comma-separated list of <br>
names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
Multiple sets of archives may be replayed by supplying
multi&acirc; <br>
ple -a flags. When the -a flag is used, the -P flag may also
be used to pause the output after each interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standalone mode can only connect
to the local host, using a set of archives implies a host
name, and nominating a host precludes using an archive, so
the options -L, -a and -h <br>
are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmstat operates on the
default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if
the -n option is specified an alternative namespace is
loaded from the file pmnsfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -s the option is
specified, samples defines the number of samples to be
retrieved and reported. If samples is 0 or -s is not
specified, pmstat will sample and report con&acirc; <br>
tinuously - this is the default behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When processing a set of
archives, pmstat may relinquish its own timing control, and
operate as a &lsquo;&lsquo;slave&rsquo;&rsquo; of a
pmtime(1) process that uses a GUI dialog to provide timing
con&acirc; <br>
trol. In this case, either the -g option should be used to
start pmstat as the sole slave of a new pmtime(1) instance,
or -p should be used to attach pmstat to an existing <br>
pmtime(1) instance via the IPC channel identified by the
port argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S, -T, -O and -A options
may be used to define a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved, set an initial origin within the time window, or
specify a &lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; align&acirc;
<br>
ment of the sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
complete description of these options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option prints the last 7
characters of a hostname in summaries involving more than
one host (when more than one -h option has been specified on
the command line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -x option (extended CPU
metrics) causes two additional CPU metrics to be reported,
namely wait for I/O (&quot;wa&quot;) and virtualisation
steal time (&quot;st&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from pmstat is
directed to standard output, and the columns in the report
are interpreted as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">loadavg The 1 minute load
average.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">memory The swpd column indicates
average swap space used during the interval, in Kbytes. The
free column indicates average free memory during the
interval, in Kbytes. The <br>
buff column indicates average buffer memory in use during
the interval, in Kbytes. The cache column indicates average
cached memory in use during the interval, in <br>
Kbytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the values become large, they
are reported as Mbytes (m suffix) or Gbytes (g suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">swap The metrics in this area of
the kernel instrumentation are of varying value. We try to
report the average number of pages that are paged in (pi)
and out (po) per sec&acirc; <br>
ond during the interval. If the corresponding page swapping
metrics are unavailable, we report the average rate per
second of swap operations in (si) and out (so) dur&acirc;
<br>
ing the interval. It is normal for the
&lsquo;&lsquo;in&rsquo;&rsquo; values to be non-zero, but
the system is suffering memory stress if the
&lsquo;&lsquo;out&rsquo;&rsquo; values are non-zero over an
extended <br>
period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the values become large, they
are reported as thousands of operations per second (K
suffix) or millions of operations per second (M suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io The bi and bo columns
indicate the average rate per second of block input and
block output operations (respectfully) during the interval.
Unless all file systems have <br>
a 1 Kbyte block size, these rates do not directly indicate
Kbytes transferred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the values become large, they
are reported as thousands of operations per second (K
suffix) or millions of operations per second (M suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">system Interrupt rate (in) and
context switch rate (cs). Rates are expressed as average
operations per second during the interval. Note that the
interrupt rate is normally <br>
at least HZ (the clock interrupt rate, usually 100)
interrupts per second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the values become large, they
are reported as thousands of operations per second (K
suffix) or millions of operations per second (M suffix).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpu Percentage of CPU time spent
executing user and &quot;nice user&quot; code (us), system
and interrupt processing code (sy), idle loop (id).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any values for the associated
performance metrics are unavailable, the value appears as
&lsquo;&lsquo;?&rsquo;&rsquo; in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pmstat reports the
time of day according to the local timezone on the system
where pmstat is run. The -Z option changes the timezone to
timezone in the format of the <br>
environment variable TZ as described in environ(7). The -z
option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
iden&acirc; <br>
tified via either the -h or -a options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* <br>
default PMNS specification files <br>
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.pmstat <br>
pmlogger(1) configuration for creating an archive suitable
for replay with pmstat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

pmNewContext(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All are generated on standard error, and are intended to be
self-explanatory.</p>
