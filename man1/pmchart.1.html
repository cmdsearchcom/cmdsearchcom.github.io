<b>pmchart</b> is a graphical utility that plots performance metrics values
  available through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). Multiple
  charts can be displayed simultaneously, either aligned on the unified time
  axis (X-axis), and through the use of multiple interface Tabs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Metric values can be sourced from one or more live hosts (simultaneously).
  Alternatively, one or more sets of PCP archives can be used as a source of
  historical data. See <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for an in-depth discussion of the
  capabilities of the PCP framework, many of which are used by <b>pmchart.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many aspects of the behaviour of <b>pmchart</b> can be customised through the
  interface. In particular, the use of &quot;views&quot; (refer to the section
  describing VIEWS later in this document) allows predefined sets of metrics and
  charting parameters like colors, scaling, titles, legends, and so on to be
  stored for later use, or use with different hosts and sets of archives. In
  addition, the Preferences dialog allows customisations to the rest of the
  <b>pmchart</b> user interface to be saved and restored between different
  invocations of the tool. This allows the default background color, highlight
  color, contents and location of the toolbar, and many other aspects to be
  configured.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pmchart</b> makes extensive use of the <b>pmtime</b>(1) utility for time
  control, refer to the <b>pmtime</b> manual page for further details of its
  operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Options which control the default source, timing and layout of the
  <b>pmchart</b> window are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
      Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs identified by this option, by
      default. The argument is a comma-separated list of names, each of which
      may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
      one or more archives. The resulting set of archives will be the source of
      the performance metrics. The initial Tab created will be an archive mode
      Tab. Multiple <b>-a</b> options can be presented, and the resulting list
      of sets of archives is used for sourcing metric values. Any <i>sources</i>
      listed on the command line are assumed to be sets of archives if this
      option is used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>configfile</i> specifies an initial view to load, using

      <b>-o</b> option for generating an output image. The <i>geometry</i>
      argument takes the form &quot;WxH&quot; (e.g. 240x120). When NOT using the
      <b>-o</b> flag, to specify the display window geometry, use
      <b>-geometry</b> <i>geometry</i> where <i>geometry</i> specifies the

The <b>-S</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>-O</b> and <b>-A</b> options may be used to define
  a time window to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial origin within
  the time window, or specify a &quot;natural&quot; alignment of the sample
  times; refer to <b>PCPIntro</b>(1) for a complete description of these
  options.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="VIEWS"><a class="selflink" href="#VIEWS">VIEWS</a></h1>
The primary <b>pmchart</b> configuration file is the &quot;view&quot;, which
  allows the metadata associated with one or more charts to be saved in the
  filesystem. This metadata describes all aspects of the charts, including which
  PCP metrics and instances are to be used, which hosts, which colors, the chart
  titles, use of chart legends, and much more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
From a conceptual point of view, there are two classes of view. These views
  share the same configuration file format - refer to a later section for a
  complete description of this format. The differences lie in where they are
  installed and how they are manipulated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first class, the &quot;system&quot; view, is simply any view that is
  installed as part of the <b>pmchart</b> package. These are stored in
  <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmchart.</i> When the <i>File&#x2192;Open View</i>
  dialog is displayed, it is these views that are initially listed. The system
  views cannot be modified by a normal user, and should not be modified even by
  a user with suitable privileges, as they will be overwritten during an
  upgrade.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second class of view is the &quot;user&quot; view. These views are created
  on-the-fly using the <i>File&#x2192;Save View</i> dialog. This is a mechanism
  for individual users to save their commonly used views. Access to these views
  is achieved through the <i>File&#x2192;Open View</i> dialog, as with the
  system views. Once the dialog is opened, the list of views can be toggled
  between user and system views by clicking on the two toggle buttons in the top
  right corner. User views are stored in <i>$HOME/.pcp/pmchart.</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TABS"><a class="selflink" href="#TABS">TABS</a></h1>
<b>pmchart</b> provides the common user interface concept of the Tab, which is
  most prevalent in modern web browsers. Tabs allow <b>pmchart</b> to update
  many more charts than the available screen real estate allows, by providing a
  user interface mechanism to stack (and switch between) different vertical sets
  of charts. Switching between Tabs is achieved by clicking on the Tab labels,
  which are located along the top of the display beneath the Menu and Tool
  bars).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each Tab has a mode of operation (either live or archive - <b>pmchart</b> can
  support both modes simultaneously), the total number of samples and currently
  visible points, and a label describing the Tab which is displayed at the top
  of the <b>pmchart</b> window. New Tabs can be created using the
  <i>File&#x2192;Add Tab</i> dialog.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to save on vertical screen real estate, note that the user interface
  element for changing between different Tabs (and its label) are only displayed
  when more than one Tab exists. A Tab can be dismissed using the
  <i>File&#x2192;Close Tab</i> menu, which removes the current Tab and any
  charts it contained.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="IMAGES_and_PRINTING"><a class="selflink" href="#IMAGES_and_PRINTING">IMAGES
  and PRINTING</a></h1>
A static copy of the currently displayed vertical series of charts can be
  captured in two ways.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the intended display device is the screen, the <i>File&#x2192;Export</i>
  menu option should be used. This allows exporting the charts in a variety of
  image formats, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP. The image size can be scaled
  up or down in any dimension.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Alternatively, when the intended display device is paper, the
  <i>File&#x2192;Print</i> menu option can be used. This supports the usual set
  of printing options (choice of printer, grayscale/color, landscape/portrait,
  scaling to different paper sizes, etc), and in addition allows printing to the
  intermediate printer formats of PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RECORDING"><a class="selflink" href="#RECORDING">RECORDING</a></h1>
It is possible to make a recording of a set of displayed charts, for later
  playback through <b>pmchart</b> or any of the other Performance Co-Pilot
  tools. The <i>Record&#x2192;Start</i> functionality is simple to configure
  through the user interface, and allows fine-tuning of the recording process
  (including record frequencies that differ to the <b>pmchart</b> update
  interval, alternate file locations, etc).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pmchart</b> produces recordings that are compatible with the PCP
  <b>pmafm</b>(1) replay mechanism, for later playback via a new instance of
  <b>pmchart</b>. In addition, when recording through <b>pmchart</b> one can
  also replay the recording immediately, as on termination of the recording
  (through the <i>Record&#x2192;Stop</i> menu item), an archive mode Tab will be
  created with the captured view.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once recording is active in a Live Tab, the Time Control status button in the
  bottom left corner of the <b>pmchart</b> window is displayed with a
  distinctive red dot. At any time during a <b>pmchart</b> recording session,
  the amount of space used in the filesystem by that recording can be displayed
  using the <i>Record&#x2192;Query</i> menu item.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, the <i>Record&#x2192;Detach</i> menu option provides a mechanism
  whereby the recording process can be completely divorced from the running
  <b>pmchart</b> process, and allowed to continue on when <b>pmchart</b> exits.
  A dialog displaying the current size and estimated rate of growth for the
  recording is presented. On the other hand, if <b>pmchart</b> is terminated
  while recording is in process, then the recording process will prompt the user
  to choose immediate cessation of recording or for it to continue on
  independently.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of the record mode services available from <b>pmchart</b> are implemented
  with the assistance of the base Performance Co-Pilot logging services - refer
  to <b>pmlogger</b>(1) and <b>pmafm</b>(1) for an extensive description of the
  capabilities of these tools.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE_SYNTAX">CONFIGURATION
  FILE SYNTAX</a></h1>
<b>pmchart</b> loads predefined chart configurations (or &quot;views&quot;) from
  external files that conform to the following rules. In the descriptions below
  keywords (shown in <b>bold</b>) may appear in upper, lower or mixed case,
  elements shown in [stuff] are optional, and user-supplied elements are shown
  as &lt;other stuff&gt;. A vertical bar (|) is used where syntactic elements
  are alternatives. Quotes (&quot;) may be used to enclose lexical elements that
  may contain white space, such as titles, labels and instance names.

    If specified, the title will appear centred and above the graph area of the

The &lt;style&gt; controls the initial plotting style of the chart, and should
  be one of the keywords <b>plot</b> (line graph), <b>bar</b>, <b>stacking</b>

If <b>scale</b> is specified, the vertical scaling is set for all plots in the
  chart to a y-range defined by &lt;ymin&gt; and &lt;ymax&gt;. Otherwise the
  vertical axis will be autoscaled based on the values currently being plotted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&lt;onoff&gt; is one of the keywords <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> and the
  <b>legend</b> clause controls the presence or absence of the plot legend below
  the graph area. The default is for the legend to be shown. After the view is
  loaded, the legend visibility can be toggled using the <i>Show Legend</i>

  the chart.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If specified, the title will appear in the chart legend. The &lt;title&gt; is
  usually enclosed in quotes (&quot;) and it may contain one or more wildcard
  characters which will be expanded using metric name, instance name, and host
  name for the plot. The wildcards are &quot;%i&quot; (short unique instance
  name, up to the first whitespace), &quot;%I&quot; (full instance name),
  &quot;%h&quot; (short host name, up to the first dot), %H (full host name),
  &quot;%m&quot; (metric name shortened to the final two PMNS components), and
  &quot;%M&quot; (full metric name).
<div class="Pp"></div>
For older <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, the keyword <b>title</b> must be
  used instead of <b>legend</b>. Nowadays <b>pmchart</b> supports either
  keyword.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>color</b> clause is optional for newer <b>pmchart</b> configuration
  files, but it was mandatory in the original <b>pmchart</b> configuration file
  format. &lt;colorspec&gt; may be one of the following:
<pre>
<br/>
<b>#-cycle</b>
<b>rgbi:</b>rr<b>:</b>gg<b>:</b>bb

<b>#</b>rrggbb
<b>#</b>rrrgggbbb
<b>#</b>rrrrggggbbbb
&lt;Xcolor&gt;
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
</pre>
where each of r, g and b are hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F) representing
  respectively the red, green and blue color components. &lt;Xcolor&gt; is one
  of the color names from the X color database, e.g. <b>red</b> or
  <b>steelblue</b>, see also the output from <b>showrgb</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;color&quot; <b>#-cycle</b> specifies that <b>pmchart</b> should use
  the next in a pallet of colors that it uses cyclically for each chart. This is
  the default if the <b>color</b> clause is omitted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &lt;hostspec&gt; in the <b>host</b> clause may be a hostname, an IP address
  or an asterisk (*); the latter is used to mean the default source of
  performance metrics. For older <b>pmchart</b> configuration files, the
  <b>host</b> clause must be present, for new <b>pmchart</b> configuration files
  it is optional, and if missing the default source of performance metrics will
  be used.

    <pre>
<br/>
<b>tab</b> &lt;label&gt; [<b>host</b> &lt;host&gt;] [<b>points</b> &lt;points&gt; [<b>samples</b> &lt;samples&gt;]]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
<br/>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
All chart specifications following this keyword will be created
on the new Tab, until the end of the configuration file or until
another  <b>tab</b> keyword is encountered.
</pre>
</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PCP_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#PCP_ENVIRONMENT">PCP
  ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the
  file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
  <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these variables. The
  <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
  file, as described in <b>pcp.conf</b>(5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of particular note, the <b>$PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG</b> setting is explicitly and
  unconditionally overridden by <b>pmchart.</b> This is set to the
  <b>pmconfirm</b>(1), utility, in order that some popup dialogs (particularly
  in the area of Recording) maintain a consistent look-and-feel with the rest of
  the <b>pmchart</b> application.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="selflink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
