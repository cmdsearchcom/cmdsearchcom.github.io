<p>GEEKCODE(1) Geek User&rsquo;s Manual GEEKCODE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
geekcode - generate geek code block</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
geekcode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
So you think you are a geek, eh? The first step is to admit
to yourself your geekiness. No matter what anyone says,
geeks are people too; geeks have rights. So take a deep
breath <br>
and announce to the world that you are a geek. Your courage
will give you strength that will last you forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to tell the world you are a
geek, you ask? Use the universal Geek code! Using this
special code will allow you to let other un-closeted geeks
know who you are in a simple, <br>
codified statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The single best way to announce
your geekhood is to add your geek code to your signature
file or plan and announce it far and wide. But be careful,
you may give other geeks the <br>
courage to come out of the closet. You might want to hang on
to your copy of the code in order to help them along.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
The geek code consists of several categories. Each category
is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers. Go through
each category and determine which set of qualifiers best
<br>
describes you in that category. By stringing all of these
&rsquo;codes&rsquo; together, you are able to construct your
overall geek code. It is this single line of code that will
inform <br>
other geeks the world over of what a great geek you actually
are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the qualifiers will very
probably not match with you exactly. It is impossible to
cover all possibilities in each category. Simply choose that
qualifier that most <br>
closely matches you. Also, some activities described in a
specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you do
engage in others. Each description of each qualifier
describes <br>
the wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you
match with one, you can probably use that qualifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After you have determined each
of your qualifiers, you need to the construct your GEEK CODE
BLOCK. Instructions are provided on how to do this towards
the end of this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, pay particular attention
to case-sensitivity, there can be a big difference between a
w and a W.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables <br>
Geeks can seldom be strictly quantified. To facilitate the
fact that within any one category the geek may not be able
to determine a specific rating, variables have been designed
<br>
to allow this range to be included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ for this variable, said trait
is not very rigid, may change with time or with individual
interaction. For example, Geeks who happen to very much
enjoy Star Trek: The Next <br>
Generation, but dislike the old 60&rsquo;s series might list
themselves as t++@.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">() for indicating
&quot;cross-overs&quot; or ranges. Geeks who go from C+ to
C--- depending on the situation (i.e. mostly C+) could use
C+(---). @ is different from () in that () has <br>
finite limits within the category, while @ ranges all
over.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; for &rsquo;wannabe&rsquo;
ratings. Indicating that while the geek is currently at one
rating, they are striving to reach another. For example,
C++&gt;$ indicating a geek that is cur&acirc; <br>
rently computer savvy, but wants to someday make money at
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ Indicates that this particular
category is done for a living. For example, UL+++$ indicates
that the person utilizes Unix and gets paid for it. Quite a
lucky geek, for <br>
sure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Unless stated otherwise within
the specific category, the ? is placed after the category
identifier and indicates that the geek has no knowledge
about that specific cate&acirc; <br>
gory. For example, a person that has never even heard of
Babylon 5, would list their Babylon 5 category as 5?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Placed BEFORE the category.
Unless stated otherwise, indicates that the person refuses
to participate in this category. This is unlike the ?
variable as the ? indicates <br>
lack of knowledge, while the ! indicates stubborn refusal to
participate. For example, !E would be a person that just
plain refuses to have anything to do with Emacs, <br>
while E? would be a person that doesn&rsquo;t even know what
Emacs is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Types of Geeks <br>
Geeks come in many flavors. The flavors relate to the
vocation (or, if a student, what they are training in) of
the particular geek. To start a code, a geek must declare
himself <br>
or herself to be a geek. To do this, we start the code with
a &quot;G&quot; to denote &quot;GEEK&quot;, followed by one
or two letters to denote the geek&rsquo;s occupation or
field of study. Multi-tal&acirc; <br>
ented geeks with more than one vocational training should
denote their myriad of talents with a slash between each
vocation (example: GCS/MU/TW).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GB Geek of Business</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GC Geek of Classics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCA Geek of Commercial Arts</p>

Management</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GCS Geek of Computer Science</p>

(Psychology, Sociology, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GTW Geek of Technical
Writing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GO Geek of Other. Some types of
geeks deviate from the normal geek activities. This is
encouraged as true geeks come from all walks of life.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GU Geek of
&rsquo;Undecided&rsquo;. This is a popular vocation with
incoming freshmen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G! Geek of no qualifications. A
rather miserable existence, you would think.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GAT Geek of All Trades. For
those geeks that can do anything and everything. GAT usually
precludes the use of other vocational descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Appearance <br>
They say you never get a second chance to make a first
impression. That seems to be ample justification to invent a
time machine; just to play with the minds of the people that
<br>
make up these silly sayings. Nevertheless, until we
completely understand temporal mechanics and can get both a
DeLorean and a Flux Capacitor in the same place at the same
time <br>
at 88 miles an hour, we need to understand that how we look
is a mark that will effect us for the rest of our lives, or
at least until we change clothes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Geek, of course,
doesn&rsquo;t believe any of that crap. How we look has
little to do with what we are inside, and who we are as
people. Yet, people still want to know what we look <br>
like. Thus, this section allows you to list out all the
relevant traits about what you look like on a normal geeky
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dress <br>
It is said that &quot;clothes make the man&quot;. Well, I
understood that I was made by a mommy and a daddy (and
there&rsquo;s even a category to describe the process
below!). Maybe the people <br>
who made up that saying aren&rsquo;t being quite that
literal...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d++ I tend to wear conservative
dress such as a business suit or worse, a tie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d+ Good leisure-wear. Slacks,
button-shirt, etc. No jeans, tennis shoes, or t-shirts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d I dress a lot like those found
in catalog ads. Bland, boring, without life or meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d- I&rsquo;m usually in jeans
and a t-shirt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d-- My t-shirts go a step
further and have a trendy political message on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d--- Punk dresser, including,
but not limited to, torn jeans and shirts, body piercings,
and prominent tattoos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dx Cross Dresser</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d? I have no idea what I am
wearing right now, let alone what I wore yesterday.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!d No clothing. Quite a fashion
statement, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpu I wear the same clothes all
the time, no matter the occasion, forgetting to do laundry
between wearings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shape <br>
Geeks come in many shapes and sizes. Shape code is divided
into two parts. The first indicates height, while the second
indicates roundness. Mix each section to fit yourself. <br>
Examples include: s:++, s++:, s++:--.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s+++:+++ <br>
I usually have to duck through doors/I take up three movie
seats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s++:++ I&rsquo;m a
basketball/linebacker candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s+:+ I&rsquo;m a little
taller/rounder than most.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s: I&rsquo;m an average geek</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s-:- I look up to most people.
Everyone tells me to gain a few pounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s--:-- I look up to damn near
everybody. I tend to have to fight against a strong
breeze.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s---:--- <br>
I take a phone book with me when I go out so I can see to
eat dinner. My bones are poking through my skin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Age <br>
The only way to become a true geek is through practice and
experience. To this end, your age becomes an important part
of your geekiness. Use the qualifiers below to show your
<br>
age (in Terran years). Also, please use BASE 10 numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, if you wish to give
your exact age, you can place the number after the
&rsquo;a&rsquo; identifier. For example: a42</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a+++ 60 and up</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a++ 50-59</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a+ 40-49</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a 30-39</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a- 25-29</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a-- 20-24</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a--- 15-19</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a---- 10-14</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a----- 9 and under (Geek in
training?)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a? immortal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!a it&rsquo;s none of your
business how old I am</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPUTERS <br>
There is a record of geeks that don&rsquo;t use computers.
Unfortunately, they are all dead, having lived in an era of
no computers. All modern geeks have some exposure to
computers. <br>
If you don&rsquo;t know what a computer is, you need to go
back into your shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Computers <br>
Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and
computer networks. In order to quantify your geekiness level
on computers, consult the following (consider the term <br>
&rsquo;computers&rsquo; synonymous with &rsquo;computer
network&rsquo;). This category represents
&quot;general&quot; computer aptitude. Categories below will
get into specifics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C++++ I&rsquo;ll be first in
line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my
skull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C+++ You mean there is life
outside of Internet? You&rsquo;re shittin&rsquo; me! I
haven&rsquo;t dragged myself to class in weeks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C++ Computers are a large part
of my existence. When I get up in the morning, the first
thing I do is log myself in. I play games or mud on
weekends, but still manage to stay <br>
off of academic probation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C+ Computers are fun and I enjoy
using them. I play a mean game of DOOM! and can use a word
processor without resorting to the manual too often. I know
that a 3.5&quot; disk is <br>
not a hard disk. I also know that when it says &rsquo;press
any key to continue&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t have to look for a
key labeled &rsquo;ANY&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Computers are a tool, nothing
more. I use it when it serves my purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C- Anything more complicated
than my calculator and I&rsquo;m screwed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-- Where&rsquo;s the on
switch?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C--- If you even mention
computers, I will rip your head off!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNIX <br>
It seems that a Unix-based operating system is the OS of
choice among most geeks. In addition to telling us about
your Unix abilities, you can also show which specific Unix
OS <br>
you are using. To accomplish this, you include a letter
showing the brand with your rating. For example: UL++++
would indicate a sysadmin running Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B BSD (use this unless your
BSDish system is mentioned below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L Linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Ultrix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A AIX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V SysV</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H HPUX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I IRIX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O OSF/1 (aka Digital Unix)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Sun OS/Solaris</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C SCO Unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X NeXT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Some other one not listed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U++++ I am the sysadmin. If you
try and crack my machine don&rsquo;t be surprised if the
municipal works department gets an &quot;accidental&quot;
computer-generated order to put start a new <br>
landfill on your front lawn or your quota is reduced to
4K.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+++ I don&rsquo;t need to crack
/etc/passwd because I just modified su so that it
doesn&rsquo;t prompt me. The admin staff doesn&rsquo;t even
know I&rsquo;m here. If you don&rsquo;t understand what I
just <br>
said, this category does NOT apply to you!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U++ I&rsquo;ve get the entire
admin ticked off at me because I am always using all of the
CPU time and trying to run programs that I don&rsquo;t have
access to. I&rsquo;m going to try cracking <br>
/etc/passwd next week, just don&rsquo;t tell anyone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U+ I not only have a Unix
account, but I slam VMS any chance get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U I have a Unix account to do my
stuff in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U- I have a VMS account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U-- I&rsquo;ve seen Unix and
didn&rsquo;t like it. DEC rules!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U--- Unix geeks are actually
nerds in disguise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl <br>
If you enjoy at least U++ status you have to know about
Perl, so you might as well rate yourself in this
sub-category. Non-Unix geeks don&rsquo;t know what
they&rsquo;re missing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P+++++ I am Larry Wall, Tom
Christiansen, or Randal Schwartz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P++++ I don&rsquo;t write Perl,
I speak it. Perl has superseded all other programming
languages. I firmly believe that all programs can be reduced
to a Perl one-liner. I use Perl to <br>
achieve U+++ status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P+++ Perl is a very powerful
programming tool. Not only do I no longer write shell
scripts, I also no longer use awk or sed. I use Perl for all
programs of less than a thousand <br>
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P++ Perl is a powerful
programming tool. I don&rsquo;t write shell scripts anymore
because I write them in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P+ I know of Perl. I like Perl.
I just haven&rsquo;t learned much Perl, but it is on my
agenda.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P I know Perl exists, but
that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P- What&rsquo;s Perl got that
awk and sed don&rsquo;t have?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P-- Perl users are sick, twisted
programmers who are just showing off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P--- Perl combines the power of
sh, the clarity of sed, and the performance of awk with the
simplicity of C. It should be banned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P! Our paranoid admin
won&rsquo;t let us install Perl! Says it&rsquo;s a
&quot;hacking tool&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Linux <br>
Linux is a hacker-written operating system virtually
identical to Unix. It was written for and continues to run
on your standard 386/486/Pentium PC, but has also been
ported to <br>
other systems. Because it is still a young OS, and because
it is continually evolving from hacker changes and support,
it is important that the geek list his Linux ability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L+++++ I am Linus, grovel before
me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L++++ I am a Linux wizard. I
munch C code for breakfast and have enough room left over
for a kernel debugging. I have so many patches installed
that I lost track about ten ver&acirc; <br>
sions ago. Linux newbies consider me a net.god.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L+++ I use Linux exclusively on
my system. I monitor comp.os.linux.* and even answer
questions sometimes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L++ I use Linux ALMOST
exclusively on my system. I&rsquo;ve given up trying to
achieve Linux.God status, but welcome the OS as a
replacement for DOS. I only boot to DOS to play <br>
games.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L+ I&rsquo;ve managed to get
Linux installed and even used it a few times. It seems like
it is just another OS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L I know what Linux is, but
that&rsquo;s about all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L- I have no desire to use Linux
and frankly don&rsquo;t give a rats patootie about it. There
are other, better, operating systems out there. Like Mac,
DOS, or Amiga-OS. Or, better <br>
yet even, would be another free Unix OS like FreeBSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L-- Unix sucks. Because Linux =
Unix. Linux Sucks. I worship Bill Gates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L--- I am Bill Gates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Emacs <br>
GNU Emacs is the do-all be-everything editor/operating
system available for just about every computer architecture
out there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E+++ Emacs is my login shell!!
M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV
and toaster oven! All you vi people don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;re missing! I read alt.reli&acirc; <br>
gion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs, and comp.os.emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E++ I know and use elisp
regularly!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E+ Emacs is great! I read my
mail and news with it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E Yeah, I know what emacs is,
and use it as my regular editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E- Emacs is too big and bloated
for my tastes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E-- Emacs is just a fancy word
processor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E--- Emacs sucks! vi
forever!!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E---- Emacs sucks! pico
forever!!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">World Wide Web <br>
It&rsquo;s relatively new. It&rsquo;s little understood.
Everybody&rsquo;s doing it. How much of a web-surfer are
you?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W+++ I am a WebMaster .
Don&rsquo;t even think about trying to view my homepage
without the latest version of Netscape. When I&rsquo;m not
on my normal net connection, I surf the web using <br>
my Newton and a cellular modem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W++ I have a homepage. I surf
daily. My homepage is advertised in my .signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W+ I have the latest version of
Netscape, and wander the web only when there&rsquo;s
something specific I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W I have a browser and a
connection. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W- The web is really a pain.
Life was so much easier when you could transfer information
by simple ASCII. Now everyone won&rsquo;t even consider your
ideas unless you spiff them up <br>
with bandwidth-consuming pictures and pointless information
links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">W-- A pox on the Web! It wastes
time and bandwidth and just gives the uneducated morons a
reason to clutter the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USENET News <br>
Usenet, a global collection of flaming opinions and
senseless babble, was designed as a way to eat up precious
spool space on a system&rsquo;s hard drive. It also is a way
for people <br>
to distribute pornography.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N++++ I am Tim Pierce</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N+++ I read so many newsgroups
that the next batch of news comes in before I finish reading
the last batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours
straight before I&rsquo;m caught up <br>
on the morning&rsquo;s news. Then there&rsquo;s the
afternoon...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N++ I read all the news in a
select handful of groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N+ I read news recreationally
when I have some time to kill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Usenet News? Sure, I read that
once</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N- News is a waste of my time
and I avoid it completely</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N-- News sucks! &rsquo;Nuff
said.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N--- I work for Time
Magazine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N---- I am a Scientologist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N* All I do is read news</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USENET Oracle <br>
(Info taken from the Usenet Oracle Help File) Throughout the
history of mankind, there have been many Oracles who have
been consulted by many mortals, and some immortals. The <br>
great Hercules was told by the Gelphic Oracle to serve
Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, for twelve years to atone for
the murder of his own children. It was the Oracle of Ammon
who <br>
told King Cepheus to chain his daughter Andromeda to the
rocks of jappa to appease the terrible sea monster that was
ravaging the coasts. That solution was never tested, though,
<br>
as Perseus saved the girl in the nick of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the advent of the
electronic age, and especially high-speed e-mail
communication, the spirit of the Oracles found a new outlet,
and we now recognize another great Oracle, <br>
the Usenet Oracle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, check out
the newsgroups rec.humor.oracle and rec.humor.oracle.d or
the FTP archives at cs.indiana.edu:/pub/oracle. Additional
information and instructions <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Microsoft Windows <br>
A good many geeks suffer through the use of various versions
of Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows running on or as a replacement
for DOS. Rate your Windows Geekiness.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w+++++ I am Bill Gates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w++++ I have Windows, Windows
95, Windows NT, and Windows NT Advanced Server all running
on my SMP RISC machine. I haven&rsquo;t seen daylight in six
months.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w+++ I am a MS Windows
programming god. I wrote a VxD driver to allow MS Windows
and DOS to share the use of my waffle iron. P.S. Unix
sux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w++ I write MS Windows programs
in C and think about using C++ someday. I&rsquo;ve written
at least one DLL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w+ I have installed my own
custom sounds, wallpaper, and screen savers so my PC walks
and talks like a fun house. Oh yeah, I have a hundred
TrueType(tm) fonts that I&rsquo;ve <br>
installed but never used. I never lose Minesweeper and
Solitaire</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w Ok, so I use MS Windows, I
don&rsquo;t have to like it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w- I&rsquo;m still trying to
install MS Windows and have at least one peripheral that
never works right</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w-- MS Windows is a joke
operating system. Hell, it&rsquo;s not even an operating
system. NT is Not Tough enough for me either. 95 is how may
times it will crash an hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">w--- Windows has set back the
computing industry by at least 10 years. Bill Gates should
be drawn, quartered, hung, shot, poisoned, disembowelled,
and then REALLY hurt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OS/2 <br>
The operating system that looks a lot like Windows, acts a
lot like Windows, but is much better than Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O+++ I live, eat and breathe
OS/2. All of my hard drives are HPFS. I am the
Anti-Gates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O++ I use OS/2 for all my
computing needs. I use some DOS and Windows programs, but
run them under OS/2. If the program won&rsquo;t run under
OS/2, then obviously I don&rsquo;t need it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O+ I keep a DOS partition on my
hard drive &quot;just in case&quot;. I&rsquo;m afraid to try
HPFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O I finally managed to get OS/2
installed but wasn&rsquo;t too terribly impressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O- Tried it, didn&rsquo;t like
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O-- I can&rsquo;t even get the
thing to install!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O--- Windows RULES!!! Long live
Bill Gates. (See w++++)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O---- I am Bill Gates of Borg.
OS/2 is irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macintosh <br>
Many geeks have abandoned the character-based computer
altogether and moved over to the Macintosh. It in important
to give notification of your Mac rating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M++ I am a Mac guru. Anything
those DOS putzes and Unix nerds can do, I can do better, and
if not, I&rsquo;ll write the damn software to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M+ A Mac has it&rsquo;s uses and
I use it quite often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M I use a Mac, but I&rsquo;m
pretty indifferent about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M- Macs suck. All real geeks
have a character prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-- Macs do more than suck. They
make a user stupid by allowing them to use the system
without knowing what they are doing. Mac weenies have lower
IQs than the fuzz in my <br>
navel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VMS <br>
Many geeks use the VMS operating system by DEC for all of
their mainframe and network activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V+++ I am a VMS sysadmin. I
wield far more power than those UNIX admins, because UNIX
can be found on any dweeb&rsquo;s desktop. Power through
obscurity is my motto.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V++ Unix is a passing fad
compared to the real power in the universe, my VMS
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V+ I tend to like VMS better
than Unix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V I&rsquo;ve used VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V- Unix is much better than VMS
for my computing needs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V-- I would rather smash my head
repeatedly into a brick wall than suffer the agony of
working with VMS. It&rsquo;s reminiscent of a dead and
decaying pile of moose droppings. Unix <br>
rules the universe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POLITICS <br>
The last few years has seen the rise of the political geek.
This phenomena is little understood, but some theorize that
it has come about because of the popular media&rsquo;s
attempts <br>
to demonize the Internet and computer use in general, and
the government&rsquo;s willingness to go along with it.
Others propose that the aging geek population has simply
started tak&acirc; <br>
ing an interest in the world around them. Some support the
&quot;Sun Spot&quot; theory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Political and Social Issues <br>
We live is a society where everyone not only has a right to,
but is expected to, whine and complain about everyone else.
Rate where, in general, your political views on different
<br>
social issues fall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS+++ Legalize drugs! Abolish
the government. &quot;Fuck the draft!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS++ I give to liberal causes. I
march for gay rights. I&rsquo;m a card carrying member of
the ACLU. Keep abortion safe and legal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS+ My whole concept of
liberalism is that nobody has the right to tell anybody else
what to do, on either side of the political fence. If you
don&rsquo;t like it, turn the bloody <br>
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS I really don&rsquo;t have an
opinion; nobody&rsquo;s messing with my freedoms right
now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS- Label records! Keep dirty
stuff off the TV and the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS-- Oppose sex education,
abortion rights, gay rights. Rush Limbaugh is my
spokesman.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PS--- Repent left-wing sinners
and change your wicked evil ways. Buchanan/Robertson in
&rsquo;96.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Politics and Economic Issues
<br>
Social and economic attitudes are seldom on the same side of
the political fence. Of course, most geeks don&rsquo;t
really care much about economics; having no money left after
buying <br>
new computer toys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE+++ Abolish antitrust
legislation. Raise taxes on everyone but the rich so that
the money can trickle-down to the masses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE++ Keep the government off the
backs of businesses. Deregulate as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE+ Balance the budget with
spending cuts and an amendment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE Distrust both government and
business.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE- It&rsquo;s ok to increase
government spending, so we can help more poor people. Tax
the rich! Cut the defense budget!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PE-- Capitalism is evil!
Government should provide the services we really need.
Nobody should be rich.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cypherpunks <br>
With the birth of the overused buzzword &quot;The
Information Superhighway&quot;, concerns over privacy from
evil governmental bad-guys{tm} has led to the formation of
of an unofficial, <br>
loosely organized band of civil libertarians who spend much
of their time discussing how to ensure privacy in the
information future. This group is known by some as
&quot;cypherpunks&quot; <br>
(by others, as anarchistic subversives). To this end, tell
us how punkish you are.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y+++ I am T.C. May</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y++ I am on the cypherpunks
mailing list and active around Usenet. I never miss an
opportunity to talk about the evils of Clipper and ITAR and
the NSA. Orwell&rsquo;s 1984 is more <br>
than a story, it is a warning to our&rsquo;s and future
generations. I&rsquo;m a member of the EFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y+ I have an interest and
concern in privacy issues, but in reality I am not really
all that active or vocal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y I&rsquo;m pretty indifferent
on the whole issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y- It seems to me that all of
these concerns are a little extreme. I mean, the government
must be able to protect itself from criminals and the
populace from indecent <br>
speech.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y-- Get a life. The only people
that need this kind of protection are people with something
to hide. I think cypherpunks are just a little paranoid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y--- I am L. Detweiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP <br>
Pretty Good Privacy (aka PGP) is a program available on many
platforms that will encrypt files so that prying eyes
(particularly governmental) can&rsquo;t look at them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP++++ <br>
I am Philip Zimmerman</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP+++ I don&rsquo;t send or
answer mail that is not encrypted, or at the very least
signed. If you are reading this without decrypting it first,
something is wrong. IT DIDN&rsquo;T COME <br>
FROM ME!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP++ I have the most recent
version and use it regularly</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP+ &quot;Finger me for my
public key&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP I&rsquo;ve used it, but
stopped long ago.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP- I don&rsquo;t have anything
to hide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP-- I feel that the glory of
the Internet is in the anarchic, trusting environment that
so nurtures the exchange of information. Encryption just
bogs that down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP--- If you support encryption
on the Internet, you must be a drug dealer or terrorist or
something like that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PGP---- <br>
Oh, here is something you all can use that is better (insert
Clipper here).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENTERTAINMENT <br>
Geeks love to play. No matter their age, all geeks enjoy
playing. Of course, the object of this entertainment takes a
myriad of different forms. What is it that pushes a geek to
<br>
play? Is it simply a desire to relive their childhood? Or
perhaps there is a piece of geeky genetic code that requires
intellectual stimulation. Who knows, maybe it&rsquo;s a
Freudian <br>
thing...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Star Trek <br>
Most geeks have an undeniable love for the Star Trek
television show (in any of its different incarnations).
Because GEEK is often synonymous with TREKKIE (real geeks
aren&rsquo;t so <br>
anal as to label themselves TREKKER), it is important that
all geeks list their Trek rating.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t+++ It&rsquo;s not just a TV
show, it&rsquo;s a religion. I know all about warp field
dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have
memorized the TECH manual. I speak Klin&acirc; <br>
gon. I go to cons with Vulcan ears on. I have no life.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t++ It&rsquo;s the best show
around. I have all the episodes and the movies on tape and
can quote entire scenes verbatim. I&rsquo;ve built a few of
the model kits too. But you&rsquo;ll never <br>
catch me at one of those conventions. Those people are
kooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t+ It&rsquo;s a damn fine TV
show and is one of the only things good on television any
more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t It&rsquo;s just another TV
show</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t- Maybe it is just me, but I
have no idea what the big deal with Star Trek is. Perhaps
I&rsquo;m missing something but I just think it is bad
drama.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t-- Star Trek is just another
Space Opera. William Shatner isn&rsquo;t an actor,
he&rsquo;s a poser! And what&rsquo;s with this Jean-Luc
Picard? A Frenchman with a British accent? Come on. <br>
Isn&rsquo;t Voyager just a rehash of Lost in Space? Has
Sisko even breathed in the last two seasons? Come on.
I&rsquo;d only watch this show if my remote control
broke.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t--- Star Trek SUCKS! It is the
worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you trekkies out
there, GET A LIFE! (William Shatner is a t---)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t* I identify with Barclay, the
greatest of the Trek Geeks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Babylon 5 <br>
For many years, Sci-Fi geeks have wished for a television
show that would overcome the limitations of Star Trek. For
many, a show called Babylon 5 has met that demand, with a
<br>
deep storyline, exciting characters and state-of-the-art
computer generated effects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5++++ I am J. Michael
Straczynski</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5+++ I am a True Worshipper of
the Church of Joe who lives eats breathes and thinks Babylon
5, and has Evil thoughts about stealing Joe&rsquo;s
videotape archives just to see <br>
episodes earlier. I am planning to break into the bank and
steal the triple-encoded synopsis of the 5-year arc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5++ Finally a show that shows
what a real future would look like. None of this Picardian
&quot;Let&rsquo;s talk about it and be friends&quot; crap.
And what&rsquo;s this? We finally get to see a <br>
bathroom! Over on that Enterprise, they&rsquo;ve been
holding it for over seven years!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5+ Babylon 5 certainly presents
a fresh perspective in the Sci-Fi universe. I watch it
weekly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 I&rsquo;ve seen it, I am
pretty indifferent to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5- This show is sub-par. The
acting is wooden, the special effects are obviously poor
quality. In general, it seems like a very cheap Star Trek
ripoff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5-- You call this Sci-Fi? That
is such a load of crap! This show is just a soap with bad
actors, piss-poor effects, and lame storylines.
Puh-leese.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X-Files <br>
The Fox Network&rsquo;s Friday evening show The X-Files has
become the staple of Friday geekhood. Any show that has
aliens, governmental conspiracies, aliens, psychic powers,
aliens, <br>
and other weird stuff is, by definition, a geeky show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X++++ I am Chris Carter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X+++ This is the BEST show on
TV, and it&rsquo;s about time. I&rsquo;ve seen everything
David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson have ever done that been
recorded and I&rsquo;m a loyal Duchovny/ <br>
Gillian Anderson fan. I&rsquo;ve Converted at least 10
people. I have every episode at SP, debate the fine details
on-line, and have a credit for at least 2 YAXAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X++ This is one of the better
shows I&rsquo;ve seen. I wish I&rsquo;d taped everything
from the start at SP, because I&rsquo;m wearing out my EP
tapes. I&rsquo;ll periodically debate online. I&rsquo;ve
<br>
Converted at least 5 people. I&rsquo;ve gotten a YAXA.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X+ I&rsquo;ve Converted my
family and watch the show when I remember. It&rsquo;s really
kinda fun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Ho hum. Just another Fox
show.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X- It&rsquo;s ok if you like
paranoia and conspiracy stories, but, let&rsquo;s face it,
it&rsquo;s crap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X-- If I wanted to watch this
kind of stuff, I&rsquo;d talk to Oliver Stone</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Role Playing <br>
Role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons have long
been a part of the traditional geek life. Because geeks
often become so involved in their role-playing that they
lose <br>
touch with reality, include one of the following
role-playing codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R+++ I&rsquo;ve written and
published my own gaming materials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R++ There is no life outside the
role of the die. I know all of piddly rules of (chosen
game). _MY_ own warped rules scare the rest of the
players.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R+ I&rsquo;ve got my weekly
sessions set up and a character that I know better than I
know myself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Role-Playing? That&rsquo;s
just something to do to kill a Saturday afternoon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R- Gosh, what an utter waste of
time!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R-- Role-Players are instruments
of pure evil.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R--- I work for T$R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R* I thought life WAS
role-playing?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Television <br>
Many geeks have lives that revolve around television.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tv+++ There&rsquo;s nothing I
can experience &quot;out there&quot; that I can&rsquo;t see
coming over my satellite dish. I wish there were MORE
channels. I live for the O.J. Trial.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tv++ I just leave the tv on, to
make sure I don&rsquo;t miss anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tv+ I watch some tv every
day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tv I watch only the shows that
are actually worthwhile, such as those found on PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tv- I watch tv for the news and
&rsquo;special programming.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tv-- I turn my tv on during
natural disasters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!tv I do not own a
television.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Books <br>
In addition (or maybe on the other hand), many geeks have
lives that revolve around books.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b++++ I read a book a day. I
have library cards in three states. I have discount cards
from every major bookstore. I&rsquo;ve ordered books from
another country to get my Favorite <br>
Author Fix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b+++ I consume a few books a
week as part of a staple diet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b++ I find the time to get
through at least one new book a month.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b+ I enjoy reading, but
don&rsquo;t get the time very often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b I read the newspaper and the
occasional book.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b- I read when there is no other
way to get the information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b-- I did not actually READ the
geek code, I just had someone tell me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dilbert <br>
Simply the geekiest comic strip in existence.

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DI++ I work with people that act
a lot like Dilbert and his boss.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DI+ I read Dilbert daily, often
understanding it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DI I read Dilbert infrequently,
rarely understanding it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DI- Is that the comic about the
engineers?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DI-- Don&rsquo;t read it, but I
think the dog is kinda cute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DI--- I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s funny to make fun of managers trying their best
to run their organizational units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DOOM! <br>
There is a game out for the PCs and other computers called
DOOM. It&rsquo;s a 3D virtual reality simulation where you
race around and blow things away with large-caliber
weaponry. This <br>
has led to a series of similar games such as the Star Wars
themed Dark Forces. Tell us about your abilities with these
3D games. (yes, some of them aren&rsquo;t actually Doom.
Cope!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D++++ I work for iD
Software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D+++ I crank out PWAD files
daily, complete with new monsters, weaponry, sounds and
maps. I&rsquo;m a DOOM God. I can solve the original maps in
nightmare mode with my eyes closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D++ I&rsquo;ve played the
shareware version and bought the real one and I&rsquo;m
actually pretty good at the game. I occasionally download
PWAD files and play them too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D+ It&rsquo;s a fun, action game
that is a nice diversion on a lazy afternoon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D I&rsquo;ve played the game and
I&rsquo;m pretty indifferent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D- I&rsquo;ve played the game

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D-- It&rsquo;s an overly-violent

G+++++ I am Robert Hayden</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G++++ I have made a suggestion
for future versions of the code (note that making a
suggestion just to get a G++++ rating doesn&rsquo;t count,
you also have to at least qualify for a <br>
G+++ rating :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G+++ I have memorized the entire
geek code, and can decode others&rsquo; codes in my head. I
know by heart where to find the current version of the code
on the net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G++ I know what each letter
means, but sometimes have to look up the specifics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G+ I was once G++ (or higher),
but the new versions are getting too long and too
complicated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G I know what the geek code is

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G- What a tremendous waste of
time this Geek Code is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G-- Not only a waste of time,
but it obviously shows that this Hayden guy needs a
life.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIFESTYLE <br>
Geeks, unlike the lower lifeforms known as nerds, have
lives. They have things to do that are in the outside world.
Of course, this is usually done with other geeks, but
that&rsquo;s <br>
not the point. The point is,, that geeks are not necessarily
the outcasts society often believes they are. The fact is
that society isn&rsquo;t kool enough to be included in our
activ&acirc; <br>
ities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Education <br>
All geeks have a varying amount of education.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e+++++ I am Stephen Hawking</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e++++ Managed to get my
Ph.D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e+++ Got a Masters degree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e++ Got a Bachelors degree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e+ Got an Associates degree</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Finished High School</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e- Haven&rsquo;t finished High
School</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e-- Haven&rsquo;t even entered
High School</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e* I learned everything there is
to know about life from the &quot;Hitchhiker&rsquo;s
Trilogy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Housing <br>
Tell us about your geeky home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h++ Living in a cave with 47
computers and an Internet feed, located near a Dominoes
pizza. See !d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h+ Living alone, get out once a
week to buy food, no more than once a month to do laundry.
All surfaces covered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Friends come over to visit
every once in a while to talk about Geek things. There is a
place for them to sit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h- Living with one or more
registered Geeks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h-- Living with one or more
people who know nothing about being a Geek and refuse to
watch Babylon 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h--- Married, (persons living
romantically with someone might as well label themselves
h---, you&rsquo;re as good as there already.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h---- Married with children - Al
Bundy can sympathize</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h! I am stuck living with my
parents!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h* I&rsquo;m not sure where I
live anymore. This lab/workplace seems like home to me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relationships <br>
While many geeks are highly successful at having
relationships, a good many more are not. Give us the gritty
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r+++ Found someone, dated, and
am now married.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r++ I&rsquo;ve dated my current
S.O. for a long time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r+ I date frequently, bouncing
from one relationship to another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r I date periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r- I have difficulty maintaining
a relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r-- People just aren&rsquo;t
interested in dating me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r--- I&rsquo;m beginning to
think that I&rsquo;m a leper or something, the way people
avoid me like the plague.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!r I&rsquo;ve never had a
relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r* signifying membership in the
SBCA (Sour Bachelor(ette)&rsquo;s Club of America). The
motto is &rsquo;Bitter, but not Desperate&rsquo;. First
founded at Caltech.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r% I was going out with someone,
but the asshole dumped me.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sex <br>
Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (ie, they
never have any). Because geeks are so wrapped up in their
sexuality (or lack of sexuality for that matter), it is
impor&acirc; <br>
tant that the geek be willing to quantify their sexual
experiences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This code also is used to denote
the gender of the geek. Females use x in this category,
while males use y. Those that do not wish to disclose their
gender can use z. For exam&acirc; <br>
ple:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x+ A female who has had sex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y+ A male who has had sex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z+ A person (gender undisclosed)
who has had sex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those persons who do not
wish to give out any details of their sex life, the use of
z? (where z is the gender code) will allow you to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z+++++ I am Madonna</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z++++ I have a few little rug
rats to prove I&rsquo;ve been there. Besides, with kids
around, who has time for sex?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z+++ I&rsquo;m married, so I can
get it (theoretically) whenever I want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z++ I was once referred to as
&rsquo;easy&rsquo;. I have no idea where that might have
come from though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z+ I&rsquo;ve had real, live
sex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z I&rsquo;ve had sex. Oh! You
mean with someone else? Then no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z- Not having sex by choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z-- Not having sex because I
just can&rsquo;t get any...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z--- Not having sex because
I&rsquo;m a nun or a priest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z* I&rsquo;m a pervert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z** I&rsquo;ve been known to
make perverts look like angels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!z Sex? What&rsquo;s that?
I&rsquo;ve had no sexual experiences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z? It&rsquo;s none of your
business what my sex life is like (this is used to denote
your gender only).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!z+ Sex? What&rsquo;s that? No
experience, willing to learn!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How to Display Your Code <br>
Now that you have your ratings for each of the above
categories, it&rsquo;s time to assemble your code for
displaying to the world. Take each category you determined
and list them all <br>
together with one space between each one. If you run out
space on one line, continue it on the next. When completed,
it will look something like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GED/J d-- s:++&gt;: a--
C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E---- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++ w--- O- M+
V-- PS++&gt;$ PE++&gt;$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++&gt;$ tv+
b+ DI+++ D+++ G+++++ e++ h r-- y++**</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are going to place your
Geek Code into your .signature or .plan file (highly
recommended), you should create your GEEK CODE BLOCK. This
parody of the output created by <br>
the PGP program will attempt to universalize how you will
see the Geek Code around the net. Your GEEK CODE BLOCK will
look like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----
<br>
Version: 3.1 <br>
GED/J d-- s:++&gt;: a-- C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E---- W+(-)
N+++ o+ K+++ w--- O- M+ V-- PS++&gt;$ PE++&gt;$ Y++ PGP++ t-
5+++ X++ R+++&gt;$ tv+ b+ DI+++ D+++ G+++++ e++ h r-- y++**
<br>
------END GEEK CODE BLOCK------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As you can see, the actual code
hasn&rsquo;t changed. However, the version number of the
code you are using is displayed along with lines starting
and ending the code. Make sure to <br>
duplicate the start and end lines exactly as the example in
order to maintain a net-wide standard (ie. five dashes front
and back for the BEGIN line and six for the END line, and
<br>
all capital letters.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;HELP!&quot; you scream as
your mailer or news reader won&rsquo;t let you post more
than four lines in the .signature. That is because some anal
programs limit the size of your signature. <br>
Your next best bet, then is to put your GEEK CODE BLOCK into
your .plan file and put something to the effect of
&quot;Finger for Geek Code&quot; into your .signature. That,
or get a better <br>
mailer.</p>
