<p>h2pas(1) Free Pascal C header conversion utility
h2pas(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
h2pas - The C header to pascal unit conversion program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
h2pas [options] filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
h2pas attempts to convert a C header file to a pascal unit.
it can handle most C constructs that one finds in a C header
file, and attempts to translate them to their pascal <br>
counterparts. see the CONSTRUCTS section for a full
description of what the translator can handle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
H2pas is a command-line tool that translates a C header file
to a spascal unit. It reads the C header file and translates
the C declarations to equivalent pascal declarations <br>
that can be used to access code written in C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the h2pas program
is written to a file with the same name as the C header file
that was used as input, but with the extension .pp. The
output file that h2pas cre&acirc; <br>
ates can be customized in a number of ways by means of many
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The output of h2pas can be controlled with the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d use external; for all
procedure and function declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D use external libname name
&rsquo;func_name&rsquo; for function and procedure
declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Emit a series of constants
instead of an enumeration type for the C enum construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i create an include file
instead of a unit (omits the unit header).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l libname <br>
specify the library name for external function
declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
Specify the output file name. Default is the input file name
with the extension replaced by .pp &quot;.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p use the letter P in front of
pointer type parameters instead of &quot;^&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Strip comments from the input
file. By default comments are converted to comments, but
they may be displaced, since a comment is handled by the
scanner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t prepend typedef type names
with the letter T (used to follow Borland&rsquo;s convention
that all types should be defined with T).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v replace pointer parameters by
call by reference parameters. Use with care because some
calls can expect a NIL pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Header file is a win32 header
file (adds support for some special macros).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x handle SYS_TRAP of the PalmOS
header files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSTRUCTS <br>
The following C declarations and statements are
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defines <br>
defines are changed into pascal constants if they are simple
defines. macros are changed - wherever possible to
functions; however the arguments are all integers, so <br>
these must be changed manually. Simple expressions in define
staments are recognized, as are most arithmetic operators:
addition, substraction, multiplication, division, <br>
logical operators, comparision operators, shift operators.
The C construct ( A ? B : C) is also recognized and
translated to a pascal construct with an IF statement (this
<br>
is buggy, however).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">preprocessor statements <br>
the conditional preprocessing commands are recognized and
translated into equivalent pascal compiler directives. The
special #ifdef __cplusplus is also recognized and <br>
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef <br>
A typedef statement is changed into a pascal type statement.
The following basic types are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char changed to char.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">float changed to real (=double
in free pascal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int changed to longint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long changed to longint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long int <br>
changed to longint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short changed to integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned <br>
changed to cardinal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned char <br>
changed to byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned int <br>
changed to cardinal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned long int <br>
changed to cardinal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned short <br>
changed to word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void ignored. <br>
These types are also changed if they appear in the arguments
of a function or procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">functions and procedures <br>
functions and procedures are translated as well; pointer
types may be changed to call by reference arguments (using
the var argument) by using the -p command line argu&acirc;
<br>
ment. functions that have a variable number of arguments are
changed to a function with an array of const argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifiers <br>
the extern specifier is recognized; however it is ignored.
the packed specifier is also recognised and changed with the
PACKRECORDS directive. The const specifier is also <br>
recognized, but is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">modifiers <br>
If the -w option is specified, then the following modifiers
are recognized: STDCALL , CDECL , CALLBACK , PASCAL , WINAPI
, APIENTRY , WINGDIAPI as defined in the win32 <br>
headers. If additionally the -x option is specified then the
SYS_TRAP specifier is also recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enums enum constructs are
changed into enumeration types; bear in mind that in C
enumeration types can have values assigned to them; Free
Pascal also allows this to a certain <br>
degree. If you know that values are assigned to enums, it is
best to use the -e option to change the enus to a series of
integer constants.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unions unions are changed to
variant records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">structs <br>
are changed to pascal records, with C packing.</p>
