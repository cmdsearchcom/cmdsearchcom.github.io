<p>pageant(1) PuTTY tool suite pageant(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pageant - PuTTY SSH authentication agent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pageant ( -X | -T | --permanent | --debug ) [ key-file... ]
<br>
pageant [ key-file... ] --exec command [ args... ] <br>
pageant -a key-file... <br>
pageant ( -d | --public | --public-openssh )
key-identifier... <br>
pageant -D <br>
pageant -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pageant is both an SSH authentication agent, and also a tool
for communicating with an already-running agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When running as an SSH agent, it
listens on a Unix-domain socket for connections from client
processes running under your user id. Clients can load SSH
private keys into the <br>
agent, or request signatures on a given message from a key
already in the agent. This permits one-touch authentication
by SSH client programs, if Pageant is holding a key that
<br>
the server they are connecting to will accept.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pageant can also act as a client
program itself, communicating with an already-running agent
to add or remove keys, list the keys, or extract their
public half.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The agent protocol used by
pageant is compatible with the PuTTY tools and also with
other implementations such as OpenSSH&rsquo;s SSH client and
ssh-agent(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run pageant as an agent, you
must provide an option to tell it what its lifetime should
be. Typically you would probably want Pageant to last for
the duration of a login ses&acirc; <br>
sion, in which case you should use either -X or -T,
depending on whether your login session is GUI or purely
terminal-based respectively. For example, in your X session
startup <br>
script you might write</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(pageant -X)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which will cause Pageant to
start running, monitor the X server to notice when your
session terminates (and then it will terminate too), and
print on standard output some shell <br>
commands to set environment variables that client processes
will need to find the running agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a terminal-based login, you
could do almost exactly the same thing but with -T:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(pageant -T)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will cause Pageant to tie
its lifetime to that of your controlling terminal: when you
log out, and the terminal device ceases to be associated
with your session, Pageant <br>
will notice that it has no controlling terminal any more,
and will terminate automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In either of these modes, you
can also add one or more private keys as extra command-line
arguments, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(pageant -T
~/.ssh/key.ppk)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in which case Pageant will
prompt for the keys&rsquo; passphrases (if any) and start
the agent with those keys already loaded. Passphrase prompts
will use the controlling terminal if <br>
one is available, or failing that the GUI if one of those is
available. If neither is available, no passphrase prompting
can be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use Pageant to talk to an
existing agent, you can add new keys using -a, list the
current set of keys&rsquo; fingerprints and comments with
-l, extract the full public half of any <br>
key using --public or --public-openssh, delete a key using
-d, or delete all keys using -D.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIFETIME <br>
The following options are called lifetime modes. They all
request Pageant to operate in agent mode; each one specifies
a different method for Pageant to start up and know when to
<br>
shut down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Pageant will open a
connection to your X display, and when that connection is
lost, it will terminate. This gives it the same lifetime as
your GUI login session, so in <br>
this mode it is suitable for running from a startup script
such as .xsession. The actual agent will be a subprocess;
the main Pageant process will terminate immediately, <br>
after printing environment-variable setting commands on
standard output which should be installed in any process
wanting to communicate with the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual approach would be to
run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(pageant -X)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in an X session startup script.
However, other possibilities exist, such as directing the
standard output of &lsquo;pageant -X&rsquo; to a file which
is then sourced by any new shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Pageant will tie its lifetime
to that of the login session running on its controlling
terminal, by noticing when it ceases to have a controlling
terminal (which will auto&acirc; <br>
matically happen as a side effect of the session leader
process terminating). Like -X, Pageant will print
environment-variable commands on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exec command <br>
Pageant will run the provided command as a subprocess,
preloaded with the appropriate environment variables to
access the agent it starts up. When the subprocess
termi&acirc; <br>
nates, Pageant will terminate as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All arguments on Pageant&rsquo;s
command line after --exec will be treated as part of the
command to run, even if they look like other valid Pageant
options or key files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--permanent <br>
Pageant will fork off a subprocess to be the agent, and
print environment-variable commands on standard output, like
-X and -T. However, in this case, it will make no <br>
effort to limit its lifetime in any way; it will simply run
permanently, unless manually killed. The environment
variable SSH_AGENT_PID, set by the commands printed by <br>
Pageant, permits the agent process to be found for this
purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not recommended,
because any method of manually killing the agent carries the
risk of the session terminating unexpectedly before it
manages to happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Pageant will run in the foreground, without forking. It will
print its environment variable setup commands on standard
output, and then it will log all agent activity to <br>
standard output as well. This is useful for debugging what
Pageant itself is doing, or what another process is doing to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CLIENT OPTIONS <br>
The following options tell Pageant to operate in client
mode, contacting an existing agent via environment variables
that it should already have set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a key-files <br>
Load the specified private key file(s), decrypt them if
necessary by prompting for their passphrases, and add them
to the already-running agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The private key files must be in
PuTTY&rsquo;s .ppk file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the keys currently in
the running agent. Each key&rsquo;s fingerprint and comment
string will be shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--public key-identifiers <br>
Print the public half of each specified key, in the RFC 4716
standard format (multiple lines, starting with &lsquo;----
BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each key-identifier can be any
of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The name of a
file containing the key, either the whole key (again in .ppk
format) or just its public half.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The key&rsquo;s
comment string, as shown by pageant -l.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enough hex
digits of the key&rsquo;s fingerprint to be unique among
keys currently loaded into the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Pageant can uniquely identify
one key by interpreting the key-identifier in any of these
ways, it will assume that key was the one you meant. If it
cannot, you will <br>
have to specify more detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find that your desired
key-identifier string can be validly interpreted as more
than one of the above kinds of identification, you can
disambiguate by prefixing it <br>
with &lsquo;file:&rsquo;, &lsquo;comment:&rsquo; or
&lsquo;fp:&rsquo; to indicate that it is a filename, comment
string or fingerprint prefix respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--public-openssh key-identifiers
<br>
Print the public half of each specified key, in the one-line
format used by OpenSSH, suitable for putting in
.ssh/authorized_keys files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d key-identifiers <br>
Delete each specified key from the agent&rsquo;s memory, so
that the agent will no longer serve it to clients unless it
is loaded in again using pageant -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Delete all keys from the
agent&rsquo;s memory, leaving it completely empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose mode. When Pageant runs in agent mode, this
option causes it to log all agent activity to its standard
error. For example, you might run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(pageant -X -v
2&gt;~/.pageant.log)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and expect a list of all
signatures requested by agent clients to build up in that
log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The log information is the same
as that produced by the --debug lifetime option, but --debug
sends it to standard output (since that is the main point of
debugging mode) <br>
whereas -v in all other lifetime modes sends the same log
data to standard error (being a by-product of the
program&rsquo;s main purpose). Using -v in --debug mode has
no <br>
effect: the log still goes to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, -c Force Pageant to output
its environment setup commands in the style of POSIX /
Bourne shells (-s) or C shells (-c) respectively. If neither
option is given, Pageant will <br>
guess based on whether the environment variable SHELL has a
value ending in &lsquo;csh&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Print a brief summary of
command-line options and terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version of Pageant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- Cause all subsequent
arguments to be treated as key file names, even if they look
like options.</p>
