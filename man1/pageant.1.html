<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>pageant</b> is both an SSH authentication agent, and also a tool for
  communicating with an already-running agent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When running as an SSH agent, it listens on a Unix-domain socket for connections
  from client processes running under your user id. Clients can load SSH private
  keys into the agent, or request signatures on a given message from a key
  already in the agent. This permits one-touch authentication by SSH client
  programs, if Pageant is holding a key that the server they are connecting to
  will accept.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pageant</b> can also act as a client program itself, communicating with an
  already-running agent to add or remove keys, list the keys, or extract their
  public half.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The agent protocol used by <b>pageant</b> is compatible with the PuTTY tools and
  also with other implementations such as OpenSSH's SSH client and
  <i>ssh-agent(1)</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To run <b>pageant</b> as an agent, you must provide an option to tell it what
  its <i>lifetime</i> should be. Typically you would probably want Pageant to
  last for the duration of a login session, in which case you should use either
  <b>-X</b> or <b>-T</b>, depending on whether your login session is GUI or
  purely terminal-based respectively. For example, in your X session startup
  script you might write
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
<b>eval&#x00A0;$(pageant&#x00A0;-X)</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which will cause Pageant to start running, monitor the X server to notice when
  your session terminates (and then it will terminate too), and print on
  standard output some shell commands to set environment variables that client
  processes will need to find the running agent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In a terminal-based login, you could do almost exactly the same thing but with
  <b>-T</b>:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
<b>eval&#x00A0;$(pageant&#x00A0;-T)</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will cause Pageant to tie its lifetime to that of your controlling
  terminal: when you log out, and the terminal device ceases to be associated
  with your session, Pageant will notice that it has no controlling terminal any
  more, and will terminate automatically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In either of these modes, you can also add one or more private keys as extra
  command-line arguments, e.g.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
<b>eval&#x00A0;$(pageant&#x00A0;-T&#x00A0;~/.ssh/key.ppk)</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
in which case Pageant will prompt for the keys' passphrases (if any) and start
  the agent with those keys already loaded. Passphrase prompts will use the
  controlling terminal if one is available, or failing that the GUI if one of
  those is available. If neither is available, no passphrase prompting can be
  done.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use Pageant to talk to an existing agent, you can add new keys using
  <b>-a</b>, list the current set of keys' fingerprints and comments with
  <b>-l</b>, extract the full public half of any key using <b>--public</b> or
  <b>--public-openssh</b>, delete a key using <b>-d</b>, or delete all keys
  using <b>-D</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIFETIME"><a class="selflink" href="#LIFETIME">LIFETIME</a></h1>
The following options are called <i>lifetime modes</i>. They all request Pageant
  to operate in agent mode; each one specifies a different method for Pageant to
  start up and know when to shut down.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-X</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pageant will open a connection to your X display, and when
      that connection is lost, it will terminate. This gives it the same
      lifetime as your GUI login session, so in this mode it is suitable for
      running from a startup script such as <b>.xsession</b>. The actual agent
      will be a subprocess; the main Pageant process will terminate immediately,
      after printing environment-variable setting commands on standard output
      which should be installed in any process wanting to communicate with the
      agent.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The usual approach would be to run
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
<b>eval&#x00A0;$(pageant&#x00A0;-X)</b>
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
in an X session startup script. However, other possibilities exist, such as
  directing the standard output of ` <b>pageant -X</b>' to a file which is then
  sourced by any new shell.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-T</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pageant will tie its lifetime to that of the login session
      running on its controlling terminal, by noticing when it ceases to have a
      controlling terminal (which will automatically happen as a side effect of
      the session leader process terminating). Like <b>-X</b>, Pageant will
      print environment-variable commands on standard output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--exec</b> <i>command</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pageant will run the provided command as a subprocess,
      preloaded with the appropriate environment variables to access the agent
      it starts up. When the subprocess terminates, Pageant will terminate as
      well.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
All arguments on Pageant's command line after <b>--exec</b> will be treated as
  part of the command to run, even if they look like other valid Pageant options
  or key files.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--permanent</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pageant will fork off a subprocess to be the agent, and
      print environment-variable commands on standard output, like <b>-X</b> and
      <b>-T</b>. However, in this case, it will make no effort to limit its
      lifetime in any way; it will simply run permanently, unless manually
      killed. The environment variable <b>SSH_AGENT_PID</b>, set by the commands
      printed by Pageant, permits the agent process to be found for this
      purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is not recommended, because any method of manually killing the agent
  carries the risk of the session terminating unexpectedly before it manages to
  happen.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--debug</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pageant will run in the foreground, without forking. It
      will print its environment variable setup commands on standard output, and
      then it will log all agent activity to standard output as well. This is
      useful for debugging what Pageant itself is doing, or what another process
      is doing to it.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CLIENT_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#CLIENT_OPTIONS">CLIENT
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following options tell Pageant to operate in client mode, contacting an
  existing agent via environment variables that it should already have set.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b> <i>key-files</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Load the specified private key file(s), decrypt them if
      necessary by prompting for their passphrases, and add them to the
      already-running agent.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
The private key files must be in PuTTY's <b>.ppk</b> file format.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">List the keys currently in the running agent. Each key's
      fingerprint and comment string will be shown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--public</b> <i>key-identifiers</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print the public half of each specified key, in the RFC
      4716 standard format (multiple lines, starting with ` <b>---- BEGIN SSH2
      PUBLIC KEY ----</b>').</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each <i>key-identifier</i> can be any of the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name of a file containing the key, either the whole key
      (again in <b>.ppk</b> format) or just its public half.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The key's comment string, as shown by <b>pageant
    -l</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Enough hex digits of the key's fingerprint to be unique
      among keys currently loaded into the agent.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If Pageant can uniquely identify one key by interpreting the
  <i>key-identifier</i> in any of these ways, it will assume that key was the
  one you meant. If it cannot, you will have to specify more detail.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find that your desired <i>key-identifier</i> string can be validly
  interpreted as more than one of the above <i>kinds</i> of identification, you
  can disambiguate by prefixing it with ` <b>file:</b>', `<b>comment:</b>' or
  `<b>fp:</b>' to indicate that it is a filename, comment string or fingerprint
  prefix respectively.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--public-openssh</b> <i>key-identifiers</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print the public half of each specified key, in the
      one-line format used by OpenSSH, suitable for putting in
      <b>.ssh/authorized_keys</b> files.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b> <i>key-identifiers</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Delete each specified key from the agent's memory, so that
      the agent will no longer serve it to clients unless it is loaded in again
      using <b>pageant -a</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Delete all keys from the agent's memory, leaving it
      completely empty.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Verbose mode. When Pageant runs in agent mode, this option
      causes it to log all agent activity to its standard error. For example,
      you might run</dd>

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>

</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and expect a list of all signatures requested by agent clients to build up in
  that log file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The log information is the same as that produced by the <b>--debug</b> lifetime
  option, but <b>--debug</b> sends it to standard output (since that is the main
  point of debugging mode) whereas <b>-v</b> in all other lifetime modes sends
  the same log data to standard error (being a by-product of the program's main
  purpose). Using <b>-v</b> in <b>--debug</b> mode has no effect: the log still
  goes to standard output.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Force Pageant to output its environment setup commands in
      the style of POSIX / Bourne shells ( <b>-s</b>) or C shells (<b>-c</b>)
      respectively. If neither option is given, Pageant will guess based on
      whether the environment variable <b>SHELL</b> has a value ending in
      `<b>csh</b>'.</dd>
