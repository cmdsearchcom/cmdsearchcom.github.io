<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cpdup &acirc; mirror filesystems</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cpdup [-C] [-v[v[v]]] [-d] [-n] [-u] [-I] [-f] [-F ssh-arg]
[-s0] [-i0] [-j0] [-l] [-q] [-o] [-m] [-H path] [-M file]
[-V] [-VV] [-S] [-R] [-k] [-K file] [-X file] [-x] <br>
[[user@]host:]source_dir [[user@]host:]target_dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cpdup utility makes an exact mirror copy of the source
in the destination, creating and deleting files and
directories as necessary. UTimes, hardlinks, softlinks,
devices, <br>
permissions, and flags are mirrored. By default, cpdup asks
for confirmation if any file or directory needs to be
removed from the destination and does not copy files which
it <br>
believes to have already been synchronized (by observing
that the source and destination files&rsquo; sizes and
mtimes match). cpdup does not cross mount points in either
the source or <br>
the destination. As a safety measure, cpdup refuses to
replace a destination directory with a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C If the source or target is a
remote host, request that the ssh(1) session be compressed.
This is the same as -F -C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[v[v]] <br>
Set verboseness. By default cpdup does not report its
progress except when asking for confirmation. A single -v
will only report modifications made to the destination. -vv
<br>
will report directories as they are being traversed as well
as modifications made to the destination. -vvv will cause
all files and directories to be reported whether or not <br>
modifications are made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Print directories as they are
being traversed. Useful to watch the progress; this
typically produces much less output than -vv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Go through the motions but
don&rsquo;t actually make any changes to the target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Causes the output generated
by -v and -d to be unbuffered. This can be useful for
obtaining prompt progress updates through a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I will cause cpdup to print a
summary at the end with performance counters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Forces file updates to occur
even if the files appear to be the same. If the -H option is
used, this option will force a byte for byte comparison
between the original file <br>
and the file in the hardlink path, even if all the stat info
matches, but will still use a hardlink if they match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F ssh-arg <br>
Pass ssh-arg to ssh. For example &acirc;-F -p222&acirc;.
Note the lack of a space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s0 Disable the
disallow-file-replaces-directory safety feature. This safety
feature is enabled by default to prevent user mistakes from
blowing away everything accidentally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i0 Do not request confirmation
when removing something.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j0 Do not try to recreate CHR
or BLK devices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Line buffer verbose
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Do not remove any files, just
overwrite/add.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Generate and maintain a MD5
checkfile called .MD5.CHECKSUMS in each directory on the
source and do an MD5 check on each file of the destination
when the destination appears <br>
to be the same as the source. If the check fails, the source
is recopied to the destination. When you specify a
destination directory, the MD5 checkfile is only updated as
<br>
needed and may not be updated even if modifications are made
to a source file. If you do not specify a destination
directory the cpdup command forcefully regenerates the MD5
<br>
checkfile for every file in the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M file <br>
Works the same as -m but allows you to specify the name of
the MD5 checkfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H path <br>
cpdup will create a hardlink from a file found under path to
the target instead of copying the source to the target if
the file found via path is identical to the source. <br>
Note that a remote host specification should not be used for
this option&rsquo;s path, but the path will be relative to
the target machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows one to use cpdup to
create incremental backups of a filesystem. Create a direct
&acirc;level 0&acirc; backup, and then specify the level 0
backup path with this option when <br>
creating an incremental backup to a different target
directory. This method works so long as the filesystem does
not hit a hardlink limit. If the system does hit a hardlink
<br>
limit, cpdup will generate a warning and copy the file
instead. Note that cpdup must record file paths for any
hardlinked file while operating and therefore uses a great
<br>
deal more memory when dealing with hardlinks or
hardlink-based backups. Example use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpdup -i0 -s0 -I -H
/backup/home.l0 /home /backup/home.l1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: If this option is used
cpdup must record the paths for all files it encounters
while it operates and it is possible that you may run the
process out of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file found via the hardlink
path will be byte-by-byte compared with the source if the -V
or -f option is also used, otherwise only the stat info is
checked to determine <br>
whether it matches the source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V This forces the contents of
regular files to be verified, even if the files appear to
the be the same. Whereas the -f (force) option forces a copy
regardless, this option <br>
will avoid rewriting the target if everything matches and
the contents are verified to be the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VV This works the same as -V
but ignores mtime entirely, making it suitable for comparing
HAMMER master and slave filesystems or copies made without
mtime retention.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S This places cpdup into slave
mode and is used to initiate the slave protocol on a remote
machine. This option is not intended to be used by
humans.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Place the slave into
read-only mode. Can only be used when the source is remote.
Useful for unattended backups via SSH keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Generate and maintain a FSMID
checkfile called .FSMID.CHECK in each directory on the
target. cpdup will check the FSMID for each source file or
directory against the check&acirc; <br>
file on the target and will not copy the file or recurse
through the directory when a match occurs. Any source file
or directory with the same name as the checkfile will be
<br>
ignored. The FSMID will be re-checked after the copy has
been completed and cpdup will loop on that directory or file
until it is sure it has an exact copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: FSMID is not always
supported by a filesystem and may not be synchronized if a
crash occurs. DragonFly will simulate an FSMID when it is
otherwise not supported by <br>
the filesystem, and users should be aware that simulated
FSMIDs may change state in such cases even if the underlying
hierarchy does not due to cache flushes. Additionally, <br>
the FSMID may not reflect changes made to remote filesystems
by other hosts. For example, using these options with NFS
mounted sources will not work well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K file <br>
Works the same as -k but allows you to specify the name of
the FSMID checkfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Causes cpdup to use the
exclusion file .cpignore in each directory on the source to
determine which files to ignore. When this option is used,
the exclusion filename itself <br>
is automatically excluded from the copy. If this option is
not used then the filename .cpignore is not considered
special and will be copied along with everything else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X file <br>
Works the same as -x but allows you to specify the name of
the exclusion file. This file is automatically excluded from
the copy. Only one exclusion file may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE COPYING <br>
cpdup can mirror directory structures across machines and
can also do third-party copies. This also works between
machines that use different byte order. ssh(1) sessions are
used <br>
and cpdup is run on the remote machine(s) in slave mode. You
can use the -F option to pass additional flags to the ssh
command if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax of remote path
specifications is similar to scp(1). In particular, that
means that a local path containing a colon must be preceded
by a slash to prevent it being con&acirc; <br>
sidered a remote host: &acirc;foo:bar&acirc; causes cpdup to
look for a directory called &acirc;bar&acirc; on host
&acirc;foo&acirc;, while &acirc;./foo:bar&acirc; denotes the
directory &acirc;foo:bar&acirc; on the local machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The cpdup utility exits 0 if no error occurred and &gt;0 if
an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cp(1), cpio(1), scp(1), ssh(1), tar(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The cpdup command was originally created to update servers
at BEST Internet circa 1997 and was placed under the FreeBSD
copyright for inclusion in the ports area in 1999. The
pro&acirc; <br>
gram was written by Matthew Dillon, Dima Ruban, and later
significantly improved by Oliver Fromme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
UFS(5) has a hardlink limit of 32767. Many programs, in
particular CVS with regards to its CVS/Root file, will
generate a lot of hard links. When using the -H option it
may not <br>
be possible for cpdup to maintain these hard links. If this
occurs, cpdup will be forced to copy the file instead of
link it, and thus not be able to make a perfect copy of the
<br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When so-called sparse files
(i.e. files with &quot;holes&quot;) are copied, the holes
will be filled in the target files, so they occupy more
physical disk space than the source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility reasons, the
slave protocol is not as efficient for writing remote files
as it is for reading them. Therefore it is recommended to
run cpdup on the target <br>
machine when making remote copies, so the source machine is
remote. If you do it the other way, cpdup will run somewhat
slower.</p>
