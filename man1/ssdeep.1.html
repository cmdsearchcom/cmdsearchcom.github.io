<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ssdeep - Computes context triggered piecewise hashes (fuzzy
hashes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ssdeep [-m &lt;file&gt;] [-k &lt;file&gt;] [-vdprgsblcxa]
[-t val] [FILES] <br>
ssdeep [-V|h]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Computes a signature based on context triggered piecewise
hashes for each input file, also called a fuzzy hash. If
requested, the program matches those signatures against a
file <br>
of known signatures and reports any possible matches. It can
also examine one or more files of signatures and find any
matches in those files. Output is written to standard out
<br>
and errors to standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m &lt;file&gt; <br>
Loads the specified file of known hashes to be used for
matching. This file must be a previous output of the
program. The program then hashes each entry in FILES and
com&acirc; <br>
pares these signatures to the known signatures. Any matches
which score above the threshold are displayed. This flag may
be used multiple times to load more known signa&acirc; <br>
tures. This flag may not be used with the -k or -x
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k &lt;file&gt; <br>
Load the specified file of known hashes to be used for
matching. This file must be a previous output of the
program. The program then treats each entry in FILES as a
set <br>
of known hashes as well. The hashes in these FILES are
compared to the known hashes from this file. Matches which
score above the threshold are displayed. Both the file <br>
specified here and the input FILES should contain fuzzy
hashes. This flag may be used multiple times to load more
known signatures. This flag may not be used with the <br>
-m, -d, or -p flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode. The name of
each file is printed to standard error as it is being
hashed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Computes a signature for each
entry in the FILES and compares it to the set of known
signatures. Matches which score above the threshold are
displayed. The computed signa&acirc; <br>
ture is then added to the set of known signatures. This flag
may not be used with the -k or -x flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Works like the -d flag, but
displays all matches for each file. That is, for two files A
and B which match score above the threshold, displays
&quot;A matches B&quot; and &quot;B matches <br>
A&quot;. This flag may not be used with the -k or -x
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Enables recursive mode. All
subdirectories are traversed. Please note that recursive
mode cannot be used to examine all files of a given file
extension. For example, <br>
invoking the program with -r *.txt will examine all files in
directories that end in .txt. If you want to process all
files in a directory tree with the .txt suffix, try <br>
using the find(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Similar files are grouped
together into clusters. This can be handy for finding more
similar files. That is, if you are searching for file A,
which matches B, anything <br>
which matches B will also be included in the cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Silent mode. All error
messages are suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Enables bare mode. Strips any
leading directory information from displayed filenames. This
flag may not be used in conjunction with the -l flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Enables relative file paths.
Instead of printing the absolute path for each file,
displays the relative file path as indicated on the command
line. This flag may not be <br>
used in conjunction with the -b flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Enables comma separated
output mode. In any of the matching modes -d, -p, or -m,
displays the results as input file, known file, matching
score.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Signature file matching. Each
entry in FILES must contain signatures generated by a
previous output of the program. Each signature is loaded and
compared against the set <br>
of known hashes. Match scores above the threshold are
displayed. Each signature is then added to the set of
knowns. This flag may not be used with the -m, -d, or -p
<br>
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Displays all matches in any
of the matching mode, regardless of score. Using the -a flag
displays all results, even if the match score is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t &lt;val&gt; <br>
In any of the matching modes, only display matches when
match score is greater than the given value. The default
threshold value is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show a help screen and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show the version number and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Returns 0 on success, 1 if there is a problem. Read errors,
permission denied, and encountering directories while not in
recursive mode are still considered successes. Problems <br>
are things like being unable to load the matching file,
specifying both bare and relative paths, etc.</p>
