<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdist -Server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdist -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rdist is a program to maintain identical copies of files
over multiple hosts. It preserves the owner, group, mode,
and mtime of files if possible and can update programs that
<br>
are executing. Rdist reads commands from distfile to direct
the updating of files and/or directories. If distfile is
&lsquo;-&rsquo;, the standard input is used. If no -f option
is <br>
present, the program looks first for &lsquo;distfile&rsquo;,
then &lsquo;Distfile&rsquo; to use as the input. If no names
are specified on the command line, rdist will update all of
the files and <br>
directories listed in distfile. Otherwise, the argument is
taken to be the name of a file to be updated or the label of
a command to execute. If label and file names conflict, <br>
it is assumed to be a label. These may be used together to
update specific files using specific commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option forces rdist to
interpret the remaining arguments as a small distfile. The
equivalent distfile is as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( name ... ) -&gt; [login@]host
<br>
install [dest] ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -Server option is recognized
to provide partial backward compatible support for older
versions of rdist which used this option to put rdist into
server mode. If rdist is <br>
started with the -Server command line option, it will
attempt to exec (run) the old version of rdist. This option
will only work if rdist was compiled with the location of
the <br>
old rdist (the path /usr/bin/oldrdist is used on Red Hat
linux) and that program is available at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rdist can use either the rcmd(3)
function call or run an arbitrary transport program such as
rsh(1c) to access each target host. The method used is
selected at compile-time. <br>
However, if the later method is used, the transport program
can be specified at run-time on the command line with the
default being rsh(1c). If the rsh(1c) method is used and
<br>
the target host is the string localhost and the remote user
name is the same as the local user name, rdist will run the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/bin/sh -c rdistd -S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise rdist run will run the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsh host -l remuser rdistd
-S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where host is the name of the
target host, remuser is the name of the user to make the
connection as and, rdistd is the rdist server command on the
target host as shown below. <br>
To use a transport program other than rsh(1c) use the -P
option. Whatever transport program is used, must be
compatible with the above specified syntax for rsh(1c). If
the <br>
transport program is not, it should be wrapped in a shell
script which does understand this command line syntax and
which then executes the real transport program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an example which
uses ssh(1) as the transport:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdist -P /usr/local/bin/ssh -f
myDistfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the rcmd(3) method is used,
then rdist makes the connection to the target host itself
and runs the rdistd server program as shown below. The
default, and preferred method, is <br>
to use rsh(1c) to make the connection to target hosts. This
allows rdist to be run without being setuid to
&lsquo;&lsquo;root&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On each target host Rdist will
attempt to run the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdistd -S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;rdistd path&gt; -S</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if the -p option was specified.
If no -p option is included, or the &lt;rdistd path&gt; is a
simple filename, rdistd or &lt;rdistd path&gt; must be
somewhere in the $PATH of the user run&acirc; <br>
ning rdist on the remote (target) host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-A num Set the minimum number of free files (inodes) on a
filesystem that must exist for rdist to update or install a
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a num Set the minimum amount of
free space (in bytes) on a filesystem that must exist for
rdist to update or install a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Enable copious debugging
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d var=value <br>
Define var to have value. This option is used to define or
override variable definitions in the distfile. Value can be
the empty string, one name, or a list of names <br>
surrounded by parentheses and separated by tabs and/or
spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Do not fork any child rdist
processes. All clients are updated sequentially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f distfile <br>
Set the name of the distfile to use to be distfile . If
distfile is specified as &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;
(dash) then read from standard input (stdin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logopts <br>
Set local logging options. See the section MESSAGE LOGGING
for details on the syntax for logopts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L logopts <br>
Set remote logging options. logopts is the same as for local
logging except the values are passed to the remote server
(rdistd). See the section MESSAGE LOGGING for <br>
details on the syntax for logopts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M num Set the maximum number of
simultaneously running child rdist processes to num. The
default is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m machine <br>
Limit which machines are to be updated. Multiple -m
arguments can be given to limit updates to a subset of the
hosts listed in the distfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Print the commands without
executing them. This option is useful for debugging
distfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-odistopts <br>
Specify the dist options to enable. distopts is a comma
separated list of options which are listed below. The valid
values for distopts are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verify Verify that the files are
up to date on all the hosts. Any files that are out of date
will be displayed but no files will be changed nor any mail
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whole Whole mode. The whole file
name is appended to the destination directory name.
Normally, only the last component of a name is used when
renaming files. This will <br>
preserve the directory structure of the files being copied
instead of flattening the directory structure. For example,
rdisting a list of files such as <br>
/path/dir1/f1 and /path/dir2/f2 to /tmp/dir would create
files /tmp/dir/path/dir1/f1 and /tmp/dir/path/dir2/f2
instead of /tmp/dir/dir1/f1 and /tmp/dir/dir2/f2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">noexec Automatically exclude
executable files that are in a.out(5) format from being
checked or updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">younger <br>
Younger mode. Files are normally updated if their mtime and
size (see stat(2)) disagree. This option causes rdist not to
update files that are younger than the mas&acirc; <br>
ter copy. This can be used to prevent newer copies on other
hosts from being replaced. A warning message is printed for
files which are newer than the master <br>
copy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compare <br>
Binary comparison. Perform a binary comparison and update
files if they differ rather than comparing dates and
sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">follow Follow symbolic links.
Copy the file that the link points to rather than the link
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ignlnks <br>
Ignore unresolved links. Rdist will normally try to maintain
the link structure of files being transferred and warn the
user if all the links cannot be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chknfs Do not check or update
files on target host that reside on NFS filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chkreadonly <br>
Enable check on target host to see if a file resides on a
read-only filesystem. If a file does, then no checking or
updating of the file is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chksym If the target on the
remote host is a symbolic link, but is not on the master
host, the remote target will be left a symbolic link. This
behavior is generally con&acirc; <br>
sidered a bug in the original version of rdist, but is
present to allow compatibility with older versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quiet Quiet mode. Files that are
being modified are normally printed on standard output. This
option suppresses this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove Remove extraneous files.
If a directory is being updated, any files that exist on the
remote host that do not exist in the master directory are
removed. This is <br>
useful for maintaining truly identical copies of
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochkowner <br>
Do not check user ownership of files that already exist. The
file ownership is only set when the file is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochkgroup <br>
Do not check group ownership of files that already exist.
The file ownership is only set when the file is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nochkmode <br>
Do not check file and directory permission modes. The
permission mode is only set when the file is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nodescend <br>
Do not descend into a directory. Normally rdist will
recursively check directories. If this option is enabled,
then any files listed in the file list in the dist&acirc;
<br>
file that are directories are not recursively scanned. Only
the existence, ownership, and mode of the directory are
checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numchkgroup <br>
Use the numeric group id (gid) to check group ownership
instead of the group name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">numchkowner <br>
Use the numeric user id (uid) to check user ownership
instead of the user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">savetargets <br>
Save files that are updated instead of removing them. Any
target file that is updates is first rename from file to
file.OLD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sparse Enable checking for
sparse (aka wholely) files. One of the most common types of
sparse files are those produced by ndbm(3). This option adds
some additional pro&acirc; <br>
cessing overhead so it should only be enabled for targets
likely to contain sparse files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p &lt;rdistd-path&gt; <br>
Set the path where the rdistd server is searched for on the
target host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P &lt;transport-path&gt; <br>
Set the path to the transport command to be used. This is
normally rsh(1c) but can be any other program - such as
ssh(1) - which understands rsh(1c) command line syntax <br>
and which provides an appropriate connection to the remote
host. The transport-path may be a colon seperated list of
possible pathnames. In this case, the first compo&acirc;
<br>
nent of the path to exist is used. i.e.
/usr/ucb/rsh:/usr/bin/remsh , /usr/bsd/rsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Set the timeout period (in seconds) for waiting for
responses from the remote rdist server. The default is 900
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MESSAGE LOGGING <br>
Rdist uses a collection of predefined message facilities
that each contain a list of message types specifying which
types of messages to send to that facility. The local client
<br>
(rdist) and the remote server (rdistd) each maintain their
own copy of what types of messages to log to what
facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l logopts option to rdist
tells rdist what logging options to use locally. The -L
logopts option to rdist tells rdist what logging options to
pass to the remote rdistd <br>
server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The form of logopts should be of
form</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">facility=types:facility=types...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The valid facility names
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stdout Messages to standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Log to a file. To specify
the file name, use the format
&lsquo;&lsquo;file=filename=types&rsquo;&rsquo;. e.g.
&lsquo;&lsquo;file=/tmp/rdist.log=all,debug&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">syslog Use the syslogd(8)
facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notify Use the internal rdist
notify facility. This facility is used in conjunction with
the notify keyword in a distfile to specify what messages
are mailed to the <br>
notify address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">types should be a comma
separated list of message types. Each message type specified
enables that message level. This is unlike the syslog(3)
system facility which uses an <br>
ascending order scheme. The following are the valid
types:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">change Things that change. This
includes files that are installed or updated in some
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info General information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">notice General info about things
that change. This includes things like making directories
which are needed in order to install a specific target, but
which are not <br>
explicitly specified in the distfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nerror Normal errors that are
not fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ferror Fatal errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning <br>
Warnings about errors which are not as serious as nerror
type messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">debug Debugging information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all All but debug messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a sample command line
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l
stdout=all:syslog=change,notice:file=/tmp/rdist.log=all</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This entry will set local
message logging to have all but debug messages sent to
standard output, change and notice messages will be sent to
syslog(3), and all messages will be <br>
written to the file /tmp/rdist.log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISTFILES <br>
The distfile contains a sequence of entries that specify the
files to be copied, the destination hosts, and what
operations to perform to do the updating. Each entry has one
of <br>
the following formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;variable name&gt;
&lsquo;=&rsquo; &lt;name list&gt; <br>
[ label: ] &lt;source list&gt; &lsquo;-&gt;&rsquo;
&lt;destination list&gt; &lt;command list&gt; <br>
[ label: ] &lt;source list&gt; &lsquo;::&rsquo;
&lt;time_stamp file&gt; &lt;command list&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first format is used for
defining variables. The second format is used for
distributing files to other hosts. The third format is used
for making lists of files that have <br>
been changed since some given date. The source list
specifies a list of files and/or directories on the local
host which are to be used as the master copy for
distribution. The <br>
destination list is the list of hosts to which these files
are to be copied. Each file in the source list is added to a
list of changes if the file is out of date on the host <br>
which is being updated (second format) or the file is newer
than the time stamp file (third format).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Labels are optional. They are
used to identify a command for partial updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Newlines, tabs, and blanks are
only used as separators and are otherwise ignored. Comments
begin with &lsquo;#&rsquo; and end with a newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables to be expanded begin
with &lsquo;$&rsquo; followed by one character or a name
enclosed in curly braces (see the examples at the end).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The source and destination lists
have the following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;name&gt; <br>
or <br>
&lsquo;(&rsquo; &lt;zero or more names separated by
white-space&gt; &lsquo;)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These simple lists can be
modified by using one level of set addition, subtraction, or
intersection like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">list &rsquo;-&rsquo; list <br>
or <br>
list &rsquo;+&rsquo; list <br>
or <br>
list &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If additional modifications are
needed (e.g., &lsquo;&lsquo;all servers and client machines
except for the OSF/1 machines&rsquo;&rsquo;) then the list
will have to be explicitly constructed in steps <br>
using &quot;temporary&quot; variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell meta-characters
&lsquo;[&rsquo;, &lsquo;]&rsquo;, &lsquo;{&rsquo;,
&lsquo;}&rsquo;, &lsquo;*&rsquo;, and &lsquo;?&rsquo; are
recognized and expanded (on the local host only) in the same
way as csh(1). They can be escaped with a backslash. <br>
The &lsquo;~&rsquo; character is also expanded in the same
way as csh but is expanded separately on the local and
destination hosts. When the -owhole option is used with a
file name that <br>
begins with &lsquo;~&rsquo;, everything except the home
directory is appended to the destination name. File names
which do not begin with &lsquo;/&rsquo; or &lsquo;~&rsquo;
use the destination user&rsquo;s home direc&acirc; <br>
tory as the root directory for the rest of the file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command list consists of
zero or more commands of the following format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;install&rsquo;
&lt;options&gt; opt_dest_name &lsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;notify&rsquo; &lt;name list&gt; &lsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;except&rsquo; &lt;name list&gt; &lsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;except_pat&rsquo; &lt;pattern list&gt;&lsquo;;&rsquo;
<br>
&lsquo;special&rsquo; &lt;name list&gt; string
&lsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;cmdspecial&rsquo; &lt;name list&gt; string
&lsquo;;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The install command is used to
copy out of date files and/or directories. Each source file
is copied to each host in the destination list. Directories
are recursively copied in <br>
the same way. Opt_dest_name is an optional parameter to
rename files. If no install command appears in the command
list or the destination name is not specified, the source
<br>
file name is used. Directories in the path name will be
created if they do not exist on the remote host. The -o
distopts option as specified above under OPTIONS, has the
same <br>
semantics as on the command line except they only apply to
the files in the source list. The login name used on the
destination host is the same as the local host unless the
<br>
destination name is of the format
&lsquo;&lsquo;login@host&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The notify command is used to
mail the list of files updated (and any errors that may have
occurred) to the listed names. If no &lsquo;@&rsquo; appears
in the name, the destination host is <br>
appended to the name (e.g., name1@host, name2@host,
...).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The except command is used to
update all of the files in the source list except for the
files listed in name list. This is usually used to copy
everything in a directory except <br>
certain files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The except_pat command is like
the except command except that pattern list is a list of
regular expressions (see ed(1) for details). If one of the
patterns matches some string <br>
within a file name, that file will be ignored. Note that
since &lsquo;&acute; is a quote character, it must be
doubled to become part of the regular expression. Variables
are expanded in <br>
pattern list but not shell file pattern matching characters.
To include a &lsquo;$&rsquo;, it must be escaped with
&lsquo;&acute;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special command is used to
specify sh(1) commands that are to be executed on the remote
host after the file in name list is updated or installed. If
the name list is omitted <br>
then the shell commands will be executed for every file
updated or installed. String starts and ends with
&lsquo;&quot;&rsquo; and can cross multiple lines in
distfile. Multiple commands to the <br>
shell should be separated by &lsquo;;&rsquo;. Commands are
executed in the user&rsquo;s home directory on the host
being updated. The special command can be used to rebuild
private databases, <br>
etc. after a program has been updated. The following
environment variables are set for each special command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE The full pathname of the
local file that was just updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMFILE <br>
The full pathname of the remote file that was just
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASEFILE <br>
The basename of the remote file that was just updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cmdspecial command is
similar to the special command, except it is executed only
when the entire command is completed instead of after each
file is updated. The list of <br>
files is placed in the environment variable $FILES. Each
file name in $FILES is separated by a &lsquo;:&rsquo;
(colon).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a hostname ends in a
&lsquo;&lsquo;+&rsquo;&rsquo; (plus sign), then the plus is
stripped off and NFS checks are disabled. This is equivalent
to disabling the -ochknfs option just for this one host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is a small
example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTS = ( matisse root@arpa)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES = ( /bin /lib /usr/bin
/usr/games <br>
/usr/include/{*.h,{stand,sys,vax*,pascal,machine}/*.h} <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXLIB = ( Mail.rc aliases

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${FILES} -&gt; ${HOSTS} <br>

install /usr/local/lib ; <br>
notify ralph ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${FILES} :: stamp.cory <br>
notify root@cory ;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
TMPDIR Name of temporary directory to use. Default is
/tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
distfile - input command file <br>
$TMPDIR/rdist* - temporary file for update lists</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
sh(1), csh(1), stat(2), rsh(1c), rcmd(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS NOTES <br>
If the basename of a file (the last component in the
pathname) is &quot;.&quot;, then rdist assumes the remote
(destination) name is a directory. i.e. /tmp/. means that
/tmp should be <br>
a directory on the remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are still
recognized for backwards compatibility:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v -N -O -q -b -r -R -s -w -y -h
-i -x</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Source files must reside on the local host where rdist is
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable expansion only works
for name lists; there should be a general macro
facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rdist aborts on files which have
