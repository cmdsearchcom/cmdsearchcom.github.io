<p>CRICKET(1) General Commands Manual CRICKET(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cricket - A program to manage the collection and display of
time-series data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cricket-compile <br>
/usr/share/cricket/collector <br>
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/cricket/grapher.cgi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the programs associated
with Cricket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cricket-compile <br>
The cricket-compile program compiles the Cricket config tree
(found in /etc/cricket) into the format read by the
collector. It is normally run after editing the files in
<br>
the config tree. No options are needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">collector <br>
The collector program reads a Cricket configuration from
/etc/cricket, compiled by the cricket-compile command, and
collects and stores data according to the information <br>
found there. It is normally run periodically from a cron(8)
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grapher.cgi <br>
grapher.cgi is a CGI program to display the data collected
by Cricket in a graphical format. It is usually accessed
using a web browser, e.g. using the URL http://local&acirc;
<br>
host/cgi-bin/cricket/grapher.cgi. It will allow you to
navigate around all of the targets in the config tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page was written for
the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original
program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has
documentation in the HTML format; <br>
see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The programs are documented fully by various HTML documents
available via the help system, or directly in
/usr/share/doc/cricket. <br>
dhelp(1), dwww(1), cron(8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
This manual page was written by Matt Zimmerman
&lt;mdz@debian.org&gt;, for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but
may be used by others).</p>
