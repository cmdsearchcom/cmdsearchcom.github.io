<p>isdnrep(1) Linux System Commands isdnrep(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
isdnrep - report ISDN activity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Isdnrep reads the isdnlog log files, generates reports, does
statistics, and other things. It can also generate HTML
output for use with a web server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-V show version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a all <br>
Show all connections registered. If this option is not
given, show only the connections made today.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Summary <br>
Show a summary (no individual calls) for selected date
range. If this option is given twice, the summaries per day
are hidden too. Don&rsquo;t use with -h</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h no header <br>
There will be no header for each day, nor will the summary
at the end of each day and at the end of the report be
generated. This is useful if the output is to be pro&acirc;
<br>
cessed by another program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option doesn&rsquo;t work
if the -wX is also given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n numbers <br>
Display numbers instead of the aliases for those
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fFILE The file from which to
generate the report. This is usually /var/log/isdn.log, or
whatever is configured in /etc/isdn/isdn.conf as LOGFILE = .
The -f option will override <br>
the setting in /etc/isdn/isdn.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t time span time=&quot;time
span&quot; <br>
With this option a specific time span covered by the log
file can be displayed, e.g. all calls in November 1995, or
on January 3rd 1996 between 03:00 and 09:45.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format in which times are
given is described below. The time span has the following
syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">time-time display from begin
time up to end time <br>
time- display from given time up to &quot;now&quot; <br>
-time display from beginning of log file up to given time
<br>
time display the given month, day, hour, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d -time delete=&quot;time&quot;
<br>
Delete entries from the log file up to (but not including)
the specified time. The format is the same as for the -t
option. The minus before the time must be given! It is <br>
not possible to define begin and end times; entries are
always deleted from the beginning up to the time given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning! Entries are really
deleted from the file. Careless use can result in all
entries being deleted, e.g. with &quot;isdnrep -d
-&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E print Errors <br>
Display all connections and connection attempts. Without
this option, only successful connections are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v verbose <br>
Display warnings on start-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c ignore default options <br>
Do not append the &quot;REPOPTIONS&quot; setting from
/etc/isdn/isdn.conf to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p
[n][m]&rsquo;number&rsquo;[,[m]&rsquo;number&rsquo;...]
phonenumber <br>
Display only selected phone numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;number&quot; is specified
in the same format as in configuration files (see
isdn.conf(5)). E.g. wildcards can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the flag &rsquo;m&rsquo; is
given, the corresponding MSN is meant. E.g.: &quot;m2&quot;
means MSN#2. If &quot;m0&quot; is given, all numbers are to
be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the flag &rsquo;n&rsquo; is
given, the given number is not to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U [_][.]&rsquo;number&rsquo;
default source number <br>
Use &rsquo;number&rsquo; as source number for outgoing calls
with an unknown source number (&quot;?&quot;).
&rsquo;.&rsquo; is replaced by country and area code from
isdn.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &rsquo;_&rsquo; the default
source number is used internally (e.g. for fetching the
right zone names from the ratefile) but it is not
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i incoming <br>
Only incoming connections are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outgoing <br>
Only outgoing connections are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xX include/exclude calls <br>
Select calls by day and/or hour. The following selections
are possible and can specified in any combination and
quantity using : as separator: <br>
ddaylist <br>
only days matching daylist <br>
Ddaylist <br>
all days not matching daylist <br>
htimelist <br>
only hours matching timelist <br>
Htimelist <br>
all hours not matching timelist</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daylist and timelist have the
same syntax as described in rate-files(5). If a day or an
hour is included and excluded it will be excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xd2-4:DH:h9-17:H12-15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will display all calls on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays that are not holidays
with a start time between 09:00 and 12:00 or 15:00 and
17:00.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u unknown caller <br>
At the end of the report, all numbers not aliased in
callerid.conf or ~/.isdn are displayed. This option is
unavailable when HTML output is requested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-LX summary lists <br>
Select the summaries in the footer by any combination of the
following letters: <br>
i,I foreign numbers of incoming calls <br>
o,O foreign numbers of outgoing calls <br>
c,C foreign numbers of all calls <br>
z,Z zones of outgoing calls <br>
p,P providers of outgoing calls <br>
m,M MSNs (own subscriber numbers) of outgoing calls</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upper case letters deselect,
lower case letters select a summary. With at least one lower
case letter, only the selected summaries are shown, as long
as they are not also dese&acirc; <br>
lected. -LiI for example will show no summary at all. Per
default all summaries are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rPROV recompute <br>
Recompute the connection fees with the current ratefile
instead of showing the amounts stored in the logfile as
usual. The provider PROV for recomputation is selected in
<br>
one of the following ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Use the logged provider. <br>
pNUM Use provider with Pnum NUM (according to P: tag in
ratefile). The provider variant is taken from rate.conf
where the provider must be enabled. <br>
pNUM_VAR Use provider with Pnum NUM and variant VAR
(according to P:NUM,VAR in ratefile). No requirements for
rate.conf. <br>
vVBN <br>
vVBN_VAR Similar to pNUM[_VAR] but the provider is selected
via VBN (B: tag in ratefile) instead of Pnum. <br>
b Use the cheapest of all booked providers. The provider
selection is done per call. Booked providers are those,
which are enabled in rate.conf <br>
B Like b but allow all providers, not only the booked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m[*|/]number modify call costs
<br>
Multiply (*) or divide (/) the stored or recalculated call
costs by number before displaying them. If neither * nor /
is given, multiply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wX WWW <br>
isdnrep can give its output in HTML format; this is switched
on with this option. Two modes are possible:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The HTML header is suppressed.
Useful if the output is to be included into an existing
page. <br>
1 A complete HTML page is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sX format string <br>
The output generated by isdnrep can be modified by
specifying the format of the line generated for each
connection. The syntax is similar to that used by printf.
The fol&acirc; <br>
lowing parameters are possible (the x where given means that
a width for the field, also known as the precision, must be
given):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%X time without date, e.g.
23:54:06 <br>
%x the date, e.g. 25/07/97 <br>
%y date without year, e.g. Sun May 04 <br>
%Y year, in four digits, e.g. 1997 <br>
%D duration of connection, e.g. 00:03:34 <br>
%xH the local MSN; if an alias can be found, that will be
displayed instead <br>
%xh the local MSN, only as a number; no aliases will be
substituted <br>
%xF the remote number; if an alias can be found, that will
be displayed instead <br>
%xf the remote number, only as a number; no aliases will be
substituted <br>
%xL the town corresponding to the local MSN if known; an
empty string otherwise <br>
%xl the town corresponding to the remote number if known; an
empty string otherwise <br>
%T an arrow indicating the direction of the connection
(&quot;-&gt;&quot; outgoing or &quot;&lt;-&quot; incoming);
the local MSN should be displayed on the left side of this.
<br>
%t an arrow indicating the direction of the connection,
reversed (&quot;&lt;-&quot; outgoing or &quot;-&gt;&quot;
incoming); the local MSN should be displayed on the right
side of this. <br>
%xu the charge units, if known, e.g. 6 EH <br>
%U the cost, if known, e.g. 2,28 DM <br>
%xj the name of the used provider <br>
%v the VBN (carrier selection prefix) of the provider, e.g.
01012 <br>
%V the VBN and variant of the provider, e.g. 01012_3 <br>
%I amount of INPUT data <br>
%O amount of OUTPUT data <br>
%P INPUT throughput (bps) <br>
%p OUTPUT throughput (bps) <br>
%S Service Indicator <br>
%G displays a HTTP link to the corresponding fax, when a fax
was received by mgetty. This fax can be displayed by using
the link in a HTTP browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only valid when
used with -wx, see below for more information. <br>
%C displays a HTTP link to the corresponding voice file,
when a call was recorded by vbox. This option is only valid
when used with -wx, see below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default format string for
(non-HTML output) is <br>
&quot; %X %D %15.15H %T %-15.15F %7u %U %I %O&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the following string all
the important data is displayed while keeping the total
length to 80:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%X%D %10.10H%T%-14.14F%U%I
%O&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above string is put into
isdn.conf at installation as REPFMTSHORT and can be used
with -Fshort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without showing the transferred
bytes, this string also fits into 80 chars:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; %X %D %16.16H %T %-25.25F
%U&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is included as REPFMTNIO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FX format <br>
format strings can be specified in isdn.conf; this option is
used to select one of these. Entries can be defined in the
section [ISDNLOG] with names beginning with <br>
&quot;REPFMT&quot;. The string after the -F option is added
to REPFMT to find the correct entry. Case is not sensitive.
E.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPFMT1 = ... # -&gt; isdnrep
-F1 <br>
REPFMTMYSTRING = ... # -&gt; isdnrep -Fmystring or <br>
isdnrep -F MYSTRING</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML USE <br>
isdnrep can generate a HTML page containing links to files
generated by vbox and mgetty (faxes), so that the messages
and faxes can be heard or seen from within a browser.
How&acirc; <br>
ever, a couple of things need to be configured first.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">_______answering_machine_messages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The %C can be used in the
isdnrep output format to make a link to a voice recording
file. For this to work, the following entry is needed in the
[ISDNLOG] section in isdn.conf:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VBOXPATH=
/var/spool/vbox/fred/incoming # incoming directory
pathname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now isdnrep can find the file
correctly. Clicking on this link will cause the file to be
sent. These files are in ZyXEL format; the browser cannot
use these directly. The type is <br>
given by isdnrep as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Content-Type:
application/x-zyxel4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The correct application (helper)
for this has to be configured in the browser. Alternatively,
a conversion program can be specified to isdnrep which will
convert the ZyXEL for&acirc; <br>
mat. The pathname of the file to convert is given as a
parameter to the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the [ISDNLOG] section of
isdn.conf an entry as follows specifies which conversion
program to use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VBOXCMD1 = /usr/bin/program1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for versions 0.x and 1.x of
vbox, and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VBOXCMD2 = /usr/bin/program2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for versions 2.x of vbox. Both
entries can be given, isdnrep recognizes which version
created the recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program must first output a
line with the content-type, followed by the data itself. To
convert the ZyXEL format into a WAV file, the following
script may be used: <br>
#! /bin/sh <br>
## <br>
## script to play voice messages from vbox-2.0 <br>
## <br>
## WARNING! If the paths are not set correctly, <br>
## netscape may simply crash!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH=$PATH:&quot;path to
sox&quot;:&quot;path to pvftools&quot;:&quot;path to
vbox&quot; <br>
FILENAME1=/tmp/voxplay.$$.voc <br>
FILENAME2=/tmp/voxplay.$$.wav <br>
VOLUME=8</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vboxtoau &lt;$1 | autopvf |
pvfamp $VOLUME | pvfcut 0.20 | pvftovoc &gt; $FILENAME1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sox $FILENAME1 $FILENAME2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo Content-Type: audio/x-wav
<br>
echo <br>
cat $FILENAME2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rm -f $FILENAME1 $FILENAME2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script above needs the
packages sox and pvftools. Additionally, the browser needs
to be told how to handle &quot;audio/x-wav&quot;. This is
done by adding the following lines to the <br>
files listed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.mime.types <br>
type=audio/x-wav desc=&quot;auWAV Audio&quot;
exts=&quot;wav&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.mailcap <br>
audio/x-wav;/usr/bin/auplay %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The NAS (Network Audio System)
package may be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, when the browser is
started, it will recognize WAV files and start the
corresponding program to handle them. The WAV format has
been chosen as it can also be played from a <br>
Windows PC.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">_______faxes_received_by_mgetty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When %G is used in the isdnrep
output format, any faxes received by mgetty will be
accessible via a HTML link, in the same manner as the
answering machine messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the faxes the following
entry in the [ISDNLOG] section in isdn.conf is needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MGETTYPATH =
/var/spool/fax/incoming</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: if isdnrep
doesn&rsquo;t have permission to read the files, they will
not be displayed; there will be no error message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When isdnrep passes these files
back to the browser, they have the G3 format. The following
header is used to notify the browser of this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Content-Type:
application/x-faxg3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the browser probably
doesn&rsquo;t understand this format, the following changes
to the files listed are needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.mime.types <br>
type=application/x-faxg3 desc=&quot;G3-Fax Format&quot;
exts=&quot;fax,g3&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.mailcap <br>
pplication/x-faxg3;/usr/X11/bin/g3view %s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program g3view has to be
installed for this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If now the link is clicked on,
the browser will automatically start the external g3view to
handle this data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you prefer another format
(instead of G3) such as JPEG, the format has to be
converted. The following entry in the [ISDNLOG] section of
isdn.conf takes care of this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VBOXCMD = /usr/bin/g3tojpeg #
example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The script g3tojpeg can be
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/sh <br>
## <br>
## command to display faxes in a browser <br>
## <br>
## WARNING! If the paths are not set correctly, <br>
## netscape may simply crash!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export PATH=$PATH:&quot;path to
g3topbm&quot;:&quot;path to convert&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo Content-Type: image/jpeg
<br>
echo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g3topbm &lt; $1 | convert pbm:-
jpeg:-</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The packages ImageMagick and
mgetty are needed. Mgetty is probably already installed if
you want to use this feature :-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The advantage of the JPEG format
is that it can also be displayed by a browser running on a
Windows PC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">_______summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A suitable value for REPFMTWWW
is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPFMTWWW = &quot;%X %D %17.17H
%T %-17.17F %-20.20l SI: %S %9u %U %I %O %G %C&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Netscape 3.0 Gold and Arena have
been tested, and both work fine with isdnrep&rsquo;s HTML
output, although Arena&rsquo;s display is not as colourful
as Netscape&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A known problem (which is
impossible to solve completely) is determining the
relationship between an isdn connection and a fax or vbox
recording. Unfortunately the times for <br>
isdnrep, mgetty and vbox differ. Isdnrep tries to make the
best guess, but it&rsquo;s always possible that e.g. a fax
is connected to the wrong isdn connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE OUTPUT <br>
With the default configuration the following output can be
generated on stdout (whitespace slightly edited for
clarity):</p>
