<p>fakeroot(1) Debian manual fakeroot(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fakeroot - run a command in an environment faking root
privileges for file manipulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fakeroot [-l|--lib library] [--faked faked-binary] [-i
load-file] [-s save-file] [-u|--unknown-is-real ]
[-b|--fd-base ] [-h|--help ] [-v|--version ] [--]
[command]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears
to have root privileges for file manipulation. This is
useful for allowing users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb
<br>
etc.) with files in them with root permissions/ownership.
Without fakeroot one would need to have root privileges to
create the constituent files of the archives with the
cor&acirc; <br>
rect permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or
one would have to construct the archives directly, without
using the archiver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fakeroot works by replacing the
file manipulation library functions (chmod(2), stat(2) etc.)
by ones that simulate the effect the real library functions
would have had, had the <br>
user really been root. These wrapper functions are in a
shared library /usr/lib/*/libfakeroot-*.so or similar
location on your platform. The shared object is loaded
through the <br>
LD_PRELOAD mechanism of the dynamic loader. (See
ld.so(8))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you intend to build packages
with fakeroot, please try building the fakeroot package
first: the &quot;debian/rules build&quot; stage has a few
tests (testing mostly for bugs in old <br>
fakeroot versions). If those tests fail (for example because
you have certain libc5 programs on your system), other
packages you build with fakeroot will quite likely fail too,
<br>
but possibly in much more subtle ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, note that it&rsquo;s best
not to do the building of the binaries themselves under
fakeroot. Especially configure and friends don&rsquo;t like
it when the system suddenly behaves dif&acirc; <br>
ferently from what they expect. (or, they randomly unset
some environment variables, some of which fakeroot
needs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-l library, --lib library <br>
Specify an alternative wrapper library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--faked binary <br>
Specify an alternative binary to use as faked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[--] command <br>
Any command you want to be ran as fakeroot. Use
&acirc;--&acirc; if in the command you have other options
that may confuse fakeroot&rsquo;s option parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s save-file <br>
Save the fakeroot environment to save-file on exit. This
file can be used to restore the environment later using -i.
However, this file will leak and fakeroot will behave <br>
in odd ways unless you leave the files touched inside the
fakeroot alone when outside the environment. Still, this can
be useful. For example, it can be used with rsync(1) <br>
to back up and restore whole directory trees complete with
user, group and device information without needing to be
root. See /usr/share/doc/fakeroot/README.saving for <br>
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i load-file <br>
Load a fakeroot environment previously saved using -s from
load-file. Note that this does not implicitly save the file,
use -s as well for that behaviour. Using the same <br>
file for both -i and -s in a single fakeroot invocation is
safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unknown-is-real <br>
Use the real ownership of files previously unknown to
fakeroot instead of pretending they are owned by
root:root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b fd Specify fd base (TCP mode
only). fd is the minimum file descriptor number to use for
TCP connections; this may be important to avoid conflicts
with the file descriptors <br>
used by the programs being run under fakeroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Here is an example session with fakeroot. Notice that inside
the fake root environment file manipulation that requires
root privileges succeeds, but is not really happening.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ whoami <br>
joost <br>
$ fakeroot /bin/bash <br>
# whoami <br>
root <br>
# mknod hda3 b 3 1 <br>
# ls -ld hda3 <br>
brw-r--r-- 1 root root 3, 1 Jul 2 22:58 hda3 <br>
# chown joost:root hda3 <br>
# ls -ld hda3 <br>
brw-r--r-- 1 joost root 3, 1 Jul 2 22:58 hda3 <br>
# ls -ld / <br>
drwxr-xr-x 20 root root 1024 Jun 17 21:50 / <br>
# chown joost:users / <br>
# chmod a+w / <br>
# ls -ld / <br>
drwxrwxrwx 20 joost users 1024 Jun 17 21:50 / <br>
# exit <br>
$ ls -ld / <br>
drwxr-xr-x 20 root root 1024 Jun 17 21:50 // <br>
$ ls -ld hda3 <br>
-rw-r--r-- 1 joost users 0 Jul 2 22:58 hda3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only the effects that user joost
could do anyway happen for real.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fakeroot was specifically
written to enable users to create Debian GNU/Linux packages
(in the deb(5) format) without giving them root privileges.
This can be done by commands <br>
like dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot or debuild -rfakeroot
(actually, -rfakeroot is default in debuild nowadays, so you
don&rsquo;t need that argument).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY ASPECTS <br>
fakeroot is a regular, non-setuid program. It does not
enhance a user&rsquo;s privileges, or decrease the
system&rsquo;s security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/usr/lib/*/libfakeroot-*.so The shared library containing
the wrapper functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
FAKEROOTKEY <br>
The key used to communicate with the fakeroot daemon. Any
program started with the right LD_PRELOAD and a FAKEROOTKEY
of a running daemon will automatically connect to <br>
that daemon, and have the same &quot;fake&quot; view of the
file system&rsquo;s permissions/ownerships. (assuming the
daemon and connecting program were started by the same
user).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LD_PRELOAD <br>
Fakeroot is implemented by wrapping system calls. This is
accomplished by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/fakeroot
and LD_PRELOAD=libfakeroot.so.0. That library is <br>
loaded before the system&rsquo;s C library, and so most of
the library functions are intercepted by it. If you need to
set either LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD from within a <br>
fakeroot environment, it should be set relative to the given
paths, as in LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/foo/bar/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Library versions <br>
Every command executed within fakeroot needs to be linked to
the same version of the C library as fakeroot itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open()/create() <br>
fakeroot doesn&rsquo;t wrap open(), create(), etc. So, if
user joost does either</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">touch foo <br>
fakeroot <br>
ls -al foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or the other way around,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fakeroot <br>
touch foo <br>
ls -al foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fakeroot has no way of knowing
that in the first case, the owner of foo really should be
joost while the second case it should have been root. For
the Debian packaging, <br>
defaulting to giving all &quot;unknown&quot; files
uid=gid=0, is always OK. The real way around this is to wrap
open() and create(), but that creates other problems, as
demonstrated <br>
by the libtricks package. This package wrapped many more
functions, and tried to do a lot more than fakeroot . It
turned out that a minor upgrade of libc (from one where <br>
the stat() function didn&rsquo;t use open() to one with a
stat() function that did (in some cases) use open()), would
cause unexplainable segfaults (that is, the libc6 stat()
<br>
called the wrapped open(), which would then call the libc6
stat(), etc). Fixing them wasn&rsquo;t all that easy, but
once fixed, it was just a matter of time before another <br>
function started to use open(), never mind trying to port it
to a different operating system. Thus I decided to keep the
number of functions wrapped by fakeroot as small <br>
as possible, to limit the likelihood of
&acirc;collisions&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU configure (and other such
programs) <br>
fakeroot, in effect, is changing the way the system behaves.
Programs that probe the system like GNU configure may get
confused by this (or if they don&rsquo;t, they may stress
<br>
fakeroot so much that fakeroot itself becomes confused). So,
it&rsquo;s advisable not to run &quot;configure&quot; from
within fakeroot. As configure should be called in the
&quot;debian/rules <br>
build&quot; target, running &quot;dpkg-buildpackage
-rfakeroot&quot; correctly takes care of this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
It doesn&rsquo;t wrap open(). This isn&rsquo;t bad by
itself, but if a program does open(&quot;file&quot;,
O_WRONLY, 000), writes to file &quot;file&quot;, closes it,
and then again tries to open to read the <br>
file, then that open fails, as the mode of the file will be
000. The bug is that if root does the same, open() will
succeed, as the file permissions aren&rsquo;t checked at all
for <br>
root. I choose not to wrap open(), as open() is used by many
other functions in libc (also those that are already
wrapped), thus creating loops (or possible future loops,
when <br>
the implementation of various libc functions slightly
change).</p>
