<p>PERLRECHARCLASS(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLRECHARCLASS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlrecharclass - Perl Regular Expression Character
Classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The top level documentation about Perl regular expressions
is found in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page discusses the
syntax and use of character classes in Perl regular
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A character class is a way of
denoting a set of characters in such a way that one
character of the set is matched. It&rsquo;s important to
remember that: matching a character class <br>
consumes exactly one character in the source string. (The
source string is the string the regular expression is
matched against.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three types of
character classes in Perl regular expressions: the dot,
backslash sequences, and the form enclosed in square
brackets. Keep in mind, though, that often <br>
the term &quot;character class&quot; is used to mean just
the bracketed form. Certainly, most Perl documentation does
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dot <br>
The dot (or period), &quot;.&quot; is probably the most
used, and certainly the most well-known character class. By
default, a dot matches any character, except for the
newline. That <br>
default can be changed to add matching the newline by using
the single line modifier: either for the entire regular
expression with the &quot;/s&quot; modifier, or locally with
&quot;(?s)&quot;. <br>
(The experimental &quot;ackslash sequence, described below,
matches any character except newline without regard to the
single line modifier.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a&quot; =~ /./ # Match
<br>
&quot;.&quot; =~ /./ # Match <br>
&quot;&quot; =~ /./ # No match (dot has to match a
character) <br>
&quot;0 =~ /./ # No match (dot does not match a newline)
<br>
&quot;0 =~ /./s # Match (global &rsquo;single line&rsquo;
modifier) <br>
&quot;0 =~ /(?s:.)/ # Match (local &rsquo;single line&rsquo;
modifier) <br>
&quot;ab&quot; =~ /^.$/ # No match (dot matches one
character)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backslash sequences <br>
A backslash sequence is a sequence of characters, the first
one of which is a backslash. Perl ascribes special meaning
to many such sequences, and some of these are character <br>
classes. That is, they match a single character each,
provided that the character belongs to the specific set of
characters defined by the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a list of the
backslash sequences that are character classes. They are
discussed in more detail below. (For the backslash sequences
that aren&rsquo;t character classes, see <br>
perlrebackslash.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Match a decimal digit character.
<br>
Match a non-decimal-digit character. <br>
0 Match a &quot;word&quot; character. <br>
W Match a non-&quot;word&quot; character. <br>
Match a whitespace character. <br>
Match a non-whitespace character. <br>
Match a horizontal whitespace character. <br>
Match a character that isn&rsquo;t horizontal whitespace.
<br>
Match a vertical whitespace character. <br>
Match a character that isn&rsquo;t vertical whitespace. <br>
Match a character that isn&rsquo;t a newline. Experimental.
<br>
P, {Prop} Match a character that has the given Unicode
property. <br>
PP, P{Prop} Match a character that doesn&rsquo;t have the
Unicode property</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;s new in 5.12, and is
experimental. It, like the dot, matches any character that
is not a newline. The difference is that &quot;s not
influenced by the single line regular <br>
expression modifier (see &quot;The dot&quot; above). Note
that the form &quot; may mean something completely
different. When the &quot;{...}&quot; is a quantifier, it
means to match a non- <br>
newline character that many times. For example,
&quot;&quot; means to match 3 non-newlines; &quot;}&quot;
means to match 5 or more non-newlines. But if
&quot;{...}&quot; is not a legal quantifier, <br>
it is presumed to be a named character. See charnames for
those. For example, none of &quot;OLON}&quot;,
&quot;}&quot;, and &quot;4}&quot; contain legal
quantifiers, so Perl will try to find <br>
characters whose names are respectively &quot;COLON&quot;,
&quot;4F&quot;, and &quot;F4&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Digits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;&quot; matches a single
character considered to be a decimal digit. If the
&quot;/a&quot; regular expression modifier is in effect, it
matches [0-9]. Otherwise, it matches anything that is <br>
matched by &quot;{Digit}&quot;, which includes [0-9]. (An
unlikely possible exception is that under locale matching
rules, the current locale might not have [0-9] matched by
&quot;&quot;, <br>
and/or might match other characters whose code point is less
than 256. Such a locale definition would be in violation of
the C language standard, but Perl doesn&rsquo;t currently
<br>
assume anything in regard to this.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What this means is that unless
the &quot;/a&quot; modifier is in effect &quot;&quot; not
only matches the digits &rsquo;0&rsquo; - &rsquo;9&rsquo;,
but also Arabic, Devanagari, and digits from other
languages. This may <br>
cause some confusion, and some security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some digits that &quot;&quot;
matches look like some of the [0-9] ones, but have different
values. For example, BENGALI DIGIT FOUR (U+09EA) looks very
much like an ASCII DIGIT EIGHT <br>
(U+0038). An application that is expecting only the ASCII
digits might be misled, or if the match is &quot;+&quot;,
the matched string might contain a mixture of digits from
different <br>
writing systems that look like they signify a number
different than they actually do. &quot;num()&quot; in
Unicode::UCD can be used to safely calculate the value,
returning &quot;undef&quot; if the <br>
input string contains such a mixture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What &quot;{Digit}&quot; means
(and hence &quot;&quot; except under the &quot;/a&quot;
modifier) is &quot;{General_Category=Decimal_Number}&quot;,
or synonymously, &quot;{General_Category=Digit}&quot;.
Starting with <br>
Unicode version 4.1, this is the same set of characters
matched by &quot;{Numeric_Type=Decimal}&quot;. But Unicode
also has a different property with a similar name, <br>
&quot;{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;, which matches a completely
different set of characters. These characters are things
such as &quot;CIRCLED DIGIT ONE&quot; or subscripts, or are
from writing <br>
systems that lack all ten digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The design intent is for
&quot;&quot; to exactly match the set of characters that can
safely be used with &quot;normal&quot; big-endian positional
decimal syntax, where, for example 123 means one <br>
&rsquo;hundred&rsquo;, plus two &rsquo;tens&rsquo;, plus
three &rsquo;ones&rsquo;. This positional notation does not
necessarily apply to characters that match the other type of
&quot;digit&quot;, &quot;{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;, <br>
and so &quot;&quot; doesn&rsquo;t match them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tamil digits (U+0BE6 -
U+0BEF) can also legally be used in old-style Tamil numbers
in which they would appear no more than one in a row,
separated by characters that mean <br>
&quot;times 10&quot;, &quot;times 100&quot;, etc. (See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21&gt;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any character not matched by
&quot;&quot; is matched by &quot; <br>
Word characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;3576_&quot;). It does
not <br>
match a whole word. To match a whole word, use &quot;2808
<br>
identifier characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier
is in effect ... <br>
&quot;960</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise ... <br>
For code points above 255 ... <br>
&quot;504{Word}&quot; matches in this range. That is, it
matches Thai letters, Greek letters, etc. This includes
connector punctuation (like the <br>
underscore) which connect two words together, or diacritics,
such as a &quot;COMBINING TILDE&quot; and the modifier
letters, which are generally used to add auxiliary markings
to <br>
letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For code points below 256 ...
<br>
if locale rules are in effect ... <br>
&quot;2544</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if Unicode rules are in effect
or if on an EBCDIC platform ... <br>
&quot;528{Word}&quot; matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise ... <br>
&quot;528</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which rules apply are determined
as described in &quot;Which character set modifier is in
effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of security
issues with the full Unicode list of word characters. See
&lt;http://unicode.org/reports/tr36&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, for a somewhat
finer-grained set of characters that are in programming
language identifiers beyond the ASCII range, you may wish to
instead use the more customized &quot;Unicode <br>
Properties&quot;, &quot;{ID_Start}&quot;,
&quot;{ID_Continue}&quot;, &quot;{XID_Start}&quot;, and
&quot;{XID_Continue}&quot;. See
&lt;http://unicode.org/reports/tr31&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any character not matched by
&quot;360W&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;atches any single
character considered whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier
is in effect ... ]; that is, the <br>
&quot;atches the 5 characters [0f horizontal tab, the
newline, the form feed, the carriage return, and the space.
(Note that it doesn&rsquo;t match the <br>
vertical tab, &quot; <br>
otherwise ... <br>
For code points above 255 ... <br>
&quot;atches exactly the code points above 255 shown with an
&quot;s&quot; column in the table below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For code points below 256 ...
<br>
if locale rules are in effect ... <br>
&quot;atches whatever the locale considers to be whitespace.
Note that this is likely to include the vertical space,
unlike non-locale &quot;atching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if Unicode rules are in effect
or if on an EBCDIC platform ... <br>
&quot;atches exactly the characters shown with an
&quot;s&quot; column in the table below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise ... ]. Note that this
list doesn&rsquo;t <br>
&quot;atches [0f include the non-breaking space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which rules apply are determined
as described in &quot;Which character set modifier is in
effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any character not matched by
&quot;s matched by &quot; <br>

this includes the platform&rsquo;s space and tab characters
and several others listed in the table below. &quot;atches
any <br>
character not considered horizontal whitespace. They use the
platform&rsquo;s native character set, and do not consider
any locale that may otherwise be in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;atches any character
considered vertical whitespace; this includes the
platform&rsquo;s carriage return and line feed characters
(newline) plus several other characters, all <br>
listed in the table below. &quot; matches any character not

platform&rsquo;s native character set, and do not consider
any locale that may <br>
otherwise be in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;nything that can be
considered a newline under Unicode rules. It&rsquo;s not a
character class, as it can match a multi-character sequence.
Therefore, it cannot be used <br>
inside a bracketed character class; use &quot;nstead
(vertical whitespace). It uses the platform&rsquo;s native
character set, and does not consider any locale that may
otherwise be <br>
in use. Details are discussed in perlrebackslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unlike &quot;nd

active locale or whether the source string <br>

equivalent to &quot;[ This is not true. The difference is
that the vertical tab (&quot;b&quot;) is not matched by

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode Properties</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;P&quot; and
&quot;{Prop}&quot; are character classes to match characters
that fit given Unicode properties. One letter property names
can be used in the &quot;P&quot; form, with the property
name <br>
following the &quot;&quot;, otherwise, braces are required.
When using braces, there is a single form, which is just the
property name enclosed in the braces, and a compound form
which <br>
looks like &quot;{name=value}&quot;, which means to match if
the property &quot;name&quot; for the character has that
particular &quot;value&quot;. For instance, a match for a
number can be written as <br>
&quot;/N/&quot; or as &quot;/{Number}/&quot;, or as
&quot;/{Number=True}/&quot;. Lowercase letters are matched
by the property Lowercase_Letter which has the short form
Ll. They need the braces, so are <br>
written as &quot;/{Ll}/&quot; or
&quot;/{Lowercase_Letter}/&quot;, or
&quot;/{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}/&quot; (the
underscores are optional). &quot;/Ll/&quot; is valid, but
means something different. <br>
It matches a two character string: a letter (Unicode
property &quot;L&quot;), followed by a lowercase
&quot;l&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither the &quot;/a&quot;
modifier nor locale rules are in effect, the use of a
Unicode property will force the regular expression into
using Unicode rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that almost all properties
are immune to case-insensitive matching. That is, adding a
&quot;/i&quot; regular expression modifier does not change
what they match. There are two sets <br>
that are affected. The first set is
&quot;Uppercase_Letter&quot;, &quot;Lowercase_Letter&quot;,
and &quot;Titlecase_Letter&quot;, all of which match
&quot;Cased_Letter&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; matching. The
second set is <br>
&quot;Uppercase&quot;, &quot;Lowercase&quot;, and
&quot;Titlecase&quot;, all of which match &quot;Cased&quot;
under &quot;/i&quot; matching. (The difference between these
sets is that some things, such as Roman numerals, come <br>
in both upper and lower case, so they are &quot;Cased&quot;,
but aren&rsquo;t considered to be letters, so they
aren&rsquo;t &quot;Cased_Letter&quot;s. They&rsquo;re
actually &quot;Letter_Number&quot;s.) This set also <br>
includes its subsets &quot;PosixUpper&quot; and
&quot;PosixLower&quot;, both of which under &quot;/i&quot;
match &quot;PosixAlpha&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details on Unicode
properties, see &quot;Unicode Character Properties&quot; in
perlunicode; for a complete list of possible properties, see
&quot;Properties accessible through {} and <br>
P{}&quot; in perluniprops, which notes all forms that have
&quot;/i&quot; differences. It is also possible to define
your own properties. This is discussed in &quot;User-Defined
Character <br>
Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode properties are defined
(surprise!) only on Unicode code points. A warning is raised
and all matches fail on non-Unicode code points (those above
the legal Unicode <br>
maximum of 0x10FFFF). This can be somewhat surprising,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chr(0x110000) =~
{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True} # Fails. <br>
chr(0x110000) =~ {ASCII_Hex_Digit=False} # Also fails!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though these two matches
might be thought of as complements, they are so only on
Unicode code points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a&quot; =~ /984 <br>
&quot;7&quot; =~ /1176 <br>
&quot;a&quot; =~ // # No match, &quot;a&quot; isn&rsquo;t a
digit. <br>
&quot;7&quot; =~ // # Match, &quot;7&quot; is a digit. <br>
&quot; &quot; =~ / # Match, a space is whitespace. <br>
&quot;a&quot; =~ / &quot;7&quot; =~ / &quot; &quot; =~ / #
No match, a space is not non-whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot; &quot; =~ / # Match,
space is horizontal whitespace. <br>
&quot; &quot; =~ / # No match, space is not vertical
whitespace.&quot; =~ / # Match, a return is vertical
whitespace. <br>
&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;a&quot; =~ /L/ # Match,
&quot;a&quot; is a letter. <br>
&quot;a&quot; =~ /{Lu}/ # No match, /{Lu}/ matches upper
case letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;0b}&quot; =~ /{Thai}/ #
Match, 0b} is the character <br>
# &rsquo;THAI CHARACTER SO SO&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s in
<br>
# Thai Unicode class. <br>
&quot;a&quot; =~ /P{Lao}/ # Match, as &quot;a&quot; is not a
Laotian character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is worth emphasizing that
&quot;&quot;, &quot;2688+&quot;; to match a word, use <br>
&quot;1920</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bracketed Character Classes <br>
The third form of character class you can use in Perl
regular expressions is the bracketed character class. In its
simplest form, it lists the characters that may be matched,
<br>
surrounded by square brackets, like this:
&quot;[aeiou]&quot;. This matches one of &quot;a&quot;,
&quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or
&quot;u&quot;. Like the other character classes, exactly one
character is matched.* To <br>
match a longer string consisting of characters mentioned in
the character class, follow the character class with a
quantifier. For instance, &quot;[aeiou]+&quot; matches one
or more <br>
lowercase English vowels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repeating a character in a
character class has no effect; it&rsquo;s considered to be
in the set only once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;e&quot; =~ /[aeiou]/ #
Match, as &quot;e&quot; is listed in the class. <br>
&quot;p&quot; =~ /[aeiou]/ # No match, &quot;p&quot; is not
listed in the class. <br>
&quot;ae&quot; =~ /^[aeiou]$/ # No match, a character class
only matches <br>
# a single character. <br>
&quot;ae&quot; =~ /^[aeiou]+$/ # Match, due to the
quantifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-------</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* There is an exception to a
bracketed character class matching a single character only.
When the class is to match caselessly under &quot;/i&quot;
matching rules, and a character inside <br>
the class matches a multiple-character sequence caselessly
under Unicode rules, the class (when not inverted) will also
match that sequence. For example, Unicode says that the <br>
letter &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S&quot; should match
the sequence &quot;ss&quot; under &quot;/i&quot; rules.
Thus,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;ss&rsquo; =~ /0LL LETTER
SHARP S}i # Matches <br>
&rsquo;ss&rsquo; =~ /0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Characters Inside a
Bracketed Character Class</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most characters that are meta
characters in regular expressions (that is, characters that
carry a special meaning like &quot;.&quot;, &quot;*&quot;,
or &quot;(&quot;) lose their special meaning and can be <br>
used inside a character class without the need to escape
them. For instance, &quot;[()]&quot; matches either an
opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, and the
parens inside the <br>
character class don&rsquo;t group or capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Characters that may carry a
special meaning inside a character class are: &quot; <br>
is sometimes not needed, in which case the backslash may be
omitted. i s s p e c i ai ls ia nn sa is ds ee ar bt ri ao
cn ki en td ei dc ca ht ai rn ag ca tp eo ri cn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sequence &quot;lt at sh sa
.t Wd ho ie ls en oo ut th sa iv de ee ti ht eh ce hr at rw
ao cw to er rd c l a s s , <br>
characters or two non-word characters on either side, m a t
c h e s a b a c k s inside a bracketed character class,
&quot;p a c e c h a r a c t e r .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sequences &quot;&quot;,
&quot; character class. (However, inside a bracketed
character class, if &quot;AME}&quot; expands to a sequence
of characters, only the first one in the sequence is used,
with a warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, a backslash followed by
two or three octal digits is considered an octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;[&quot; is not special
inside a character class, unless it&rsquo;s the start of a
POSIX character class (see &quot;POSIX Character
Classes&quot; below). It normally does not need
escaping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;]&quot; is normally
either the end of a POSIX character class (see &quot;POSIX
Character Classes&quot; below), or it signals the end of the
bracketed character class. If you want to include <br>
a &quot;]&quot; in the set of characters, you must generally
escape it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, if the &quot;]&quot; is
the first (or the second if the first character is a caret)
character of a bracketed character class, it does not denote
the end of the class (as you <br>
cannot have an empty class) and is considered part of the
set of characters that can be matched without escaping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;+&quot; =~ /[+?*]/ #
Match, &quot;+&quot; in a character class is not special.
<br>
&quot; # is equivalent to a backspace. <br>
&quot;]&quot; =~ /[][]/ # Match, as the character class
contains. <br>
# both [ and ]. <br>
&quot;[]&quot; =~ /[[]]/ # Match, the pattern contains a
character class <br>
# containing just ], and the character class is <br>
# followed by a ].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Character Ranges</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not uncommon to want to
match a range of characters. Luckily, instead of listing all
characters in the range, one may use the hyphen
(&quot;-&quot;). If inside a bracketed character <br>
class you have two characters separated by a hyphen,
it&rsquo;s treated as if all characters between the two were
in the class. For instance, &quot;[0-9]&quot; matches any
ASCII digit, and <br>
&quot;[a-m]&quot; matches any lowercase letter from the
first half of the ASCII alphabet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the two characters on
either side of the hyphen are not necessarily both letters
or both digits. Any character is possible, although not
advisable. &quot;[&rsquo;-?]&quot; contains a <br>
range of characters, but most people will not know which
characters that means. Furthermore, such ranges may lead to
portability problems if the code has to run on a platform
<br>
that uses a different character set, such as EBCDIC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a hyphen in a character class
cannot syntactically be part of a range, for instance
because it is the first or the last character of the
character class, or if it immediately <br>
follows a range, the hyphen isn&rsquo;t special, and so is
considered a character to be matched literally. If you want
a hyphen in your set of characters to be matched and its
<br>
position in the class is such that it could be considered
part of a range, you must escape that hyphen with a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[a-z] # Matches a character that
is a lower case ASCII letter. <br>
[a-fz] # Matches any letter between &rsquo;a&rsquo; and
&rsquo;f&rsquo; (inclusive) or <br>
# the letter &rsquo;z&rsquo;. <br>
[-z] # Matches either a hyphen (&rsquo;-&rsquo;) or the
letter &rsquo;z&rsquo;. <br>
[a-f-m] # Matches any letter between &rsquo;a&rsquo; and
&rsquo;f&rsquo; (inclusive), the <br>
# hyphen (&rsquo;-&rsquo;), or the letter &rsquo;m&rsquo;.
<br>
[&rsquo;-?] # Matches any of the characters
&rsquo;()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;? <br>
# (But not on an EBCDIC platform).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to instead
list the characters you do not want to match. You can do so
by using a caret (&quot;^&quot;) as the first character in
the character class. For instance, <br>
&quot;[^a-z]&quot; matches any character that is not a
lowercase ASCII letter, which therefore includes more than a
million Unicode code points. The class is said to be
&quot;negated&quot; or <br>
&quot;inverted&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This syntax make the caret a
special character inside a bracketed character class, but
only if it is the first character of the class. So if you
want the caret as one of the <br>
characters to match, either escape the caret or else
don&rsquo;t list it first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In inverted bracketed character
classes, Perl ignores the Unicode rules that normally say
that certain characters should match a sequence of multiple
characters under caseless <br>
&quot;/i&quot; matching. Following those rules could lead to
highly confusing situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ss&quot; =~ /^[^]+$/ui; #
Matches!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should match any sequences
of characters that aren&rsquo;t &quot;&quot; nor what
&quot;&quot; matches under &quot;/i&quot;. &quot;s&quot;
isn&rsquo;t &quot;&quot;, but Unicode says that
&quot;ss&quot; is what &quot;&quot; matches under <br>
&quot;/i&quot;. So which one &quot;wins&quot;? Do you fail
the match because the string has &quot;ss&quot; or accept it
because it has an &quot;s&quot; followed by another
&quot;s&quot;? Perl has chosen the latter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;e&quot; =~ /[^aeiou]/ # No
match, the &rsquo;e&rsquo; is listed. <br>
&quot;x&quot; =~ /[^aeiou]/ # Match, as &rsquo;x&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t a lowercase vowel. <br>
&quot;^&quot; =~ /[^^]/ # No match, matches anything that
isn&rsquo;t a caret. <br>
&quot;^&quot; =~ /[x^]/ # Match, caret is not special
here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backslash Sequences</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can put any backslash
sequence character class (with the exception of &quot;nd
&quot;nside a bracketed character class, and it will act
just as if you had put all characters <br>
matched by the backslash sequence inside the character
class. For instance, &quot;[a-f]&quot; matches any decimal
digit, or any of the lowercase letters between
&rsquo;a&rsquo; and &rsquo;f&rsquo; inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;ithin a bracketed
character class must be of the forms &quot;ame}&quot; or
&quot;+hex char}&quot;, and NOT be the form that matches
non-newlines, for the same reason that a dot &quot;.&quot;
<br>
inside a bracketed character class loses its special
meaning: it matches nearly anything, which generally
isn&rsquo;t what you want to happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/[{Thai}]/ # Matches a character
that is either a Thai <br>
# character, or a digit. <br>
/[^{Arabic}()]/ # Matches a character that is neither an
Arabic <br>
# character, nor a parenthesis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backslash sequence character
classes cannot form one of the endpoints of a range. Thus,
you can&rsquo;t say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/[{Thai}-]/ # Wrong!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX Character Classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX character classes have the
form &quot;[:class:]&quot;, where class is name, and the
&quot;[:&quot; and &quot;:]&quot; delimiters. POSIX
character classes only appear inside bracketed character
classes, <br>
and are a convenient and descriptive way of listing a group
of characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful about the syntax,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Correct: <br>
$string =~ /[[:alpha:]]/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Incorrect (will warn): <br>
$string =~ /[:alpha:]/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latter pattern would be a
character class consisting of a colon, and the letters
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;p&quot; and
&quot;h&quot;. POSIX character classes can be part of a
larger bracketed character <br>
class. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[01[:alpha:]%]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is valid and matches
&rsquo;0&rsquo;, &rsquo;1&rsquo;, any alphabetic character,
and the percent sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl recognizes the following
POSIX character classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alpha Any alphabetical character
(&quot;[A-Za-z]&quot;). <br>
alnum Any alphanumeric character. (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9]&quot;)
<br>
ascii Any character in the ASCII character set. <br>
blank A GNU extension, equal to a space or a horizontal tab
(&quot;&quot;). <br>
cntrl Any control character. See Note [2] below. <br>
digit Any decimal digit (&quot;[0-9]&quot;), equivalent to
&quot;&quot;. <br>
graph Any printable character, excluding a space. See Note
[3] below. <br>
lower Any lowercase character (&quot;[a-z]&quot;). <br>
print Any printable character, including a space. See Note
[4] below. <br>
punct Any graphical character excluding &quot;word&quot;
characters. Note [5]. <br>
space Any whitespace character. &quot;lus the vertical tab
(&quot; upper Any uppercase character (&quot;[A-Z]&quot;).
<br>
word A Perl extension (&quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]&quot;), equivalent
to &quot;24 <br>
xdigit Any hexadecimal digit (&quot;[0-9a-fA-F]&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most POSIX character classes
have two Unicode-style &quot;&quot; property counterparts.
(They are not official Unicode properties, but Perl
extensions derived from official Unicode <br>
properties.) The table below shows the relation between
POSIX character classes and these counterparts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One counterpart, in the column
labelled &quot;ASCII-range Unicode&quot; in the table,
matches only characters in the ASCII character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other counterpart, in the
column labelled &quot;Full-range Unicode&quot;, matches any
appropriate characters in the full Unicode character set.
For example, &quot;{Alpha}&quot; matches not <br>
just the ASCII alphabetic characters, but any character in
the entire Unicode character set considered alphabetic. An
entry in the column labelled &quot;backslash sequence&quot;
is a <br>
(short) equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[:...:]] ASCII-range Full-range
backslash Note <br>
Unicode Unicode sequence <br>
----------------------------------------------------- <br>
alpha {PosixAlpha} {XPosixAlpha} <br>
alnum {PosixAlnum} {XPosixAlnum} <br>
ascii {ASCII} <br>
blank {PosixBlank} {XPosixBlank} [1] <br>
or {HorizSpace} [1] <br>
cntrl {PosixCntrl} {XPosixCntrl} [2] <br>

space {PosixSpace} {XPosixSpace} [6] <br>
upper {PosixUpper} {XPosixUpper} <br>
word {PosixWord} {XPosixWord} 1296</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[1] &quot;{Blank}&quot; and
&quot;{HorizSpace}&quot; are synonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[2] Control characters
don&rsquo;t produce output as such, but instead usually
control the terminal somehow: for example, newline and
backspace are control characters. In the ASCII <br>
range, characters whose code points are between 0 and 31
inclusive, plus 127 (&quot;DEL&quot;) are control
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On EBCDIC platforms, it is
likely that the code page will define
&quot;[[:cntrl:]]&quot; to be the EBCDIC equivalents of the
ASCII controls, plus the controls that in Unicode have code
<br>
pointss from 128 through 159.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[3] Any character that is
graphical, that is, visible. This class consists of all
alphanumeric characters and all punctuation characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[4] All printable characters,
which is the set of all graphical characters plus those
whitespace characters which are not also controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[5] &quot;{PosixPunct}&quot; and
&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot; in the ASCII range match all
non-controls, non-alphanumeric, non-space characters:
&quot;[-!&quot;#$%&amp;&rsquo;()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_&lsquo;{|}~]&quot;
(although if a <br>
locale is in effect, it could alter the behavior of
&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The similarly named property,
&quot;{Punct}&quot;, matches a somewhat different set in the
ASCII range, namely
&quot;[-!&quot;#%&amp;&rsquo;()*,./:;?@[\]_{}]&quot;. That
is, it is missing the nine <br>
characters &quot;[$+&lt;=&gt;^&lsquo;|~]&quot;. This is
because Unicode splits what POSIX considers to be
punctuation into two categories, Punctuation and
Symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{XPosixPunct}&quot; and
(under Unicode rules) &quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, match what
&quot;{PosixPunct}&quot; matches in the ASCII range, plus
what &quot;{Punct}&quot; matches. This is different than
<br>
strictly matching according to &quot;{Punct}&quot;. Another
way to say it is that if Unicode rules are in effect,
&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot; matches all characters that Unicode
considers <br>
punctuation, plus all ASCII-range characters that Unicode
considers symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[6] &quot;{SpacePerl}&quot; and
&quot;{Space}&quot; differ only in that in non-locale
matching, &quot;{Space}&quot; additionally matches the
vertical tab, &quot; forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are various other synonyms
that can be used besides the names listed in the table. For
example, &quot;{PosixAlpha}&quot; can be written as
&quot;{Alpha}&quot;. All are listed in <br>
&quot;Properties accessible through {} and P{}&quot; in
perluniprops, plus all characters matched by each
ASCII-range property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the &quot;&quot;
counterparts always assume Unicode rules are in effect. On
ASCII platforms, this means they assume that the code points
from 128 to 255 are Latin-1, and that means <br>
that using them under locale rules is unwise unless the
locale is guaranteed to be Latin-1 or UTF-8. In contrast,
the POSIX character classes are useful under locale rules.
<br>
They are affected by the actual rules in effect, as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier,
is in effect ... <br>
Each of the POSIX classes matches exactly the same as their
ASCII-range counterparts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise ... <br>
For code points above 255 ... <br>
The POSIX class matches the same as its Full-range
counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For code points below 256 ...
<br>
if locale rules are in effect ... <br>
The POSIX class matches according to the locale, except that
&quot;word&quot; uses the platform&rsquo;s native underscore
character, no matter what the locale is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if Unicode rules are in effect
or if on an EBCDIC platform ... <br>
The POSIX class matches the same as the Full-range
counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">otherwise ... <br>
The POSIX class matches the same as the ASCII range
counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Which rules apply are determined
as described in &quot;Which character set modifier is in
effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is proposed to change this
behavior in a future release of Perl so that whether or not
Unicode rules are in effect would not change the behavior:
Outside of locale or an <br>
EBCDIC code page, the POSIX classes would behave like their
ASCII-range counterparts. If you wish to comment on this
proposal, send email to
&quot;perl5-porters@perl.org&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Negation of POSIX character
classes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Perl extension to the POSIX
character class is the ability to negate it. This is done by
prefixing the class name with a caret (&quot;^&quot;). Some
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSIX ASCII-range Full-range
backslash <br>
Unicode Unicode sequence <br>
----------------------------------------------------- <br>
[[:^digit:]] P{PosixDigit} P{XPosixDigit} P{PerlSpace}
P{XPerlSpace} [[:^word:]] P{PerlWord} P{XPosixWord} W</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The backslash sequence can mean
either ASCII- or Full-range Unicode, depending on various
factors as described in &quot;Which character set modifier
is in effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[= =] and [. .]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl recognizes the POSIX
character classes &quot;[=class=]&quot; and
&quot;[.class.]&quot;, but does not (yet?) support them. Any
attempt to use either construct raises an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/[[:digit:]]/ # Matches a
character that is a digit. <br>
/[01[:lower:]]/ # Matches a character that is either a <br>
# lowercase letter, or &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;1&rsquo;.
<br>
/[[:digit:][:^xdigit:]]/ # Matches a character that can be
anything <br>
# except the letters &rsquo;a&rsquo; to &rsquo;f&rsquo;.
This is <br>
# because the main character class is composed <br>
# of two POSIX character classes that are ORed <br>
# together, one that matches any digit, and <br>
# the other that matches anything that isn&rsquo;t a <br>
# hex digit. The result matches all <br>
# characters except the letters &rsquo;a&rsquo; to
&rsquo;f&rsquo; and <br>
# &rsquo;A&rsquo; to &rsquo;F&rsquo;.</p>
