<p>PERL5162DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5162DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5162delta - what is new for perl v5.16.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.16.1
release and the 5.16.2 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read perl5161delta,
which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.16.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit
a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList has been upgraded from
version 2.70 to version 2.76.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; configuration should no longer be confused
by ls colorization</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
AIX Configure now always adds -qlanglvl=extc99 to the CC
flags on AIX when using xlC. This will make it easier to
compile a number of XS-based modules that assume C99 [perl
<br>
#113778].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; fix / equivalence with /[ <br>
see [perl #114220]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
There are no new known problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>
Perl 5.16.2 represents approximately 2 months of development
since Perl 5.16.1 and contains approximately 740 lines of
changes across 20 files from 9 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl continues to flourish into
its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and
developers. The following people are known to have
contributed the improvements that <br>
became Perl 5.16.2:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Andy Dougherty, Craig A. Berry,
Darin McBride, Dominic Hargreaves, Karen Etheridge, Karl
Williamson, Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a more complete list of all
of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . <br>
There may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the
Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
