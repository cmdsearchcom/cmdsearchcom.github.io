<p>INDXBIB(1) General Commands Manual INDXBIB(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
indxbib - make inverted index for bibliographic
databases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
indxbib [ -vw ] [ -cfile ] [ -ddir ] [ -ffile ] [ -hn ] [
-istring ] [ -kn ] [ -ln ] [ -nn ] [ -ofile ] [ -tn ] [
filename... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
indxbib makes an inverted index for the bibliographic
databases in filename... for use with refer(1), lookbib(1),
and lkbib(1). The index will be named filename.i; the index
is <br>
written to a temporary file which is then renamed to this.
If no filenames are given on the command line because the -f
option has been used, and no -o option is given, the <br>
index will be named Ind.i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bibliographic databases are
divided into records by blank lines. Within a record, each
fields starts with a % character at the beginning of a line.
Fields have a one letter <br>
name which follows the % character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values set by the -c, -n, -l
and -t options are stored in the index; when the index is
searched, keys will be discarded and truncated in a manner
appropriate to these <br>
options; the original keys will be used for verifying that
any record found using the index actually contains the keys.
This means that a user of an index need not know whether
<br>
these options were used in the creation of the index,
provided that not all the keys to be searched for would have
been discarded during indexing and that the user supplies at
<br>
least the part of each key that would have remained after
being truncated during indexing. The value set by the -i
option is also stored in the index and will be used in
verify&acirc; <br>
ing records found using the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Index whole files. Each file
is a separate record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfile Read the list of common
words from file instead of /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/eign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ddir Use dir as the pathname of
the current working directory to store in the index, instead
of the path printed by pwd(1). Usually dir will be a
symbolic link that points to <br>
the directory printed by pwd(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ffile Read the files to be
indexed from file. If file is -, files will be read from the
standard input. The -f option can be given at most once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-istring <br>
Don&rsquo;t index the contents of fields whose names are in
string. Initially string is XYZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hn Use the first prime greater
than or equal to n for the size of the hash table. Larger
values of n will usually make searching faster, but will
make the index larger and <br>
indxbib use more memory. Initially n is 997.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kn Use at most n keys per input
record. Initially n is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ln Discard keys that are
shorter than n. Initially n is 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nn Discard the n most common
words. Initially n is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-obasename <br>
The index should be named basename.i.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tn Truncate keys to n.
Initially n is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
filename.i Index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ind.i Default index name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/share/groff/1.22.2/eign
<br>
List of common words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indxbibXXXXXX Temporary
file.</p>
