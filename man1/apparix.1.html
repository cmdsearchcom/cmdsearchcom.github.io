<p>apparix(1) USER COMMANDS apparix(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
apparix - bookmark directories and apparate inside them</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Apparix allows you to bookmark directories and later jump to
them using the mark. It is possible to directly jump to
subdirectories of the target directory. The contributed bash
<br>
completion code facilitates completion both on bookmarks and
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page suffers from an
excess in verbosity due to the many examples, explanations
of the bells and whistles, and comparisons with other
approaches to bookmarking. The <br>
fundamental idea is simply that typing a string of your own
choosing takes you to the directory associated with it.
Apparix does little more than maintaining a list of keys and
<br>
values. It obtains directory names and listings, associates
path names (values) with bookmarks (keys), and has some
facilities for manipulating keys and values. The functions
<br>
involving apparix (bm, to, and portal) provide the user
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Install apparix. This should be as easy as ./configure
--prefix=$HOME/local &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install, or perhaps a pre-packaged apparix is available for
your system. Then get hold <br>
of the to, bm and portal shell handles. These are either
aliases or functions depending on your shell. Currently
csh-style shells and bash are supported. Get the ones you
need <br>
either from the FILES section or by issuing apparix
--shell-examples. Activate them by simply pasting them in a
shell or adding them to the appropriate resource file, e.g.
<br>
$HOME/.cshrc or $HOME/.profile (do not forget to source the
resource file). The handles to, bm and portal can of course
be changed to any name desired. The following is a mock-up
<br>
shell navigation session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; pwd <br>
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo <br>
&gt; ls <br>
src/ doc/ CVS/ bin/ <br>
&gt; bm xkr # bookmark as xkr (funny name though) <br>
&gt; bm # bookmark as foo (trailing component is default)
<br>
(later) <br>
&gt; to xkr # cd to /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo
<br>
(alternatively) <br>
&gt; to xkr src # cd to
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo/src <br>
(alternatively) <br>
&gt; to foo # cd to
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(later) <br>
&gt; ls <br>
aap pyu/ qua tim/ zut/ <br>
&gt; pwd <br>
/home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under <br>
&gt; portal # bookmark as portal, imports tim zut pyu
bookmarks <br>
added flock of 3 in portal
/home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(later) <br>
&gt; to zut # cd to
/home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under/zut</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(later) <br>
&gt; apparix # show all bookmarks <br>
--- portals <br>
e /home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under <br>
--- expansions <br>
j pyu /home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under/pyu <br>
j tim /home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under/tim <br>
j zut /home/eez/another/branch/deep/down/under/zut <br>
--- bookmarks <br>
j xkr /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo <br>
j foo /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the last example apparix
simply shows all its bookmarks. The first batch shows
portals. The second batch shows secondary bookmarks expanded
from portals. The third batch shows <br>
all regular bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apparix also allows subdirectory
specification. If this is combined with the bash completion
code it yields a powerful way of navigating container
directories, i.e. directories <br>
that contain a large number of subdirectories. Refer to the
subdirectory specification section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Further options <br>
[--add-mark (add jump bookmark)] [--add-portal (add portal
bookmark)] [-sm &lt;mark&gt; (squash repeated marks)] [-sd
&lt;mark&gt; (squash repeated destinations)] [-lm

with this mark)] [-ld &lt;mark&gt; (list destinations with
mark indirection)] [-favour &lt;list&gt; (duplicate
resolution)] [-purge pat (delete bookmarks)] [-purge-mark

getcwd(3), not pwd(1))] [--shell-examples (output example
macros)]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Apparix combines the properties of the cdargs utility and
the CDPATH shell mechanism for fast navigation through the
file system. It is especially useful for visiting and
docu&acirc; <br>
menting both often- and rarely-used locations. Apparix
enables you to attach marks to locations and jump to those
locations by loading the mark. Marking, unmarking and
jumping are <br>
simple operations that are performed in the shell. All
actions take effect immediately in all shells running. By
setting up convenient aliases for marking and jumping the
file <br>
system can be navigated in a fast and intuitive manner. The
FILES section lists aliases for csh-type shells and
functions for bash, including the setup to equip the to
function <br>
with argument completion in bash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section contains some
examples of the most common uses of apparix. OPTIONS
contains a list of additional options available for listing,
pruning, and squashing bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES features a brief
discussion of the advantages of apparix over other
approaches such as setting up aliases for often visited
directories, using symlinks, CDPATH, or a combi&acirc; <br>
nation of these. HISTORY explains the difference between
cdargs and apparix. The sections duplicate resolution,
subdirectory specification, tab completion, copying and
moving <br>
files, and listing bookmarks further below are also
recommended reading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apparix works in a manner
similar to cdargs. One usually invokes apparix by using
pre-defined aliases. Here they will be called bm for
bookmark, portal for a CDPATH-style bookmark <br>
and to for initiating an apparition (aka jump). These
aliases are found below in the FILES section and can also be
obtained by issuing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apparix --shell-examples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose your user name is eez
and your home directory is /home/eez. You often visit a
directory called /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo. This
is how to create and use a <br>
bookmark for foo</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo&gt;
bm foo <br>
added: foo -&gt; /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo <br>
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo&gt; cd <br>
/home/eez&gt; to foo <br>
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one bookmarks a directory by
its trailing component as happened in this case, it is not
necessary to specify the mark. By default apparix will use
the trailing component as the <br>
mark. So</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo&gt;
bm <br>
added: foo -&gt; /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gives the same result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another scenario is where you
have some directory that contains a largish number of
subdirectories, all of which you would like to have
bookmarked. If the subdirectories have <br>
distinctive names this can be achieved in one fell swoop by
marking the parent directory as a portal. This is similar to
adding the parent directory to the CDPATH environment <br>
variable, except that apparix bookmarks are not part of the
cd namespace. It is argued in NOTES that this is a good
thing. Consider this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/cvs/bagger/boemel/mcl/mcl/src&gt;
ls <br>
alien/ CVS/ impala/ Makefile.am README shmcx/ <br>
attic/ giraffe/ lib/ Makefile.in shcl/ shmx/ <br>
contrib/ gmon.out Makefile mcl/ shmcl/ taurus/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the subdirectories have
not-so-distinct names such as contrib and attic, but they
happen to be the directories least visited. Issuing:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/cvs/bagger/boemel/mcl/mcl/src&gt;
portal <br>
[apparix] expanded 1 portal to 12 destinations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">yields all of the subdirectories
as destinations bookmarked by the last component of their
path name. Incidentally, directory names such as CVS can be
explicitly excluded from <br>
expansion by setting the environment variable APPARIXEXCLUDE
appropriately - refer to section ENVIRONMENT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bookmarks resulting from portal
expansion are kept in a separate resource file (see FILES).
Portal expansions can be recreated by issuing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apparix --rehash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful to reflect a
change in the directory naming structure underneath a
portal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate resolution <br>
Apparix allows identical bookmarks to point to different
locations. When asked to visit such a bookmark it will by
default present a list of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -favour &lt;list&gt; option
can be used to automate resolution. &lt;list&gt; is a
sequence of single characters. The order in which they are
given denote the order in which resolution <br>
rules are applied. This option is typically used in the
definition of the to function/alias or in the bash
completion code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Duplicates are allowed because
it can be useful to overwrite a bookmark with a new
location. The old bookmark is kept as a matter of policy.
Use -sm to explicitly squash dupli&acirc; <br>
cates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l level; prefer paths with fewer
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L reverse of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o bookmark order; prefer older
entries. Entries appearing earlier in the file are
considered older, but the actual date of creating the
bookmark is not stored. Refer to editing <br>
bookmarks for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O reverse of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r regular first; prefer regular
bookmarks over portal expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R reverse of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there are still ties after
the specified rules have been applied apparix will simply
take the first matching option. This behaviour cannot be
further specified as the program <br>
uses a non-stable ordering routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is an absolute prerequisite
that -favour is used in the bash completion code. Otherwise
completion will fail (for a duplicated bookmark) while
apparix is waiting for input. <br>
Refer to the tab completion description below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">subdirectory specification <br>
When jumping (apparating) you can specify an additional
subdirectory after the bookmark. Apparix will append the
subdirectory to the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is useful for projects with
directory nodes corresponding with versions. Assume you have
a directory structure such as this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/x/y/z/OpusMagnum/v1/ <br>
/x/y/z/OpusMagnum/v2/ <br>
/x/y/z/OpusMagnum/v3/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is probably easiest to simply
bookmark the OpusMagnum directory in some way (say with
bookmark om). You can then issue &rsquo;to om v2&rsquo; to
jump to OpusMagnum/v2. This is more flexi&acirc; <br>
ble and maintainable than creating bookmarks om1, om2, om3.
One could add OpusMagnum as a portal, but with generic names
such as v1 this is not a very extendible approach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also the tab completion
description below - it is possible to tab-complete on
subdirectories of the apparix jump directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tab completion <br>
The bash tab completion code does two things. First, it is
possible to tab-complete on apparix bookmarks themselves,
showing a listing of all available bookmarks (or iterating
<br>
through them in cyclic mode, depending on your bash
settings). Second, once a bookmark has been given tab
completion will list or iterate over all the subdirectories
of the direc&acirc; <br>
tory associated with that bookmark. Specifying a string
after the bookmark will limit tab-completion to directories
matching the shell-pattern in string. Very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Be careful to not remove the
-favour list option from the bash completion code. It is
necessary to resolve duplicate bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">editing bookmarks <br>
Apparix appends new bookmarks to the end of the .apparixrc
file. Nothing stops you from editing the file, and this is
in fact recommended if for example you need to get rid of a
<br>
bookmark and neither of -purge, -purge-mark, -sd, -sm
fulfills your needs. It was an easy design choice not to
equip apparix with editor capabilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copying and moving files <br>
It is straightforward to copy or move files to locations
known by apparix. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASH and variants <br>
cp FOO $(apparix zoem) <br>
mv BAR $(apparix zoem doc) <br>
mv BAR $(apparix zoem doc)/test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CSH and variants <br>
cp FOO &lsquo;apparix zoem&lsquo; <br>
mv BAR &lsquo;apparix zoem doc&lsquo;/test</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">listing bookmarks <br>
Simply issuing apparix gives you a list of bookmarks grouped
into three categories, portals, expansions, and bookmarks.
Use the -d option to dump the resource file to STDOUT <br>
exactly as it is. This can be useful when you intend to use
the -u num option to remove bookmarks or portals that were
most recently added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use -l to list all available
jumps without their destinations. The jumps are grouped into
expansions resulting from portals and regular bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
For bookmarking and jumping apparix is best invoked by using
the aliases (tcsh-variants) or functions (sh/bash) listed in
FILES. Apparix has a few options that are useful for <br>
pruning, squashing and rehasing bookmarks. These are best
issued by invoking apparix directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are interested in marks
or destinations matching a certain pattern, simply issue
apparix without arguments and pipe it through your program
of choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unary options (those without
arguments) usually start with two hyphens except for
standardized options such as -h. Options that take an
argument can be converted to a unary <br>
key=value notation, e.g. -purge-mark foo is equivalent to
--purge-mark=foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked without arguments
apparix will simply dump its bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-mark (add jump bookmark)
<br>
This options expects trailing [mark [destination]]
argument(s). Both arguments are optional. If a single
argument is given it is interpreted as a bookmark name to be
mapped to <br>
the current directory. If two arguments are given the last
argument is taken as the target directory. If no argument is
given apparix will enlist the current directory as a <br>
target bookmarked by the trailing component of the directory
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--add-portal (add portal
bookmark) <br>
This option enlists a directory as a portal and adds all
subdirectories as bookmarks. The name of the bookmark is
simply the name of the subdirectory. By default the current
<br>
directory is added as a portal. An optional trailing
argument will override this behaviour and instead be
interpreted as the portal location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sm &lt;mar&gt; (squash repeated
marks) <br>
Apparix will squash bookmarks with mark &lt;mark&gt;. This
is useful when a mark points to a versioned project, and the
project is updated to a new version and a new directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apparix will by default keep the
last one occurring in the resource file (corresponding with
-favour O). This option respects the -favour option if
given. Duplicating an <br>
already existing mark can be useful when it identifies a
project for which the underlying directory changes every
once in a while (e.g. the project is downloaded from
external <br>
sources and comes with version information). It is not
strictly necessary to squash bookmarks since to
functions/macros that are equipped with the -favour option
will generally <br>
resolve duplicate matches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sd &lt;mark&gt; (squash
repeated destinations) <br>
All other bookmarks with the same destination as
&lt;mark&gt; are removed. This is useful when a given
destination has acquired multiple bookmarks and you decide
to settle on a <br>
favourite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lm &lt;mark&gt; (list bookmarks
with this mark) <br>
It lists all bookmarks &lt;mark&gt; (noting that it may
point to multiple locations).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ld &lt;mark&gt; (list repeated
destinations) <br>
This lists all bookmarks &lt;mark&gt; (noting that it may
point to multiple locations) and additionally lists all
other bookmarks that share the destination with any of the
first <br>
bookmarks. This allows one to predict the effect of issuing
apparix -sd &lt;mark&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-purge pat (delete bookmarks)
<br>
This deletes bookmarks where destination matches pat. All
deleted bookmarks are printed to STDOUT. Thus if you regret
deleting a bookmark it is easy to add it back. Portal <br>
specifications are never affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-purge-mark (pat) <br>
This deletes bookmarks where mark matches pat. Portal
specifications are never affected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d (dump resource file to
STDOUT) <br>
Dump resource file to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l (list available jumps) <br>
List available jumps paragraph-style. Portal specifications
themselves are excluded, and regular jumps and jumps
resulting from portal expansions are listed under different
<br>
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u &lt;num&gt; (remove last
&lt;num&gt; additions) <br>
Remove last &lt;num&gt; additions. Portal specifications and
regular jumps are treated alike.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rehash (re-expand portal
bookmarks) <br>
Apparix will reread the resource file and reexpand portal
locations. Useful if directories have been added, renamed,
or removed. Refer to section ENVIRONMENT for the effect <br>
that the environment variable APPARIXEXCLUDE has on portal
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-favour &lt;list&gt; (set
duplicat resolution policy) <br>
This option has its own section. Refer to duplicate
resolution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cwd (use getcwd(3), not
pwd(1)) <br>
By default aparix uses the program pwd(1) rather than the
system call getcwd(3). On some systems it was found that the
latter results in paths that contain machine-specific <br>
mount components. Appparix will use getcwd(3) when --cwd is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell-examples (output example
macros) <br>
This outputs example macros. They are also listed in the
FILES section though.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--bu (create backup of the
resource file) <br>
This creates the backup file in .apparixrc.bu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bu fname (create backup of the
resource file) <br>
This creates the backup file in fname. Use -d or -bu - to
dump to STDOUT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h (show synopsis) <br>
--apropos (show synopsis) <br>
print synopsis of all options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
APPARIXEXCLUDE <br>
This variable specifies exclusion behaviour when portals are
expanded with the --rehash option. It has the following
syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;[:,][&lt;string&gt;]&gt;+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That is, a list of names with
each name preceded by a colon or a comma. A colon indicates
that &lt;string&gt; triggers exclusion of directory names
for which the trailing component <br>
is identical to &lt;string&gt;. A comma indicates that
&lt;string&gt; triggers exclusion of directory names for
which the trailing component contains &lt;string&gt; as a
substring. Consider:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
APPARIXEXCLUDE=:CVS:lib,tmp # A - example <br>
export APPARIXEXCLUDE=, # B - curiosity</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first excludes directory
names CVS and lib and any directory name having tmp as a
substring. The second example will effectively disable
portals, as it speficies the empty <br>
string which is a substring of all strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPARIXTAG <br>
This variable, if set, is incorporated into the names of the
apparix resource files. By default these are .apparixrc and
.apparixexpand. When APPARIXTAG is set to &lt;tag&gt; they
<br>
become .&lt;tag&gt;apparixrc and .&lt;tag&gt;apparixexpand.
This can be used e.g. to maintain different sets of
bookmarks on different host machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPARIXLOG <br>
This variable, if set, is interpreted as the name of a log
file. The log file keeps track of all newly added bookmarks
and portals without ever deleting anything, in the same <br>
format as the .apparixrc file. If this variable is not set
nothing is tracked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPARIXPURGE <br>
This changes the way apparix dumps purged bookmarks to
STDOUT. By default they are dumped as command lines that
will reimport the bookmarks if issued (i.e. cut and pasted).
<br>
By setting this variable to 1 purged bookmarks are dumped in
the format used in the .apparixrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
You should use aliases or functions to make apparix really
useful. Get them from apparix by giving it the
--shell-examples option, or from further below. Note the
fragment that <br>
provides to argument completion in bash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.apparixrc <br>
This is the primary resource file. There is usually no need
to edit it by hand. Sometimes it can be useful to edit by
hand to remove an unwanted bookmark; refer to editing <br>
bookmarks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.apparixrc.bu <br>
Apparix creates a back-up file whenever it is asked to
remove entries from it. Refer to editing bookmarks for
options inducing removal. You can explicitly require a
backup to <br>
be made by either of --bu or -bu fname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.apparixexpand <br>
This contains bookmarks that are expanded from portals. A
portal is simply some directory. The names of all
subdirectories are taken as bookmarks that point to those
subdirec&acirc; <br>
tories. This file can be recreated by issuing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apparix --rehash</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.bashrc <br>
$HOME/.tcshrc <br>
$HOME/.cshrc <br>
Add the code you need to the appropriate rc file. The macros
and functions below point cd(1) in the right direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Below follow some comments on other approaches to file
system navigation. HISTORY explains the difference between
the venerable cdargs program and apparix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDPATH is only useful in cases
where a given directory has subdirectories with distinctive
names. It does not usually scale well when there are more
than a few paths in CDPATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some people use aliases to jump
to often visited directories. I was one of them for a period
of ten years. The fact is, those aliases are cumbersome to
create and remove and they <br>
clutter up the alias namespace. They can clash with
executable names when the alias includes the cd part. This
sometimes prohibits one from assigning the logical bookmark
to a <br>
given location, especially when one has a lot of source code
locations. They can clash with directory names when the
aliases just expand to the location. This again means that
<br>
sometimes a location cannot be assigned its logical
bookmark. I have found that setting cd jumps aside in their
own namespace improves file system navigation by a large
factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is also possible to create
symlinks to often visited files. Again, creation and removal
of these are cumbersome. One could of course create shell
functions with a similar <br>
interface to apparix or cdargs to handle the symlink
lifecycle. On Linux Weekly News nix suggested to put these
symlinks in a single directory and add that directory to
CDPATH. <br>
This is quite a neat trick and effectively creates a
bookmark navigation system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Still there are problems with
the above approach. One problem with the symlink approach is
that they are a bit awkward to edit. One could make a
utility to wrap around the prob&acirc; <br>
lem, but in the end the directory-with-symlinks would
functionally be the same as apparix&rsquo;s .apparixrc
resource file, only more of a kludge. Another problem is
that symlinks are <br>
awkard when traversing the file system. They confuse the
notion of parent directory and &rsquo;cd ..&rsquo; mostly
does the unexpected. Sometimes &rsquo;..&rsquo; has a
different meaning to cd than it <br>
has to another application, as one will trace back symlinks
and the other will not. Finally, a minor objection is that I
find it convenient to have bookmarks in a separate
names&acirc; <br>
pace than that of cd(1). Jumps are magical and it is natural
to invoke them by a different method. This is in fact how
apparix acquired its CDPATH behaviour. I used CDPATH to jump
<br>
to a few particular source directories with distinct names
that lay deeply hidden in some CVS directory. Once I started
using apparix however, I would mistakenly issue to rather
<br>
than cd to jump to those locations. My brain classified both
types of jump in the same category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apparix (and cdargs) have
another use besides jumping, namely annotation. Whenever I
end up in an esoteric part of the file system and need to
make a quick note of the location, I <br>
simply bookmark it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On SlashDot, that eternal source
of wisdom or alternatively the geek wheel of suffering,
Clueless Moron offered the following gems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mk() { eval ${1:-MKPWD}= <br>
rt() { eval cd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># type &quot;mk&quot; (as in
&quot;mark&quot;) and &quot;rt&quot; (as in
&quot;return&quot;) to mark <br>
# a directory and later go back to it. <br>
# Or give it a name: do &quot;mk foo&quot;, and later on
&quot;rt foo&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This of course is a per-session
mechanism, but noteworthy for its simplicity. I am not sure
whether csh-style shells could offer an equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A feature shared by apparix and
cdargs is that adding a bookmark immediately takes effect in
all shells. There is no need to source some resource file,
as the applications do this <br>
everytime they are invoked. It is fast, do not worry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The resource file parsing code thinks that parentheses are
special. Also records are currently separated by commas.
Accordingly, apparix will hitch if a path name contains a
<br>
parenthesis or a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THANKS <br>
Stefan Kamphausen wrote cdargs, the inspiration for
apparix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sitaram Chamarty fixed up some
of the existing bash code, and added the tab completion part
(basing this on similar code in cdargs). He does not
garantuee predictable or even <br>
pretty results if there are spaces in the directory names
which you attempt to complete. AUTHOR would like to submit
that spaces in path names are evil, and that the completion
<br>
code seems to work in their evil presence anyway. Just
don&rsquo;t put commas in path names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The autotooled build environment
was modified from a template written by Joost van Baal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Apparix was created to optimize a scenario that cdargs does
not support very well, namely where the mark (called needle
in cdargs) is always known. As an additional feature <br>
apparix supports CDPATH-style behaviour and subdirectory
specification. In other respects apparix is a much simpler
application. cdargs offers menu-based navigation of the file
<br>
system and the bookmark list, which apparix does not.</p>
