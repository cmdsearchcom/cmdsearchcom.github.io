<p style="margin-top: 1em">typical usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan &lsquo;pick -from
jones&lsquo; <br>
pick -to holloway -sequence select <br>
show &lsquo;pick -before friday&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Pick searches within a folder for messages with the
specified contents, and then identifies those messages. Two
types of search primitives are available: pattern matching
and <br>
date constraint operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A modified grep(1) is used to
perform the matching, so the full regular expression (see
ed(1)) facility is available within pattern. With -search,
pattern is used directly, and <br>
with the others, the grep pattern constructed is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;component[
]*:.*pattern&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that the pattern
specified for a -search will be found everywhere in the
message, including the header and the body, while the other
pattern matching requests are lim&acirc; <br>
ited to the single specified component. The expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--component
pattern&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is a shorthand for
specifying</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;-search &acirc;component[
]*:.*pattern&acirc; &rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is used to pick a component
which is not one of &acirc;To:&acirc;, &acirc;cc:&acirc;,
&acirc;Date:&acirc;, &acirc;From:&acirc;, or
&acirc;Subject:&acirc;. An example is &acirc;pick --reply-to
pooh&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pattern matching is performed on
a per-line basis. Within the header of the message, each
component is treated as one long line, but in the body, each
line is separate. <br>
Lower-case letters in the search pattern will match either
lower or upper case in the message, while upper case will
match only upper case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since the -date switch
is a pattern matching operation (as described above), to
find messages sent on a certain date the pattern string must
match the text of the <br>
&acirc;Date:&acirc; field of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Independent of any pattern
matching operations requested, the switches -after date or
-before date may also be used to introduce date/time
constraints on all of the messages. By <br>
default, the &acirc;Date:&acirc; field is consulted, but if
another date yielding field (such as
&acirc;BB-Posted:&acirc; or &acirc;Delivery-Date:&acirc;)
should be used, the -datefield field switch may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With -before and -after, pick
will actually parse the date fields in each of the messages
specified in &lsquo;msgs&rsquo; and compare them to the
date/time specified. If -after is given, <br>
then only those messages whose &acirc;Date:&acirc; field
value is chronologically after the date specified will be
considered. The -before switch specifies the complimentary
action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both the -after and -before
switches take legal RFC 822-style date specifications as
arguments. Pick will default certain missing fields so that
the entire date need not be <br>
specified. These fields are (in order of defaulting):
timezone, time and timezone, date, date and timezone. All
defaults are taken from the current date, time, and
timezone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to RFC 822-style
dates, pick will also recognize any of the days of the week
(&acirc;sunday&acirc;, &acirc;monday&acirc;, and so on), and
the special dates &acirc;today&acirc;,
&acirc;yesterday&acirc; (24 hours <br>
ago), and &acirc;tomorrow&acirc; (24 hours from now). All
days of the week are judged to refer to a day in the past
(e.g., telling pick &acirc;saturday&acirc; on a
&acirc;tuesday&acirc; means &acirc;last saturday&acirc; not
<br>
&acirc;this saturday&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, in addition to these
special specifications, pick will also honor a specification
of the form &acirc;-dd&acirc;, which means &acirc;dd days
ago&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pick supports complex boolean
operations on the searching primitives with the -and, -or,
-not, and -lbrace ... -rbrace switches. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pick -after yesterday -and <br>
-lbrace -from freida -or -from fear -rbrace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">identifies messages recently
sent by &acirc;frieda&acirc; or &acirc;fear&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The matching primitives take
precedence over the -not switch, which in turn takes
precedence over -and which in turn takes precedence over
-or. To override the default prece&acirc; <br>
dence, the -lbrace and -rbrace switches are provided, which
act just like opening and closing parentheses in logical
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no search criteria are given,
all the messages specified on the command line are selected
(this defaults to &acirc;all&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the search has been
performed, if the -list switch is given, the message numbers
of the selected messages are written to the standard output
separated by newlines. This is <br>
extremely useful for quickly generating arguments for other
nmh programs by using the &acirc;backquoting&acirc; syntax
of the shell. For example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan &lsquo;pick +todo -after
&acirc;31 Mar 83 0123 PST&acirc;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">says to scan those messages in
the indicated folder which meet the appropriate criterion.
Note that since pick&rsquo;s context changes are written out
prior to scan&rsquo;s invocation, you <br>
need not give the folder argument to scan as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -sequence name switch may be
given once for each sequence the user wishes to define. For
each sequence named, that sequence will be defined to mean
exactly those messages <br>
selected by pick. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pick -from frated -seq fred</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defines a new message sequence
for the current folder called &acirc;fred&acirc; which
contains exactly those messages that were selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -nosequence switch will
disable all previously named sequences, allowing those
established by a profile component to be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pick will zero a
sequence before adding it. This action can be disabled with
the -nozero switch, which means that the messages selected
by pick will be added to the <br>
sequence, if it already exists, and any messages already a
part of that sequence will remain so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -public and -nopublic
switches are used by pick in the same way mark uses
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output when no messages are
matched <br>
If pick is used in a backquoted operation, such as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scan &lsquo;pick -from
jones&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and pick selects no messages
(e.g., no messages are from &acirc;jones&acirc;), then the
shell will still run the outer command (e.g., scan). Since
no messages were matched, pick produced no <br>
output, and the argument given to the outer command as a
result of backquoting pick is empty. In the case of nmh
programs, the outer command now acts as if the default
&lsquo;msg&rsquo; or <br>
&lsquo;msgs&rsquo; should be used (e.g., &acirc;all&acirc;
in the case of scan). To prevent this unexpected behavior,
if -list was given, and if its standard output is not a tty,
then pick outputs the <br>
illegal message number &acirc;0&acirc; when it fails. This
lets the outer command fail gracefully as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$HOME/.mh_profile The user profile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROFILE COMPONENTS <br>
Path: To determine the user&rsquo;s nmh directory <br>
Current-Folder: To find the default current folder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
mark(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
&lsquo;+folder&rsquo; defaults to the current folder <br>
&lsquo;msgs&rsquo; defaults to all <br>
&lsquo;-datefield date&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;-zero&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;-list&rsquo; is the default if no
&lsquo;-sequence&rsquo;, &lsquo;-nolist&rsquo; otherwise</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
If a folder is given, it will become the current folder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
In previous versions of MH, the pick command would show,
scan, or refile the selected messages. This was rather
&acirc;inverted logic&acirc; from the UNIX point of view, so
pick was changed <br>
to define sequences and output those sequences. Hence, pick
can be used to generate the arguments for all other MH
commands, instead of giving pick endless switches for
invoking <br>
those commands itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, previous versions of pick
balked if you didn&rsquo;t specify a search string or a
date/time constraint. The current version does not, and
merely matches the messages you spec&acirc; <br>
ify. This lets you type something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show &lsquo;pick last:20 -seq
fear&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">instead of typing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mark -add -nozero -seq fear
last:20 <br>
show fear</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, timezones used to be
ignored when comparing dates: they aren&rsquo;t any
more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HELPFUL HINTS <br>
Use &acirc;pick sequence -list&acirc; to enumerate the
messages in a sequence (such as for use by a shell
script).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Any occurrence of -datefield must occur prior to the -after
or -before switch it applies to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pattern syntax
&acirc;[l-r]&acirc; is not supported; each letter to be
matched must be included within the square brackets.</p>
