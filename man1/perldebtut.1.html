perldebtut - Perl debugging tutorial
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
A (very) lightweight introduction in the use of the perl debugger, and a pointer
  to existing, deeper sources of information on the subject of debugging perl
  programs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's an extraordinary number of people out there who don't appear to know
  anything about using the perl debugger, though they use the language every
  day. This is for them.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="use_strict"><a class="selflink" href="#use_strict">use
  strict</a></h1>
First of all, there's a few things you can do to make your life a lot more
  straightforward when it comes to debugging perl programs, without using the
  debugger at all. To demonstrate, here's a simple script, named
  &quot;hello&quot;, with a problem:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        $var1 = 'Hello World'; # always wanted to do that :-)
        $var2 = &quot;$varl\n&quot;;
        print $var2; 
        exit;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While this compiles and runs happily, it probably won't do what's expected,
  namely it doesn't print &quot;Hello World\n&quot; at all; It will on the other
  hand do exactly what it was told to do, computers being a bit that way
  inclined. That is, it will print out a newline character, and you'll get what
  looks like a blank line. It looks like there's 2 variables when (because of
  the typo) there's really 3:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $var1 = 'Hello World';
        $varl = undef;
        $var2 = &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To catch this kind of problem, we can force each variable to be declared before
  use by pulling in the strict module, by putting 'use strict;' after the first
  line of the script.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now when you run it, perl complains about the 3 undeclared variables and we get
  four error messages because one variable is referenced twice:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 Global symbol &quot;$var1&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 4.
 Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
 Global symbol &quot;$varl&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 5.
 Global symbol &quot;$var2&quot; requires explicit package name at ./t1 line 7.
 Execution of ./hello aborted due to compilation errors.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Luvverly! and to fix this we declare all variables explicitly and now our script
  looks like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        #!/usr/bin/perl
        use strict;
        my $var1 = 'Hello World';
        my $varl = undef;
        my $var2 = &quot;$varl\n&quot;;
        print $var2; 
        exit;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We then do (always a good idea) a syntax check before we try to run it again:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -c hello
        hello syntax OK
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And now when we run it, we get &quot;\n&quot; still, but at least we know why.
  Just getting this script to compile has exposed the '$varl' (with the letter
  'l') variable, and simply changing $varl to $var1 solves the problem.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Looking_at_data_and_-w_and_v"><a class="selflink" href="#Looking_at_data_and_-w_and_v">Looking
  at data and -w and v</a></h1>
Ok, but how about when you want to really see your data, what's in that dynamic
  variable, just before using it?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        #!/usr/bin/perl 
        use strict;
        my $key = 'welcome';
        my %data = (
                'this' =&gt; qw(that), 
                'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
                'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
                'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        );
        my @data = keys %data;
        print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
        exit;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Looks OK, after it's been through the syntax check (perl -c scriptname), we run
  it and all we get is a blank line again! Hmmmm.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One common debugging approach here, would be to liberally sprinkle a few print
  statements, to add a check just before we print out our data, and another just
  after:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        print &quot;All OK\n&quot; if grep($key, keys %data);
        print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
        print &quot;done: '$data{$key}'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And try again:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl data
        All OK     
        done: ''
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After much staring at the same piece of code and not seeing the wood for the
  trees for some time, we get a cup of coffee and try another approach. That is,
  we bring in the cavalry by giving perl the ' <b>-d</b>' switch on the command
  line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -d data 
        Default die handler restored.
        Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07
        Editor support available.
        Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.
        main::(./data:4):     my $key = 'welcome';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, what we've done here is to launch the built-in perl debugger on our script.
  It's stopped at the first line of executable code and is waiting for input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before we go any further, you'll want to know how to quit the debugger: use just
  the letter ' <b>q</b>', not the words 'quit' or 'exit':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;1&gt; q
        &gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's it, you're back on home turf again.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="help"><a class="selflink" href="#help">help</a></h1>
Fire the debugger up again on your script and we'll look at the help menu.
  There's a couple of ways of calling help: a simple ' <b>h</b>' will get the
  summary help list, ' <b>|h</b>' (pipe-h) will pipe the help through your pager
  (which is (probably 'more' or 'less'), and finally, ' <b>h h</b>' (h-space-h)
  will give you the entire help screen. Here is the summary page:
<div class="Pp"></div>

</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
More confusing options than you can shake a big stick at! It's not as bad as it
  looks and it's very useful to know more about all of it, and fun too!
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's a couple of useful ones to know about straight away. You wouldn't think
  we're using any libraries at all at the moment, but ' <b>M</b>' will show
  which modules are currently loaded, and their version number, while '
  <b>m</b>' will show the methods, and ' <b>S</b>' shows all subroutines (by
  pattern) as shown below. ' <b>V</b>' and '<b>X</b>' show variables in the
  program by package scope and can be constrained by pattern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;2&gt;S str 
        dumpvar::stringify
        strict::bits
        strict::import
        strict::unimport
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using 'X' and cousins requires you not to use the type identifiers ($@%), just
  the 'name':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DM&lt;3&gt;X ~err
        FileHandle(stderr) =&gt; fileno(2)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Remember we're in our tiny program with a problem, we should have a look at
  where we are, and what our data looks like. First of all let's view some code
  at our present position (the first line of code in this case), via '
  <b>v</b>':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;4&gt; v
        1       #!/usr/bin/perl
        2:      use strict;
        3
        4==&gt;    my $key = 'welcome';
        5:      my %data = (
        6               'this' =&gt; qw(that),
        7               'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
        8               'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
        9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        10      );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
At line number 4 is a helpful pointer, that tells you where you are now. To see
  more code, type 'v' again:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;4&gt; v
        8               'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
        9               'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        10      );
        11:     my @data = keys %data;
        12:     print &quot;All OK\n&quot; if grep($key, keys %data);
        13:     print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
        14:     print &quot;done: '$data{$key}'\n&quot;;
        15:     exit;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And if you wanted to list line 5 again, type 'l 5', (note the space):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;4&gt; l 5
        5:      my %data = (
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this case, there's not much to see, but of course normally there's pages of
  stuff to wade through, and 'l' can be very useful. To reset your view to the
  line we're about to execute, type a lone period '.':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;5&gt; .
        main::(./data_a:4):     my $key = 'welcome';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The line shown is the one that is about to be executed <b>next</b>, it hasn't
  happened yet. So while we can print a variable with the letter ' <b>p</b>', at
  this point all we'd get is an empty (undefined) value back. What we need to do
  is to step through the next executable statement with an ' <b>s</b>':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;6&gt; s
        main::(./data_a:5):     my %data = (
        main::(./data_a:6):             'this' =&gt; qw(that),
        main::(./data_a:7):             'tom' =&gt; qw(and jerry),
        main::(./data_a:8):             'welcome' =&gt; q(Hello World),
        main::(./data_a:9):             'zip' =&gt; q(welcome),
        main::(./data_a:10):    );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we can have a look at that first ($key) variable:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;7&gt; p $key 
        welcome
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
line 13 is where the action is, so let's continue down to there via the letter '
  <b>c</b>', which by the way, inserts a 'one-time-only' breakpoint at the given
  line or sub routine:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;8&gt; c 13
        All OK
        main::(./data_a:13):    print &quot;$data{$key}\n&quot;;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We've gone past our check (where 'All OK' was printed) and have stopped just
  before the meat of our task. We could try to print out a couple of variables
  to see what is happening:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;9&gt; p $data{$key}
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not much in there, lets have a look at our hash:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;10&gt; p %data
        Hello Worldziptomandwelcomejerrywelcomethisthat 
        DB&lt;11&gt; p keys %data
        Hello Worldtomwelcomejerrythis
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Well, this isn't very easy to read, and using the helpful manual ( <b>h h</b>),
  the ' <b>x</b>' command looks promising:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;12&gt; x %data
        0  'Hello World'
        1  'zip'
        2  'tom'
        3  'and'
        4  'welcome'
        5  undef
        6  'jerry'
        7  'welcome'
        8  'this'
        9  'that'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's not much help, a couple of welcomes in there, but no indication of which
  are keys, and which are values, it's just a listed array dump and, in this
  case, not particularly helpful. The trick here, is to use a <b>reference</b>
  to the data structure:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;13&gt; x \%data
        0  HASH(0x8194bc4)
           'Hello World' =&gt; 'zip'
           'jerry' =&gt; 'welcome'
           'this' =&gt; 'that'
           'tom' =&gt; 'and'
           'welcome' =&gt; undef
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The reference is truly dumped and we can finally see what we're dealing with.
  Our quoting was perfectly valid but wrong for our purposes, with 'and jerry'
  being treated as 2 separate words rather than a phrase, thus throwing the
  evenly paired hash structure out of alignment.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ' <b>-w</b>' switch would have told us about this, had we used it at the
  start, and saved us a lot of trouble:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -w data
        Odd number of elements in hash assignment at ./data line 5.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We fix our quoting: 'tom' =&gt; q(and jerry), and run it again, this time we get
  our expected output:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -w data
        Hello World
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
While we're here, take a closer look at the ' <b>x</b>' command, it's really
  useful and will merrily dump out nested references, complete objects, partial
  objects - just about whatever you throw at it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let's make a quick object and x-plode it, first we'll start the debugger: it
  wants some form of input from STDIN, so we give it something non-committal, a
  zero:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -de 0
        Default die handler restored.
        Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.07
        Editor support available.
        Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.
        main::(-e:1):   0
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now build an on-the-fly object over a couple of lines (note the backslash):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;1&gt; $obj = bless({'unique_id'=&gt;'123', 'attr'=&gt; \
        cont:   {'col' =&gt; 'black', 'things' =&gt; [qw(this that etc)]}}, 'MY_class')
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And let's have a look at it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;2&gt; x $obj
        0  MY_class=HASH(0x828ad98)
                'attr' =&gt; HASH(0x828ad68)
        'col' =&gt; 'black'
        'things' =&gt; ARRAY(0x828abb8)
                0  'this'
                1  'that'
                2  'etc'
                'unique_id' =&gt; 123       
        DB&lt;3&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Useful, huh? You can eval nearly anything in there, and experiment with bits of
  code or regexes until the cows come home:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;3&gt; @data = qw(this that the other atheism leather theory scythe)
        DB&lt;4&gt; p 'saw -&gt; '.($cnt += map { print &quot;\t:\t$_\n&quot; } grep(/the/, sort @data))
        atheism
        leather
        other
        scythe
        the
        theory  
        saw -&gt; 6
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to see the command History, type an ' <b>H</b>':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;5&gt; H
        4: p 'saw -&gt; '.($cnt += map { print &quot;\t:\t$_\n&quot; } grep(/the/, sort @data))
        3: @data = qw(this that the other atheism leather theory scythe)
        2: x $obj
        1: $obj = bless({'unique_id'=&gt;'123', 'attr'=&gt;
        {'col' =&gt; 'black', 'things' =&gt; [qw(this that etc)]}}, 'MY_class')
        DB&lt;5&gt;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And if you want to repeat any previous command, use the exclamation: '
  <b>!</b>':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;5&gt; !4
        p 'saw -&gt; '.($cnt += map { print &quot;$_\n&quot; } grep(/the/, sort @data))
        atheism
        leather
        other
        scythe
        the
        theory  
        saw -&gt; 12
</pre>

Here's a simple program which converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit, it too
  has a problem:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w
        use strict;
        my $arg = $ARGV[0] || '-c20';
        if ($arg =~ /^\-(c|f)((\-|\+)*\d+(\.\d+)*)$/) {
                my ($deg, $num) = ($1, $2);
                my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num);
                if ($deg eq 'c') {
                        $deg = 'f';
                        $out = &amp;c2f($num);

                }
                $out = sprintf('%0.2f', $out);
                $out =~ s/^((\-|\+)*\d+)\.0+$/$1/;
                print &quot;$out $deg\n&quot;;
        } else {
                print &quot;Usage: $0 -[c|f] num\n&quot;;
        }
        exit;
        sub f2c {
                my $f = shift;
                my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9;
                return $c;
        }
        sub c2f {
                my $c = shift;
                my $f = 9 * $c / 5 + 32;
                return $f;
        }

For some reason, the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion fails to return the
  expected output. This is what it does:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; temp -c0.72
        33.30 f
        &gt; temp -f33.3
        162.94 c
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not very consistent! We'll set a breakpoint in the code manually and run it
  under the debugger to see what's going on. A breakpoint is a flag, to which
  the debugger will run without interruption, when it reaches the breakpoint, it
  will stop execution and offer a prompt for further interaction. In normal use,
  these debugger commands are completely ignored, and they are safe - if a
  little messy, to leave in production code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num);
        $DB::single=2; # insert at line 9!
        if ($deg eq 'c') 
                ...
        &gt; perl -d temp -f33.3
        Default die handler restored.

        Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.
        main::(temp:4): my $arg = $ARGV[0] || '-c100';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We'll simply continue down to our pre-set breakpoint with a ' <b>c</b>':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;1&gt; c
        main::(temp:10):                if ($deg eq 'c') {
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Followed by a view command to see where we are:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;1&gt; v
        7:              my ($deg, $num) = ($1, $2);
        8:              my ($in, $out) = ($num, $num);
        9:              $DB::single=2;
        10==&gt;           if ($deg eq 'c') {
        11:                     $deg = 'f';
        12:                     $out = &amp;c2f($num);
        13              } else {
        14:                     $deg = 'c';
        15:                     $out = &amp;f2c($num);
        16              }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And a print to show what values we're currently using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;1&gt; p $deg, $num
        f33.3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We can put another break point on any line beginning with a colon, we'll use
  line 17 as that's just as we come out of the subroutine, and we'd like to
  pause there later on:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;2&gt; b 17
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There's no feedback from this, but you can see what breakpoints are set by using
  the list 'L' command:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;3&gt; L
        temp:
                17:            print &quot;$out $deg\n&quot;;
                break if (1)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that to delete a breakpoint you use 'B'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now we'll continue down into our subroutine, this time rather than by line
  number, we'll use the subroutine name, followed by the now familiar 'v':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;3&gt; c f2c
        main::f2c(temp:30):             my $f = shift;  
        DB&lt;4&gt; v
        24:     exit;
        25
        26      sub f2c {
        27==&gt;           my $f = shift;
        28:             my $c = 5 * $f - 32 / 9; 
        29:             return $c;
        30      }
        31
        32      sub c2f {
        33:             my $c = shift;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if there was a subroutine call between us and line 29, and we wanted
  to <b>single-step</b> through it, we could use the '<b>s</b>' command, and to
  step over it we would use ' <b>n</b>' which would execute the sub, but not
  descend into it for inspection. In this case though, we simply continue down
  to line 29:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;4&gt; c 29  
        main::f2c(temp:29):             return $c;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And have a look at the return value:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;5&gt; p $c
        162.944444444444
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is not the right answer at all, but the sum looks correct. I wonder if it's
  anything to do with operator precedence? We'll try a couple of other
  possibilities with our sum:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;6&gt; p (5 * $f - 32 / 9)
        162.944444444444
        DB&lt;7&gt; p 5 * $f - (32 / 9) 
        162.944444444444
        DB&lt;8&gt; p (5 * $f) - 32 / 9
        162.944444444444
        DB&lt;9&gt; p 5 * ($f - 32) / 9
        0.722222222222221
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
:-) that's more like it! Ok, now we can set our return variable and we'll return
  out of the sub with an 'r':
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;10&gt; $c = 5 * ($f - 32) / 9
        DB&lt;11&gt; r
        scalar context return from main::f2c: 0.722222222222221
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Looks good, let's just continue off the end of the script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        DB&lt;12&gt; c
        0.72 c 
        Debugged program terminated.  Use q to quit or R to restart,
        use O inhibit_exit to avoid stopping after program termination,
        h q, h R or h O to get additional info.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A quick fix to the offending line (insert the missing parentheses) in the actual
  program and we're finished.

Ever wanted to know what a regex looked like? You'll need perl compiled with the
  DEBUGGING flag for this one:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -Dr -e '/^pe(a)*rl$/i'
        Compiling REx `^pe(a)*rl$'
        size 17 first at 2
        rarest char
         at 0
           1: BOL(2)
           2: EXACTF &lt;pe&gt;(4)
           4: CURLYN[1] {0,32767}(14)
           6:   NOTHING(8)
           8:   EXACTF &lt;a&gt;(0)
          12:   WHILEM(0)
          13: NOTHING(14)
          14: EXACTF &lt;rl&gt;(16)
          16: EOL(17)
          17: END(0)
        floating `'$ at 4..2147483647 (checking floating) stclass `EXACTF &lt;pe&gt;'

        Omitting $` $&amp; $' support.
        EXECUTING...
        Freeing REx: `^pe(a)*rl$'
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Did you really want to know? :-) For more gory details on getting regular
  expressions to work, have a look at perlre, perlretut, and to decode the
  mysterious labels (BOL and CURLYN, etc. above), see perldebguts.

  TIPS</a></h1>
To get all the output from your error log, and not miss any messages via helpful
  operating system buffering, insert a line like this, at the start of your
  script:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        $|=1;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To watch the tail of a dynamically growing logfile, (from the command line):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        tail -f $error_log
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Wrapping all die calls in a handler routine can be useful to see how, and from
  where, they're being called, perlvar has more information:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        BEGIN { $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { require Carp; Carp::confess(@_) } }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various useful techniques for the redirection of STDOUT and STDERR filehandles
  are explained in perlopentut and perlfaq8.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CGI"><a class="selflink" href="#CGI">CGI</a></h1>
Just a quick hint here for all those CGI programmers who can't figure out how on
  earth to get past that 'waiting for input' prompt, when running their CGI
  script from the command-line, try something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        &gt; perl -d my_cgi.pl -nodebug
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course CGI and perlfaq9 will tell you more.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="GUIs"><a class="selflink" href="#GUIs">GUIs</a></h1>
The command line interface is tightly integrated with an <b>emacs</b> extension
  and there's a <b>vi</b> interface too.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You don't have to do this all on the command line, though, there are a few GUI
  options out there. The nice thing about these is you can wave a mouse over a
  variable and a dump of its data will appear in an appropriate window, or in a
  popup balloon, no more tiresome typing of 'x $varname' :-)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In particular have a hunt around for the following:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ptkdb</b> perlTK based wrapper for the built-in debugger
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ddd</b> data display debugger
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PerlDevKit</b> and <b>PerlBuilder</b> are NT specific
<div class="Pp"></div>
NB. (more info on these and others would be appreciated).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUMMARY"><a class="selflink" href="#SUMMARY">SUMMARY</a></h1>
We've seen how to encourage good coding practices with <b>use strict</b> and
  <b>-w</b>. We can run the perl debugger <b>perl -d scriptname</b> to inspect
  your data from within the perl debugger with the <b>p</b> and <b>x</b>
  commands. You can walk through your code, set breakpoints with <b>b</b> and
  step through that code with <b>s</b> or <b>n</b>, continue with <b>c</b> and
  return from a sub with <b>r</b>. Fairly intuitive stuff when you get down to
  it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is of course lots more to find out about, this has just scratched the
  surface. The best way to learn more is to use perldoc to find out more about
  the language, to read the on-line help (perldebug is probably the next place
  to go), and of course, experiment.
