<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvechecker - Attempt to identify possible vulnerable
software on the system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvechecker [-i] [-l version.dat] [-b binlist.txt] [-c] [-C]
[-r] [-s] [-S] [-d] [-D] [-H] [-w watchlist.txt] [-f
filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cvechecker is a tool that, simply stated, matches your
installed software versus an online database of potential
vulnerable software and report the results back to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To be able to identify which
software is installed on your system, cvechecker asks you to
load a list of filenames (such as the output of a find
command) into the tool using the <br>
-b (or --binlist) argument. It will then try to match the
files against an internal list of known softwares. If it
finds a known software title, it will attempt to discover
the <br>
version of this software title. This internal list can be
updated using the -l (or --loaddata) arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To identify potential vulnerable
software, cvechecker downloads the CVE entries from the
Mitre site and stores it in the database. The results of the
CVE data and the scanned <br>
software on the system then provides us with the means to
generate a report, listing software/version sets that have
one (or more) CVE entries assigned to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker also supports a
watchlist. This is a file that contains the CPEs for which
you want to watch for CVEs. The watchlist behaves as if the
selected software is indeed in&acirc; <br>
stalled on your system (so it will be visible in the reports
that you pull from cvechecker). Using a watchlist allows
administrators to add software that is not detectable by
<br>
cvechecker (yet).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
INITIALIZATION <br>
To use cvechecker, you first need to initialize the the
databases. If your installation uses a server RDBMS (instead
of sqlite) this requires database owner privileges. Please
<br>
consult the user guide for more information on how to
initialize the database using SQL files (instead of database
owner) if this is not allowed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, download the CVE entries
from the Internet as well as the version detection rules and
load them in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pullcves pull</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOAD SOFTWARE LIST <br>
Every time your system changes, you need to (re)load the
software list in the database. Otherwise, cvechecker will
keep on reporting about software and versions that you might
<br>
not have anymore (or not report about software that you
have). A possible method is to use find to identify all
executable commands and libraries and load those in
cvechecker. I <br>
also recommend to add /proc/version as this allows
cvechecker to validate Linux kernel vulnerabilities as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find / -path /mnt -prune -o
-path /media -prune -o -type f -perm -o+x &gt; scanlist.txt
<br>
echo &quot;/proc/version&quot; &gt;&gt; scanlist.txt <br>
cvechecker -b filelist.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to only update a
part of the file database when you add the -d (--deltaonly)
option. This is useful when you integrate cvechecker with
your package management sys&acirc; <br>
tem. It also supports removing a part of the entries in the
database (such as when you uninstall software) when you add
the -D (--deletedeltaonly) option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOAD WATCHLIST <br>
Like the software list, you can have cvechecker load a
watchlist. This load can happen concurrently with the
filelist and also supports the delta options. Be aware
though that, <br>
if you do not use the delta option, loading a watchlist will
reload the database (clearing your detected software). As
such, it is recommended to use the watchlist at the same
<br>
time with your binary file listing, like so:pr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -b filelist.txt -w
watchlist.txt</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the reports,
watchlist-provided software will have a filename starting
with &quot;&lt;&lt;provided&gt;&gt;&quot; and named after
the CPE they represent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOAD LATEST CVE ENTRIES <br>
Pull in the latest CVE entries from the Internet (see also
man pullcves)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pullcves pull</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT ON POTENTIAL
VULNERABILITIES <br>
To get a report on potential vulnerabilities, run cvechecker
with the -r argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -r</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want cvechecker to report
on vulnerabilities that have been exposed with higher
versions of software that you have installed, you can add
the -H (--reporthigher) option. <br>
However, be warned that this will give lots of false
positives. The upside is that you can find potential
vulnerabilities in software whose CVE entries doesn&rsquo;t
contain all af&acirc; <br>
fected software versions (some CVEs only - falsely - contain
the highest version where the vulnerability was
present).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -r -H</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use the output of
the command as input for other commands (for instance, to
create a nice report), you can add the -C argument which
makes the output csv-like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -r -C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REPORT ON DETECTED SOFTWARE <br>
To get a report on the detected software, run cvechecker
with the -s (only software) or -S (software with files that
lead to the software detection) argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use the output of
the command as input for other commands (for instance, to
create a nice report), you can add the -C argument which
makes the output csv-like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvechecker -s -C</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND REFERENCE <br>
cvechecker supports the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --initdbs <br>
Initialize the databases</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;datafile&gt;,
--loaddata=&lt;datafile&gt; <br>
Load the version detection rules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;binlist&gt;,
--binlist=&lt;binlist&gt; <br>
Load the list of binaries available on the system. Accepts
standard input if &quot;-&quot; is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;cvelist&gt;,
--cvedata=&lt;cvelist&gt; <br>
Load the CSV file with CVE data. The CSV file can be
generated with nvd2simple, part of the cvechecker package.
Normally you don&rsquo;t need to call this argument as it
will <br>
be done by pullcves anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;binfilepath&gt;,
--fileinfo=&lt;binfilepath&gt; <br>
Load a single file path in cvechecker. This allows you to
verify if cvechecker can identify the binary or not (as it
will display the CPE data if it can)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --runcheck <br>
Match the identified software and versions against the known
CVE entries and report it on the screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --csvoutput <br>
Report using CSV-like output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only interesting when used with
-r or -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --showinstalled <br>
Show the detected software/version sets of this system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --showinstalledfiles <br>
Show the detected software/version sets of this system
together with the files that are used to detect this
software/version set</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --deltaonly <br>
The file passed on through the -b (--binlist) option only
contains files that need to be added to the file database
(and checked for versions) rather than a full file
sys&acirc; <br>
tem dump</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --deletedeltaonly <br>
The file passed on through the -b (--binlist) option only
contains files that have been uninstalled from the system,
and thus can be removed from the database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --reporthigher <br>
Do not only report on CVEs that affect software installed on
your system, but also on CVEs that affect higher versions of
the software that is installed on your system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;watchlist&gt;,
--watchlist=&lt;watchlist&gt; <br>
Load the watchlist information (a file containing CPE
entries - one per line - using the official CPE syntax)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
cvechecker will read the configuration file pointed towards
by the CVECHECKER_CONFFILE variable. If that variable is not
set, ~/.cvechecker.rc, /usr/local/etc/cvechecker.conf or
<br>
/etc/cvechecker.conf, whichever comes first. This file
contains the locations as well as other static parameters
for the cvechecker application. An example configuration
file is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# Generic settings <br>
# <br>
dbtype = &quot;mysql&quot;; <br>
#dbtype = &quot;sqlite3&quot;; <br>
cvecache = &quot;/var/lib/cvechecker/cache&quot;; <br>
datadir = &quot;/usr/share/cvechecker&quot;; <br>
stringcmd = &quot;/usr/bin/strings -n 3
&rsquo;@file@&rsquo;&quot;; <br>
version_url =
&quot;https://raw.github.com/sjvermeu/cvechecker/master/versions.dat&quot;;
<br>
#userkey = &quot;servertag&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# For SQLite3 <br>
# <br>
sqlite3: { <br>
localdb = &quot;/var/lib/cvechecker/local&quot;; <br>
globaldb = &quot;/var/lib/cvechecker/global.db&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# For MySQL <br>
# <br>
mysql: { <br>
dbname = &quot;cvechecker&quot;; <br>
dbuser = &quot;cvechecker_rw&quot;; <br>
dbpass = &quot;passwordforcvechecker_rw&quot;; <br>
dbhost = &quot;mysql.company.com&quot;; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dbtype tells the
cvechecker application which back-end to use. Currently,
&quot;sqlite&quot;, &quot;sqlite3&quot; and
&quot;mysql&quot; are supported (sqlite and sqlite3 result
in the same back-end)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; cvecache is a
(cvechecker writeable) directory where pullcves will
download all XML files and store the transformed XML2CSV
files (containing the CVE entry data). Although it <br>
is not used anymore after being imported into the local
databases, pullcves relies on the availability of the XML
files to find out if it needs to (re)download and import CVE
<br>
entries. So if you want to clean out the directory, make
(empty) files named after the XML files so that pullcves
does not redownload and reimport the CVE entry data (not
that <br>
this will render the application unusable, but it takes a
while)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; datadir is a
directory where cvechecker-related files are stored,
including the XSLT transformation files used to convert CVE
XML files in CSV files as well as the sample re&acirc; <br>
porting files as used in this document</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; stringcmd is the
command that cvechecker launches against a file to get the
files&rsquo; content. Currently, this is the only supported
method for cvechecker to identify the soft&acirc; <br>
ware/version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; version_url is
the location where pullcves can find the latest
software/version matching rules to identify installed
software on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; servertag is an
optional setting that is used in case of server RDBMS
backends to differentiate between the cvechecker clients. It
is optional, because cvechecker already uses <br>
the clients&rsquo; hostname as a key, but users can define a
second one. This can be both because they want to run
multiple clients from the same system/hostname, or because
they <br>
want a more proper key for their identification (such as a
server serial id or asset tag). This key is displayed in the
reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; sqlite3:
combines all sqlite specific settings, which are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; localdb is a
(cvechecker writeable) directory where cvechecker will store
its sqlite3 databases containing the CPE data
(identification information of software/versions) as <br>
well as the local systems&rsquo; matching file/software
pairs and all downloaded CVE entries</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; globaldb is a
(cvechecker writeable) sqlite3 database containing the
software/version matching rules and CPEs associated with
these rules</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mysql: combines
all mysql specific settings, which are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dbname is the
name of the cvechecker database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dbuser is the
user that cvechecker uses to connect to the database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dbpass is the
password that cvechecker uses to connect to the database and
authenticate itself</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dbhost is the
hostname where the database resides</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVECHECKER IS NOT COMPLETE <br>
The strength of cvechecker can only be fully used if the
list of supported software is huge. Currently, the list is
too small to cover most systems. However, if you want to
help <br>
us out in creating a larger database, please read on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format used to import
software detection rules is as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">,[filepart],1,[fileregexp],[contentregexp],a,[vendor],[product],[version],[update],[edition],[language]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first comma tells cvechecker
what the field separator is, so if you need to use the comma
in a regular expression, you can use a different field
separator. Just start the <br>
line with the separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; filepart is a
string which cvechecker will match against the filename (not
fully qualified). If it matches, cvechecker will continue
with this file&rsquo;s investigation. This is <br>
merely for performance reasons</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 1 is the type of
check that cvechecker will execute to find out about the
software&rsquo;s version. Currently, only 1 is supported. In
the future, more methods will be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;1&quot; method uses the output of strings
&lt;file&gt;. The output is then matched against a regular
expression (with grouping) and the results of the matches
are then used to <br>
identify the version, edition, ... of the software</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fileregexp is a
regular expression statement that cvechecker will run
against the filename (not fully qualified). If it matches,
cvechecker will continue with this file&rsquo;s in&acirc;
<br>
vestigation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; contextregexp is
a regular expression statement that cvechecker will run
against the output of the strings &lt;file&gt; command. If
it matches, the same regular expressions&rsquo; grouping
<br>
output will be used to fill up the metadata about the
software</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a means that
this is an application match. Other values are h (hardware)
or o (operating system). From this point onwards, all next
fields are part of the CPE specification</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; vendor is the
vendor name of the software. You can deduce the vendor name
by surfing to the software&rsquo;s homepage/vendor&rsquo;s
homepage. The vendor name is the domainname, without <br>
any prefix or suffix. For instance, www.redhat.com yields
&quot;redhat&quot;. If no vendor exists, then the vendor is
the name of the author. For instance, Sven Vermeulen yields
<br>
&quot;sven_vermeulen&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; product is the
name of the software title itself</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; version is the
version of the software. It will most likely use grouping
references (1, 2, ...) from the regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; update is the
update of the software. It will either be empty, or use the
grouping references (1, 2, ...) from the regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; edition is the
edition of the software. It will either be empty, or use the
grouping references (1, 2, ...) from the regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; language is the
language of the software. It will either be empty, or use
the grouping references (1, 2, ...) from the regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I have mentioned CPE. CPE stands
for Common Platform Enumeration and is a standard for
identifying a product with version. More information on CPE
can be found at <br>
http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm and
http://cpe.mitre.org/specification/index.html.</p>
