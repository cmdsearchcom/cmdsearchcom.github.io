<b>cwcp</b> is a curses-based program that takes over the complete operation of
  the terminal on which it is run. If colours are available on the terminal, it
  will produce a colour interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>cwcp</b> screen is divided into several distinct areas:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>The Menu Selection window</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Menu Selection window shows the main modes that
      <b>cwcp</b> offers. Use the <i>F10</i> and <i>F11</i> or <i>KEY_DOWN</i>
      and <i>KEY_UP</i> keys to select the mode. <i>F9</i> or <i>Return</i>
      start sending, and <i>F9</i> again or <i>Esc</i> stop sending. Changing
      mode also stops sending.</dd>

      20Hz.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      this window counts down to one, and after final minute of sending has
      elapsed, <b>cwcp</b> stops sending. The timer operates like a microwave or
      kitchen timer; it counts down on its own, but the time remaining can also
      be altered manually while the timer operates.</dd>

<div class="Pp"></div>
Eight screen colours are available for each: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
  magenta, cyan, and white. Use a key to cycle round these colours for the
  particular part of the display controlled by that key. On a change of colours,
  the complete screen is repainted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use <i>Ctrl-L</i> to repaint the complete screen, in case of screen corruption.
  Use <i>Ctrl-V</i> to clear the Morse Code Display Window. This command is
  available only when <b>cwcp</b> is not sending.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To leave <b>cwcp</b>, press <i>F12</i> or <i>Ctrl-C</i>, or select <i>Exit</i>
  on the mode menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All of the above command keys may be used while random characters are being
  sent, and when keyboard input is being sent.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If function keys are not available on the terminal, <i>Ctrl-&lt;key&gt;</i>
  combinations can be used. On the top row of letter keys on the keyboard, the
  keys <i>Ctrl-Q</i> to <i>Ctrl-I</i> may be used as alternatives for <i>F1</i>
  to <i>F8</i>, and on the second row of letter keys, <i>Ctrl-A</i> to
  <i>Ctrl-F</i> as alternatives for <i>F9</i> to <i>F12</i>. For
  <i>KEY_PPAGE</i> and <i>KEY_NPAGE</i>, use <i>Ctrl-O</i> and <i>Ctrl-P</i>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="RANDOM_CHARACTERS_AND_WORDS"><a class="selflink" href="#RANDOM_CHARACTERS_AND_WORDS">RANDOM
  CHARACTERS AND WORDS</a></h2>
<b>cwcp</b> sends random characters in groups of five, with a space between each
  group. After a period of sending, set in the <i>Time Control window</i>,
  <b>cwcp</b> stops automatically. It can also be stopped manually, before this
  time period expires.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When sending random words, <b>cwcp</b> sends the complete word, followed by a
  space. Because short words are easier to copy without writing, <b>cwcp</b>'s
  default dictionary contains only three, four, and five-letter words in its
  random words list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cwcp</b> chooses at random from a list of around 3000 words in its default
  dictionary. You can change this text using a configuration file, read at
  startup. See <i>CREATING CONFIGURATION FILES</i> below.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="NOTES_ON_USING_A_SOUND_CARD"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES_ON_USING_A_SOUND_CARD">NOTES
  ON USING A SOUND CARD</a></h2>
By default, <b>cw</b> tries to open default PulseAudio. If PulseAudio server is
  not accessible, cw tries to open OSS device &quot;/dev/audio&quot; to access
  the system sound card. This is generally the correct device to use, but for
  systems with special requirements, or those with multiple sound cards, the
  option <i>-d</i> or <i>--device</i>, combined with <i>-s</i> or
  <i>--system</i> can be used to specify the device and audio system for sound
  card access. If the sound card device cannot be set up, <b>cwcp</b> prints the
  error message
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">cannot set up soundcard sound</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sound card devices, when opened through OSS sound system, are usually
  single-access devices, so that when one process has opened the device, other
  processes are prevented from using it. In such cases <b>cwcp</b> will of
  course conflict with any other programs that expect exclusive use of the
  system sound card (for example, MP3 players). If <b>cwcp</b> finds that the
  sound card is already busy, it prints the error message
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">open /dev/audio: Device or resource busy</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and exits.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The sound card device is not used if <b>cwcp</b> is only sending tones on the
  console speaker.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="AUDIO_OUTPUT_-_DEFAULTS_AND_SELECTION"><a class="selflink" href="#AUDIO_OUTPUT_-_DEFAULTS_AND_SELECTION">AUDIO
  OUTPUT - DEFAULTS AND SELECTION</a></h2>
<b>cwcp</b> first tries to access sound card using PulseAudio sound system,
  using default device name, unless user specifies other audio device with
  option <i>-d</i> or <i>--device</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cwcp</b> then tries to access sound card using OSS audio system and default
  OSS audio device name ('/dev/audio'), unless user specifies other audio device
  with option <i>-d</i> or <i>--device</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If opening soundcard through OSS fails, <b>cwcp</b> tries to access the sound
  card using ALSA audio system, and default ALSA audio device name ('default'),
  unless user specifies other audio device with option <i>-d</i> or
  <i>--device</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If opening soundcard through ALSA also fails, <b>cwcp</b> tries to access system
  console buzzer using default buzzer device '/dev/console', unless user
  specifies other audio device with option <i>-d</i> or <i>--device</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is very common that in order to access the console buzzer device user has to
  have root privileges. For that reason trying to open console buzzer almost
  always fails. This is not a program's bug, this is a result of operating
  system's restrictions. Making <b>cwcp</b> an suid binary bypasses this
  restriction. The program does not fork() or exec(), so making it suid should
  be relatively safe. Note however that this practice is discouraged for
  security reasons.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As stated, user can tell <b>cwcp</b> which device to use, using <i>-d</i> or
  <i>--device</i> option. Which device files are suitable will depend on which
  operating system is running, which system user ID runs <b>cwcp</b>, and which
  user groups user belongs to.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="CREATING_CONFIGURATION_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#CREATING_CONFIGURATION_FILES">CREATING
  CONFIGURATION FILES</a></h2>
<b>cwcp</b> contains a default set of modes and practice text that should be
  enough to begin with. It can however read in a file at startup that
  reconfigures these to provide different character groupings, word sets, and
  other practice data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To read a configuration file, use the <i>-f</i> or <i>--infile</i> command line
  options. The file should introduce each <b>cwcp</b> mode with a section header
  in '[' ... ']' characters, followed by the practice text for that mode, with
  elements separated by whitespace. Lines starting with a semicolon or hash are
  treated as comments. For example
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">; Simple example mode
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    [ A to Z ]
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cwcp</b> will generate five character groups for modes whose elements are all
  single characters, and treat other modes as having elements that are complete
  words. As a starting point for customized modes, <b>cwcp</b> will write its
  default configuration to a file if given the undocumented <i>-#</i> option,
  for example &quot;cwcp -# /tmp/cwcp.ini&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<b>cwcp</b> owes its existence to the DOS Morse code tutor CP222C.EXE, by
  VU2ZAP. CP222C.EXE seemed to offer the right range of facilities for learning
  Morse code in a simple, easy-to-use, and compact package. <b>cwcp</b> is very
  much modeled on that DOS program, and should prove useful both for learning
  the code, and for experienced CW users who want, or need, to improve their
  receiving speed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Curses may impose a delay when recognizing the <i>Esc</i> key alone, as this
  character is often the first of a sequence generated by a function key.
  <b>cwcp</b> responds instantly to <i>F9</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The characters echoed in the Morse Code Display window may be ASCII
  representations of Morse procedural signals; see the <b>cw</b>(7,LOCAL) man
  page for details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="HINTS_ON_LEARNING_MORSE_CODE"><a class="selflink" href="#HINTS_ON_LEARNING_MORSE_CODE">HINTS
  ON LEARNING MORSE CODE</a></h2>
Here are a few hints and tips that may help with the process of learning Morse
  code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Firstly, do <b>NOT</b> think of the elements as dots and dashes. Instead, think
  of them as dits and dahs (so 'A' is di-dah). If you think of them in this way,
  the process of translating sound into characters will be learned much more
  easily.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not learn the characters from a table. Learn them by watching the groups
  appear on the screen, and listening to the sounds produced as each is sent. In
  the very initial stages, it may be beneficial if you can find a person to take
  you through the first stages of recognizing characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not waste your time learning Morse code at 5 WPM. Set the speed to 12 or 15
  WPM, but use extra spacing (the Gap window) to reduce the effective speed to
  much lower - around four or five WPM <i>effective</i> speed. This way, you
  will learn the rhythm of the characters as they are sent, but still have
  plenty of time between characters. As you practice, decrease the gap to zero.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Learn in stages. Start by learning the <i>EISH5</i> group, then progress down
  through the menu as each group is mastered. The groups contain characters
  which are in some way related, either by sound, or by type of character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you have completed all the groups <i>EISH5</i> to <i>&quot;'$(+:_</i> (or
  <i>23789</i> if you do not want to learn procedural signals yet), use the full
  character set options, and the words and CW words options, to sharpen your
  skill. If you have difficulties with particular characters, return to that
  group and practice again with a smaller character set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Resist the temptation to try to learn or improve your speed by copying off-air.
  You will not know what speed you are working at, and much hand-sent Morse is
  not perfectly formed. What you can gain off-air though is a general
  'resilience', a tolerance for Morse code where the timing of individual
  elements, or spacing between characters and words, is not 100% accurate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If working to attain a particular speed for a test, always set the speed
  slightly higher. For example, if aiming for 12 WPM, set the tutor speed to 14
  or 15 WPM. This way, when you drop back to 12 WPM you will feel much more
  relaxed about copying. Be aware that <b>cwcp</b> is not necessarily going to
  send at exactly the speed you set, due to limitations in what can be done with
  UNIX timers. It often sends at a slower speed than you set, so be very careful
  with this if you have a target speed that you need to reach.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Use the program to make cassette tapes that you can take with you in a walkman
  or in the car, for long journeys. You do not have to write down everything you
  hear to practice Morse code. Simply listening to the shapes of characters over
  a period will help to train your brain into effortless recognition. In fact,
  slavishly writing everything down becomes a barrier at speeds of 15-20 WPM and
  above, so if you can begin to copy without writing each character down, you
  will find progress much easier above these speeds. But do not over-use these
  tapes, otherwise you will quickly memorize them. Re-record them with new
  contents at very regular intervals.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Try to spend at least 15-30 minutes each day practicing. Much less than this
  will make progress glacially slow. But significantly more than an hour or so
  may just result in you becoming tired, but not improving. Recognize when it is
  time to stop for the day.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not worry if you reach a speed 'plateau'. This is common, and you will soon
  pass it with a little perseverance.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At higher speeds, CW operators tend to recognize the 'shape' of whole words,
  rather than the individual characters within the words. The CW words menu
  option can be used to help to practice and develop this skill.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ERRORS_AND_OMISSIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#ERRORS_AND_OMISSIONS">ERRORS
  AND OMISSIONS</a></h1>
The calibration option is a bit ropy. It simply sends PARIS repeatedly, and
  relies on you to time the sending and then work out if any adjustment to the
  speed is really necessary. Automatic calibration by making measurements over a
  given period would be a lot better.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Generating random CW QSOs would be fun to do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A facility to allow a user to key Morse into the system, and to have it send
  code, and measure the accuracy of keying, would be nice.
