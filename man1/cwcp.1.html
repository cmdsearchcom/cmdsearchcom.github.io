<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cwcp - curses-based Morse tutor program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cwcp [-s --system=SYSTEM] [-d --device=DEVICE] [-w
--wpm=WPM] [-t --tone=HZ] [-v --volume=PERCENT] [-g
--gap=GAP] [-k --weighting=WEIGHT] [-T --time=TIME] [-f,
--infile=FILE] <br>
[-F, --outifile=FILE] [-h --help] [-V --version]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwcp installed on GNU/Linux
systems understands both short form and long form command
line options. cwcp installed on other operating systems may
understand only the short form <br>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are no mandatory
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options may be predefined in the
environment variable CWCP_OPTIONS. If defined, these options
are used first; command line options take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cwcp is a curses-based interactive Morse code tutor program.
It allows menu selection from a number of sending modes, and
also permits character sounding options, such as the <br>
tone pitch, and sending speed, to be varied from the
keyboard using a full-screen user interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
cwcp understands the following command line options. The
long form options may not be available in non-LINUX
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --system=SYSTEM <br>
Specifies the way that cwcp generates tones. Valid values
are: null for no tones, just timings, console for tones
through the console speaker, alsa for tones generated <br>
through the system sound card using ALSA sound system, oss
for tones generated through system sound card using OSS
sound system, pulseaudio for tones generated through <br>
system sound card using PulseAudio sound system, soundcard
for tones generated through the system sound card, but
without explicit selection of sound system. These values
<br>
can be shortened to &rsquo;n&rsquo;, &rsquo;c&rsquo;,
&rsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;o&rsquo;, &rsquo;p&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;s&rsquo;, respectively. The default value is
&rsquo;pulseaudio&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --device=DEVICE <br>
Specifies the device file to open for generating a sound.
cwcp will use default device if none is specified. The
default devices are: /dev/console for sound produced <br>
through console, default for ALSA sound system, /dev/audio
for OSS sound system, a default device for PulseAudio sound
system. See also NOTES ON USING A SOUND CARD below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wpm=WPM <br>
Sets the initial sending speed in words per minute. The
value must be between 4 and 60. The default value is 12
WPM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --tone=HZ <br>
Sets the initial sounder pitch in Hz. This value must be
between 0 and 4,000. A value of 0 selects silent operation,
and can be used for timing checks or other testing. <br>
The default value is 800Hz,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --volume=PERCENT <br>
Sets the initial sending volume, as a percentage of full
scale volume. The value must be between 0 and 100. The
default value is 70 %. Sound volumes work fully for <br>
sound card tones, but cwcp cannot control the volume of
tones from the console speaker. In this case, a volume of
zero is silent, and all other volume values are simply <br>
sounded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gap=GAP <br>
Sets the initial extra gap, in dot lengths, between
characters (the &rsquo;Farnsworth&rsquo; delay). It must be
between 0 and 60. The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --weighting=WEIGHT <br>
Sets the initial weighting, as a percentage of dot lengths.
It must be between 20 and 80. The default is 50.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --time=TIME <br>
Sets the initial practice time, in minutes. cwcp stops after
generating random Morse code for this period. The value must
be between 1 and 99. The default is 15 min&acirc; <br>
utes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --infile=FILE <br>
Specifies a text file that cwcp can read to configure its
practice text. See CREATING CONFIGURATION FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --outfile=FILE <br>
Specifies a text file to which cwcp should write its current
practice text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Prints short help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Prints information about program&rsquo;s version, authors
and license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER INTERFACE <br>
cwcp is a curses-based program that takes over the complete
operation of the terminal on which it is run. If colours are
available on the terminal, it will produce a colour <br>
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cwcp screen is divided into
several distinct areas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Menu Selection window <br>
The Menu Selection window shows the main modes that cwcp
offers. Use the F10 and F11 or KEY_DOWN and KEY_UP keys to
select the mode. F9 or Return start sending, and F9 <br>
again or Esc stop sending. Changing mode also stops
sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Morse Code Display window
<br>
This window displays each Morse code character after it has
been sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Speed Control window <br>
The Speed window shows the current Morse code sending speed
in words per minute. Pressing the F2 or KEY_RIGHT keys
increases the speed; pressing the F1 or KEY_LEFT keys <br>
decreases the speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Tone Control window <br>
This window shows the current Morse code tone pitch. Use the
F4 or KEY_HOME key to increase the pitch, and the F3 or
KEY_END key to decrease it. Values change in steps <br>
of 20Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Volume Control window <br>
This window shows the current Morse code volume. Use the F6
key to increase the volume, and the F5 key to decrease it.
Values change in steps of 1%. Note that cwcp can&acirc; <br>
not control the volume of the console speaker, so the volume
control only works effectively for tones generated on the
sound card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Gap Control window <br>
This window shows the current additional
&rsquo;Farnsworth&rsquo; gaps to be appended after each
Morse code character is sounded. Use F8 to increase the gap,
and F7 to decrease it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Time Control window <br>
This window shows the selected practice time. After
generating Morse code in a particular mode for this amount
of time, cwcp stops automatically. Use KEY_NPAGE to <br>
increase the time, and KEY_PPAGE to decrease it. During
sending, the value in this window counts down to one, and
after final minute of sending has elapsed, cwcp stops <br>
sending. The timer operates like a microwave or kitchen
timer; it counts down on its own, but the time remaining can
also be altered manually while the timer operates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following keys vary the
screen colours:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ key Changes the foreground
colour of the window boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} key Changes the background
colour of the window boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ key Changes the foreground
colour of the window contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">] key Changes the background
colour of the window contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eight screen colours are
available for each: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan, and white. Use a key to cycle round these
colours for the particular part of the <br>
display controlled by that key. On a change of colours, the
complete screen is repainted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use Ctrl-L to repaint the
complete screen, in case of screen corruption. Use Ctrl-V to
clear the Morse Code Display Window. This command is
available only when cwcp is not <br>
sending.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To leave cwcp, press F12 or
Ctrl-C, or select Exit on the mode menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All of the above command keys
may be used while random characters are being sent, and when
keyboard input is being sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If function keys are not
available on the terminal, Ctrl-&lt;key&gt; combinations can
be used. On the top row of letter keys on the keyboard, the
keys Ctrl-Q to Ctrl-I may be used as <br>
alternatives for F1 to F8, and on the second row of letter
keys, Ctrl-A to Ctrl-F as alternatives for F9 to F12. For
KEY_PPAGE and KEY_NPAGE, use Ctrl-O and Ctrl-P.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RANDOM CHARACTERS AND WORDS <br>
cwcp sends random characters in groups of five, with a space
between each group. After a period of sending, set in the
Time Control window, cwcp stops automatically. It can <br>
also be stopped manually, before this time period
expires.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When sending random words, cwcp
sends the complete word, followed by a space. Because short
words are easier to copy without writing, cwcp&rsquo;s
default dictionary contains only <br>
three, four, and five-letter words in its random words
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwcp chooses at random from a
list of around 3000 words in its default dictionary. You can
change this text using a configuration file, read at
startup. See CREATING CONFIGURA&acirc; <br>
TION FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES ON USING A SOUND CARD <br>
By default, cw tries to open default PulseAudio. If
PulseAudio server is not accessible, cw tries to open OSS
device &quot;/dev/audio&quot; to access the system sound
card. This is gener&acirc; <br>
ally the correct device to use, but for systems with special
requirements, or those with multiple sound cards, the option
-d or --device, combined with -s or --system can be used
<br>
to specify the device and audio system for sound card
access. If the sound card device cannot be set up, cwcp
prints the error message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot set up soundcard
sound</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sound card devices, when opened
through OSS sound system, are usually single-access devices,
so that when one process has opened the device, other
processes are prevented from <br>
using it. In such cases cwcp will of course conflict with
any other programs that expect exclusive use of the system
sound card (for example, MP3 players). If cwcp finds that
<br>
the sound card is already busy, it prints the error
message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">open /dev/audio: Device or
resource busy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sound card device is not
used if cwcp is only sending tones on the console
speaker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUDIO OUTPUT - DEFAULTS AND
SELECTION <br>
cwcp first tries to access sound card using PulseAudio sound
system, using default device name, unless user specifies
other audio device with option -d or --device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwcp then tries to access sound
card using OSS audio system and default OSS audio device
name (&rsquo;/dev/audio&rsquo;), unless user specifies other
audio device with option -d or --device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If opening soundcard through OSS
fails, cwcp tries to access the sound card using ALSA audio
system, and default ALSA audio device name
(&rsquo;default&rsquo;), unless user specifies other <br>
audio device with option -d or --device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If opening soundcard through
ALSA also fails, cwcp tries to access system console buzzer
using default buzzer device &rsquo;/dev/console&rsquo;,
unless user specifies other audio device with <br>
option -d or --device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is very common that in order
to access the console buzzer device user has to have root
privileges. For that reason trying to open console buzzer
almost always fails. This is <br>
not a program&rsquo;s bug, this is a result of operating
system&rsquo;s restrictions. Making cwcp an suid binary
bypasses this restriction. The program does not fork() or
exec(), so making <br>
it suid should be relatively safe. Note however that this
practice is discouraged for security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As stated, user can tell cwcp
which device to use, using -d or --device option. Which
device files are suitable will depend on which operating
system is running, which system <br>
user ID runs cwcp, and which user groups user belongs
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING CONFIGURATION FILES
<br>
cwcp contains a default set of modes and practice text that
should be enough to begin with. It can however read in a
file at startup that reconfigures these to provide different
<br>
character groupings, word sets, and other practice data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To read a configuration file,
use the -f or --infile command line options. The file should
introduce each cwcp mode with a section header in
&rsquo;[&rsquo; ... &rsquo;]&rsquo; characters, followed by
<br>
the practice text for that mode, with elements separated by
whitespace. Lines starting with a semicolon or hash are
treated as comments. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; Simple example mode <br>
[ A to Z ] <br>
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwcp will generate five
character groups for modes whose elements are all single
characters, and treat other modes as having elements that
are complete words. As a starting <br>
point for customized modes, cwcp will write its default
configuration to a file if given the undocumented -# option,
for example &quot;cwcp -# /tmp/cwcp.ini&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
cwcp owes its existence to the DOS Morse code tutor
CP222C.EXE, by VU2ZAP. CP222C.EXE seemed to offer the right
range of facilities for learning Morse code in a simple,
easy-to- <br>
use, and compact package. cwcp is very much modeled on that
DOS program, and should prove useful both for learning the
code, and for experienced CW users who want, or need, to
<br>
improve their receiving speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Curses may impose a delay when
recognizing the Esc key alone, as this character is often
the first of a sequence generated by a function key. cwcp
responds instantly to F9.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The characters echoed in the
Morse Code Display window may be ASCII representations of
Morse procedural signals; see the cw(7,LOCAL) man page for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HINTS ON LEARNING MORSE CODE
<br>
Here are a few hints and tips that may help with the process
of learning Morse code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Firstly, do NOT think of the
elements as dots and dashes. Instead, think of them as dits
and dahs (so &rsquo;A&rsquo; is di-dah). If you think of
them in this way, the process of translat&acirc; <br>
ing sound into characters will be learned much more
easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not learn the characters from
a table. Learn them by watching the groups appear on the
screen, and listening to the sounds produced as each is
sent. In the very initial <br>
stages, it may be beneficial if you can find a person to
take you through the first stages of recognizing
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not waste your time learning
Morse code at 5 WPM. Set the speed to 12 or 15 WPM, but use
extra spacing (the Gap window) to reduce the effective speed
to much lower - around <br>
four or five WPM effective speed. This way, you will learn
the rhythm of the characters as they are sent, but still
have plenty of time between characters. As you practice,
<br>
decrease the gap to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Learn in stages. Start by
learning the EISH5 group, then progress down through the
menu as each group is mastered. The groups contain
characters which are in some way related, <br>
either by sound, or by type of character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have completed all the
groups EISH5 to &quot;&rsquo;$(+:_ (or 23789 if you do not
want to learn procedural signals yet), use the full
character set options, and the words and CW <br>
words options, to sharpen your skill. If you have
difficulties with particular characters, return to that
group and practice again with a smaller character set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Resist the temptation to try to
learn or improve your speed by copying off-air. You will not
know what speed you are working at, and much hand-sent Morse
is not perfectly <br>
formed. What you can gain off-air though is a general
&rsquo;resilience&rsquo;, a tolerance for Morse code where
the timing of individual elements, or spacing between
characters and words, <br>
is not 100% accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If working to attain a
particular speed for a test, always set the speed slightly
higher. For example, if aiming for 12 WPM, set the tutor
speed to 14 or 15 WPM. This way, when <br>
you drop back to 12 WPM you will feel much more relaxed
about copying. Be aware that cwcp is not necessarily going
to send at exactly the speed you set, due to limitations in
<br>
what can be done with UNIX timers. It often sends at a
slower speed than you set, so be very careful with this if
you have a target speed that you need to reach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the program to make cassette
tapes that you can take with you in a walkman or in the car,
for long journeys. You do not have to write down everything
you hear to practice <br>
Morse code. Simply listening to the shapes of characters
over a period will help to train your brain into effortless
recognition. In fact, slavishly writing everything down <br>
becomes a barrier at speeds of 15-20 WPM and above, so if
you can begin to copy without writing each character down,
you will find progress much easier above these speeds. But
<br>
do not over-use these tapes, otherwise you will quickly
memorize them. Re-record them with new contents at very
regular intervals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Try to spend at least 15-30
minutes each day practicing. Much less than this will make
progress glacially slow. But significantly more than an hour
or so may just result in you <br>
becoming tired, but not improving. Recognize when it is time
to stop for the day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not worry if you reach a
speed &rsquo;plateau&rsquo;. This is common, and you will
soon pass it with a little perseverance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At higher speeds, CW operators
tend to recognize the &rsquo;shape&rsquo; of whole words,
rather than the individual characters within the words. The
CW words menu option can be used to help <br>
to practice and develop this skill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERRORS AND OMISSIONS <br>
The calibration option is a bit ropy. It simply sends PARIS
repeatedly, and relies on you to time the sending and then
work out if any adjustment to the speed is really
neces&acirc; <br>
sary. Automatic calibration by making measurements over a
given period would be a lot better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generating random CW QSOs would
be fun to do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A facility to allow a user to
key Morse into the system, and to have it send code, and
measure the accuracy of keying, would be nice.</p>
