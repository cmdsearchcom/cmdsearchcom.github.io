<p>LEAVE(1) BSD General Commands Manual LEAVE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
leave &acirc; remind you when you have to leave</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
leave [[+]hhmm]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
leave waits until the specified time (within the next 12
hours), then reminds you that you have to leave by writing
to the TTY that you executed leave on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You are reminded 5 minutes and 1
minute before the actual time, at the time, and every minute
thereafter. When you log off, leave exits just before it
would have printed the next <br>
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
hhmm The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time
in hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and mm are minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, all times are converted
to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.
An attempt to set an alarm for farther into the future will
be truncated to <br>
within the next 12 hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ If the time is preceded by
&acirc;+&acirc;, the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no argument is given, leave
prompts with &quot;When do you have to leave?&quot; A reply
of newline causes leave to exit, otherwise the reply is
assumed to be a time. This form is suit&acirc; <br>
able for inclusion in a ~/.login or ~/.profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
calendar(1), csh(1), sh(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The leave command appeared in 3.0BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
In the modern age with X(1) and window multiplexing programs
like window(1) and screen(1), the leave command&rsquo;s
reminders and admonitions might not be seen if the user has
the win&acirc; <br>
dow where leave was started minimized or obscured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This all begs for a more general
user notifications system to be implemented.</p>
