<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
quilt - tool to manage series of patches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
quilt [-h] command [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping
track of the changes each patch makes. Patches can be
applied, un-applied, refreshed, etc. The key philosophical
con&acirc; <br>
cept is that your primary output is patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With quilt, all work occurs
within a single directory tree. Commands can be invoked from
anywhere within the source tree. They are of the form quilt
cmd similar to CVS, svn or <br>
git commands. They can be abbreviated as long as the
specified part of the command is unique. All commands print
some help text with quilt cmd -h.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quilt manages a stack of
patches. Patches are applied incrementally on top of the
base tree plus all preceding patches. They can be pushed on
top of the stack (quilt push), and <br>
popped off the stack (quilt pop). Commands are available for
querying the contents of the series file (quilt series, see
below), the contents of the stack (quilt applied, quilt <br>
previous, quilt top), and the patches that are not applied
at a particular moment (quilt next, quilt unapplied). By
default, most commands apply to the topmost patch on the
<br>
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patch files are located in the
patches sub-directory of the source tree (see EXAMPLE OF
WORKING TREE below). The QUILT_PATCHES environment variable
can be used to override this <br>
location. When not found in the current directory, that
subdirectory is searched recursively in the parent
directories (this is similar to the way git searches for its
configura&acirc; <br>
tion files). The patches directory may contain
sub-directories. It may also be a symbolic link instead of a
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file called series contains a
list of patch file names that defines the order in which
patches are applied. Unless there are means by which series
files can be generated auto&acirc; <br>
matically, it is usually provided along with a set of
patches. In this file, each patch file name is on a separate
line. Patch files are identified by path names that are
rela&acirc; <br>
tive to the patches directory; patches may be in
sub-directories below this directory. Lines in the series
file that start with a hash character (#) are ignored. You
can also <br>
add a comment after each patch file name, introduced by a
space followed by a hash character. When quilt adds,
removes, or renames patches, it automatically updates the
series <br>
file. Users of quilt can modify series files while some
patches are applied, as long as the applied patches remain
in their original order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Different series files can be
used to assemble patches in different ways, corresponding
for example to different development branches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before a patch is applied (or
&lsquo;&lsquo;pushed on the stack&rsquo;&rsquo;), copies of
all files the patch modifies are saved to the .pc/patch
directory. The patch is added to the list of currently <br>
applied patches (.pc/applied-patches). Later when a patch is
regenerated (quilt refresh), the backup copies in .pc/patch
are compared with the current versions of the files in <br>
the source tree using GNU diff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation related to a patch
can be put at the beginning of a patch file. Quilt is
careful to preserve all text that precedes the actual patch
when doing a refresh. (This is <br>
limited to patches in unified format; see diff
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The series file is looked up in
the .pc directory, in the root of the source tree, and in
the patches directory. The first series file that is found
is used. This may also be a <br>
symbolic link, or a file with multiple hard links. Usually,
only one series file is used for a set of patches, so the
patches sub-directory is a convenient location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .pc directory and its
sub-directories cannot be relocated, but it can be a
symbolic link. While patches are applied to the source tree,
this directory is essential for many <br>
operations, including taking patches off the stack (quilt
pop), and refreshing patches (quilt refresh). Files in the
.pc directory are automatically removed when they are no
<br>
longer needed, so there is no need to clean up manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT COMMANDS REFERENCE <br>
add [-P patch] {file} ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add one or more files to the
topmost or named patch. Files must be added to the patch
before being modified. Files that are modified by patches
already applied on top of <br>
the specified patch cannot be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patch to add files to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">annotate [-P patch] {file}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print an annotated listing of
the specified file showing which patches modify which lines.
Only applied patches are included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stop checking for changes at the
specified rather than the topmost patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete [-r] [--backup]
[patch|-n]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove the specified or topmost
patch from the series file. If the patch is applied, quilt
will attempt to remove it first. (Only the topmost patch can
be removed right <br>
now.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Delete the next patch after
topmost, rather than the specified or topmost patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Remove the deleted patch file
from the patches directory as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename the patch file to patch~

num|-c|-C num] [--combine patch|-z] [-R] [-P patch]
[--snapshot] [--diff=utility] [--no-timestamps] [--no-index]
[--sort] [--color[=always|auto|never]] <br>
[file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Produces a diff of the specified
file(s) in the topmost or specified patch. If no files are
specified, all files that are modified are included.</p>

Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p ab <br>
Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the
original and new filenames instead of the default
dir.orig/file and dir/file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, -U num, -c, -C num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a unified diff (-u, -U)
with num lines of context. Create a context diff (-c, -C)
with num lines of context. The number of context lines
defaults to 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-timestamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not include file timestamps
in patch headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not output Index: lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Write to standard output the

patch. (Defaults to the topmost patch.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--combine patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a combined diff for all
patches between this patch and the patch specified with -P.
A patch name of &lsquo;-&rsquo; is equivalent to specifying
the first applied patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--snapshot</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff against snapshot (see
&lsquo;quilt snapshot -h&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--diff=utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the specified utility for
generating the diff. The utility is invoked with the
original and new file name as arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color[=always|auto|never]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use syntax coloring (auto
activates it only if the output is a tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort <br>
Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">edit file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit the specified file(s) in
$EDITOR after adding it (them) to the topmost patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files [-v] [-a] [-l] [--combine
patch] [patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the list of files that the
topmost or specified patch changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a List all files in all applied
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Add patch name to output.</p>

output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--combine patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a listing for all patches
between this patch and the topmost or specified patch. A
patch name of &lsquo;-&rsquo; is equivalent to specifying
the first applied patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fold [-R] [-q] [-f] [-p
strip-level]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Integrate the patch read from
standard input into the topmost patch: After making sure
that all files modified are part of the topmost patch, the
patch is applied with the <br>
specified strip level (which defaults to 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Apply patch in reverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force apply, even if the
patch has rejects. Unless in quiet mode, apply the patch
interactively: the patch utility may ask questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p strip-level</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of pathname
components to strip from file names when applying
patchfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fork [new_name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fork the topmost patch. Forking
a patch means creating a verbatim copy of it under a new
name, and use that new name instead of the original one in
the current series. This <br>
is useful when a patch has to be modified, but the original
version of it should be preserved, e.g. because it is used
in another series, or for the history. A typical <br>
sequence of commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If new_name is missing, the name
of the forked patch will be the current patch name, followed
by &lsquo;-2&rsquo;. If the patch name already ends in a
dash-and-number, the number is <br>
further incremented (e.g., patch.diff, patch-2.diff,
patch-3.diff).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">graph [--all] [--reduce]
[--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [-T ps] [patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Generate a dot(1) directed graph
showing the dependencies between applied patches. A patch
depends on another patch if both touch the same file or,
with the --lines option, <br>
if their modifications overlap. Unless otherwise specified,
the graph includes all patches that the topmost patch
depends on. When a patch name is specified, instead of the
<br>
topmost patch, create a graph for the specified patch. The
graph will include all other patches that this patch depends
on, as well as all patches that depend on this patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--all <br>
Generate a graph including all applied patches and their
dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reduce</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Eliminate transitive edges from
the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lines[=num]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compute dependencies by looking
at the lines the patches modify. Unless a different num is
specified, two lines of context are included.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--edge-labels=files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label graph edges with the file
names that the adjacent patches modify.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T ps <br>
Directly produce a PostScript output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grep [-h|options] {pattern}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grep through the source files,
recursively, skipping patches and quilt meta-information. If
no filename argument is given, the whole source tree is
searched. Please see the <br>
grep(1) manual page for options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print this help. The grep -h
option can be passed after a double-dash (--). Search
expressions that start with a dash can be passed after a
second double-dash (-- --).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header [-a|-r|-e] [--backup]
[--strip-diffstat] [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print or change the header of
the topmost or specified patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, -r, -e</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Append to (-a) or replace (-r)
the exiting patch header, or edit (-e) the header in
$EDITOR. If none of these options is given, print the patch
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strip-diffstat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strip diffstat output from the
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strip-trailing-whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strip trailing whitespace at the
end of lines of the header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a backup copy of the old
version of a patch as patch~.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">import [-p num] [-R] [-P patch]
[-f] [-d {o|a|n}] patchfile ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import external patches. The
patches will be inserted following the current top patch,
and must be pushed after import to apply them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Number of directory levels to
strip when applying (default=1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apply patch in reverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patch filename to use inside
quilt. This option can only be used when importing a single
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Overwrite/update existing
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d {o|a|n}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When overwriting in existing
patch, keep the old (o), all (a), or new (n) patch header.
If both patches include headers, this option must be
specified. This option is <br>
only effective when -f is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mail {--mbox file|--send} [-m
text] [-M file] [--prefix prefix] [--sender ...] [--from
...] [--to ...] [--cc ...] [--bcc ...] [--subject ...]
[--reply-to message] [--charset ...] <br>
[--signature file] [first_patch [last_patch]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create mail messages from a
specified range of patches, or all patches in the series
file, and either store them in a mailbox file, or send them
immediately. The editor is <br>
opened with a template for the introduction. Please see
/usr/share/doc/quilt/README.MAIL for details. When
specifying a range of patches, a first patch name of
&lsquo;-&rsquo; denotes <br>
the first, and a last patch name of &lsquo;-&rsquo; denotes
the last patch in the series.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text to use as the text in the
introduction. When this option is used, the editor will not
be invoked, and the patches will be processed
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like the -m option, but read the
introduction from file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix prefix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use an alternate prefix in the
bracketed part of the subjects generated. Defaults to
&lsquo;patch&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mbox file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Store all messages in the
specified file in mbox format. The mbox can later be sent
using formail, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Send the messages directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sender</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The envelope sender address to
use. The address must be of the form
&lsquo;user@domain.name&rsquo;. No display name is
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--from, --subject</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The values for the From and
Subject headers to use. If no --from option is given, the
value of the --sender option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--to, --cc, --bcc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Append a recipient to the To,
Cc, or Bcc header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--charset</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specify a particular message
encoding on systems which don&rsquo;t use UTF-8 or
ISO-8859-15. This character encoding must match the one used
in the patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--signature file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Append the specified signature
to messages (defaults to ~/.signature if found; use
&lsquo;-&rsquo; for no signature).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reply-to message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add the appropriate headers to
reply to the specified message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new [-p n|-p ab] {patchname}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a new patch with the
specified file name, and insert it after the topmost patch.
The name can be prefixed with a sub-directory name, allowing
for grouping related <br>
patches together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p n <br>
Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p ab <br>
Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the
original and new filenames instead of the default
dir.orig/file and dir/file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quilt can be used in
sub-directories of a source tree. It determines the root of
a source tree by searching for a patches directory above the
current working directory. <br>
Create a patches directory in the intended root directory if
quilt chooses a top-level directory that is too high up in
the directory tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next [patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the name of the next patch
after the specified or topmost patch in the series file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patches [-v]
[--color[=always|auto|never]] {file} [files...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the list of patches that
modify any of the specified files. (Uses a heuristic to
determine which files are modified by unapplied patches.
Note that this heuristic is <br>
much slower than scanning applied patches.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose, more user friendly
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color[=always|auto|never]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use syntax coloring (auto
activates it only if the output is a tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pop [-afRqv] [--refresh]
[num|patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove patch(es) from the stack
of applied patches. Without options, the topmost patch is
removed. When a number is specified, remove the specified
number of patches. When <br>
a patch name is specified, remove patches until the
specified patch end up on top of the stack. Patch names may
include the patches/ prefix, which means that filename
com&acirc; <br>
pletion can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Remove all applied
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force remove. The state
before the patch(es) were applied will be restored from
backup files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Always verify if the patch
removes cleanly; don&rsquo;t rely on timestamp checks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh</p>

patch before the specified or topmost patch in the series
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">push [-afqvm] [--fuzz=N]
[--merge[=merge|diff3]] [--leave-rejects]
[--color[=always|auto|never]] [--refresh] [num|patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apply patch(es) from the series
file. Without options, the next patch in the series file is
applied. When a number is specified, apply the specified
number of patches. <br>
When a patch name is specified, apply all patches up to and
including the specified patch. Patch names may include the
patches/ prefix, which means that filename completion <br>
can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Apply all patches in the
series file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Force apply, even if the
patch has rejects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fuzz=N</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the maximum fuzz factor
(default: 2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --merge[=merge|diff3]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge the patch file into the
original files (see patch(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--leave-rejects</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Leave around the reject files
patch produced, even if the patch is not actually
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Automatically refresh every
patch after it was successfully applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refresh [-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U
num|-c|-C num] [-z[new_name]] [-f] [--no-timestamps]
[--no-index] [--diffstat] [--sort] [--backup]
[--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refreshes the specified patch,
or the topmost patch by default. Documentation that comes
before the actual patch in the patch file is retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to refresh
patches that are not on top. If any patches on top of the
patch to refresh modify the same files, the script aborts by
default. Patches can still <br>
be refreshed with -f. In that case this script will print a
warning for each shadowed file, changes by more recent
patches will be ignored, and only changes in files that <br>
have not been modified by any more recent patches will end
up in the specified patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p n <br>
Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 supported).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p ab <br>
Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the
original and new filenames instead of the default
dir.orig/file and dir/file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, -U num, -c, -C num</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a unified diff (-u, -U)
with num lines of context. Create a context diff (-c, -C)
with num lines of context. The number of context lines
defaults to 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z[new_name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a new patch containing
the changes instead of refreshing the topmost patch. If no
new name is specified, &lsquo;-2&rsquo; is added to the
original patch name, etc. (See the <br>
fork command.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-timestamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not include file timestamps
in patch headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not output Index: lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add a diffstat section to the
patch header, or replace the existing diffstat section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Enforce refreshing of a patch
that is not on top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a backup copy of the old
version of a patch as patch~.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sort <br>
Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--strip-trailing-whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Strip trailing whitespace at the
end of lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remove [-P patch] {file} ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove one or more files from
the topmost or named patch. Files that are modified by
patches on top of the specified patch cannot be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove named files from the
named patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patch to rename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">revert [-P patch] {file} ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revert uncommitted changes to
the topmost or named patch for the specified file(s): after
the revert, &rsquo;quilt diff -z&rsquo; will show no
differences for those files. Changes to <br>
files that are modified by patches on top of the specified
patch cannot be reverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P patch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revert changes in the named
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">series
[--color[=always|auto|never]] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the names of all patches
in the series file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color[=always|auto|never]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use syntax coloring (auto
activates it only if the output is a tty).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose, more user friendly

<p style="margin-top: 1em">setup [-d path-prefix] [-v]
[--sourcedir dir] [--fuzz=N] [--slow|--fast]
{specfile|seriesfile}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initializes a source tree from

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set the maximum fuzz factor
(needs rpm 4.6 or later).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--slow <br>
Use the original, slow method to process the spec file. This
is the default for now, but that might change in the future.
In this mode, rpmbuild generates a working tree <br>
in a temporary directory while all its actions are recorded,
and then everything is replayed from scratch in the target
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fast <br>
Use an alternative, faster method to process the spec file.
In this mode, rpmbuild is told to generate a working tree
directly in the target directory. If the input is a <br>
series file, it is assumed that all archives have been
extracted manually beforehand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">snapshot [-d]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Take a snapshot of the current
working state. After taking the snapshot, the tree can be

the tree at the moment of the snapshot can be generated with
&lsquo;quilt diff --snapshot&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Only remove current
snapshot.</p>

in the series file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">upgrade</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upgrade the meta-data in a
working tree from an old version of quilt to the current
version. This command is only needed when the quilt
meta-data format has changed, and the <br>
working tree still contains old-format meta-data. In that
case, quilt will request to run &lsquo;quilt
upgrade&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS TO ALL COMMANDS
<br>
--trace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Runs the command in bash trace
mode (-x). For internal debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiltrc file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the specified configuration
file instead of ~/.quiltrc (or /etc/quilt.quiltrc if
~/.quiltrc does not exist). See the pdf documentation for
details about its possible <br>
contents. The special value &quot;-&quot; causes quilt not
to read any configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print the version number and
exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status is 0 if the sub-command was successfully
executed, and 1 in case of error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exit status of 2 denotes that
quilt did not do anything to complete the command. This
happens in particular when asking to push when the whole
stack is already pushed, or <br>
asking to pop when the whole stack is already popped. This
behavior is intended to ease the scripting around quilt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE OF WORKING TREE <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The patches/ directory is
precious as it contains all your patches as well as the
order in which it should be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .pc/ directory contains some
metadata about the current state of your patch serie.
Changing its content is not advised. This directory can
usually be regenerated from the <br>
initial files and the content of the patches/ directory
(provided that all patches were regenerated before the
removal).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Please refer to the pdf documentation for a full example of
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Upon startup, quilt evaluates the file .quiltrc in the
user&rsquo;s home directory, or the file specified with the
--quiltrc option. This file is a regular bash script.
Default <br>
options can be passed to any COMMAND by defining a
QUILT_${COMMAND}_ARGS variable. For example,
QUILT_DIFF_ARGS=&quot;--color=auto&quot; causes the output
of quilt diff to be syntax col&acirc; <br>
ored when writing to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to that, quilt
recognizes the following variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EDITOR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program to run to edit
files. If it isn&rsquo;t redefined in the configuration
file, $EDITOR as defined in the environment will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LESS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments used to invoke the
pager. Inherits the existing value of $LESS if LESS is
already set in the environment, otherwise defaults to
&quot;-FRSX&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_DIFF_OPTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional options that quilt
shall pass to GNU diff when generating patches. A useful
setting for C source code is &quot;-p&quot;, which causes
GNU diff to show in the resulting patch <br>
which function a change is in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_PATCH_OPTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional options that quilt
shall pass to GNU patch when applying patches. For example,
recent versions of GNU patch support the
&quot;--reject-format=unified&quot; option for gen&acirc;
<br>
erating reject files in unified diff style (older patch
versions used &quot;--unified-reject-files&quot; for
that).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also want to add the
&quot;-E&quot; option if you have issues with quilt not
deleting empty files when you think it should. The
documentation of GNU patch says that &quot;normally <br>
this option is unnecessary&quot;, but when patch is in POSIX
mode or if the patch format doesn&rsquo;t allow to
distinguish empty files from deleted files, patch deletes
empty files <br>
only if the -E option is given. Beware that when passing -E
to patch, quilt will no longer be able to deal with empty
files, which is why using -E is no longer the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional options that quilt
shall pass to diffstat when generating patch statistics. For
example, &quot;-f0&quot; can be used for an alternative
output format. Recent versions of <br>
diffstat also support alternative rounding methods
(&quot;-r1&quot;, &quot;-r2&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_PATCHES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The location of patch files,
defaulting to &quot;patches&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_SERIES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the series file,
defaulting to &quot;series&quot;. Unless an absolute path is
used, the search algorithm described above applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to anything, quilt will
prefix patch names it prints with their directory
(QUILT_PATCHES).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, quilt prepends an
Index: line to the patches it generates. If this variable is
set to anything, no line is prepended. This is a shortcut to
adding --no-index to <br>
both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, quilt includes
timestamps in headers when generating patches. If this
variable is set to anything, no timestamp will be included.
This is a shortcut to adding <br>
--no-timestamps to both QUILT_DIFF_ARGS and
QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_PAGER</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pager quilt shall use for
commands which produce paginated output. If unset, the
values of GIT_PAGER or PAGER is used. If none of these
variables is set, &quot;less -R&quot; is <br>
used. An empty value indicates that no pager should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_COLORS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, quilt uses its
predefined color set in order to be more comprehensible when
distiguishing various types of patches, eg.
applied/unapplied, failed, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To override one or more color
settings, set the QUILT_COLORS variable in following syntax
- colon (:) separated list of elements, each being of the
form &lt;format name&gt;=&lt;fore&acirc; <br>
ground color&gt;[;&lt;background color&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Format names with their
respective default values are listed below, along with their
usage(s). Color codes(values) are standard bash coloring
escape codes. See more at <br>
http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/colorizing.html#AEN20229</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_hdr Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color the index line. Defaults to 32
(green).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_add Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color added lines. Defaults to 36
(azure).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_mod Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color modified lines. Defaults to 35
(purple).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_rem Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color removed lines. Defaults to 35
(purple).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_hunk Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color hunk header. Defaults to 33
(brown/orange).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_ctx Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color the text after end of hunk header (diff
--show-c-function generates this). Defaults to 35
(purple).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff_cctx Used in &rsquo;quilt
diff&rsquo; to color the 15-asterisk sequence before or
after a hunk. Defaults to 33 (brown/orange).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch_fuzz <br>
Used in &rsquo;quilt push&rsquo; to color the patch fuzz
information. Defaults to 35 (purple).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patch_fail <br>
Used in &rsquo;quilt push&rsquo; to color the fail message.
Defaults to 31 (red).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">series_app <br>
Used in &rsquo;quilt series&rsquo; and &rsquo;quilt
patches&rsquo; to color the applied patch names. Defaults to
32 (green).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">series_top <br>
Used in &rsquo;quilt series&rsquo; and &rsquo;quilt
patches&rsquo; to color the top patch name. Defaults to 33
(brown/orange).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">series_una <br>
Used in &rsquo;quilt series&rsquo; and &rsquo;quilt
patches&rsquo; to color unapplied patch names. Defaults to 0
(no special color).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the clear format
name is used to turn off special coloring. Its value is 0;
it is not advised to modify it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The content of QUILT_COLORS
supersedes default values. So the value diff_hdr=35;44 will
get you the diff headers in magenta over blue instead of the
default green over <br>
unchanged background. For that, add the following content to
~/.quiltrc (or /etc/quilt.quiltrc):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">QUILT_DIFF_ARGS=&quot;--color&quot;
<br>
QUILT_COLORS=&rsquo;diff_hdr=35;44&rsquo;</p>
