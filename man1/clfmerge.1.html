clfmerge - merge Common-Log Format web logs based on time-stamps

The <b>clfmerge</b> program is designed to avoid using sort to merge multiple
  web log files. Web logs for big sites consist of multiple files in the
  &gt;100M size range from a number of machines. For such files it is not
  practical to use a program such as gnusort to merge the files because the data
  is not always entirely in order (so the merge option of gnusort doesn't work
  so well), but it is not in random order (so doing a complete sort would be a
  waste). Also the date field that is being sorted on is not particularly easy
  to specify for gnusort (I have seen it done but it was messy).
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program is designed to simply and quickly sort multiple large log files
  with no need for temporary storage space or overly large buffers in memory
  (the memory footprint is generally only a few megs).

It will take a number (from 0 to n) of file-names on the command line, it will
  open them for reading and read CLF format web log data from them all. Lines
  which don't appear to be in CLF format (NB they aren't parsed fully, only
  minimal parsing to determine the date is performed) will be rejected and
  displayed on standard-error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If zero files are specified then there will be no error, it will just silently
  output nothing, this is for scripts which use the <b>find</b> command to find
  log files and which can't be counted on to find any log files, it saves doing
  an extra check in your shell scripts.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If one file is specified then the data will be read into a 1000 line buffer and
  it will be removed from the buffer (and displayed on standard output) in date
  order. This is to handle the case of web servers which date entries on the
  connection time but write them to the log at completion time and thus generate
  log files that aren't in order (Netscape web server does this - I haven't
  checked what other web servers do).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If more than one file is specified then a line will be read from each file, the
  file that had the earliest time stamp will be read from until it returns a
  time stamp later than one of the other files. Then the file with the earlier
  time stamp will be read. With multiple files the buffer size is 1000 lines or
  100 * the number of files (whichever is larger). When the buffer becomes full
  the first line will be removed and displayed on standard output.

      to produce good graphs for large hosting sites. Also it will make the
      domain name in lower case.
