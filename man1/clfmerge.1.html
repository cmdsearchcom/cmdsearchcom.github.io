<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
clfmerge - merge Common-Log Format web logs based on
time-stamps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
clfmerge [--help | -h] [-b size] [-d] [-v] [file names]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The clfmerge program is designed to avoid using sort to
merge multiple web log files. Web logs for big sites consist
of multiple files in the &gt;100M size range from a number
of <br>
machines. For such files it is not practical to use a
program such as gnusort to merge the files because the data
is not always entirely in order (so the merge option of
gnusort <br>
doesn&rsquo;t work so well), but it is not in random order
(so doing a complete sort would be a waste). Also the date
field that is being sorted on is not particularly easy to
specify <br>
for gnusort (I have seen it done but it was messy).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program is designed to
simply and quickly sort multiple large log files with no
need for temporary storage space or overly large buffers in
memory (the memory footprint is <br>
generally only a few megs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
It will take a number (from 0 to n) of file-names on the
command line, it will open them for reading and read CLF
format web log data from them all. Lines which don&rsquo;t
appear to <br>
be in CLF format (NB they aren&rsquo;t parsed fully, only
minimal parsing to determine the date is performed) will be
rejected and displayed on standard-error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If zero files are specified then
there will be no error, it will just silently output
nothing, this is for scripts which use the find command to
find log files and which can&rsquo;t be <br>
counted on to find any log files, it saves doing an extra
check in your shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one file is specified then
the data will be read into a 1000 line buffer and it will be
removed from the buffer (and displayed on standard output)
in date order. This is to <br>
handle the case of web servers which date entries on the
connection time but write them to the log at completion time
and thus generate log files that aren&rsquo;t in order
(Netscape <br>
web server does this - I haven&rsquo;t checked what other
web servers do).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one file is
specified then a line will be read from each file, the file
that had the earliest time stamp will be read from until it
returns a time stamp later than <br>
one of the other files. Then the file with the earlier time
stamp will be read. With multiple files the buffer size is
1000 lines or 100 * the number of files (whichever is <br>
larger). When the buffer becomes full the first line will be
removed and displayed on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b buffer-size <br>
Specify the buffer-size to use, if 0 is specified then it
means to disable the sliding-window sorting of the data
which improves the speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Set domain-name mangling to
on. This means that if a line starts with as the name of the
site that was requested then that would be removed from the
start of the line and <br>
the GET / would be changed to GET http://www.company.com/
which allows programs like Webalizer to produce good graphs
for large hosting sites. Also it will make the <br>
domain name in lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 No errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Bad parameters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Can&rsquo;t open one of the
specified files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Can&rsquo;t write to
output</p>
