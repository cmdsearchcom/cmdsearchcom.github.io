<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lsdnssec - List DNSSEC components of zones from files or
directories</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lsdnssec [-d 1-9] [OPTIONS] [FILES OR DIRECTORIES...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The lsdnssec program summarizes information about
DNSSEC-related files. These files may be specified on the
command line or found in directories that were given on the
command <br>
line. The -d flag controls the amount of detail in the
lsdnssec output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lsdnssec displays the following
information about each zone for which it collects
information:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keys <br>
Key information is shown about the keys currently in use. A
bar graph is included that shows the age of the key with
respect to the configured expected key lifetime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information is collected
from any .krf files lsdnssec finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rolling status <br>
If any zone keys are being rolled via rollerd, then the
status of the rolling state is shown. The time needed to
reach the next state is also displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This information is collected
from any .rollrec or .rrf files found by lsdnssec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-z ZONENAME1[,ZONENAME2] <br>
--zone=ZONENAME1[,ZONENAME2] <br>
Only prints information about the named zone(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p NUMBER <br>
--phase=NUMBER <br>
Only prints information about zones currently being rolled
by rollerd and where either a zsk or a ksk rollover is
taking place and is in phase NUMBER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the phase NUMBER is specified
as 0, then any zone in any rolling phase will be printed
(but not zones that aren&rsquo;t being rolled at all).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This flag is especially useful
to find all of your zones that are currently in KSK rolling
phase 6, which requires operator intervention to propagate
the new DS records into <br>
the parent zone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
--roll-status <br>
Show only rolling information from the rollrec files. By
default both roll-state and key information is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
--key-data <br>
Show only keying information from the krf files. By default
both roll-state and key information is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K <br>
--key-gen-time <br>
Normally rollerd calculates the age of a key based on the
last time a key was rolled. However, it&rsquo;s also
possible to calculate the age of a key based on the
difference <br>
between the time of execution and when the key was created
(which was typically before the rolling began). The -K flag
switches to this second mode of key age calculation <br>
(which will not match how rollerd actually performs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M <br>
--monitor <br>
The -M flag gives an abbreviated version of lsdnssec output
that is intended for use by monitoring systems. It displays
the zone name, the rollover phase, and the time <br>
remaining in that phase. This option implicitly sets the -r
flag on and sets the detail level to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d 1-9 <br>
--detail 1-9 <br>
Controls the amount of information shown in the output. A
level of 9 shows everything; a level of 1 shows a minimal
amount. The default level is 5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Turns on extra debugging information.</p>
