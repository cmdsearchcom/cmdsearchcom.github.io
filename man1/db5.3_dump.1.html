<p>DB5.3_DUMP(1) General Commands Manual DB5.3_DUMP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db5.3_dump - Write database to flat-text format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db5.3_dump [-klNpRrV] [-d ahr] [-f output] [-h home] [-P
password] [-s database] file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db5.3_dump utility reads the database file file and
writes it to the standard output using a portable flat-text
format understood by the db5.3_load utility. The file
argu&acirc; <br>
ment must be a file produced using the Berkeley DB library
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d Dump the specified database in a format helpful for
debugging the Berkeley DB library routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Display all information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Display only page headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Do not display the free-list
or pages on the free list. This mode is used by the recovery
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format of the -d
option is not standard and may change, without notice,
between releases of the Berkeley DB library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Write to the specified file
instead of to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Specify a home directory for
the database environment; by default, the current working
directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Dump record numbers from
Queue and Recno databases as keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the databases stored in
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not acquire shared region
mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially
fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
option is intended <br>
only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Specify an environment
password. Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password
strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a window
of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p If characters in either the
key or data items are printing characters (as defined by
isprint(3)), use printing characters in file to represent
them. This option permits <br>
users to use standard text editors and tools to modify the
contents of databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: different systems may have
different notions about what characters are considered
printing characters, and databases dumped in this manner may
be less portable to <br>
external systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Aggressively salvage data
from a possibly corrupt file. The -R flag differs from the
-r option in that it will return all possible data from the
file at the risk of also <br>
returning already deleted or otherwise nonsensical items.
Data dumped in this fashion will almost certainly have to be
edited by hand or other means before the data is <br>
ready for reload into another database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Salvage data from a possibly
corrupt file. When used on a uncorrupted database, this
option should return equivalent data to a normal dump, but
most likely in a different <br>
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Specify a single database to
dump. If no database is specified, all databases in the
database file are dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping and reloading Hash
databases that use user-defined hash functions will result
in new databases that use the default hash function.
Although using the default hash func&acirc; <br>
tion may not be optimal for the new database, it will
continue to work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping and reloading Btree
databases that use user-defined prefix or comparison
functions will result in new databases that use the default
prefix and comparison functions. In <br>
this case, it is quite likely that the database will be
damaged beyond repair permitting neither record storage or
retrieval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only available workaround
for either case is to modify the sources for the db5.3_load
utility to load the database using the correct hash, prefix,
and comparison functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_dump utility output
format is documented in the Dump Output Formats section of
the Berkeley DB Reference Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_dump utility may be
used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h
option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
utility was run in a directory <br>
containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db5.3_dump should always be given the chance to detach from
<br>
the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db5.3_dump to
release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it
an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even when using a Berkeley DB
database environment, the db5.3_dump utility does not use
any kind of database locking if it is invoked with the -d,
-R, or -r arguments. If used <br>
with one of these arguments, the db5.3_dump utility may only
be safely run on databases that are not being modified by
any other process; otherwise, the output may be corrupt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db5.3_dump utility exits 0
on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
