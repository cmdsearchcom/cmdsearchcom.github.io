perlaix - Perl version 5 on IBM AIX (UNIX) systems
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes various features of IBM's UNIX operating system AIX that
  will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compiling_Perl_5_on_AIX"><a class="selflink" href="#Compiling_Perl_5_on_AIX">Compiling
  Perl 5 on AIX</a></h2>
For information on compilers on older versions of AIX, see &quot;Compiling Perl
  5 on older AIX versions up to 4.3.3&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. AIX does not ship an ANSI
  compliant C compiler with AIX by default, but binary builds of gcc for AIX are
  widely available. A version of gcc is also included in the AIX Toolbox which
  is shipped with AIX.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Supported_Compilers"><a class="selflink" href="#Supported_Compilers">Supported
  Compilers</a></h2>
Currently all versions of IBM's &quot;xlc&quot;, &quot;xlc_r&quot;,
  &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;cc_r&quot; or &quot;vac&quot; ANSI/C compiler will work
  for building Perl if that compiler works on your system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you plan to link Perl to any module that requires thread-support, like
  DBD::Oracle, it is better to use the _r version of the compiler. This will not
  build a threaded Perl, but a thread-enabled Perl. See also &quot;Threaded
  Perl&quot; later on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As of writing (2010-09) only the <i>IBM XL C for AIX</i> or <i>IBM XL C/C++</i>
  <i>for AIX</i> compiler is supported by IBM on AIX 5L/6.1/7.1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following compiler versions are currently supported by IBM:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    IBM XL C and IBM XL C/C++ V8, V9, V10, V11
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The XL C for AIX is integrated in the XL C/C++ for AIX compiler and therefore
  also supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you choose XL C/C++ V9 you need APAR IZ35785 installed otherwise the
  integrated SDBM_File do not compile correctly due to an optimization bug. You
  can circumvent this problem by adding -qipa to the optimization flags
  (-Doptimize='-O -qipa'). The PTF for APAR IZ35785 which solves this problem is
  available from IBM (April 2009 PTF for XL C/C++ Enterprise Edition for AIX,
  V9.0).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you choose XL C/C++ V11 you need the April 2010 PTF (or newer) installed
  otherwise you will not get a working Perl version.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl can be compiled with either IBM's ANSI C compiler or with gcc. The former
  is recommended, as not only it can compile Perl with no difficulty, but also
  can take advantage of features listed later that require the use of IBM
  compiler-specific command-line flags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and complete,
  and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-specific details.
  Please report any hoops you had to jump through to the development team.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Incompatibility_with_AIX_Toolbox_lib_gdbm"><a class="selflink" href="#Incompatibility_with_AIX_Toolbox_lib_gdbm">Incompatibility
  with AIX Toolbox lib gdbm</a></h2>
If the AIX Toolbox version of lib gdbm &lt; 1.8.3-5 is installed on your system
  then Perl will not work. This library contains the header files
  /opt/freeware/include/gdbm/dbm.h|ndbm.h which conflict with the AIX system
  versions. The lib gdbm will be automatically removed from the wanted libraries
  if the presence of one of these two header files is detected. If you want to
  build Perl with GDBM support then please install at least gdbm-devel-1.8.3-5
  (or higher).

Successfully tested means that all &quot;make test&quot; runs finish with a
  result of 100% OK. All tests were conducted with -Duseshrplib set.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All tests were conducted on the oldest supported AIX technology level with the
  latest support package applied. If the tested AIX version is out of support
  (AIX 4.3.3, 5.1, 5.2) then the last available support level was used.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Building_Dynamic_Extensions_on_AIX"><a class="selflink" href="#Building_Dynamic_Extensions_on_AIX">Building
  Dynamic Extensions on AIX</a></h2>
Starting from Perl 5.7.2 (and consequently 5.8.x / 5.10.x / 5.12.x) and AIX 4.3
  or newer Perl uses the AIX native dynamic loading interface in the so called
  runtime linking mode instead of the emulated interface that was used in Perl
  releases 5.6.1 and earlier or, for AIX releases 4.2 and earlier. This change
  does break backward compatibility with compiled modules from earlier Perl
  releases. The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other
  applications like Apache/mod_perl which are using the AIX native interface.
  This change also enables the use of C++ code with static constructors and
  destructors in Perl extensions, which was not possible using the emulated
  interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is highly recommended to use the new interface.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_Large_Files_with_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_Large_Files_with_Perl">Using
  Large Files with Perl</a></h2>
Should yield no problems.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Threaded_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#Threaded_Perl">Threaded
  Perl</a></h2>
Should yield no problems with AIX 5.1 / 5.2 / 5.3 / 6.1 / 7.1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
IBM uses the AIX system Perl (V5.6.0 on AIX 5.1 and V5.8.2 on AIX 5.2 / 5.3 and
  6.1; V5.8.8 on AIX 5.3 TL11 and AIX 6.1 TL4; V5.10.1 on AIX 7.1) for some AIX
  system scripts. If you switch the links in /usr/bin from the AIX system Perl
  (/usr/opt/perl5) to the newly build Perl then you get the same features as
  with the IBM AIX system Perl if the threaded options are used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The threaded Perl build works also on AIX 5.1 but the IBM Perl build (Perl
  v5.6.0) is not threaded on AIX 5.1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl 5.12 an newer is not compatible with the IBM fileset perl.libext.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="64-bit_Perl"><a class="selflink" href="#64-bit_Perl">64-bit
  Perl</a></h2>
If your AIX system is installed with 64-bit support, you can expect 64-bit
  configurations to work. If you want to use 64-bit Perl on AIX 6.1 you need an
  APAR for a libc.a bug which affects (n)dbm_XXX functions. The APAR number for
  this problem is IZ39077.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need more memory (larger data segment) for your Perl programs you can
  set:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    /etc/security/limits
    default:                    (or your user)
        data = -1               (default is 262144 * 512 byte)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With the default setting the size is limited to 128MB. The -1 removes this
  limit. If the &quot;make test&quot; fails please change your
  /etc/security/limits as stated above.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Compiling_Perl_5_on_older_AIX_versions_up_to_4.3.3"><a class="selflink" href="#Compiling_Perl_5_on_older_AIX_versions_up_to_4.3.3">Compiling
  Perl 5 on older AIX versions up to 4.3.3</a></h2>
Due to the fact that AIX 4.3.3 reached end-of-service in December 31, 2003 this
  information is provided as is. The Perl versions prior to Perl 5.8.9 could be
  compiled on AIX up to 4.3.3 with the following settings (your mileage may
  vary):
<div class="Pp"></div>
When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. AIX does not ship an ANSI
  compliant C-compiler with AIX by default, but binary builds of gcc for AIX are
  widely available.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the moment of writing, AIX supports two different native C compilers, for
  which you have to pay: <b>xlC</b> and <b>vac</b>. If you decide to use either
  of these two (which is quite a lot easier than using gcc), be sure to upgrade
  to the latest available patch level. Currently:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    xlC.C     3.1.4.10 or 3.6.6.0 or 4.0.2.2 or 5.0.2.9 or 6.0.0.3
    vac.C     4.4.0.3  or 5.0.2.6 or 6.0.0.1
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
note that xlC has the OS version in the name as of version 4.0.2.0, so you will
  find xlC.C for AIX-5.0 as package
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    xlC.aix50.rte   5.0.2.0 or 6.0.0.3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
subversions are not the same &quot;latest&quot; on all OS versions. For example,
  the latest xlC-5 on aix41 is 5.0.2.9, while on aix43, it is 5.0.2.7.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl can be compiled with either IBM's ANSI C compiler or with gcc. The former
  is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no difficulty, but also
  can take advantage of features listed later that require the use of IBM
  compiler-specific command-line flags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IBM's compiler patch levels 5.0.0.0 and 5.0.1.0 have compiler optimization
  bugs that affect compiling perl.c and regcomp.c, respectively. If Perl's
  configuration detects those compiler patch levels, optimization is turned off
  for the said source code files. Upgrading to at least 5.0.2.0 is recommended.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and complete,
  and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-specific details.
  Please report any hoops you had to jump through to the development team.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OS_level"><a class="selflink" href="#OS_level">OS
  level</a></h2>
Before installing the patches to the IBM C-compiler you need to know the level
  of patching for the Operating System. IBM's command 'oslevel' will show the
  base, but is not always complete (in this example oslevel shows 4.3.NULL,
  whereas the system might run most of 4.3.THREE):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # oslevel
    4.3.0.0
    # lslpp -l | grep 'bos.rte '
    bos.rte           4.3.3.75  COMMITTED  Base Operating System Runtime
    bos.rte            4.3.2.0  COMMITTED  Base Operating System Runtime
    #
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same might happen to AIX 5.1 or other OS levels. As a side note, Perl cannot
  be built without bos.adt.syscalls and bos.adt.libm installed
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
    # lslpp -l | egrep &quot;syscalls|libm&quot;
    bos.adt.libm      5.1.0.25  COMMITTED  Base Application Development
    bos.adt.syscalls  5.1.0.36  COMMITTED  System Calls Application

AIX supports dynamically loadable objects as well as shared libraries. Shared
  libraries by convention end with the suffix .a, which is a bit misleading, as
  an archive can contain static as well as dynamic members. For Perl dynamically
  loaded objects we use the .so suffix also used on many other platforms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that starting from Perl 5.7.2 (and consequently 5.8.0) and AIX 4.3 or newer
  Perl uses the AIX native dynamic loading interface in the so called runtime

  5.6.1 and earlier or, for AIX releases 4.2 and earlier. This change does break

All defaults for Configure can be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you've chosen to use vac 4, be sure to run 4.4.0.3. Older versions will turn
  up nasty later on. For vac 5 be sure to run at least 5.0.1.0, but vac 5.0.2.6
  or up is highly recommended. Note that since IBM has removed vac 5.0.2.1
  through 5.0.2.5 from the software depot, these versions should be considered
  obsolete.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's a brief lead of how to upgrade the compiler to the latest level. Of
  course this is subject to changes. You can only upgrade versions from
  ftp-available updates if the first three digit groups are the same (in where
  you can skip intermediate unlike the patches in the developer snapshots of
  Perl), or to one version up where the &quot;base&quot; is available. In other
  words, the AIX compiler patches are cumulative.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 vac.C.4.4.0.1 =&gt; vac.C.4.4.0.3  is OK     (vac.C.4.4.0.2 not needed)

If you like a more web-like approach, a good start point can be
  http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/downloadaz.jsp and click &quot;C
  for AIX&quot;, and follow the instructions.

If linking miniperl
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 cc -o miniperl ... miniperlmain.o opmini.o perl.o ... -lm -lc ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
causes error like this
<div class="Pp"></div>

<div class="Pp"></div>
you could retry with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 make realclean
 rm config.sh
 ./Configure -Dusenm ...
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which makes Configure to use the &quot;nm&quot; tool when scanning for library
  symbols, which usually is not done in AIX.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Related to this, you probably should not use the &quot;-r&quot; option of
  Configure in AIX, because that affects of how the &quot;nm&quot; tool is used.

  GNU's gcc for building Perl</a></h2>
Using gcc-3.x (tested with 3.0.4, 3.1, and 3.2) now works out of the box, as do
  recent gcc-2.9 builds available directly from IBM as part of their Linux
  compatibility packages, available here:

Threads seem to work OK, though at the moment not all tests pass when threads
  are used in combination with 64-bit configurations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may get a warning when doing a threaded build:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  &quot;pp_sys.c&quot;, line 4640.39: 1506-280 (W) Function argument assignment 
  between types &quot;unsigned char*&quot; and &quot;const void*&quot; is not allowed.
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exact line number may vary, but if the warning (W) comes from a line line
  this
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  hent = PerlSock_gethostbyaddr(addr, (Netdb_hlen_t) addrlen, addrtype);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
in the &quot;pp_ghostent&quot; function, you may ignore it safely. The warning
  is caused by the reentrant variant of <i>gethostbyaddr()</i> having a slightly
  different prototype than its non-reentrant variant, but the difference is not
  really significant here.

  Perl &lt; 5L</a></h2>
If your AIX is installed with 64-bit support, you can expect 64-bit
  configurations to work. In combination with threads some tests might still
  fail.

  4.2 and extensions using C++ with statics</a></h2>
In AIX 4.2 Perl extensions that use C++ functions that use statics may have
  problems in that the statics are not getting initialized. In newer AIX
  releases this has been solved by linking Perl with the libC_r library, but
  unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has an obscure bug where the various
  functions related to time (such as <i>time()</i> and <i>gettimeofday()</i>)
  return broken values, and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against the
  libC_r.
