<p>NEWGRP(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
NEWGRP(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
newgrp &acirc; change to a new group</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
newgrp [&acirc;l] [group]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The newgrp utility shall create a new shell execution
environment with a new real and effective group
identification. Of the attributes listed in Section 2.12,
Shell Execution <br>
Environment, the new shell execution environment shall
retain the working directory, file creation mask, and
exported variables from the previous environment (that is,
open <br>
files, traps, unexported variables, alias definitions, shell
functions, and set options may be lost). All other aspects
of the process environment that are preserved by the exec
<br>
family of functions defined in the System Interfaces volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 shall also be preserved by newgrp;
whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A failure to assign the new
group identifications (for example, for security or
password-related reasons) shall not prevent the new shell
execution environment from being cre&acirc; <br>
ated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newgrp utility shall affect
the supplemental groups for the process as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* On systems where the effective
group ID is normally in the supplementary group list (or
whenever the old effective group ID actually is in the
supplementary group list):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the new effective group ID
is also in the supplementary group list, newgrp shall change
the effective group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the new effective group ID
is not in the supplementary group list, newgrp shall add the
new effective group ID to the list, if there is room to add
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* On systems where the effective
group ID is not normally in the supplementary group list (or
whenever the old effective group ID is not in the
supplementary group list):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the new effective group ID
is in the supplementary group list, newgrp shall delete
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- If the old effective group ID
is not in the supplementary list, newgrp shall add it if
there is room.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: The System Interfaces
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 does not specify whether the
effective group ID of a process is included in its
supplementary group list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no operands, newgrp shall
change the effective group back to the groups identified in
the user&rsquo;s user entry, and shall set the list of
supplementary groups to that set in <br>
the user&rsquo;s group database entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the first argument is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a password is required for
the specified group, and the user is not listed as a member
of that group in the group database, the user shall be
prompted to enter the correct <br>
password for that group. If the user is listed as a member
of that group, no password shall be requested. If no
password is required for the specified group, it is
implementa&acirc; <br>
tion-defined whether users not listed as members of that
group can change to that group. Whether or not a password is
required, implementation-defined system accounting or
secu&acirc; <br>
rity mechanisms may impose additional authorization
restrictions that may cause newgrp to write a diagnostic
message and suppress the changing of the group
identification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The newgrp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines, except for the unspecified usage of
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;l (The letter ell.)
Change the environment to what would be expected if the user
actually logged in again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operand shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group A group name from the
group database or a non-negative numeric group ID. Specifies
the group ID to which the real and effective group IDs shall
be set. If group is a <br>
non-negative numeric string and exists in the group database
as a group name (see getgrnam()), the numeric group ID
associated with that group name shall be used as the <br>
group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The file /dev/tty shall be used to read a single line of
text for password checking, when one is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of newgrp:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
a prompt string for a password, if one is required.
Diagnostic messages may be written in cases where the exit
status <br>
is not available. See the EXIT STATUS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If newgrp succeeds in creating a new shell execution
environment, whether or not the group identification was
changed successfully, the exit status shall be the exit
status of <br>
the shell. Otherwise, the following exit value shall be
returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
The invoking shell may terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
There is no convenient way to enter a password into the
group database. Use of group passwords is not encouraged,
because by their very nature they encourage poor security
prac&acirc; <br>
tices. Group passwords may disappear in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A common implementation of
newgrp is that the current shell uses exec to overlay itself
with newgrp, which in turn overlays itself with a new shell
after changing group. On some <br>
implementations, however, this may not occur and newgrp may
be invoked as a subprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newgrp command is intended
only for use from an interactive terminal. It does not offer
a useful interface for the support of applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status of newgrp is
generally inapplicable. If newgrp is used in a script, in
most cases it successfully invokes a new shell and the rest
of the original shell script is <br>
bypassed when the new shell exits. Used interactively,
newgrp displays diagnostic messages to indicate problems.
But usage such as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">newgrp foo <br>
echo $?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is not useful because the new
shell might not have access to any status newgrp may have
generated (and most historical systems do not provide this
status). A zero status echoed <br>
here does not necessarily indicate that the user has changed
to the new group successfully. Following newgrp with the id
command provides a portable means of determining whether
<br>
the group change was successful or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Most historical implementations use one of the exec
functions to implement the behavior of newgrp. Errors
detected before the exec leave the environment unchanged,
while errors <br>
detected after the exec leave the user in a changed
environment. While it would be useful to have newgrp issue a
diagnostic message to tell the user that the environment
changed, <br>
it would be inappropriate to require this change to some
historical implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The password mechanism is
allowed in the group database, but how this would be
implemented is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The newgrp utility was retained
in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, even given the
existence of the multiple group permissions feature in the
System Interfaces volume of <br>
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, for several reasons. First, in some
implementations, the group ownership of a newly created file
is determined by the group of the directory in which the
file is <br>
created, as allowed by the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008; on other implementations, the group
ownership of a newly created file is determined by the
effective group <br>
ID. On implementations of the latter type, newgrp allows
files to be created with a specific group ownership.
Finally, many implementations use the real group ID in
accounting, <br>
and on such systems, newgrp allows the accounting identity
of the user to be changed.</p>
