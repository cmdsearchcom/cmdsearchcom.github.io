<p>VILE(1) General Commands Manual VILE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
vile, xvile, uxvile, lxvile - VI Like Emacs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
vile [@cmdfile] [+command] [-FhIiRVv] [-gNNN] [-kcryptkey]
[-spattern] [-ttag] [filename]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
vile is a text editor. This man page is fairly terse. More
information can be obtained from the internal help,
available with the -h option or by using the
&quot;:help&quot; command from <br>
within vile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xvile is the same text editor,
built as an X-windows application, with fully integrated
mouse support, scrollbars, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">uxvile is a wrapper around xvile
which invokes the latter program with the correct locale
environment required to use a unicode character set and the
&quot;UXVile&quot; X resource class <br>
set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lxvile is a wrapper around xvile
which invokes the latter program with a font chosen to match
the current locale environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPIRIT <br>
vile retains the &quot;finger-feel&quot;, if you will, of
vi, while adding the multiple buffer and multiple window
features of emacs and other editors. It is definitely not a
vi clone, in <br>
that some substantial stuff is missing, and the screen
doesn&rsquo;t look quite the same. The things that you tend
to type over and over probably work. Things done less
frequently, <br>
like configuring a startup file, are somewhat (or very,
depending on how ambitious you are) different. But what
matters most is that one&rsquo;s &quot;muscle memory&quot;
does the right thing <br>
to the text in front of you, and that is what vile tries to
do for vi users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Vile accumulates most options into two temporary buffers
[vileinit] and [vileopts]. The former is executed before
reading the first file into a buffer. The latter is executed
<br>
after reading the first file into a buffer. Each is removed
after executing (unless an error is detected).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMON OPTIONS <br>
-ccommand <br>
vile will begin the session on the first file invoking the
given command. Legal commands include many ex-style
commands, vile-commands, etc., subject to shell quoting.
<br>
This option is used most often with a line number or search
pattern. For example</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vile -c123 filename <br>
vile -c/pattern filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">They correspond to ex-style
commands on the given file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">:123 <br>
:/pattern</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are more verbose
equivalents:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vile -c&rsquo;123
goto-line&rsquo; filename <br>
vile -c&rsquo;search-forward /pattern/&rsquo; filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use more than one
command, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vile -c&rsquo;123&rsquo;
-c&rsquo;10*goto-col&rsquo; filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to put the cursor on column 10
of line 123. The &quot;*&quot; (or &quot;:&quot;) separates
the repeat count (used by goto-col) from the line- or
range-specification used by line-oriented <br>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@cmdfile <br>
vile will run the specified file as its startup file, and
will bypass any normal startup file (i.e. .vilerc) or
environment variable (i.e. $VILEINIT). This is added to <br>
[vileinit].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D tells vile to trace the
results of macro execution into the hidden buffer
&quot;[Trace]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e | -E <br>
Invokes vile in &quot;noview&quot; mode - changes are
permitted to any buffer while in this mode (see
&quot;-v&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F will run the syntax filter
that applies to each filename on the command-line, and write
the attributed text to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Invokes vile on the
helpfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i | -I <br>
Tells vile to use vileinit.rc (which is installed) as the
initialization file. If you do not have a .vilerc, vile will
make a short one that sources vileinit.rc This is <br>
added to [vileinit].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k cryptkey | -K cryptkey <br>
Specifies an encryption/decryption key. See below for
further discussion. This option applies only locally to the
buffers named on the command-line, and is not added to <br>
[vileopts], since that is executed too late.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Invokes vile in
&quot;readonly&quot; mode - no writes are permitted while in
this mode. (This will also be true if vile is invoked as
view, or if &quot;readonly&quot; mode is set in the <br>
startup file.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s pattern | -S pattern <br>
In the first file, vile will execute an initial search for
the given pattern. This is not the same as
&quot;-c/pattern&quot;, since that positions the cursor to
the line matching <br>
the pattern. This option positions the cursor within the
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t tag <br>
vile will edit the correct file and move the cursor to the
location of the tag. This requires a tagsfile created with
the ctags(1) command. The option -T is equivalent, <br>
and can be used when X11 option parsing eats the -t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U overrides the $system-crlf
variable, making new buffers start in dos mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u overrides the $system-crlf
variable, making new buffers start in nodos mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Invokes vile in
&quot;view&quot; mode - no changes are permitted to any
buffer while in this mode (see &quot;-e&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V vile will report its version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-25 -43 -50 -60 <br>
On PC systems you may be able to set the initial screen
resolution from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-80 -132 <br>
On VMS systems you may be able to set the initial screen
resolution from the command line. See vile.hlp for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X11 OPTIONS <br>
xvile-specific command-line options are detailed in the help
file (see &quot;Standard X command line arguments&quot;).
The standard ones (e.g. -display, -fn, -geometry, -name,
etc.) are <br>
all supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBSOLETE OPTIONS <br>
vile recognizes some options which duplicate the
functionality of the POSIX &quot;-c&quot; option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+command <br>
This has the same effect as &quot;-ccommand&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g NNN | -G NNN <br>
This has the same effect as &quot;-cNNN&quot;. vile will
begin the session on the first file jumping to the given
line number NNN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
vile will edit the files specified on the command line. If
no files are specified, and standard input is not connected
to a terminal, then vile will bring up a buffer containing
<br>
the output of the pipe it is connected to, and will re-open
/dev/tty for commands. Files (except for the first) are not
actually read into buffers until &quot;visited&quot;. All
buffers <br>
are kept in memory: machines with not much memory or swap
space may have trouble with this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STARTUP <br>
If the @cmdfile option is given, then the file given as
&quot;cmdfile&quot; will be run before any files are loaded.
If no @ option appears, startup commands will be taken from
the user&rsquo;s <br>
VILEINIT variable, if it is set, from the file .vilerc in
the current directory, if it exists, or from $HOME/.vilerc,
as a last resort. See the help file for examples of what
<br>
sorts of things might go into these command files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Please refer to the help available within vile for
vile-specific commands. (That document, however, assumes
familiarity with vi.) Short descriptions of each vile
command may be <br>
obtained with the &quot;:describe-function&quot; and
&quot;:describe-key&quot; commands. All commands may be
listed with &quot;:show-commands&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional documentation on
writing macros using the internal scripting language can be
found in the file macros.doc, distributed with the vile
source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RELATED PROGRAMS <br>
vile may also be built and installed as xvile, in which case
it behaves as a native X Windows application, with
scrollbars, better mouse support, etc. The help file has
more <br>
information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a program distributed
with the vile source which is usually installed as
vile-manfilt. (Two versions of the source for vile-manfilt
are available, in C (manfilt.c) and <br>
in Perl (manfilt.pl).) It may be used in conjunction with
vile or xvile (with the help of the macro in the file
manpage.rc) to filter and view system manual pages. xvile
will <br>
even (with your font set properly) display certain portions
of the manual page text in bold or italics as appropriate.
See the help file for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, there are several
language filters, e.g., vile-c-filt for C, which can
embolden, underline, or perform coloring on program source
code. Again, see the help file for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENCRYPTION <br>
The program vile-crypt can be used to encrypt/decrypt files
using the same algorithm as microEmac&rsquo;s internal crypt
algorithm. This program, which uses public domain code
written <br>
by by Dana Hoggatt, is no longer used in vile, though it is
provided for compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vile currently uses the crypt(3)
function for encryption/decryption, which is available on
most Unix systems. This ensures that vile is able to read
and write files compatibly <br>
with vi (but not vim, which uses an different algorithm
derived from info-zip). The editor&rsquo;s
encryption/decryption key can be specified on the command
line with &quot;-k key&quot;. Text <br>
to be encrypted can be specified as filenames on the command
line, or provided as the standard input. On systems with a
getpass() library routine, the user will be prompted for
<br>
the encryption key if it is not given on the command line.
To accommodate systems (such as linux) where the getpass()
library routine is not interruptible from the keyboard, <br>
entering a crypt-key password which ends in ^C will cause
the program to quit. See the help file for more information
on vile&rsquo;s encryption support, including a discussion
of a <br>
collection of macros that interface with GNU&rsquo;s gpg
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
VILEINIT <br>
Editor initialization commands in lieu of a startup file.
These are copied into [vileinit], and executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VILE_HELP_FILE <br>
Override the name of the help file, normally
&lsquo;&lsquo;vile.hlp&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VILE_LIBDIR_PATH <br>
Augment $PATH when searching for a filter program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VILE_STARTUP_FILE <br>
Override the name of the startup file, normally
&lsquo;&lsquo;.vilerc&rsquo;&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;&lsquo;vile.rc&rsquo;&rsquo; for non-UNIX
systems).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VILE_STARTUP_PATH <br>
Override the search path for the startup and help files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
Your favorite vi document, the file macros.doc, and the vile
help page, available with the -h option or as the text file
vile.hlp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBTS and CREDITS <br>
vile was originally built from a copy of microEmacs, so a
large debt of gratitude is due to the developers of that
program. A lot of people have helped with code and bug
reports <br>
on vile. Names are named at the bottom of the help file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
vile was created by Paul Fox, Tom Dickey, and Kevin
Buettner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The &quot;VI Like Emacs&quot; joke isn&rsquo;t really funny.
It only sounds that way. :-) Other suspicious behavior
should be reported via the project mailing list, or via the
web-based bug <br>
reporting system. Both of these are available here:</p>
