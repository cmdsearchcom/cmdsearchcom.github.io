<p>CHATTR(1) General Commands Manual CHATTR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chattr - change file attributes on a Linux file system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chattr [ -RVf ] [ -v version ] [ mode ] files...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
chattr changes the file attributes on a Linux file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of a symbolic mode is
+-=[aAcCdDeijsStTu].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operator &rsquo;+&rsquo;
causes the selected attributes to be added to the existing
attributes of the files; &rsquo;-&rsquo; causes them to be
removed; and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The letters
&rsquo;aAcCdDeijsStTu&rsquo; select the new attributes for
the files: append only (a), no atime updates (A), compressed
(c), no copy on write (C), no dump (d), synchronous
direc&acirc; <br>
tory updates (D), extent format (e), immutable (i), data
journalling (j), secure deletion (s), synchronous updates
(S), no tail-merging (t), top of directory hierarchy (T),
and <br>
undeletable (u).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following attributes are
read-only, and may be listed by lsattr(1) but not modified
by chattr: compression error (E), huge file (h), indexed
directory (I), inline data (N), <br>
compression raw access (X), and compressed dirty file
(Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not all flags are supported or
utilized by all filesystems; refer to filesystem-specific
man pages such as btrfs(5), ext4(5), and xfs(5) for more
filesystem-specific details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-R Recursively change attributes of directories and their
contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Be verbose with
chattr&rsquo;s output and print the program version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Suppress most error
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v version <br>
Set the file&rsquo;s version/generation number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ATTRIBUTES <br>
A file with the &rsquo;a&rsquo; attribute set can only be
open in append mode for writing. Only the superuser or a
process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can
set or clear <br>
this attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a file with the
&rsquo;A&rsquo; attribute set is accessed, its atime record
is not modified. This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O
for laptop systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;c&rsquo;
attribute set is automatically compressed on the disk by the
kernel. A read from this file returns uncompressed data. A
write to this file compresses data <br>
before storing them on the disk. Note: please make sure to
read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this
document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;C&rsquo;
attribute set will not be subject to copy-on-write updates.
This flag is only supported on file systems which perform
copy-on-write. (Note: For btrfs, the <br>
&rsquo;C&rsquo; flag should be set on new or empty files. If
it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it is
undefined when the blocks assigned to the file will be fully
stable. <br>
If the &rsquo;C&rsquo; flag is set on a directory, it will
have no effect on the directory, but new files created in
that directory will the No_COW attribute.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;d&rsquo;
attribute set is not candidate for backup when the dump(8)
program is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a directory with the
&rsquo;D&rsquo; attribute set is modified, the changes are
written synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to the
&rsquo;dirsync&rsquo; mount option applied to a subset <br>
of the files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;e&rsquo; attribute
indicates that the file is using extents for mapping the
blocks on disk. It may not be removed using chattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;E&rsquo; attribute is
used by the experimental compression patches to indicate
that a compressed file has a compression error. It may not
be set or reset using chattr(1), <br>
although it can be displayed by lsattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;h&rsquo; attribute
indicates the file is storing its blocks in units of the
filesystem blocksize instead of in units of sectors, and
means that the file is (or at one time was) <br>
larger than 2TB. It may not be set or reset using chattr(1),
although it can be displayed by lsattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;i&rsquo;
attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or
renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can
be written to the file. Only the superuser <br>
or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability
can set or clear this attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;I&rsquo; attribute is
used by the htree code to indicate that a directory is being
indexed using hashed trees. It may not be set or reset using
chattr(1), although it can be dis&acirc; <br>
played by lsattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;j&rsquo;
attribute has all of its data written to the ext3 or ext4
journal before being written to the file itself, if the
filesystem is mounted with the <br>
&quot;data=ordered&quot; or &quot;data=writeback&quot;
options. When the filesystem is mounted with the
&quot;data=journal&quot; option all file data is already
journalled and this attribute has no effect. <br>
Only the superuser or a process possessing the
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability can set or clear this
attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;N&rsquo;
attribute set indicates that the file has data stored
inline, within the inode itself. It may not be set or reset
using chattr(1), although it can be dis&acirc; <br>
played by lsattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a file with the
&rsquo;s&rsquo; attribute set is deleted, its blocks are
zeroed and written back to the disk. Note: please make sure
to read the bugs and limitations section at the end <br>
of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a file with the
&rsquo;S&rsquo; attribute set is modified, the changes are
written synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to the
&rsquo;sync&rsquo; mount option applied to a subset of the
<br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file with the &rsquo;t&rsquo;
attribute will not have a partial block fragment at the end
of the file merged with other files (for those filesystems
which support tail-merging). This is <br>
necessary for applications such as LILO which read the
filesystem directly, and which don&rsquo;t understand
tail-merged files. Note: As of this writing, the ext2 or
ext3 filesystems <br>
do not (yet, except in very experimental patches) support
tail-merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A directory with the
&rsquo;T&rsquo; attribute will be deemed to be the top of
directory hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block
allocator. This is a hint to the block allocator <br>
used by ext3 and ext4 that the subdirectories under this
directory are not related, and thus should be spread apart
for allocation purposes. For example it is a very good idea
<br>
to set the &rsquo;T&rsquo; attribute on the /home directory,
so that /home/john and /home/mary are placed into separate
block groups. For directories where this attribute is not
set, the <br>
Orlov block allocator will try to group subdirectories
closer together where possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a file with the
&rsquo;u&rsquo; attribute set is deleted, its contents are
saved. This allows the user to ask for its undeletion. Note:
please make sure to read the bugs and limita&acirc; <br>
tions section at the end of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;X&rsquo; attribute is
used by the experimental compression patches to indicate
that the raw contents of a compressed file can be accessed
directly. It currently may not be set or <br>
reset using chattr(1), although it can be displayed by
lsattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;Z&rsquo; attribute is
used by the experimental compression patches to indicate a
compressed file is dirty. It may not be set or reset using
chattr(1), although it can be dis&acirc; <br>
played by lsattr(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
chattr was written by Remy Card &lt;Remy.Card@linux.org&gt;.
It is currently being maintained by Theodore Ts&rsquo;o
&lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS AND LIMITATIONS <br>
The &rsquo;c&rsquo;, &rsquo;s&rsquo;, and &rsquo;u&rsquo;
attributes are not honored by the ext2, ext3, and ext4
filesystems as implemented in the current mainline Linux
kernels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;j&rsquo; option is
only useful if the filesystem is mounted as ext3 or
ext4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;D&rsquo; option is
only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AVAILABILITY <br>
chattr is part of the e2fsprogs package and is available
from http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net.</p>
