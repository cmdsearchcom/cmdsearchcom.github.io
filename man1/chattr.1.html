chattr - change file attributes on a Linux file system

<b>chattr</b> [ <b>-RVf</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> <i>version</i> ] [ <i>mode</i> ]

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>chattr</b> changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[aAcCdDeijsStTu].
<div class="Pp"></div>
The operator '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the existing
  attributes of the files; '-' causes them to be removed; and
<div class="Pp"></div>
The letters 'aAcCdDeijsStTu' select the new attributes for the files: append
  only (a), no atime updates (A), compressed (c), no copy on write (C), no dump
  (d), synchronous directory updates (D), extent format (e), immutable (i), data
  journalling (j), secure deletion (s), synchronous updates (S), no tail-merging
  (t), top of directory hierarchy (T), and undeletable (u).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by <b>lsattr</b>(1)
  but not modified by chattr: compression error (E), huge file (h), indexed
  directory (I), inline data (N), compression raw access (X), and compressed
  dirty file (Z).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Not all flags are supported or utilized by all filesystems; refer to
  filesystem-specific man pages such as <b>btrfs</b>(5), <b>ext4</b>(5), and
  <b>xfs</b>(5) for more filesystem-specific details.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ATTRIBUTES"><a class="selflink" href="#ATTRIBUTES">ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
A file with the 'a' attribute set can only be open in append mode for writing.
  Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability
  can set or clear this attribute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a file with the 'A' attribute set is accessed, its atime record is not
  modified. This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O for laptop systems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 'c' attribute set is automatically compressed on the disk by the
  kernel. A read from this file returns uncompressed data. A write to this file
  compresses data before storing them on the disk. Note: please make sure to
  read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 'C' attribute set will not be subject to copy-on-write updates.
  This flag is only supported on file systems which perform copy-on-write.
  (Note: For btrfs, the 'C' flag should be set on new or empty files. If it is
  set on a file which already has data blocks, it is undefined when the blocks
  assigned to the file will be fully stable. If the 'C' flag is set on a
  directory, it will have no effect on the directory, but new files created in
  that directory will the No_COW attribute.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 'd' attribute set is not candidate for backup when the
  <b>dump</b>(8) program is run.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a directory with the 'D' attribute set is modified, the changes are written
  synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to the 'dirsync' mount option
  applied to a subset of the files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'e' attribute indicates that the file is using extents for mapping the
  blocks on disk. It may not be removed using <b>chattr</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'E' attribute is used by the experimental compression patches to indicate
  that a compressed file has a compression error. It may not be set or reset
  using <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'h' attribute indicates the file is storing its blocks in units of the
  filesystem blocksize instead of in units of sectors, and means that the file
  is (or at one time was) larger than 2TB. It may not be set or reset using
  <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 'i' attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or
  renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can be written to the
  file. Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
  capability can set or clear this attribute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'I' attribute is used by the htree code to indicate that a directory is
  being indexed using hashed trees. It may not be set or reset using
  <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 'j' attribute has all of its data written to the ext3 or ext4
  journal before being written to the file itself, if the filesystem is mounted
  with the &quot;data=ordered&quot; or &quot;data=writeback&quot; options. When
  the filesystem is mounted with the &quot;data=journal&quot; option all file
  data is already journalled and this attribute has no effect. Only the
  superuser or a process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability can set or
  clear this attribute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 'N' attribute set indicates that the file has data stored
  inline, within the inode itself. It may not be set or reset using
  <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a file with the 's' attribute set is deleted, its blocks are zeroed and
  written back to the disk. Note: please make sure to read the bugs and
  limitations section at the end of this document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a file with the 'S' attribute set is modified, the changes are written
  synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to the 'sync' mount option
  applied to a subset of the files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A file with the 't' attribute will not have a partial block fragment at the end
  of the file merged with other files (for those filesystems which support
  tail-merging). This is necessary for applications such as LILO which read the
  filesystem directly, and which don't understand tail-merged files. Note: As of
  this writing, the ext2 or ext3 filesystems do not (yet, except in very
  experimental patches) support tail-merging.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A directory with the 'T' attribute will be deemed to be the top of directory
  hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block allocator. This is a hint to
  the block allocator used by ext3 and ext4 that the subdirectories under this
  directory are not related, and thus should be spread apart for allocation
  purposes. For example it is a very good idea to set the 'T' attribute on the
  /home directory, so that /home/john and /home/mary are placed into separate
  block groups. For directories where this attribute is not set, the Orlov block
  allocator will try to group subdirectories closer together where possible.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a file with the 'u' attribute set is deleted, its contents are saved. This
  allows the user to ask for its undeletion. Note: please make sure to read the
  bugs and limitations section at the end of this document.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'X' attribute is used by the experimental compression patches to indicate
  that the raw contents of a compressed file can be accessed directly. It
  currently may not be set or reset using <b>chattr</b>(1), although it can be
  displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'Z' attribute is used by the experimental compression patches to indicate a
  compressed file is dirty. It may not be set or reset using <b>chattr</b>(1),
  although it can be displayed by <b>lsattr</b>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="AUTHOR"><a class="selflink" href="#AUTHOR">AUTHOR</a></h1>
<b>chattr</b> was written by Remy Card &lt;Remy.Card@linux.org&gt;. It is
  currently being maintained by Theodore Ts'o &lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS_AND_LIMITATIONS">BUGS
  AND LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
The 'c', 's', and 'u' attributes are not honored by the ext2, ext3, and ext4
  filesystems as implemented in the current mainline Linux kernels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'j' option is only useful if the filesystem is mounted as ext3 or ext4.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The 'D' option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.
