<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
frozen-bubble - arcade/reflex game</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
frozen-bubble [OPTION]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Frozen-Bubble game is a free software implementation of
a popular arcade/reflex game. The game mainly consists of
firing randomly chosen bubbles across the board. If the <br>
shoot ends up having a clump of at least 3 bubbles of the
same color, they all pop. If some bubbles were sticked only
on the popping clump, they fall. In 1-player mode, the goal
<br>
is to pop all the bubbles on the board as quickly as
possible. In 2-players or network mode, you have to get your
opponent to &quot;die&quot; before you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTROL <br>
The default controlling mechanism is through the keyboard,
but you can play with a joystick or a joypad if it is
supported by the system (use the commandline option -ji to
make <br>
sure frozen-bubble detected your joysticks). A key (or a
joystick direction or button) is needed for moving the aim
to the left, moving the aim to the right, center, and
fire.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1-PLAYER GAME <br>
In single player mode, as a beginner the best training is to
choose Play Default Levelset, which lets you run through 100
levels of an increasing difficulty. Pop all the bubbles <br>
of each level to advance to the next level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to train for
multiplayer, choose Multiplayer Training which reproduces
the conditions of 2-player or network mode; the only
difference is that created malus bubbles <br>
are counted in your score, and you must get the highest
score you can in 2 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2-PLAYERS GAME <br>
In 2-players mode, you can play against a friend (or a foe,
actually) on the same computer. The board is populated with
random bubbles, and your goal is to make big clumps to <br>
send malus bubbles to your opponent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NETWORK GAME <br>
If your computer has networking, you can choose LAN GAME to
play games against others on your local network (up to 5
players). Frozen-Bubble will look for a game server on the
<br>
local network with a UDP broadcast, connect to it if found,
or start a new game server if not found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your computer is connected to
Internet, you can choose NET GAME to play against others on
Earth (or beyond?). Frozen-Bubble will retrieve the server
list from the master <br>
server and propose you to choose between available servers.
The flag in front of a server indicates the preferred
language for chatting with others before the game is
started. <br>
The ping is the roundtrip when talking with the server,
choose a low ping when possible.</p>
