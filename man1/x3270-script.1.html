<p>X3270-SCRIPT(1) General Commands Manual
X3270-SCRIPT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Scripting Facilities for x3270, s3270, ws3270 and c3270</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
x3270 -script [ x3270-options ] <br>
s3270 [ s3270-options ] <br>
ws3270 [ ws3270-options ] <br>
Script ( command [ ,arg... ] )</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The x3270 scripting facilities allow the interactive 3270
emulators x3270 and c3270 to be operated under the control
of another program, and form the basis for the script-only
<br>
emulators s3270 and ws3270.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two basic scripting
methods. The first is the peer script facility, invoked by
the x3270 -script switch, and the default mode for s3270 and
ws3270. This runs x3270, <br>
s3270 or ws3270 as a child of another process. Typically
this would be a script using expect(1), perl(1), or the
co-process facility of the Korn Shell ksh(1). Inthis mode,
the <br>
emulator process looks for commands on its standard input,
and places the responses on standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second method is the child
script facility, invoked by the Script action in x3270,
c3270, or s3270. This runs a script as a child process of
the emulator. The child has <br>
access to pipes connected to the emulator; the emulator look
for commands on one pipe, and places the responses on the
other. (The file descriptor of the pipe for commands to <br>
the emulator is passed in the environment variable
X3270INPUT; the file descriptor of the pipe for responses
from the emulator is passed in the environment variable
X3270OUTPUT.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to mix the two
methods. A script can invoke another script with the Script
action, and may also be implicitly nested when a script
invokes the Connect action, and <br>
the ibm_hosts file specifies a login script for that host
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are emulator actions;
the syntax is the same as for the right-hand side of an Xt
translation table entry (an x3270 or c3270 keymap). Unlike
translation tables, action <br>
names are case-insensitive, can be uniquely abbreviated, and
the parentheses may be omitted if there are no parameters.
Any input line that begins with # or ! is treaded as a <br>
comment and will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any emulator action may be
specified. Several specific actions have been defined for
use by scripts, and the behavior of certain other actions
(and of the emulators in general) <br>
is different when an action is initiated by a script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some actions generate output;
some may delay completion until the certain external events
occur, such as the host unlocking the keyboard. The
completion of every command is <br>
marked by a two-line message. The first line is the current
status of the emulator, documented below. If the command is
successful, the second line is the string &quot;ok&quot;;
other&acirc; <br>
wise it is the string &quot;error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATUS FORMAT <br>
The status message consists of 12 blank-separated
fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 Keyboard State <br>
If the keyboard is unlocked, the letter U. If the keyboard
is locked waiting for a response from the host, or if not
connected to a host, the letter L. If the keyboard <br>
is locked because of an operator error (field overflow,
protected field, etc.), the letter E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 Screen Formatting <br>
If the screen is formatted, the letter F. If unformatted or
in NVT mode, the letter U.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 Field Protection <br>
If the field containing the cursor is protected, the letter
P. If unprotected or unformatted, the letter U.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4 Connection State <br>
If connected to a host, the string C(hostname). Otherwise,
the letter N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 Emulator Mode <br>
If connected in 3270 mode, the letter I. If connected in NVT
line mode, the letter L. If connected in NVT character mode,
the letter C. If connected in unnegotiated <br>
mode (no BIND active from the host), the letter P. If not
connected, the letter N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Model Number (2-5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 Number of Rows <br>
The current number of rows defined on the screen. The host
can request that the emulator use a 24x80 screen, so this
number may be smaller than the maximum number of rows <br>
possible with the current model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 Number of Columns <br>
The current number of columns defined on the screen, subject
to the same difference for rows, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 Cursor Row <br>
The current cursor row (zero-origin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 Cursor Column <br>
The current cursor column (zero-origin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">11 Window ID <br>
The X window identifier for the main x3270 window, in
hexadecimal preceded by 0x. For s3270, ws3270 and c3270,
this is zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 Command Execution Time <br>
The time that it took for the host to respond to the
previous commnd, in seconds with milliseconds after the
decimal. If the previous command did not require a host <br>
response, this is a dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES <br>
When an action is initiated by a script, the emulators
behave in several different ways:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an error occurs in processing
an action, the usual pop-up window does not appear. Instead,
the text is written to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If end-of-file is detected on
standard input, the emulator exits. (A script can exit
without killing the emulator by using the CloseScript
action, below.) Note that this <br>
applies to peer scripts only; end-of-file on the pipe
connected to a child script simply causes the pipes to be
closed and the Script action to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Quit action always causes
the emulator to exit. (When called from the keyboard, it
will exit only if not connected to a host.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, the AID actions
(Clear, Enter, PF, and PA) will not complete until the host
unlocks the keyboard. If the parameter to a String action
includes a code for one these <br>
actions, it will also wait for the keyboard to unlock before
proceeding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The AidWait toggle controls with
behavior. When this toggle is set (the default), actions
block as described above. When the toggle is clear, AID
actions complete immediately. <br>
The Wait(Output) action can then be used to delay a script
until the host changes something on the screen, and the
Wait(Unlock) action can be used to delay a script until the
<br>
host unlocks the keyboard, regardless of the state of the
AidWait toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the Script action does
not complete until end-of-file is detected on the pipe or
the CloseScript action is called by the child process. This
behavior is not affected <br>
by the state of the AidWait toggle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCRIPT-SPECIFIC ACTIONS <br>
The following actions have been defined or modified for use
with scripts. (Note that unlike the display on the status
line, row and col coordinates used in these actions use <br>
[0,0] as their origin, not [1,1]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AnsiText <br>
Outputs whatever data that has been output by the host in
NVT mode since the last time that AnsiText was called. The
data is preceded by the string &quot;data: &quot;, and has
had <br>
all control characters expanded into C backslash
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a convenient way to
capture NVT mode output in a synchronous manner without
trying to decode the screen contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ascii(row,col,rows,cols)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ascii(row,col,length)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ascii(length)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ascii Outputs an ASCII text
representation of the screen contents. Each line is preceded
by the string &quot;data: &quot;, and there are no control
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If four parameters are given, a
rectangular region of the screen is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If three parameters are given,
length characters are output, starting at the specified row
and column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If only the length parameter is
given, that many characters are output, starting at the
cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no parameters are given, the
entire screen is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EBCDIC-to-ASCII translation
and output character set depend on the both the emulator
character set (the -charset option) and the locale. UTF-8
and certain DBCS <br>
locales may result in multi-byte expansions of EBCDIC
characters that translate to ASCII codes greater than
0x7f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AsciiField <br>
Outputs an ASCII text representation of the field containing
the cursor. The text is preceded by the string &quot;data:
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Connect(hostname) <br>
Connects to a host. The command does not return until the
emulator is successfully connected in the proper mode, or
the connection fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CloseScript(status) <br>
Causes the emulator to stop reading commands from the
script. This is useful to allow a peer script to exit, with
the emulator proceeding interactively. (Without this <br>
command, the emulator would exit when it detected
end-of-file on standard input.) If the script was invoked by
the Script action, the optional status is used as the <br>
return status of Script; if nonzero, Script will complete
with an error, and if this script was invoked as part of
login through the ibm_hosts file, the connection will be
<br>
broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ContinueScript(param) <br>
Allows a script that is waiting in a PauseScript action,
below, to continue. The param given is output by the
PauseScript action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disconnect <br>
Disconnects from the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ebcdic(row,col,rows,cols)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ebcdic(row,col,length)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ebcdic(length)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ebcdic The same function as
Ascii above, except that rather than generating ASCII text,
each character is output as a hexadecimal EBCDIC code,
preceded by 0x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EbcdicField <br>
The same function as AsciiField above, except that it
generates hexadecimal EBCDIC codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info(message) <br>
In x3270, pops up an informational message. In c3270 and
wc3270, writes an informational message to the OIA (the line
below the display). Not defined for s3270 or <br>
tcl3270.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Expect(text[,timeout]) <br>
Pauses the script until the specified text appears in the
data stream from the host, or the specified timeout (in
seconds) expires. If no timeout is specified, the <br>
default is 30 seconds. Text can contain standard C-language
escape (backslash) sequences. No wild-card characters or
pattern anchor characters are understood. Expect is <br>
valid only in NVT mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MoveCursor(row,col) <br>
Moves the cursor to the specified coordinates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PauseScript <br>
Stops a script until the ContinueScript action, above, is
executed. This allows a script to wait for user input and
continue. Outputs the single parameter to Continue&acirc;
<br>
Script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PrintText([command,]filter))
<br>
Pipes an ASCII representation of the current screen image
through the named filter, e.g., lpr.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">PrintText([html,],file,filename))
<br>
Saves the current screen contents in a file. With the html
option, saves it as HTML, otherwise saves it as plain
ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PrintText(html,string) <br>
Returns the current screen contents as HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReadBuffer(Ascii) <br>
Dumps the contents of the screen buffer, one line at a time.
Positions inside data fields are generally output as 2-digit
hexadecimal codes in the current display charac&acirc; <br>
ter set. If the current locale specifies UTF-8 (or certain
DBCS character sets), some positions may be output as
multi-byte strings (4-, 6- or 8-digit codes). DBCS
char&acirc; <br>
acters take two positions in the screen buffer; the first
location is output as a multi-byte string in the current
locale codeset, and the second location is output as a <br>
dash. Start-of-field characters (each of which takes up a
display position) are output as SF(aa=nn[,...]), where aa is
a field attribute type and nn is its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attribute Values <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extended attributes (which do
not take up display positions) are output as SA(aa=nn), with
aa and nn having the same definitions as above (though the
basic 3270 attribute <br>
will never appear as an extended attribute).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, NULL characters in
the screen buffer are reported as ASCII character 00 instead
of 20, even though they should be displayed as blanks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ReadBuffer(Ebcdic) <br>
Equivalent to Snap(Ascii), but with the data fields output
as hexadecimal EBCDIC codes instead. Additionally, if a
buffer position has the Graphic Escape attribute, it is <br>
displayed as GE(xx).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap Equivalent to Snap(Save)
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Ascii,...) <br>
Performs the Ascii action on the saved screen image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Cols) <br>
Returns the number of columns in the saved screen image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Ebcdic,...) <br>
Performs the Ebcdic action on the saved screen image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(ReadBuffer) <br>
Performs the ReadBuffer action on the saved screen
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Rows) <br>
Returns the number of rows in the saved screen image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Save) <br>
Saves a copy of the screen image and status in a temporary
buffer. This copy can be queried with other Snap actions to
allow a script to examine a consistent screen <br>
image, even when the host may be changing the image (or even
the screen dimensions) dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Status) <br>
Returns the status line from when the screen was last
saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Snap(Wait[,timeout],Output) <br>
Pauses the script until the host sends further output, then
updates the snap buffer with the new screen contents. Used
when the host unlocks the keyboard (allowing the <br>
script to proceed after an Enter, PF or PA action), but has
not finished updating the screen. This action is usually
invoked in a loop that uses the Snap(Ascii) or <br>
Snap(Ebcdic) action to scan the screen for some pattern that
indicates that the host has fully processed the last
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Snap action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Source(file) <br>
Read and execute commands from file. Any output from those
commands will become the output from Source. If any of the
commands fails, the Source command will not abort; <br>
it will continue reading commands until EOF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Title(text) <br>
Changes the x3270 window title to text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transfer(keyword=value,...) <br>
Invokes IND$FILE file transfer. See FILE TRANSFER below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait([timeout,] 3270Mode) <br>
Used when communicating with a host that switches between
NVT mode and 3270 mode. Pauses the script or macro until the
host negotiates 3270 mode, then waits for a <br>
formatted screen as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Wait action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backwards compatibility,
Wait(3270) is equivalent to Wait(3270Mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait([timeout,] Disconnect) <br>
Pauses the script until the host disconnects. Often used to
after sending a logoff command to a VM/CMS host, to ensure
that the session is not unintentionally set to <br>
disconnected state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Wait action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait([timeout,] InputField) <br>
A useful utility for use at the beginning of scripts and
after the Connect action. In 3270 mode, waits until the
screen is formatted, and the host has positioned the <br>
cursor on a modifiable field. In NVT mode, waits until the
host sends at least one byte of data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Wait action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backwards compatibility,
Wait is equivalent to Wait(InputField).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait([timeout,] NVTMode) <br>
Used when communicating with a host that switches between
3270 mode and NVT mode. Pauses the script or macro until the
host negotiates NVT mode, then waits for a byte <br>
from the host as above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Wait action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backwards compatibility,
Wait(ansi) is equivalent to Wait(NVTMode).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait([timeout,] Output) <br>
Pauses the script until the host sends further output. Often
needed when the host unlocks the keyboard (allowing the
script to proceed after a Clear, Enter, PF or PA <br>
action), but has not finished updating the screen. Also used
in non-blocking AID mode (see DIFFERENCES for details). This
action is usually invoked in a loop that uses <br>
the Ascii or Ebcdic action to scan the screen for some
pattern that indicates that the host has fully processed the
last command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Wait action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait([timeout,] Unlock) <br>
Pauses the script until the host unlocks the keyboard. This
is useful when operating in non-blocking AID mode (toggle
AidWait clear), to wait for a host command to <br>
complete. See DIFFERENCES for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional timeout parameter
specifies a number of seconds to wait before failing the
Wait action. The default is to wait indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wait(timeout, Seconds) <br>
Delays the script timeout seconds. Unlike the other forms of
Wait, the timeout is not optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WindowState(mode) <br>
If mode is Iconic, changes the x3270 window into an icon. If
mode is Normal, changes the x3270 window from an icon to a
normal window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE TRANSFER <br>
The Transfer action implements IND$FILE file transfer. This
action requires that the IND$FILE program be installed on
the IBM host, and that the 3270 cursor be located in a <br>
field that will accept a TSO or VM/CMS command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Transfer action can be
entered at the command prompt with no parameters, which will
cause it to prompt interactively for the file names and
options. It can also be invoked <br>
with parameters to define the entire transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the complexity and
number of options for file transfer, the parameters to the
Transfer action take the unique form of option=value, and
can appear in any order. Note <br>
that if the value contains spaces (such as a VM/CMS file
name), then the entire parameter must be quoted, e.g.,
&quot;HostFile=xxx foo a&quot;. The options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option Required? Default Other

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option details are as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Direction <br>
send to send a file to the host, receive to receive a file
from the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HostFile <br>
The name of the file on the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LocalFile <br>
The name of the file on the local workstation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host The type of host (which
dictates the form of the IND$FILE command): tso (the
default) or vm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode Use ascii (the default) for
a text file, which will be translated between EBCDIC and
ASCII as necessary. Use binary for non-text files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cr Controls how Newline
characters are handled when transferring Mode=ascii files.
remove (the default) strips Newline characters in local
files before transferring them to <br>
the host. add adds Newline characters to each host file
record before transferring it to the local workstation. keep
preserves Newline characters when transferring a <br>
local file to the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remap Controls text translation
for Mode=ascii files. The value yes (the default) causes
x3270-script to remap the text to ensure maximum
compatibility between the <br>
workstation&rsquo;s character set and encoding and the
host&rsquo;s EBCDIC code page. The value no causes
x3270-script to pass the text to or from the host as-is,
leaving all <br>
translation to the IND$FILE program on the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exist Controls what happens when
the destination file already exists. keep (the default)
preserves the file, causing the Transfer action to fail.
replace overwrites the <br>
destination file with the source file. append appends the
source file to the destination file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Recfm Controls the record format
of files created on the host. fixed creates a file with
fixed-length records. variable creates a file with
variable-length records. undefined <br>
creates a file with undefined-length records (TSO hosts
only). The Lrecl option controls the record length or
maximum record length for Recfm=fixed and Recfm=variable
<br>
files, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lrecl Specifies the record
length (or maximum record length) for files created on the
host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blksize <br>
Specifies the block size for files created on the host. (TSO
hosts only.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Allocation <br>
Specifies the units for the TSO host PrimarySpace and
SecondarySpace options: tracks, cylinders or avblock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PrimarySpace <br>
Primary allocation for a file created on a TSO host. The
units are given by the Allocation option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SecondarySpace <br>
