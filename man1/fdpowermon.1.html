<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fdpowermon - add a battery level icon to a
freedesktop.org-compliant system tray</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fdpowermon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program allows one to display a &quot;battery
level&quot; icon in any freedesktop.org-compliant status
area. It can be themed through either a plain-text
configuration file <br>
(/etc/fdpowermon/theme.cfg or
$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/fdpowermon/theme.cfg), or through a short
perl script (/etc/fdpowermon/theme.pl or
$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/fdpowermon/theme.pl). If <br>
$XDG_CONFIG_DIR is not set, $HOME/.config is used as a
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The former is easier, as it
doesn&rsquo;t require any scripting; and indeed the default
configuration is an example of such a plain-text theme.
However, the latter allows for more <br>
flexibility, as one can define callbacks that should be run
when the battery level reaches a certain threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Themes, whether perl themes or
plain-text themes, are built through &rsquo;steps&rsquo;,
which are defined in a single line. In a plain-text config
file, such a line looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discharging =
2:missing.png:low.png, 10:low.png, 100:full.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This defines three steps. The
highest step shows &quot;full.png&quot; when the battery
level is between 11% and 100% (inclusive); the second step
shows &quot;low.png&quot; when the battery level is <br>
between 3% and 10% (inclusive); and the third step will
alternate between &quot;missing.png&quot; and
&quot;low.png&quot; on three-second intervals, when the
battery is between 0% and 2%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the line starts with
&quot;discharging&quot;, these steps are used when the
system is running on battery power. A similar line of steps
could be defined for when the battery is <br>
charging:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">charging = 0:empty-charging.png,
10:low-charging.png, 100: full-charging.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this will show
&quot;empty-charging.png&quot; when the battery is at 0%
(exactly), &quot;low-charging.png&quot; between 1% and 10%
(inclusive), and &quot;full-charging.png&quot; at 11% and
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ordering is
significant: steps should be defined from low to high.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To complete the theme
configuration, we must add a few more items:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[mytheme] <br>
steps = 3 <br>
dir = /home/wouter/.fdpowermon/mytheme-icons <br>
charging = 0:empty-charging.png, 10:low-charging.png, 100:
full-charging.png <br>
discharging = 2:missing.png:low.png, 10:low.png,
100:full.png</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This defines a theme called
&quot;mytheme&quot; which has three steps, and will look for
images in the directory
&quot;/home/wouter/.fdpowermon/mytheme-icons&quot;. It is
not possible to define a <br>
theme which has a different number of steps for the charging
phase than it does for the discharging phase; if you want
that, just define (an) extra step(s) for the phase that you
<br>
would like to have less steps, which has the same icon as
the step above or below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that ordering is
significant here, too; the &quot;steps&quot; line should
appear before any &quot;charging&quot; or
&quot;discharging&quot; lines (this was not the case in
fdpowermon 1.7 or below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one theme is
configured, fdpowermon will, by default, use the last theme
defined in the per-user configuration, or (if no per-user
configuration file exists) the <br>
last theme defined in the system-wide configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl theme config files can use
fdpowermon::theme::make_default to change the default
theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL API <br>
@warnings <br>
The @fdpowermon::theme::warnings array can be used to
specify at which levels fdpowermon should issue a standard
warning. The default is (10, 5, 1), which means to issue a
<br>
warning at a level of 10%, 5%, and 1%. Note that if the
battery runs flat at a particularly fast pace, the level may
have reduced even further than that before the warning is
<br>
issued; also, fdpowermon will issue a warning immediately
when power is removed from the machine and the power is
below the first level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To make fdpowermon always issue
a warning when power is removed, set this to something like
(100, 10, 5, 1). To make fdpowermon issue warnings at 20%,
10%, and 5%, set this to <br>
(20, 10, 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is not possible to
change the text of the warning. If you want that, see the
fdpowermon::theme::warning sub, and use an event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$use_notify <br>
The variable $fdpowermon::theme::use_notify can be used to
decide whether to use a libnotify message (if set to a
nonzero value), or a dialog window (if set to a value which
<br>
evaluates to zero).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to use libnotify
if the libnotify Glib introspection data is installed, or a
dialog box if not. Because dialog boxes can steal the focus
and therefore wreak havoc <br>
with the user&rsquo;s work, using libnotify is strongly
recommended by the author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that if you set the
variable to nonzero explicitly, then the test whether or not
the Glib introspection data is installed will be ignored.
Make sure it&rsquo;s available in that <br>
case!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new <br>
Create a new fdpowermon theme. Returns a blessed reference;
e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $theme = new
fdpowermon::theme;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;set_stepcount($count)
<br>
Set the number of steps in the theme. Note that an
fdpowermon theme must have an equal number of steps in both
the &quot;charging&quot; and the &quot;discharging&quot;
direction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should be called before calling
set_charging, set_discharging, or parse_step.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;set_dir($dir) <br>
Set the base directory used for icon file names.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;set_charging(@elements)
<br>
Set the icons that should be shown when the battery is
charging. The argument should be created by way of the
parse_step method.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;set_discharging(@elements)
<br>
Set the icons that should be shown when the battery is
discharging. The argument should be created by way of the
parse_step method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;parse_step($defs)
<br>
Parses the given string into something that can be passed on
to set_charging or set_discharging. The definitions should
be in the steps format, described above, without the <br>
leading &quot; charging = &quot; or &quot; discharging =
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While this method returns an
arrayref that can be inspected and (probably) modified,
themes that want to be forward-compatible should treat it as
an opaque data structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;set_event($step,
callback, &rsquo;d&rsquo;) <br>
Update the theme so the sub &rsquo;callback&rsquo; is
executed when we&rsquo;re discharging and we reach $step for
the first time. To set an event when charging instead, pass
a &rsquo;c&rsquo; as the third <br>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the steps are arrays,
and are therefore 0-based; the lowest-numbered items are the
lowest-level steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the event triggers, the
callback routine will be passed two arguments: the first is
the current battery level (in percent); the second is a
number denoting whether the <br>
battery is currently charging (1) or discharging (0). In
case the parsing of the ACPI command fails, however, the
second argument may be undef; you should prepare for this
<br>
possibility. Note that fdpowermon itself handles that case
by assuming the battery is charging; you may or may not wish
to do the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$theme-&gt;register($name) <br>
Registers a theme under a given name. If a theme already
exists under that name, it is replaced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make_default($name) <br>
Makes a theme with a given name be the default theme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">get_theme($name) <br>
Looks up a theme with the given name; e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $theme =
fdpowermon::theme::get_theme(&quot;default&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning($message) <br>
Produce a warning, either using libnotify, or using a dialog
box:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">fdpowermon::theme::warning($message);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the documentation on
$fdpowermon::theme::use_notify above for details on which
implementation is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
For a full .cfg theme example, look above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To construct the same theme
fully from perl, you&rsquo;d do something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $theme = new
fdpowermon::theme; <br>
$theme-&gt;set_stepcount(3); <br>

$theme-&gt;set_dir(&quot;/home/wouter/.fdpowermon/mytheme-icons&quot;);
<br>

$theme-&gt;set_charging($theme-&gt;parse_step(&quot;0:empty-charging.png,
10:low-charging.png, 100: full-charging.png&quot;)); <br>

$theme-&gt;set_discharging($theme-&gt;parse_step(&quot;2:missing.png:low.png,
10:low.png, 100:full.png&quot;));</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(note, as a perl theme, this
would go in theme.pl, not theme.cfg; see above for possible
locations for perl themes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, unless you want to
build the theme dynamically, doing it this way is not
recommended. Instead, you would build the theme from a .cfg
file, and possibly modify it from <br>
perl. Let&rsquo;s say you wish to add an event to suspend
the system when the power gets low; in that case,
you&rsquo;d do something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub suspend { <br>
system(&quot;sudo pm-suspend&quot;); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $theme =
fdpowermon::theme::get_theme(&quot;mytheme&quot;); <br>
$theme-&gt;set_event(0, suspend, &rsquo;d&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This would call the
&rsquo;suspend&rsquo; sub when the battery is discharging
and we reach the lowest step (in the above example, that
would be when the battery reaches 10%; you might want <br>
to do that somewhat later). This &rsquo;suspend&rsquo; sub
simply calls the &quot;pm-suspend&quot; program, with sudo,
to suspend the system.</p>
