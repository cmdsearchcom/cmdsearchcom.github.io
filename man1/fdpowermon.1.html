fdpowermon - add a battery level icon to a freedesktop.org-compliant system tray
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
fdpowermon
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program allows one to display a &quot;battery level&quot; icon in any
  freedesktop.org-compliant status area. It can be themed through either a
  plain-text configuration file ( <i>/etc/fdpowermon/theme.cfg</i> or
  <i></i><i>$XDG_CONFIG_DIR</i> <i>/fdpowermon/theme.cfg</i>), or through a
  short perl script ( <i>/etc/fdpowermon/theme.pl</i> or
  <i></i><i>$XDG_CONFIG_DIR</i> <i>/fdpowermon/theme.pl</i>). If $XDG_CONFIG_DIR
  is not set, $HOME/.config is used as a default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The former is easier, as it doesn't require any scripting; and indeed the
  default configuration is an example of such a plain-text theme. However, the
  latter allows for more flexibility, as one can define callbacks that should be
  run when the battery level reaches a certain threshold.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Themes, whether perl themes or plain-text themes, are built through 'steps',
  which are defined in a single line. In a plain-text config file, such a line
  looks like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 discharging = 2:missing.png:low.png, 10:low.png, 100:full.png
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This defines three steps. The highest step shows &quot;full.png&quot; when the
  battery level is between 11% and 100% (inclusive); the second step shows
  &quot;low.png&quot; when the battery level is between 3% and 10% (inclusive);
  and the third step will alternate between &quot;missing.png&quot; and
  &quot;low.png&quot; on three-second intervals, when the battery is between 0%
  and 2%.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the line starts with &quot;discharging&quot;, these steps are used when
  the system is running on battery power. A similar line of steps could be
  defined for when the battery is charging:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 charging = 0:empty-charging.png, 10:low-charging.png, 100: full-charging.png
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
this will show &quot;empty-charging.png&quot; when the battery is at 0%
  (exactly), &quot;low-charging.png&quot; between 1% and 10% (inclusive), and
  &quot;full-charging.png&quot; at 11% and above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that ordering is significant: steps should be defined from low to high.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To complete the theme configuration, we must add a few more items:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 [mytheme]
 steps = 3
 dir = /home/wouter/.fdpowermon/mytheme-icons
 charging = 0:empty-charging.png, 10:low-charging.png, 100: full-charging.png
 discharging = 2:missing.png:low.png, 10:low.png, 100:full.png
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This defines a theme called &quot;mytheme&quot; which has three steps, and will
  look for images in the directory
  &quot;/home/wouter/.fdpowermon/mytheme-icons&quot;. It is not possible to
  define a theme which has a different number of steps for the charging phase
  than it does for the discharging phase; if you want that, just define (an)
  extra step(s) for the phase that you would like to have less steps, which has
  the same icon as the step above or below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that ordering is significant here, too; the &quot;steps&quot; line should
  appear before any &quot;charging&quot; or &quot;discharging&quot; lines (this
  was not the case in fdpowermon 1.7 or below).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If more than one theme is configured, fdpowermon will, by default, use the last
  theme defined in the per-user configuration, or (if no per-user configuration
  file exists) the last theme defined in the system-wide configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl theme config files can use fdpowermon::theme::make_default to change the
  default theme.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERL_API"><a class="selflink" href="#PERL_API">PERL
  API</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="@warnings"><a class="selflink" href="#@warnings">@warnings</a></h2>
The @fdpowermon::theme::warnings array can be used to specify at which levels
  fdpowermon should issue a standard warning. The default is (10, 5, 1), which
  means to issue a warning at a level of 10%, 5%, and 1%. Note that if the
  battery runs flat at a particularly fast pace, the level may have reduced even
  further than that before the warning is issued; also, fdpowermon will issue a
  warning immediately when power is removed from the machine and the power is
  below the first level.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To make fdpowermon always issue a warning when power is removed, set this to
  something like (100, 10, 5, 1). To make fdpowermon issue warnings at 20%, 10%,
  and 5%, set this to (20, 10, 5).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that it is not possible to change the text of the warning. If you want
  that, see the fdpowermon::theme::warning sub, and use an event.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$use_notify"><a class="selflink" href="#$use_notify">$use_notify</a></h2>
The variable $fdpowermon::theme::use_notify can be used to decide whether to use
  a libnotify message (if set to a nonzero value), or a dialog window (if set to
  a value which evaluates to zero).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default is to use libnotify if the libnotify Glib introspection data is
  installed, or a dialog box if not. Because dialog boxes can steal the focus
  and therefore wreak havoc with the user's work, using libnotify is strongly
  recommended by the author.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if you set the variable to nonzero explicitly, then the test whether
  or not the Glib introspection data is installed will be ignored. Make sure
  it's available in that case!
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="new"><a class="selflink" href="#new">new</a></h2>
Create a new fdpowermon theme. Returns a blessed reference; e.g.,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 my $theme = new fdpowermon::theme;
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;set_stepcount($count)"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;set_stepcount($count)">$theme-&gt;set_stepcount($count)</a></h2>
Set the number of steps in the theme. Note that an fdpowermon theme must have an
  equal number of steps in both the &quot;charging&quot; and the
  &quot;discharging&quot; direction.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Should be called before calling set_charging, set_discharging, or parse_step.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;set_dir($dir)"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;set_dir($dir)">$theme-&gt;set_dir($dir)</a></h2>
Set the base directory used for icon file names.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;set_charging(\@elements)"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;set_charging(\@elements)">$theme-&gt;set_charging(\@elements)</a></h2>
Set the icons that should be shown when the battery is charging. The argument
  should be created by way of the parse_step method.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;set_discharging(\@elements)"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;set_discharging(\@elements)">$theme-&gt;set_discharging(\@elements)</a></h2>
Set the icons that should be shown when the battery is discharging. The argument
  should be created by way of the parse_step method.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;parse_step($defs)"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;parse_step($defs)">$theme-&gt;parse_step($defs)</a></h2>
Parses the given string into something that can be passed on to set_charging or
  set_discharging. The definitions should be in the steps format, described
  above, without the leading &quot; charging = &quot; or &quot; discharging =
  &quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While this method returns an arrayref that can be inspected and (probably)
  modified, themes that want to be forward-compatible should treat it as an
  opaque data structure.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;set_event($step,_\&amp;callback,_'d')"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;set_event($step,_\&amp;callback,_'d')">$theme-&gt;set_event($step,
  \&amp;callback, 'd')</a></h2>
Update the theme so the sub 'callback' is executed when we're discharging and we
  reach $step for the first time. To set an event when charging instead, pass a
  'c' as the third argument.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the steps are arrays, and are therefore 0-based; the lowest-numbered
  items are the lowest-level steps.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the event triggers, the callback routine will be passed two arguments: the
  first is the current battery level (in percent); the second is a number
  denoting whether the battery is currently charging (1) or discharging (0). In
  case the parsing of the ACPI command fails, however, the second argument may
  be undef; you should prepare for this possibility. Note that fdpowermon itself
  handles that case by assuming the battery is charging; you may or may not wish
  to do the same.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="$theme-&gt;register($name)"><a class="selflink" href="#$theme-&gt;register($name)">$theme-&gt;register($name)</a></h2>
Registers a theme under a given name. If a theme already exists under that name,
  it is replaced.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="make_default($name)"><a class="selflink" href="#make_default($name)">make_default($name)</a></h2>
Makes a theme with a given name be the default theme.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="get_theme($name)"><a class="selflink" href="#get_theme($name)">get_theme($name)</a></h2>
Looks up a theme with the given name; e.g.,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 my $theme = fdpowermon::theme::get_theme(&quot;default&quot;);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="warning($message)"><a class="selflink" href="#warning($message)">warning($message)</a></h2>
Produce a warning, either using libnotify, or using a dialog box:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 fdpowermon::theme::warning($message);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the documentation on $fdpowermon::theme::use_notify above for details on
  which implementation is chosen.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
For a full .cfg theme example, look above.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To construct the same theme fully from perl, you'd do something like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 my $theme = new fdpowermon::theme;
 $theme-&gt;set_stepcount(3);
 $theme-&gt;set_dir(&quot;/home/wouter/.fdpowermon/mytheme-icons&quot;);
 $theme-&gt;set_charging($theme-&gt;parse_step(&quot;0:empty-charging.png, 10:low-charging.png, 100: full-charging.png&quot;));
 $theme-&gt;set_discharging($theme-&gt;parse_step(&quot;2:missing.png:low.png, 10:low.png, 100:full.png&quot;));
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(note, as a perl theme, this would go in theme.pl, not theme.cfg; see above for
  possible locations for perl themes)
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, unless you want to build the theme dynamically, doing it this way is
  not recommended. Instead, you would build the theme from a .cfg file, and
  possibly modify it from perl. Let's say you wish to add an event to suspend
  the system when the power gets low; in that case, you'd do something like
  this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 sub suspend {
        system(&quot;sudo pm-suspend&quot;);
 }
 my $theme = fdpowermon::theme::get_theme(&quot;mytheme&quot;);
 $theme-&gt;set_event(0, \&amp;suspend, 'd');
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This would call the 'suspend' sub when the battery is discharging and we reach
  the lowest step (in the above example, that would be when the battery reaches
  10%; you might want to do that somewhat later). This 'suspend' sub simply
  calls the &quot;pm-suspend&quot; program, with sudo, to suspend the
  system.</div>
