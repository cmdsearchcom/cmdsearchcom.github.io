<p>AMBDEC(1) General Commands Manual AMBDEC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ambdec - Ambisonic decoder for first and second order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ambdec [options] <br>
ambdec_cli config_file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the ambdec and ambdec_cli
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AmbDec is an Ambisonics decoder
for up to 36 speakers. It can be used for both horizontal
and full 3-D systems of first, second and third order. The
decoding matrices are fully <br>
user-configurable. AmbDec has some advanced features not
found on most decoders:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dual frequency band operation.
Optimal Ambisonics reproduction requires a different decoder
for low and high frequencies. This is so mainly because
human perception of sound <br>
direction uses different mechanisms at low and high
frequencies. The crossover filters used in AmbDec are
phase-aligned (the two outputs are exactly in phase at all
frequen&acirc; <br>
cies). The combined response is equivalent to a first-order
all-pass network, which is very probably inaudible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Speaker distance compensation.
If the speakers are not all at the same distance to the
center of the listening area, this must be compensated by
including the right delays and <br>
gain corrections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Near-field effect compensation.
Ambisonics works by reconstructing the spherical harmonic
components of a sound field at the center of the listening
area, using all speakers to <br>
synthesize each of them. All non-zero order components show
a near-field effect depending on the ratio
wavelength=distance, and increasing for rising order. One
example of this <br>
is the well known &rsquo;proximity effect&rsquo; of
directional microphones (&rsquo;directional&rsquo; is
equivalent to &rsquo;using non-zero order
components&rsquo;). Except in very large installations,
where the <br>
speaker distances will be large enough so the listening area
is not in the near field, this effect must be compensated
for in order to obtain a correct reconstruction of a sound
<br>
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
ambdec accepts the following command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c FILE <br>
Load configuration from FILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p PATH <br>
Load presets from PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V VOLUME <br>
Set initial volume in dB.</p>
