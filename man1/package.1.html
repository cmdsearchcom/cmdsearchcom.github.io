<p>PACKAGE(1) General Commands Manual PACKAGE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
package - register package user via mailagent</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
package address system version patchlevel [ mailpatches |
notifypatches ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This command is not intended to be run directly by a user,
but may appear in any mail whose subject is set to Command.
Such mail will be processed by the mailagent(1), which will
<br>
extract all lines beginning with @SH, which may specify this
command. The mailagent first sets environment variables that
will be used by the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package is used to notify the
author of a package about its users. It is normally
generated automatically by the MailAuthor.U unit when the
user runs Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the patchlevel specified is
not the latest for that system and version, mail is
immediately sent suggesting that they upgrade and remindng
them how to request the latest <br>
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The final parameter, if included
may be set to mailpatches to specify that the user would
like to have future patches mailed to them, or notifypatches
to specify that a mail <br>
notification of future patches should be sent, rather than
the entire patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user&rsquo;s address and
notification request are saved in the file users in the
package&rsquo;s directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package performs an approximate
address match in order to avoid duplicate entries. Whenever
this elimination occurs, a warning message is issued in the
logfile. Two addresses <br>
will be said equivalent if one of them has an added machine
name or if they are really equal. Therefore, the following
addresses are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ram@acri.fr <br>
ram@main.acri.fr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whereas the following two are
not equivalent, unfortunately:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ram@acri.acri.fr <br>
ram@main.acri.fr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user is asking to be left
alone, it is important to let him know if the request
failed, because he will be annoyed when the next set of
patches is issued and he still gets <br>
them despite his previous request. Therefore, if no
approximate match occurs, a warning message is sent back,
with a list of addresses that are close to his own e-mail
address, <br>
but not equivalent. Fortunately, the following addresses are
considered close:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ram@acri.fr <br>
ram@somewhere.com <br>
raphael@main.acri.fr <br>
manfredi@acri.acri.fr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because they either have the
same login (important when someone changes company) or share
the same domain or sub-domain part.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to edit the users file,
the edusers script should be used. For one thing, it will
let you edit the users file from whatever package you name
in the command line, but it <br>
will also properly lock the file so that the execution of
package will stall for the duration of the manual edition
(provided you have a strict locking policy defined in your
<br>
~/.mailagent configuration file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORWARDING <br>
Package supports command forwarding as described in the
mailhelp(1) page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.mailagent configuration file for mailagent. <br>
System/users list of users of that system. <br>
This file consists of single line records, one for each
registered user. Each record consists of three tab-separated
fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first field indicates the
level of updates requested by the user by a single letter as
follows: <br>
M Mail future patches directly to the user when they are
issued. <br>
N Notify the user of future patches. <br>
U The users chose to let the author know that they have
tried the program, but does not wish to know about future
updates. <br>
L The user is no longer interested in the program and wants
to be left alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second field is their last
notified patch level, or a dash (-) if it is not known.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third field is the
user&rsquo;s Email address. <br>
Log/agentlog mailagent&rsquo;s log file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Graham Stoney &lt;greyham@research.canon.oz.au&gt; <br>
Raphael Manfredi &lt;Raphael_Manfredi@pobox.com&gt; (minor
enhancements)</p>
