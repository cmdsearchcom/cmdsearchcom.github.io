<b>Star</b> is a very fast <b>tar</b>(1) like tape archiver with improved
  functionality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> archives and extracts multiple files to and from a single file
  called a <i>tarfile.</i> A <i>tarfile</i> is usually a magnetic tape, but it
  can be any file. In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to the
  files and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star's</b> actions are controlled by the mandatory command flags from the
  list below. The way <b>star</b> acts may be modified by additional options.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that unpacking tar archives may be a security risk because <b>star</b> may
  overwrite existing files. See SECURITY NOTES for more information.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FEATURES"><a class="selflink" href="#FEATURES">FEATURES</a></h1>
<b>Star</b> includes the first free implementation of <b>POSIX.1-2001</b>
  extended <b>tar</b> headers. The <b>POSIX.1-2001</b> extended <b>tar</b>
  headers define a new standard way for going beyond the limitations of the
  historic <b>tar</b> format. They allow (among others) to archive all UNIX time
  stamps in sub-second resolution, files of arbitrary size and filenames without
  length limitation using <b>UNICODE UTF-8</b> coding for best exchange
  compatibility.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> by default uses a fifo to optimize data flow from/to tape. This
  results in a normally streaming tape during the whole backup. See <b>-fifo</b>
  and <b>fs=</b> option to get information on how to find the best fifo size.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> includes a pattern matcher to control the list of files to be
  processed. This gives a convenient interface for archiving and restoring
  complex lists of files. In conjunction with the <b>-w</b> flag it is easy to
  merge a <b>tar</b> archive into an existing file tree. See also <b>-U</b>
  option. In create mode use the <b>pat=</b> option to specify either select or
  exclude patterns (depending on the <b>-V</b> flag). In extract or list mode
  all file type arguments are interpreted as select patterns while the patterns
  specified with the <b>pat=</b> option may be used as select or exclude
  patterns (depending on the <b>-V</b> flag). Have a look at the description of
  the <b>-C</b> option to learn how to fetch files from a list of directories
  (in create mode) or to distribute files to a list of directories (in extract
  mode). A substitute option allows <b>ed</b>(1) like pattern substitution in
  file names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> includes an enhanced function that is similar to the <b>find</b>(1)
  command (see <b>sfind</b>(1)). This allows to use <b>find</b> expressions,
  even in extract or list mode, directly on the content on an archive. The
  extensions to <b>find</b>(1) allow to modify the file metadata.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> includes a sophisticated diff command. Several diff options allow
  user tailorable functionality. <b>Star</b> won't show you differences you are
  not interested in. Check the <b>diffopts=</b> option for more details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> has no limitation on filename length. Pathnames and linknames up to
  <i>PATH_MAX</i> (1023&#x00A0;bytes with old OS versions and 4095&#x00A0;bytes
  with POSIX.1-2001) may be archived. Later versions may be able to deal with
  longer pathnames.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> deals with all 3 times, available for files on UNIX systems if the
  archive format is either chosen from the star specific formats or is a format
  that uses POSIX.1-2001 extended headers. This is either done in second
  resolution by using a star specific POSIX.1-1988 compatible extension or in
  sub second resolution by using POSIX.1-2001 extended headers. <b>Star</b> is
  able to store and restore all 3 times (mtime, atime and even ctime). On
  Solaris 2.x systems, <b>star</b> is able to do backups without changing any of
  the 3 the times.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If used with the <b>H=</b><i>ustar</i> option, or if called as <b>ustar</b> or
  <b>tar</b> while the <b>H=</b>headertype option is not used, <b>star</b> is
  100% POSIX compliant.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star's </b> default format (if called as <b>star</b>) is <i>xstar</i> and is
  as posix compliant as possible. Enhancements to the standard that prevent
  correct extraction of single files when using a different <b>tar</b>
  implementation that is only POSIX.1-1988 compliant may occur, but they only
  affect single files with a pathname that is longer than 100+130 chars or when
  archiving sparse files with the <b>-sparse</b> option in effect. All other
  files will extract correctly. See the description for the
  <b>H=</b><i>headertype</i> option below for more information on archive
  formats and possible archive interchange problems.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> makes it easy to repair corrupted filesystems. After a fsck -y has
  been run on the filesystem, <b>star</b> is able to restore only the missing
  files automatically. Use then <i>star -diff</i> to check for differences (see
  EXAMPLES for more information).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> automatically recognizes the type of the archive. <b>Star</b>
  therefore is able to handle features and properties of different archive types
  in their native mode, if it knows about the peculiarities of the archive type.
  See the <b>H=</b>headertype option for more details. To be able to do this,
  <b>star</b> adds hidden fingerprints to the archive header that allows to
  recognise all star specific archive formats. The GNU tar format is recognised
  by the way it deviates from the standard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> automatically recognizes and handles byte swapped archives. There is
  no option to manually control byte swapping.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> automatically recognizes and handles compressed archives inside
  plain files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> is able to archive and restore <b>Access Control Lists</b> for files
  using POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND">COMMAND</a></h1>
In native mode, <b>star</b> is compatible to the command line syntax of a
  typical POSIX command and for this reason expects <i>commands</i> and
  <i>options</i> to start with a single dash (-). In this case, commands and
  options may be specified separately, all boolean or increment type options may
  be specified either separately or combined. For compatibility with GNU
  programs, long options may alternatively start with a double dash. In
  compatibility mode to POSIX <b>tar</b>, <b>star</b> expects commands and
  options to appear as one single string that does not start with a dash. In
  POSIX tar compatibility mode, additional non POSIX options may be specified
  but must appear after the POSIX options and their args and need to start with
  a dash.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the option <b>-diff</b> has been specified in addition, <b>star</b>
      performs a one pass directory tree compare instead of copying files. The

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If the option <b>-t</b> has been specified in addition, the last file type
      argument is not a target directory and <b>star</b> is performing a one
      pass listing instead of copying files. This makes sense as the listing
      from <b>star</b> may be better readable than the output from <b>ls

      forks into two processes and data exchange is done via the shared memory
      from the FIFO. This gives the best possible performance. Without FIFO, the
      <b>-copy</b> mode will not work.

  <dd class="It-tag">The extended standard <b>tar</b> format has been introduced

      format. This is an upward/downward compatible enhancement of the
      IEEE/Posix1003/IEC-9945-1 Standard Data Interchange format. It allows
      among others very long filenames (100+130&#x00A0;chars and above) and

    The access time and creation time are stored at the end of the POSIX file

      interfere with the POSIX standard as the fields for mtime and ctime field
      are always separated from the POSIX file name prefix by a null byte. The

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The reason for using error control is to make <b>star</b> quiet about error
      conditions that are known to be irrelevant on the quality of the archive
      or restore run or to tell <b>star</b> to abort on certain error conditions
      instead of trying to continue with the archive.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A typical reason to use error control is to suppress warnings about growing
      log files while doing a backup on a live file system. Another typical
      reason to use error control is to tell <b>star</b> to abort if e.g. a file
      could not be archived instead of continuing to archive other files from a
      list.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The error control file contains a set of lines, each starting with a list of
      error conditions to be ignored followed by white space followed by a file
      name pattern (see <b>match</b>(1) or <b>patmatch</b>(3) for more
      information). The <i>error control spec</i> uses the same syntax as a
      single line from the error control file. If the file name pattern needs to
      start with white space, use a backslash to escape the start of the file
      name. It is not possible to have new line characters in the file name
      pattern. Whenever an error situation is encountered, <b>star</b> checks
      the lines in the error control file starting from the top. If the current
      error condition is listed on a line in the error control file, then
      <b>star</b> checks whether the pattern on the rest of the line matches the
      current file name. If this is the case, <b>star</b> uses the current error
      control specification to control the current error condition.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

      that if <b>star</b> is installed suid root and the first tarfile is a
      remote archive, only the connection to this archive will be created with
      root privileges. After this connection has been established as root,
      <b>star</b> switches back to the id of the caller. If any of the other

      be able to open this archive later on, unless run by root.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>Star</b> normally uses <i>stdin</i>/<i>stdout</i> for the <b>tar</b>

      <b>meta</b> file extensions of <b>star</b>. <b>Star</b> tries to force all
      tar implementations that are not standard compliant to abort. <b>Star</b>
      also tries to make all non POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar implementations
      unable to find a valid filename. However when other POSIX.1-2001 aware tar

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The problems result from the only current fallback in the POSIX standard
      that tells tar implementations to treat all unknown file types as if they
      were plain files. As <b>meta</b> files are needed for incremental backups,
      I am looking for people and companies who like to support me to be able to
      add the <b>meta</b> file concept to the POSIX.1-2005 standard.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-multivol</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Switch to multi volume mode. In multi volume mode, there
      will be no logical EOF marker written to the end of a single tape. If
      <b>-multivol</b> is used in read mode, a hard EOF on input (if not
      preceded by a logical EOF) triggers a medium change operation.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Specifying <b>-multivol</b> tells <b>star</b> to split files across volumes
      if needed. This way, a virtual archive is created that spans more than one
      medium. Multi volume mode is needed whenever it is not possible to split
      the archiving or extracting into several logically independent tasks. This
      is true for e.g. incremental dump/restore operations where inode numbers
      need to be traced for the whole task.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>tsize=</b><i>#</i> has been specified, but <b>star</b> is not in
      multi volume mode, files cannot be split across volumes.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    When <b>-multivol</b> has been specified in create mode together with
      <b>tsize=</b><i>#</i> then a media change is initiated exactly after an
      amount of <i>tsize</i> data has been written. When <b>-multivol</b> has
      been specified in create mode and <b>tsize=</b><i>#</i> has not been
      specified, then the medium change is triggered by a EOT condition from
      writing the medium. This allows to use media where the size cannot be
      known in advance (e.g. tapes with build in compression); it does not work
      if the EOT condition is not returned in sync with the related write
      operation. For this reason, it is expected that data buffering inside a
      device driver cannot be used.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Depending on the selected archive format, <b>star</b> writes a volume header
      at the beginning of a new medium. This medium header allows to verify the
      correct volume after a change during read back. It is recommended to use
      the <b>exustar</b> format for best results. In create mode,
      <b>-multivol</b> is only supported for archives types that allow to write
      reliable multi volume header information.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See <b>tsize=</b><i>#</i> option for more information.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note that <b>-multivol</b> is an interactive option that prevents

The incremental backup method used by <b>star</b> depends on comparing the time
  stamps of all files against the time of the last backup. Note that this method
  only works correctly if the level 0 backup and all higher level incrementals
  include the whole file system. As <b>star</b> archives all inode meta data,
  <b>star</b> is able to detect renamed files by comparing the <b>inode
  numbers</b> of all files while in incremental restore mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Detecting renamed files only works if <b>star</b>, while in backup mode, scans
  the whole file system tree for each full and incremental backup. This will
  work in case no files are excluded and the dump starts at the root directory
  of a file system. In case that no files are renamed from excluded parts to
  included parts, partial backups may be taken also. Partial backups only make
  sense if a complete directory sub tree is excluded (e.g. by using the
  <b>pat=</b> option) or if a partial backup starts at a sub directory that is
  not the root directory of the file system.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a level 0 dump call:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>star -c -xdev -sparse -acl -link-dirs level=0 -wtardumps \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;f=<i>archive-name</i> -C

<b>star -c -xdev -sparse -acl -link-dirs level=1 -wtardumps \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;f=<i>archive-name</i> -C
  /<i>filestem-mount-point</i> .</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Do not forget the dot at the end of the command line that specifies the
  directory to start the operation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Backups from live filesystems should be avoided. On operating systems that
  support <b>file system snapshots</b>, backups should be made from a read-only
  mount of a snapshot. Be careful that all files that have been created between
  setting up a snapshot and starting an incremental backup may be missing from
  all backups unless the <b>dumpdate=</b><i>name</i> option is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the system that is going to be backed up is not acting as a file server, it
  makes sense to shut down all services that may result in inconsistent file
  states before setting up the filesystem snapshot. After the filesystem
  snapshot has been set up, the services may be restarted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the the system that is going to be backed up is acting as a file server, it
  may be that services on remote clients cause inconsistent file states unless
  all such services that remotely access files are shut down before the snapshot
  is set up.

  snapshots</b>. The following example backs up a file system on Solaris using a
  file system snapshot:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>echo &gt; /tmp/snapstamp</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>mount -r `fssnap -F ufs -o \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;backing-store=/var/tmp/EXPORT-NFS.snap
  /export/nfs` /mnt</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>star -c -xdev -sparse -acl -link-dirs level=0 -wtardumps \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;f=<i>archive-name</i> dumpdate=/tmp/snapstamp
  \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;fs-name=/export/nfs -C /mnt .</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
First a file with a current time stamp is created, then a snapshot for
  /export/nfs is created and mounted on /mnt. The following <b>star</b> command
  then creates a level 0 backup from the file system using the time the snapshot
  was created and the original mount point of the file system for /etc/tardumps
  and the archive header.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that if the backup is done on a live file system, it may be unreliable. A
  typical problem problem in this context is caused by growing log files. As
  growing files are not a real problem with backups, the best way of dealing
  with growing files is to set up a <b>star</b> error control file (see
  <b>errctl=</b> option) and to tell <b>star</b> to ignore growing files.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BACKUP_SCHEDULES"><a class="selflink" href="#BACKUP_SCHEDULES">BACKUP
  SCHEDULES</a></h1>
Full (level 0) dumps should be made on a regular base (e.g. once a month). As a
  full dump may take a long time and takes a lot of tape, it is wise to make
  higher level incremental dumps with shorter intervals. The next table shows a
  dump level list that may be used if monthly full dumps take place:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
	 <i>Sun 	Mon	Tue	Wed	Thu	Fri</i>
<i>Week 1:</i><b>	0	10	10	10	10	5</b>
<b></b><i>Week 2:</i><b>	10	10	10	10	10	5</b>
<b></b><i>Week 3:</i><b>	10	10	10	10	10	5</b>
<b></b><i>Week 4:</i><b>	10	10	10	10	10	5</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The level 10 dumps made between Monday and Friday accumulate all changes made
  within the week. If you don't like this, use the following backup schedule:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<pre>
	 <i>Sun 	Mon	Tue	Wed	Thu	Fri</i>
<i>Week 1:</i><b>	0	20	30	40	50	5</b>
<b></b><i>Week 2:</i><b>	10	20	30	40	50	5</b>
<b></b><i>Week 3:</i><b>	10	20	30	40	50	5</b>
<b></b><i>Week 4:</i><b>	10	20	30	40	50	5</b>
<b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that in this case, 7 dumps need to be restored if the a crash happens at
  the worst case date (just before the Friday dump in week 2 or later).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INCREMENTAL_RESTORES"><a class="selflink" href="#INCREMENTAL_RESTORES">INCREMENTAL
  RESTORES</a></h1>
Incremental restores should be made to an empty file system (except for the
  <b>lost+found</b> directory). <b>Star</b> is currently unable to perform
  incremental restores to a file system that contains active mount points.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The incremental restore procedure starts with restoring the last full (level 0)
  dump. Then the latest incremental dump of each dump level (with ascending
  order of dump levels) need to be restored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Let us assume the first example from the section <b>BACKUP SCHEDULES</b> for the
  backup schedule. If a disk crash happens before the Thursday dump of week 3
  has been made, the following restore procedure needs to be applied:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>level 0</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">starting with an empty disk, the full (level 0) dump from
      week 1 is restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>level 5</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">after the level 0 restore has been finished, the level 5
      dump from Friday in week 2 is restored.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>level 10</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">after the level 5 restore has been finished, the level 10
      dump from Wednesday in week 3 is restored.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The disk now contains the same files as it did when the level 10 dump has been
  made on Wednesday of week 3.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract a level 0 dump call:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cd /<i>filestem-mount-point</i></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>star -xpU -restore f=<i>archive-name</i></b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This creates the directory <b>star-tmpdir</b> and the database
  <b>star-symtable</b> in the root directory of the new file system. Subsequent
  restores with higher level backups depend on these files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract a level 1 (or higher) dump call:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>cd /<i>filestem-mount-point</i></b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>star -xpU -restore f=<i>archive-name</i></b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the environment variable <b>STAR_DEBUG</b> exists, <b>star</b> does
  not remove files with link count 1 that have been removed between incremental
  dumps. These files are moved to the directory <b>star-tmpdir</b>. Before you
  start to extract the next incremental, you need to remove all files in
  <b>star-tmpdir</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNCHRONIZING_FILESYSTEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNCHRONIZING_FILESYSTEMS">SYNCHRONIZING
  FILESYSTEMS</a></h1>
<b>Star</b> may be used to synchronize filesystem content. To do this, an
  initial copy of the current content of the source filesystem needs to be
  performed first.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create an initial copy of a filesystem call:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>star -c -xdev -sparse -acl -link-dirs level=0 -wtardumps \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;-C /<i>filestem-mount-point</i> . | \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;star -xpU -restore -C
  /<i>extract-target-dir</i> </b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to perform subsequent synchronization of the target filesystem with the
  content of the source filesystem, a modified incremental dump/restore
  procedure may be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy incremental content of a filesystem call:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>star -c -xdev -sparse -acl -link-dirs level=1 -wtardumps \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;-cumulative -C /<i>filestem-mount-point</i> .
  | \</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;star -xpU -restore -C
  /<i>extract-target-dir</i> </b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that like with backups in general, copies from a live filesystem should be
  avoided. On operating systems that support <b>file system snapshots</b>,
  copies should be made from a read-only mount of a snapshot. Be careful that
  all files that have been created between setting up a snapshot and starting an
  incremental copy may be missing from all copies unless the
  <b>dumpdate=</b><i>name</i> option is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See section <b>INCREMENTAL BACKUPS</b> to learn how to modify the command line
  in case <b>file system snapshots</b> are used.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>

To get a listing in a way similar to ls -l one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example% star -tv f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The same command as listed above in a <b>POSIX tar</b> command line syntax
  compliant way is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example% star tvf /dev/rmt/1mbn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy the directory tree in <i>/home/someuser</i> to the directory
  <i>/home/fs</i> use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<b>example% (cd /home/someuser; star -c .) | (cd /home/fs ; star -xp)</b>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or by using the change directory option of <b>star</b>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -c -C /home/someuser . | star -xp -C /home/fs
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that both examples above are not the optimum way to copy a directory tree.
  A more efficient way to copy a directory tree is to use the <b>-copy</b>
  option.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <pre>
<b>example% star -copy -p -xdot -C /home/someuser . /home/fs</b>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To copy a file tree including the <b>Access Control List</b> entries for all
  files and to correctly copy sparse (holey) files use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -copy -p -xdot -acl -sparse -C /home/someuser . /home/fs
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To compare the content of a tape to the filesystem one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example% star -diff -v f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To compare two directory trees one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -c . | star -C todir -diff -v diffopts=!times
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
or better by using a method similar to the <b>-copy</b> method above:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -c -diff -v diffopts=!times -C fromdir . todir
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To compare all properties of two file trees, use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -c -diff -vv -dump -acl -sparse -C fromdir . todir
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract a backup of the /usr tree without all files residing below
  /usr/openwin one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example% star -xp -V pat=openwin/\*
    f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract all <i>.c</i> files to <b>src</b>, all <i>.o</i> files to <b>obj</b>
  and all other files to /tmp one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -xp -C src '*.c' -C obj '*.o' -C /tmp '*' f=/dev/rmt/1bn
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract files from a zipped <b>tar</b> archive that is located on a read only
  filesystem e.g. a CD while having the shell's working directory on the CD one
  might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example% star -zxp -C /tmp f=star-1.1.tar.gz</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to extract the files from the <b>tar</b> archive to the /tmp directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To backup a list of files generated by the <b>find</b>(1) command:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% find .  <i>find_options</i> -print | star -c list=- f=/dev/rmt/1bn
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this does not work if the file names from output of the <b>find</b>
  command include new line characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To extract a <i>tarfile</i> that contains a <i>tarfile</i> one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>
    <pre>
example% star -x -to-stdout f=/dev/rmt/1bn pat= <i>pat</i> | star -xp
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Pat,</i> in this case should match the <i>tarfile</i> in the <i>tarfile</i>
  on tape that should be extracted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To make a backup of the root filesystem to a tape drive connected to a remote
  machine, one might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# cd /</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>
    <pre>
example# star -cM fs=128m bs=63k f=tape@remotehost:/dev/rmt/1bn .
    </pre>
    </b>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You need a line in /etc/passwd like the following to enable this:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>tape:NP:60001:60001:Tape:/etc/tapehome:/opt/schily/sbin/rmt</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
And a .rhosts file in /etc/tapehome to allow remote connections from the
  appropriate hosts. Make sure that the file /etc/default/rmt exists and allows
  remote access to the requested tape drive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To use a <b>ssh(1)</b> connection for a backup to a remote tape server, one
  might use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# env RSH=/usr/bin/ssh star -cM fs=128m bs=63k
      f=tape@remotehost:/dev/rmt/1bn .</b>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To repair a corrupted filesystem for which no recent backup exists, do the
  following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# fsck -y /filesys</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>example# mount /filesys</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>example# cd /filesys</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>example# star -xpk f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>example# mt -f /dev/rmt/1bn rewind</b>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    <b>example# star -diff -v diffopts=!times f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now check the differences and decide whether to restore additional files. This
  may be done by generating a list containing the needed filenames and using the
  list= option or by using the interactive mode (see -w option).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want a list that only contains all filenames from files with differences
  you may use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# star -diff -tpath diffopts=!times
      f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are looking for files that changed the type or the access permission
  because this is a common case on still corrupted files, use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# star -diff -tpath diffopts=type,perm
      f=/dev/rmt/1bn</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you like to archive all directories only that are part of the directory tree
  under &quot;.&quot;, use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# star -c f=<i>archive-name</i> -find . -type
      d</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you like to archive all files as owner root and group root and make all files
  world readable in the archive, use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# star -c f=<i>archive-name</i> -find . -chown
      root -chgrp root -chmod o+r</b></dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you like to list all files in an archive in a way like <b>sfind</b>(1),
  instead of the way used by star, use:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><b>example# star -t f=<i>archive-name</i> -find . -ls
      -false</b>

    A correct <b>archive?=</b> line has 3..4 space separated entries. The first
      is the device entry (e.g. <i>archive0=/dev/tape</i>). The second is the
      blocking factor in 512 byte units. The third is the maximum media size in
      1024 byte units. If this entry contains a 0, then the media size is
      unlimited. The fourth entry is optional. If it contains a 'n' or a 'N',
      then the archive device is not a tape.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

The command line syntax for the tar command (as defined in SUSv2 - UNIX-98)
  deviates from the command line syntax defined for all other commands. While
  the <b>POSIX command line syntax</b> requests all options to start with a dash
  (-) and allows to either write options separately or combined (in case of
  boolean flags), the <b>tar</b> command line syntax requires all options to be
  combined into a single string that does not start with a dash. <b>Star</b> by
  default assumes a command line syntax like a typical POSIX command and
  includes a compatibility mode that allows to specify a command line syntax as
  documented for the <b>UNIX-98 tar</b> command. If you believe that you found a
  bug in the way <b>star</b> parses the command line, please first check your
  command line for correctness before you make a bug report for <b>star</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you like to write portable shell scripts that call tar, use the <b>UNIX-98
  tar</b> command line syntax (i.e. a single option string and no dash), choose
  the commands and options from the following set of characters ( <i>rxtuc
  vxfblmo</i> ) and check the shell script with both, your local tar and
  <b>star</b> for correct behavior. It you expect the script to call gnutar, do
  not include the <b>-o</b> option as gnutar implements this option in a way
  that violates UNIX-98.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> strips leading ./ sequences from pathnames. This lets <b>star</b> in
  many cases store longer pathnames than other implementations.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The POSIX.1-1988 method (ustar format) of storing files with pathnames that are
  longer than 100 chars has some limitations:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The name field (100 chars) an inserted slash (`/') and the
      prefix field (155 chars) produce the pathname of the file. When recreating
      the original filename, name and prefix are concatenated, using a slash
      character in the middle. If a pathname does not fit in the space provided
      or may not be split at a slash character so that the parts will fit into
      100 + 155 chars, the file may not be archived. Linknames longer than 100
      chars may not be archived too.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>star</i>, <i>xstar</i>, <i>xustar</i>, <i>exustar</i>, <i>pax</i>, and
  <i>gnutar</i> archive formats don't have these limitations. While gnutar uses
  a method that makes it impossible for other <b>tar</b> implementations (except
  <b>star</b>) to restore filenames that are longer than 100 chars, the
  <i>xstar</i>, <i>xustar</i>, <i>exustar</i> and <i>pax</i> archive format uses
  a method that allows an POSIX.1-1988 compliant way of storing filenames, if
  the POSIX method would allow this. When the archive format is <i>xustar</i>,
  <i>exustar</i> or <i>pax</i> very long filenames are stored using extended
  headers from the POSIX.1-2001 standard.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some buggy <b>tar</b> implementations will generate incorrect filenames during a
  restore operation if the archive contains pathnames or linknames of exactly
  100 chars length.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> adds a <i>tar</i> signature in the last four bytes of each
  <b>tar</b> header if the archive format is <i>star</i> or <i>xstar</i>. This
  is no problem with the <b>star</b> archive format as it is an extension of the
  old pre POSIX.1-1988 tar format. On the other side, the <b>xstar</b> archive
  format claims to be as POSIX.1-1988 compliant as possible. Inserting this
  <i>tar</i> signature is a minor deviation from the standard that has the last
  12 bytes of each header reserved for future use. On the other side, <b>tar</b>
  implementations such as some <b>pax</b> implementations that only compute
  checksums on the first 500 bytes of the header are violating the standard that
  requests the checksum to be computed on all 512 bytes of the tar header. All
  <b>tar</b> implementations that are 100% Posix compliant will be able to
  extract <b>xstar</b> archives as long as no new standard is defined that
  claims the last 12 bytes of the header for a different use. But then the
  <b>ustar version</b> number should be changed from `00' to `01'. Now, that the
  POSIX-2001 standard has been accepted, it is even predictable that all
  extensions to the standard <b>tar</b> format will go into the POSIX.1-2001
  extended headers which are extensible to include any feature without future
  limitation. The only known <b>tar</b> implementation that also uses the last
  12 bytes of the <b>tar</b> header is Sun's <b>tar</b> which uses these 12
  bytes for files that are split over several archives. Such archives created by
  Sun's tar are not readable by the buggy <b>pax</b> implementation too. The Sun
  extension is not incompatible to the <b>star</b> signature because Sun expects
  an octal number at the beginning of the 12 byte field which is a null
  character in the <b>star</b> case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> uses these four bytes since 1985 without problems. If you need a
  100% POSIX.1-1988 and 100% POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar archive, you may use the
  <i>xustar</i>, <i>exustar</i> or the <i>pax</i> archive format. The
  probability of falsely detecting other <b>tar</b> formats as <b>xustar</b> or
  <b>exustar</b> format however is higher.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no way to ask for the <i>n</i>-th occurrence of a file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The way EOF is handled by <b>star</b> differs, whether the fifo is in effect or
  not. If the fifo is not used, <b>star</b> stops reading the archive if it
  encounters a logical EOF record in the archive. If the fifo is used,
  <b>star</b> may read until the fifo is full or until the real EOF mark on tape
  is reached. How much data <b>star actually reads depends on the time when
  the</b> <b>star</b> foreground process sends a fifo shutdown signal to the
  background fifo read process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Gnu tar often creates <b>tar</b> archives with incorrect logical EOF marks. The
  standard requires two blocks that are completely zeroed, whereas gnutar often
  only adds one of them.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Old versions of <b>tar</b> found on SYSVr3 and earlier cannot read <b>tar</b>
  archives with a blocksize greater than 10&#x00A0;kBytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The method of storing <i>sparse</i> files currently used with the <i>star</i>
  and <i>xstar</i> format is not guaranteed to be used in later versions of
  <b>star</b>. If the author decides to change this method, later versions of
  <b>star</b> may not be able to restore sparse files from <b>tar</b> archives
  made by the current version of <b>star</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Some <b>tar</b> implementations violate the standard in using only the first 500
  Bytes of the header for checksum computation. These <b>tar</b> implementations
  will not accept <i>star</i> and <i>xstar</i> type <b>tar</b> archives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sun's Solaris 2.x <b>tar</b> implementation violates the Posix standard. Tar
  archives generated by <b>star</b> cause Sun's <b>tar</b> to print tar:
  impossible file type messages. You may ignore these messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Gnutar's dumpdirs are non standard and are currently not implemented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If gnutar archives sparse files with more than four holes, it produces archives
  that violate the standard in a way that prevents other <b>tar</b>
  implementations to read these archives. <b>Star</b> knows about that and is
  able to handle these gnutar archives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The filetype <i>N</i> (LF_NAMES) from gnutar (an obsolete method of storing long
  names) will never be implemented.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that on operating systems (like DOS) that do not implement real pipes,
  <b>star</b> implements compression via a temporary file. Using compression
  thus is limited by the maximum file size and the available disk space.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The extended file flags implementation (see <b>-xfflags</b> option) on Linux is
  buggy by design. In order to retrieve the needed information, every file needs
  to be opened. If the /dev directory is included in create mode, every possible
  driver will be loaded which may hang the system for a long time. In the worst
  case, unwanted side effects from opening devices (such as causing tape drives
  to rewind the media) may be caused.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_NOTES">SECURITY
  NOTES</a></h1>
If you unpack a tar archive in a non empty directory, any file in that directory
  may be overwritten unless you specify the <b>-k</b> option. If the archive
  contains symbolic links or hard links, <b>star</b> may even overwrite files
  outside the current directory. If the directory where the archive is been
  unpacked is not empty and contains contains symbolic links or hard links to
  directories outside that directory, <b>star</b> may also overwrite files
  outside the current directory. As many other commands, <b>star</b> usually has
  all possible permissions when run as root. Unpacking archives as root thus may
  have fatal results to any file on your system. Be very careful when you try to
  extract an archive that has not been created by you. It is possible to create
  hand crafted tar archives that may overwrite critical files (like /etc/passwd)
  on your system. In addition all tar archives that have been created with the
  <b>list=</b> option and tar archives where the <b>C=</b> option was not
  specified before all file type arguments may be critical.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A good advise is to extract all doubtful archives as non root in an empty
  directory and to specify the <b>-secure-links</b> option. If you get a
  warning, you should unpack the archive a second time and specify the options
  <b>-k</b>, <b>-w</b> and <b>-nowarn</b> in addition to the options used for
  the first run.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUID_NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#SUID_NOTES">SUID
  NOTES</a></h1>
If <b>star</b> is installed suid root, <b>star</b> is able to make connections
  to remote archives for non root users. This is done by using the rcmd(3)
  interface to get a connection to a rmt(8) server.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> resets its effective uid back to the real user id immediately after
  setting up the remote connection to the rmt server and before opening any
  other file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>star</b> has not been installed suid root and not called by root, it will
  try to create the remote connection via <b>rsh(1)</b> or <b>ssh(1)</b> (in
  case the environment <b>RSH</b> has been set to <b>ssh</b>). Note that in this
  case, the throughput to the remote tape server will be much lower than with a
  connection that has been initiated via <b>rcmd(3)</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
If <b>star</b> is running on a large file aware platform, <b>star</b> is able to
  handle files up to 8 GB in a mode that is compliant to the POSIX.1-1988
  <b>ustar</b> format. With a nonstandard <b>star</b> specific extension, up to
  95 bits may be used to code the filesize. This will handle files up to
  200,000,000 TB. With the new POSIX.1-2001 extended headers used by the
  <i>xustar</i>, <i>exustar</i> and <i>pax</i> format, any filesize may be
  archived.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The fact that the <b>-f</b> option has to be implemented in a way that is
  compatible with old tar implementations gives several problems. The options
  <b>-fifostats</b>, <b>-force-hole</b>, <b>-force-remove</b> and <b>-fifo</b>
  interfere with the <b>-f</b> option and the fact that they exist prevents
  users from using filenames like e.g. <b>ifo</b> using the traditional way
  where the filename directly follows the string <b>-f</b> without any space
  between the option name and the file name. However, there is no problem to use
  a file named <b>ifo</b> by by calling <b>-f ifo</b>, <b>f=ifo</b>,
  <b>-f=ifo</b> or <b>-f= ifo</b>. Be careful not to make typos with the above
  options. The result could be that a file is created as a result of the
  mistyped option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is currently no way to set the fifo lowwater and highwater marks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is currently no way to automatically delete files in the target file tree
  if they are obsolete. <b>Star</b> should implement something similar to
  gnutar's dumpdirs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If not invoked by the super user <b>star</b> may not be able to extract files if
  they reside in read only directories.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Star</b> is not able to make a complete backup of a filesystem if files are
  hidden by a mount that is in effect on a directory of this filesystem. This
  may be avoided in case of the ufs filesystem if the backup is made off a ufs
  snapshot (see the man page for <b>fssnap</b>(1m) It could be avoided for any
  filesystem if the loopback filesystem had an option that tells <i>lofs</i> not
  to traverse mountpoints.
<div class="Pp"></div>

Sun already did accept a bug report for <b>rsh</b>(1)<b>/</b>ssh(1)<b>.</b>
  Openssh.org accepted and fixed a bug for their implementation of
  <b>ssh</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you use <b>star</b> to create a remote connection via an unfixed

<b>Star</b> was first created in 1982 to extract tapes on a UNIX clone that had
  no <b>tar</b> command. In 1985 the first fully functional version has been
  released as <b>mtar.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the old <b>star</b> format extensions have been introduced in 1985, it was
  renamed to <b>star</b> (Schily tar). In 1994, Posix 1003.1-1988 extensions
  were added and <b>star</b> was renamed to <b>star</b> (Standard tar).
