<p>FAKEROOT-NG(1) Fakeroot Next Gen User Manual
FAKEROOT-NG(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fakeroot-ng - run a command while making it believe it is
running as root</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fakeroot-ng [ -llogfile [-f] ] [ -ppersist_file ] [-d]
command line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents the fakeroot-ng command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fakeroot-ng allows running a
process without any change to the permissions, but fooling
the process into thinking that it is running with root
permissions. This typically <br>
involves intercepting certain system calls the process
performs and manipulating their results. In order for the
effect to be complete enough, previous manipulations have to
be <br>
remembered, and consistent results returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea behind fakroot-ng was
first implemented by a tool called fakeroot(1). This tool
used LD_PRELOAD of the dynamic linking to glibc in order to
intercept the system calls. <br>
While this approach is very rebust and very platform
independent, it does suffer in scope. In particular, certain
operations (mostly the open(2) system call) could not be
inter&acirc; <br>
cepted, which caused emulating other operations (mainly the
chroot(2) system call) to not be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fakeroot-ng strives to fill
those gaps by using a totally different technology for
system call interception. Instead of using LD_PRELOAD,
ptrace(2) is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PARAMETERS <br>
-pstate_file <br>
Before the first process is being run, loads from state_file
the information needed in order to maintain a consistent
view of file permissions and owners across fake&acirc; <br>
root-ng runs. This image is also automatically saved when
the last process exists. If more then one instance of
fakeroot-ng is loaded simultaneously, both with the same
<br>
state_file, then the two instances will share state and
their processes will see the same picture at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-llog_file <br>
Causes fakeroot-ng to dump to log_file internal state and
processing information. This is mostly useful for cases
where fakeroot-ng fails to act as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Causes the log file to be
flushed after every print. Guarantees that the important
hint as to why the crash happened will be in the actual
file, but has non-negligent per&acirc; <br>
formance effect. Only has effect if -l is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Tells fakeroot-ng not to
completely daemonize itself. This is mostly useful in case
of crashes that cause a core dump, as the debugger would
normally change directory to <br>
root, which would prevent a core file from being
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print out the version number
and copyright info and exit without doing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print out a short help screen
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
Sending the ALRM signal to the fakeroot-ng master process
makes it dump to the log a complete list of all tracked
processes, along with their parent and current state. This
is, <br>
mostly, a debugging feature. The signal does nothing if -l
is not active. Please note that no process executes any
system calls while this takes place, so this feature
essen&acirc; <br>
tially freezes all of the debugged processes for a few
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND SHARED
MEMORY <br>
Some of the communication between fakeroot-ng and the
program being fooled is done through a shared memory
mechanism. In order to create it, fakeroot-ng creates a
temporary file <br>
and maps it into memory as executable segment. Some systems
have their /tmp folder mounted with the noexec flag. On
those system, the mmap will fail and fakeroot-ng will not
run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two environment
variables that allow fakeroot-ng to find a folder in which
the shared memory files can be created. The first is TMPDIR.
If it exists, fakeroot-ng will <br>
use it to create the temporary files, rather than /tmp. The
problem with using TMPDIR for creating temporary files is
that fakeroot-ng is not the only one to use it. For that
<br>
reason, if the environment has a variable called
FAEKROOT_TMPDIR, its value will override that of either
TMPDIR or the default /tmp directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Linux, it is usually entirely
safe to point FAKEROOT_TMPDIR to /dev/shm, which usually
lives up to expectations regarding mount mode and
writability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Fakeroot-ng is a non-SUID executable, and does not modify
any sensitive data. It, therefor, does not affect the
overall security of the system. One may be tempted, however,
to <br>
use fakeroot-ng as a security tool, for running processes
with reduced privileges or inside a chroot jail. In addition
to all the warnings that usually apply to using chroot <br>
jails as a security tool (in a nutshell - don&rsquo;t), the
following should be understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike previous implementations,
fakeroot-ng uses a technology that leaves the traced process
no choice regarding whether it will use fakeroot-ng&rsquo;s
&quot;services&quot; or not. Compiling a <br>
program statically, directly calling the kernel and
manipulating ones own address space are all techniques that
can be trivially used to bypass LD_PRELOAD based control
over a <br>
process, and do not apply to fakeroot-ng. It is,
theoretically, possible to mold fakeroot-ng in such a way as
to have total control over the traced process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While it is theoretically
possible, it has not been done. Fakeroot-ng does assume
certain &quot;nicely behaved&quot; assumptions about the
process being traced, and a process that break <br>
those assumptions may be able to, if not totally escape then
at least circumvent some of the &quot;fake&quot; environment
imposed on it by fakeroot-ng. As such, you are strongly
warned <br>
against using fakeroot-ng as a security tool. Bug reports
that claim that a process can deliberatly (as opposed to
inadvertly) escape fakeroot-ng&rsquo;s control will either
be closed <br>
as &quot;not a bug&quot; or marked as low priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible that this policy
be rethought in the future. For the time being, however, you
have been warned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Plenty of those. See the &quot;README&quot; file for a list
of known ones.</p>
