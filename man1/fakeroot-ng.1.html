This manual page documents the <b>fakeroot-ng</b> command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fakeroot-ng allows running a process without any change to the permissions, but
  fooling the process into thinking that it is running with root permissions.
  This typically involves intercepting certain system calls the process performs
  and manipulating their results. In order for the effect to be complete enough,
  previous manipulations have to be remembered, and consistent results returned.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The idea behind fakroot-ng was first implemented by a tool called fakeroot(1).
  This tool used LD_PRELOAD of the dynamic linking to glibc in order to
  intercept the system calls. While this approach is very rebust and very
  platform independent, it does suffer in scope. In particular, certain
  operations (mostly the open(2) system call) could not be intercepted, which
  caused emulating other operations (mainly the chroot(2) system call) to not be
  supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Fakeroot-ng strives to fill those gaps by using a totally different technology
  for system call interception. Instead of using LD_PRELOAD, ptrace(2) is being
  used.

      also automatically saved when the last process exists. If more then one
      instance of fakeroot-ng is loaded simultaneously, both with the same
      <i>state_file</i>, then the two instances will share state and their

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SIGNALS"><a class="selflink" href="#SIGNALS">SIGNALS</a></h1>
Sending the ALRM signal to the fakeroot-ng master process makes it dump to the
  log a complete list of all tracked processes, along with their parent and
  current state. This is, mostly, a debugging feature. The signal does nothing
  if <b>-l</b> is not active. Please note that no process executes any system
  calls while this takes place, so this feature essentially freezes all of the
  debugged processes for a few seconds.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_AND_SHARED_MEMORY"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_AND_SHARED_MEMORY">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES AND SHARED MEMORY</a></h1>
Some of the communication between fakeroot-ng and the program being fooled is
  done through a shared memory mechanism. In order to create it, fakeroot-ng
  creates a temporary file and maps it into memory as executable segment. Some
  systems have their /tmp folder mounted with the <b>noexec</b> flag. On those
  system, the mmap will fail and fakeroot-ng will not run.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are two environment variables that allow fakeroot-ng to find a folder in
  which the shared memory files can be created. The first is <b>TMPDIR</b>. If
  it exists, fakeroot-ng will use it to create the temporary files, rather than
  /tmp. The problem with using <b>TMPDIR</b> for creating temporary files is
  that fakeroot-ng is not the only one to use it. For that reason, if the
  environment has a variable called <b>FAEKROOT_TMPDIR</b>, its value will
  override that of either <b>TMPDIR</b> or the default /tmp directory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
On Linux, it is usually entirely safe to point <b>FAKEROOT_TMPDIR</b> to
  <b>/dev/shm</b>, which usually lives up to expectations regarding mount mode
  and writability.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#SECURITY_CONSIDERATIONS">SECURITY
  CONSIDERATIONS</a></h1>
Fakeroot-ng is a non-SUID executable, and does not modify any sensitive data.
  It, therefor, does not affect the overall security of the system. One may be
  tempted, however, to use fakeroot-ng as a security tool, for running processes
  with reduced privileges or inside a chroot jail. In addition to all the
  warnings that usually apply to using chroot jails as a security tool (in a
  nutshell - don't), the following should be understood.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unlike previous implementations, fakeroot-ng uses a technology that leaves the
  traced process no choice regarding whether it will use fakeroot-ng's
  &quot;services&quot; or not. Compiling a program statically, directly calling
  the kernel and manipulating ones own address space are all techniques that can
  be trivially used to bypass LD_PRELOAD based control over a process, and do
  not apply to fakeroot-ng. It is, theoretically, possible to mold fakeroot-ng
  in such a way as to have total control over the traced process.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While it is theoretically possible, it has not been done. Fakeroot-ng does
  assume certain &quot;nicely behaved&quot; assumptions about the process being
  traced, and a process that break those assumptions may be able to, if not
  totally escape then at least circumvent some of the &quot;fake&quot;
  environment imposed on it by fakeroot-ng. As such, you are strongly warned
  against using fakeroot-ng as a security tool. Bug reports that claim that a
  process can deliberatly (as opposed to inadvertly) escape fakeroot-ng's
  control will either be closed as &quot;not a bug&quot; or marked as low
  priority.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible that this policy be rethought in the future. For the time being,
  however, you have been warned.
