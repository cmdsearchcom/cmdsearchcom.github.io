Unsf is a tool to convert SoundFont files into GUS patches. Some reasons you
  might want to do such a thing are: (1) Your midi player can use GUS patches
  but doesn't know how to read soundfonts, (2) You want a convenient way of
  substituting patches or reassigning banks of instruments by editing GUS config
  files, or (3) You need to modify patches by changing amplitude, stripping
  envelopes, or make other changes that can easily be done by attaching options
  in config files. Or (4), my own reason, you might need to use a version of
  timidity covered under the Lessor GNU Public License and find that the
  versions of timidity that can read soundfonts are protected by the more
  restrictive GNU Public License (e.g., Timidity++ or kmidi, or the Alsaplayer
  midi plugin).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Instrument samples embedded in soundfonts have a more complicated structure, and
  have more features, than GUS patches. So breaking a soundfont up into GUS
  patches loses information and quality, unless the GUS patch format is
  extended. The patch files produced by unsf do contain most of the information
  and structure they had as part of the original soundfont, but the extensions
  to GUS format are tucked away in hidden places, as they must be, to be
  compatible with programs expecting to see ordinary GUS patches. I'll describe
  the extensions below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unsf is easy to use. If you're using a version of timidity, just put a soundfont
  into the directory where you keep patches -- perhaps /usr/local/lib/timidity
  -- then cd to that directory and say &quot;unsf filename.sf2&quot;. Unsf will
  create directories for each bank of instruments in the soundfont and put the
  patch files for all the instruments into the appropriate bank directories. The
  names of the directories and patch files are derived from the names they were
  given inside the soundfont. Unsf also creates a GUS type configuration file,
  which will be called &quot;&lt;filename&gt;.cfg&quot;, the &lt;filename&gt;
  part coming from the name of the original soundfont. Edit timidity.cfg by
  adding the line &quot;source &lt;filename&gt;.cfg&quot; and you're ready to
  use the new patches.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
However, you won't hear any of the enhancements of sf2 instruments, unless you
  use my reference version of timidity, because no other midi players as yet
  know how to find the special information in the extended GUS patch files. How
  could there be any? I just made up this extension to GUS patch structure. What
  you will hear is only the keyrange set of samples for the left channel of the
  first velocity layer. Sf2 instruments can have several velocity layers,
  meaning sets of samples tuned for the different timbres produced by different
  note loudness, and they can also be in stereo, with different sets of samples
  for the left and right channels.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This diagram describes the overall structure of sf2 instruments and extended GUS
  patches:

             velocity range 1                   ...                  |part

<div class="Pp"></div>
                                left channel    ...

                                right channel   ...

             velocity range 3   ...
<div class="Pp"></div>
             ...
<div class="Pp"></div>
             velocity range 19  ...
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In addition to the extra sets of samples for various velocity (loudness) ranges
  and for left and right channels, sf2 instruments have parameters for
  controlling an extra low frequency modulator and a bandpass filter. These
  parameters are also carried over into the extended GUS patches produced by
  unsf. My reference version of timidity does not interpret and use all this
  extra information, by any means, but it does understand velocity ranges,
  stereo instruments, and a couple of the extra sf2 parameters:
  volume-envelope-delay and exclusive-class. The first delays the beginning of
  note volume envelopes by a variable amount, and the second causes notes of
  certain instruments to be terminated when a new note of that instrument or an
  instrument in the same class is begun.

My reference version of timidity is the one contained the the SDL_mixer library
  of the gaming program library SDL (Simple Direct Layer),
  http://www.libsdl.org. As of now (Sept 2004) only the CVS version of SDL_mixer
  has my version of timidity. My patches for the latest released version are in
  the archive:

I have also made a free standing demo version of timidity, which is in:
