<p>UNSF(1) General Commands Manual UNSF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
unsf - break up SoundFont .sf2 files into GUS-type
instrument patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
unsf [-v|-s|-m|-d|-n|-V] [-M
&lt;bank&gt;:&lt;instrument&gt;=&lt;layer&gt;] [-D
&lt;bank&gt;:&lt;instrument&gt;=&lt;layer&gt;]
soundfont-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Unsf is a tool to convert SoundFont files into GUS patches.
Some reasons you might want to do such a thing are: (1) Your
midi player can use GUS patches but doesn&rsquo;t know how
to <br>
read soundfonts, (2) You want a convenient way of
substituting patches or reassigning banks of instruments by
editing GUS config files, or (3) You need to modify patches
by <br>
changing amplitude, stripping envelopes, or make other
changes that can easily be done by attaching options in
config files. Or (4), my own reason, you might need to use a
ver&acirc; <br>
sion of timidity covered under the Lessor GNU Public License
and find that the versions of timidity that can read
soundfonts are protected by the more restrictive GNU Public
<br>
License (e.g., Timidity++ or kmidi, or the Alsaplayer midi
plugin).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instrument samples embedded in
soundfonts have a more complicated structure, and have more
features, than GUS patches. So breaking a soundfont up into
GUS patches loses informa&acirc; <br>
tion and quality, unless the GUS patch format is extended.
The patch files produced by unsf do contain most of the
information and structure they had as part of the original
<br>
soundfont, but the extensions to GUS format are tucked away
in hidden places, as they must be, to be compatible with
programs expecting to see ordinary GUS patches. I&rsquo;ll
<br>
describe the extensions below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsf is easy to use. If
you&rsquo;re using a version of timidity, just put a
soundfont into the directory where you keep patches --
perhaps /usr/local/lib/timidity -- then cd to that <br>
directory and say &quot;unsf filename.sf2&quot;. Unsf will
create directories for each bank of instruments in the
soundfont and put the patch files for all the instruments
into the appro&acirc; <br>
priate bank directories. The names of the directories and
patch files are derived from the names they were given
inside the soundfont. Unsf also creates a GUS type
configura&acirc; <br>
tion file, which will be called
&quot;&lt;filename&gt;.cfg&quot;, the &lt;filename&gt; part
coming from the name of the original soundfont. Edit
timidity.cfg by adding the line &quot;source &lt;file&acirc;
<br>
name&gt;.cfg&quot; and you&rsquo;re ready to use the new
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you won&rsquo;t hear
any of the enhancements of sf2 instruments, unless you use
my reference version of timidity, because no other midi
players as yet know how to find the <br>
special information in the extended GUS patch files. How
could there be any? I just made up this extension to GUS
patch structure. What you will hear is only the keyrange set
<br>
of samples for the left channel of the first velocity layer.
Sf2 instruments can have several velocity layers, meaning
sets of samples tuned for the different timbres produced
<br>
by different note loudness, and they can also be in stereo,
with different sets of samples for the left and right
channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This diagram describes the
overall structure of sf2 instruments and extended GUS
patches:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">key range 1 sample |GUS <br>
left channel key range 2 sample |compatible <br>
velocity range 1 ... |part <br>
key range 1 sample <br>
right channel key range 2 sample <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">left channel ... <br>
Instrument velocity range 2 <br>
right channel ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">velocity range 3 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">velocity range 19 ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the extra sets of
samples for various velocity (loudness) ranges and for left
and right channels, sf2 instruments have parameters for
controlling an extra low fre&acirc; <br>
quency modulator and a bandpass filter. These parameters are
also carried over into the extended GUS patches produced by
unsf. My reference version of timidity does not inter&acirc;
<br>
pret and use all this extra information, by any means, but
it does understand velocity ranges, stereo instruments, and
a couple of the extra sf2 parameters: volume-envelope-delay
<br>
and exclusive-class. The first delays the beginning of note
volume envelopes by a variable amount, and the second causes
notes of certain instruments to be terminated when a new
<br>
note of that instrument or an instrument in the same class
is begun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">My reference version of timidity
is the one contained the the SDL_mixer library of the gaming
program library SDL (Simple Direct Layer),
http://www.libsdl.org. As of now (Sept <br>
2004) only the CVS version of SDL_mixer has my version of
timidity. My patches for the latest released version are in
the archive: <br>
ftp://ling.lll.hawaii.edu/pub/greg/Surround-SDL.tgz <br>
I have also made a free standing demo version of timidity,
which is in: <br>
ftp://ling.lll.hawaii.edu/pub/greg/gt-0.3.tar.gz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-s Small. Extract only a single velocity layer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Mono. Extract only the left
channel of stereo patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Drum. Assume the sf2 file is
a drum kit, even though it is not marked as such in the
soundfont, so that individual notes are broken out into
separate drum patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n No write. Don&rsquo;t write
out patches or directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Do not normalize sample
volumes (it&rsquo;s time-consuming).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Adjust sustain by guessing
which looping patches should be continued until note is
released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M
&lt;bank&gt;:&lt;instrument&gt;=&lt;layer&gt; <br>
Make the given velocity layer the default for
bank:instrument, this affects programs which do not know
howto handle the extended GUS patch format, as they will
always play <br>
the default layer, and this determines which layer gets
written when using -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D
&lt;bank&gt;:&lt;instrument&gt;=&lt;layer&gt; <br>
Same as -M but then for drum banks.</p>
