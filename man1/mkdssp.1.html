<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mkdssp - Calculate secondary structure for proteins in a PDB
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mkdssp [OPTION] pdbfile [dsspfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mkdssp program was originally designed by Wolfgang
Kabsch and Chris Sander to standardize secondary structure
assignment. DSSP is a database of secondary structure
assign&acirc; <br>
ments (and much more) for all protein entries in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) and mkdssp is the application that
calculates the DSSP entries from PDB entries. Please note
that <br>
mkdssp does not predict secondary structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
If you invoke mkdssp with only one parameter, it will be
interpreted as the PDB file to process and output will be
sent to stdout. If a second parameter is specified this is
<br>
interpreted as the name of the DSSP file to create. Both the
input and the output file names may have either .gz or .bz2
as extension resulting in the proper compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --input filename <br>
The file name of a PDB formatted file containing the protein
structure data. This file may be a file compressed by gzip
or bzip2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --output filename <br>
The file name of a DSSP file to create. If the filename ends
in .gz or .bz2 a compressed file is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Write out diagnositic information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print the help message and exit. The directory containing
the parser scripts for mrs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THEORY <br>
The DSSP program works by calculating the most likely
secondary structure assignment given the 3D structure of a
protein. It does this by reading the position of the atoms
in a <br>
protein (the ATOM records in a PDB file) followed by
calculation of the H-bond energy between all atoms. The best
two H-bonds for each atom are then used to determine the
most <br>
likely class of secondary structure for each residue in the
protein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means you do need to have a
full and valid 3D structure for a protein to be able to
calculate the secondary structure. There&rsquo;s no magic in
DSSP, so e.g. it cannot guess the <br>
secondary structure for a mutated protein for which you
don&rsquo;t have the 3D structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DSSP FILE FORMAT <br>
The header part of each DSSP file is self explaining, it
contains some of the information copied over from the PDB
file and there are some statistics gathered while
calculating <br>
the secondary structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second half of the file
contains the calculated secondary structure information per
residue. What follows is a brief explanation for each
column.</p>

<br>
# The residue number as counted by mkdssp <br>
RESIDUE The residue number as specified by the PDB file
followed by a chain identifier. <br>
AA The one letter code for the amino acid. If this letter is
lower case this means this is a <br>
cysteine that form a sulfur bridge with the other amino acid
in this column with the same <br>
lower case letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRUCTURE This is a complex
column containing multiple sub columns. The first column
contains a let&acirc; <br>
ter indicating the secondary structure assigned to this
residue. Valid values are: <br>
Code Description <br>
H Alpha Helix <br>
B Beta Bridge <br>
E Strand <br>
G Helix-3 <br>
I Helix-5 <br>
T Turn <br>
S Bend <br>
What follows are three column indicating for each of the
three helix types (3, 4 and 5) <br>
whether this residue is a candidate in forming this helix. A
&gt; character indicates it starts <br>
a helix, a number indicates it is inside such a helix and a
&lt; character means it ends the <br>
helix. <br>
The next column contains a S character if this residue is a
possible bend. <br>
Then there&rsquo;s a column indicating the chirality and
this can either be positive or negative <br>
(i.e. the alpha torsion is either positive or negative).
<br>
The last two columns contain beta bridge labels. Lower case
here means parallel bridge and <br>
thus upper case means anti parallel. <br>
BP1 and BP2 The first and second bridge pair candidate, this
is followed by a letter indicating the <br>
sheet. <br>
ACC The accessibility of this residue, this is the surface
area expressed in square &Atilde;ngstrom <br>
that can be accessed by a water molecule. <br>
N-H--&gt;O..O--&gt;H-N Four columns, they give for each
residue the H-bond energy with another residue where the
<br>
current residue is either acceptor or donor. Each column
contains two numbers, the first is <br>
an offset from the current residue to the partner residue in
this H-bond (in DSSP number&acirc; <br>
ing), the second number is the calculated energy for this
H-bond. <br>
TCO The cosine of the angle between C=O of the current
residue and C=O of previous residue. For <br>
alpha-helices, TCO is near +1, for beta-sheets TCO is near
-1. Not used for structure defi&acirc; <br>
nition. <br>
Kappa The virtual bond angle (bend angle) defined by the
three C-alpha atoms of the residues cur&acirc; <br>
rent - 2, current and current + 2. Used to define bend
(structure code &rsquo;S&rsquo;). <br>
PHI and PSI IUPAC peptide backbone torsion angles. <br>
X-CA, Y-CA and Z-CA The C-alpha coordinates</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The original DSSP application was written by Wolfgang Kabsch
and Chris Sander in Pascal. This version is a complete
rewrite in C++ based on the original source code. A few bugs
<br>
have been fixed since and the algorithms have been tweaked
here and there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
The code desperately needs an update. The first thing that
needs implementing is the improved recognition of
pi-helices. A second improvement would be to use angle
dependent <br>
H-bond energy calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you find any, please let me know.</p>
