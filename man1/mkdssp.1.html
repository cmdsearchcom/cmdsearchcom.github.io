mkdssp - Calculate secondary structure for proteins in a PDB file
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>mkdssp</b> [OPTION] pdbfile [dsspfile]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>mkdssp</i> program was originally designed by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris
  Sander to standardize secondary structure assignment. DSSP is a database of
  secondary structure assignments (and much more) for all protein entries in the
  Protein Data Bank (PDB) and <i>mkdssp</i> is the application that calculates
  the DSSP entries from PDB entries. Please note that <i>mkdssp</i> <b>does not
  predict</b> secondary structure.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
If you invoke <i>mkdssp</i> with only one parameter, it will be interpreted as
  the PDB file to process and output will be sent to stdout. If a second
  parameter is specified this is interpreted as the name of the DSSP file to
  create. Both the input and the output file names may have either .gz or .bz2
  as extension resulting in the proper compression.

The DSSP program works by calculating the most likely secondary structure
  assignment given the 3D structure of a protein. It does this by reading the
  position of the atoms in a protein (the ATOM records in a PDB file) followed
  by calculation of the H-bond energy between all atoms. The best two H-bonds
  for each atom are then used to determine the most likely class of secondary
  structure for each residue in the protein.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This means you do need to have a full and valid 3D structure for a protein to be
  able to calculate the secondary structure. There's no magic in DSSP, so e.g.
  it cannot guess the secondary structure for a mutated protein for which you
  don't have the 3D structure.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DSSP_FILE_FORMAT"><a class="selflink" href="#DSSP_FILE_FORMAT">DSSP
  FILE FORMAT</a></h1>
The header part of each DSSP file is self explaining, it contains some of the
  information copied over from the PDB file and there are some statistics
  gathered while calculating the secondary structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second half of the file contains the calculated secondary structure
  information per residue. What follows is a brief explanation for each column.

The original DSSP application was written by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris Sander in
  Pascal. This version is a complete rewrite in C++ based on the original source
  code. A few bugs have been fixed since and the algorithms have been tweaked
  here and there.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TODO"><a class="selflink" href="#TODO">TODO</a></h1>
The code desperately needs an update. The first thing that needs implementing is
  the improved recognition of pi-helices. A second improvement would be to use
  angle dependent H-bond energy calculation.
