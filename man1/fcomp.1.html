<p>fcomp(1) General Commands Manual fcomp(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fcomp - file compare</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fcomp [ option... ] filename1 filename2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcomp -Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fcomp -VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The fcomp program is used to compare text files, similar to
the diff(1) program. Its advantage is that it always
produces minimal differences, and so will never
mis&acirc;sync when <br>
comparing files. Its disadvantage is that it runs slower due
to the extra work required to produce optimal differences.
However, for files differing by less than a few thousand
<br>
lines, its performance is adequate. The algorithms used by
this utility are also used by the fhist(1) program in order
to produce the edit history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compare file old to file new,
the command: <br>
fcomp old new <br>
would be used. This gives the differences involved in
converting from file old to file new. This is analogous to
the use of the cp(1) command. Either the old or new file may
<br>
be a directory, in which case the comparison is done to the
file in the directory with the same name as the other file.
An error is given if old and new are both directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-BINary This option may be used
to compare binary files on a byte&acirc;for&acirc;byte
basis. (Each byte is treated as a &acirc;line&acirc; by the
algorithm.) Byte values are displayed in hexadecimal, <br>
as are the addresses. Note: this is different behaviour to
the fhist(1) option of the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_BINary <br>
This option may be used to avoid comparing binary files. A
warnign will be prointed on the standard error, but the
program will report success without printing andy <br>
other output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Blank <br>
Ignore blank lines in the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Context number <br>
This specifies the number of lines of &quot;context&quot;
which is displayed. This shows the specified number of lines
before and after the actual lines being changed. This is
<br>
useful to locate and identify the line which is actually
being changed, when there are many identical copies of the
line in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Edit <br>
Output an edit script which is machine readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Failures number <br>
This stops the comparison if the number of changes exceeds
the specified number. Each change is a delete or insert of a
single line. This is useful when you are not <br>
interested in the results when the files are totally
different. Another use is a quick check to see if two files
are identical, by using a value of zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Give some help on how to use the fcomp program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Join number <br>
This merges together lines which have changed, if they are
separated by up to the specified number of unchanged lines.
This makes a change look bigger, but reduces the <br>
&quot;choppiness&quot; of the output by showing fewer
regions being changed. This is particularly effective to
suppress worthless matchings of single blank lines or
comment begin&acirc; <br>
ning and ending lines. A useful value for this option is 3
or so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Matching <br>
Output matching lines, rather then changed lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Number <br>
This outputs the line numbers at the left edge of the
output. This isn&rsquo;t normally needed, since the line
numbers are displayed in the comment line preceding the
lines <br>
being displayed. Not outputting the line numbers prevents
the terminal from needlessly scrolling for long lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Output filename <br>
Send the output to this file, rather than the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Quiet <br>
Output only a quick summary of changes needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Spaces <br>
This option ignores differences in the number of spaces in
the two lines. That is, two or more adjacent spaces are
handled as a single space. Spaces at the beginning or <br>
end of a line are totally ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Upcase <br>
Uppercase lines before comparing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-VERSion <br>
Show what version of fcomp is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-What <br>
This outputs all of both files together, showing what
happened to each line of the first file in order to change
to the line in the second file. This output is in <br>
&quot;change bar&quot; format, where inserted lines begin
with |+, deleted lines begin with |&acirc;, and unchanged
lines begin with spaces. The presence of the vertical bar
makes it <br>
easy to search for the changed lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options may be abbreviated;
the abbreviation is documented as the upper case letters,
all lower case letters and underscores (_) are optional. You
must use consecutive <br>
sequences of optional letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All options are case
insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case
or a combination of both, case is not important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example: the arguments
&quot;-help, &quot;-HELP&quot; and &quot;-h&quot; are all
interpreted to mean the -Help option. The argument
&quot;-hlp&quot; will not be understood, because consecutive
optional char&acirc; <br>
acters were not supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and other command line
arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GNU long option names are
understood. Since all option names for fcomp are long, this
means ignoring the extra leading &rsquo;-&rsquo;. The
&quot;-option=value&quot; convention is also under&acirc;
<br>
stood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE NAME EXPANSION <br>
As a convenience, if a pathname begins with a period and a
environment variable exists with that name, then the value
of the environment variable will be used as the actual
path&acirc; <br>
name. For example, if a environment variable of .FOO has the
value this.is.a.long.name, then the command <br>
fcomp -o .FOO <br>
is actually equivilant to the command <br>
fcomp -o this.is.a.long.name <br>
If you want to prevent the expansion of a pathname which
begins with a period, then you can use an alternate form for
the pathname, as in: <br>
fcomp -o ./.FOO</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINARY FILES <br>
In general, fcomp can handle all text files you throw at it,
even international text with unusual encodings. However,
fcomp is unable to cope elegantly with files which contain
<br>
the NUL character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fcomp(1) program simply
prints a warning, and continues, you need to know that it
converts NUL characters into an 0x80 value before performing
the comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fmerge(1) program also
converts the NUL character to an 0x80 value before merging,
after a warning, and any output file will contain this
value, rather than the original NUL <br>
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fhist(1) program, however,
generates a fatal error if any input file contains NUL
characters. This is intended to protect your source files
for unintentional corruption. <br>
Use -BINary for files which absolutely must contain NUL
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The fcomp program will exit with a status of 1 on any error.
The fcomp program will only exit with a status of 0 if there
are no errors.</p>
