<p>AUEDIT(1) General Commands Manual AUEDIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
auedit - graphically record and edit audio files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
auedit [-audio servername] [-toolkitoption ...]
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
auedit provides an X-based window-oriented interface
allowing the user to record and edit audio files. The
editing features available include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Cutting, copying, pasting, and
mixing within a single auedit instance or between multiple
auedit instances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Changing the amplitude of an
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Reversing an interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Fading in or out an
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUEDIT AND THE ATHENA WIDGET SET
<br>
auedit uses the X Toolkit Intrinsics and the Athena Widget
Set. For more information, see the Athena Widget Set
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCREEN LAYOUT <br>
auedit starts out with a single window divided into several
areas:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A collection of drop-down
menus and command buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A volume indicator and control
slider.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The audio file represented as
a wave form. If the audio data contains multiple tracks, the
tracks will be displayed in ascending order. For stereo
data, the convention is <br>
left track, then right track.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A set of indicators displaying
the interval start, duration, and end and the current
position. These indicators are in units of minutes, seconds,
and hundredths of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Buttons to play, stop, and
pause the audio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Two menus indicating the
current file and data formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Two editable fields containing
the current frequency and the audio file comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERVALS <br>
Many functions in auedit operate on a range of audio data
called an interval. The initial interval encompasses all of
the audio data. The interval is indicated within the wave
<br>
form by two solid, vertical lines. The left marker indicates
the start of the interval. The right marker indicates the
end of the interval. To select an interval of audio <br>
data, use the mouse to move the interval markers in the wave
form. Pressing a mouse button in the wave form will select
the marker closest to the mouse position. That marker <br>
may then be dragged to the desired location in the wave
form. Note that the markers may not cross over each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYING AN INTERVAL <br>
To play an interval, click on the Play button (the one with
the triangle on its side). The audio data delimited by the
start and end markers will be played. A dashed vertical <br>
line will indicate the approximate position of the data
currently being played. To stop playing, click on the Stop
button (the one containing a solid square). Clicking on
Pause <br>
(the button containing two vertical, parallel lines) will
pause the playing. To resume, click on Pause again. The
volume slider controls the play volume. The interval is <br>
played at the frequency specified by the Frequency field.
Note that while data is being played, most other functions
are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE FILE MENU <br>
New... Initializes auedit with an empty file. You will be
prompted for the number of tracks for the new file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load... Loads a file. You will
be prompted for the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save Saves the current file. A
backup file will be created by appending a tilde (~) to the
current file name. The file format, data format, frequency
and comment <br>
are used when saving the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save as... Saves the current
file under a new name. You will be prompted for the file
name. The file format, data format, frequency and comment
are used when saving <br>
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save interval... Saves the
interval to a file. You will be prompted for a file name.
The file format, data format, frequency and comment are used
when saving the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revert Discards all changes made
since the last save and restores the data to its state
following the last save.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit Exits auedit. If there have
been changes made to the current file that have not been
saved, you will be asked if you wish to save them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE EDIT MENU <br>
The cut, copy, and paste commands in the edit menu transfer
data to and from a selection buffer. This buffer is shared
between all instances of auedit. This means that you can
<br>
cut or copy data from one instance of auedit and paste it
into another instance. The only restriction is that the
audio data in both instances must have the same number of
<br>
tracks. When transferring data between instances of
differing frequencies, the data will be converted to the
frequency of the destination. This can be used to change the
fre&acirc; <br>
quency of the data in a single instance of auedit. First,
cut the data whose frequency you wish to change. Then change
the Frequency field to the desired frequency. Finally, <br>
paste the data back in. The frequency of the data will be
converted to the frequency specified in the Frequency
field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cut Moves the interval to the
selection buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy Copies the interval to the
selection buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste insert Inserts the
selection buffer at the point marked by the start
marker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste replace Replaces the data
at the point marked by the start marker with the data from
the selection buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paste mix Mixes the data at the
point marked by the start marker with the data from the
selection buffer. The mixing function is an average.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undo Undoes the last operation
that modified the audio data. This includes effects
operations in addition to editing operations. If the last
operation was an <br>
Undo then the undo is undone, restoring the data to the
state prior to the first undo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE ZOOM MENU <br>
In Zoom in by a factor of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Out Zoom out by a factor of
two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Markers Zoom in to the interval
delimited by the start and end markers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Full Zoom out to display all of
the audio data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE EFFECTS MENU <br>
All operations under the effects menu apply to the current
interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Amplitude... Scale the
amplitude. You will be prompted for the scale. The scale may
be non-integral.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Max Amplitude Scales the
interval to its maximum amplitude without clipping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reverse Reverses the order of
the data within the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade In Linearly scales the
interval using a scale ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade Out Linearly scales the
interval using a scale ranging from 1.0 to 0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE RECORD COMMAND <br>
Clicking on the Record button brings up the record dialog
box. The record dialog box consists of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A duration field. This is the
maximum duration of the recording in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A frequency field. This is the
frequency of the recording in hertz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o An input mode toggle button.
Clicking this button toggles between line mode and
microphone mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A gain slider. This controls
the input gain level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A record toggle button.
Clicking this button starts and stops the recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A monitor toggle button.
Clicking this button toggles the record monitoring feature
that lets you hear what you&rsquo;re recording.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o A dismiss command button.
Clicking this button stops any current recording and
dismisses the record dialog box.</p>
