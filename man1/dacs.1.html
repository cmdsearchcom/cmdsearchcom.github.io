<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of the DACS suite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS is a general-purpose,
Web-based authentication and access control system. It
provides single sign-on functionality and flexible access
control to content and services <br>
provided by web servers. DACS consists of an Apache module
(mod_auth_dacs[2]) through which Apache communicates with
DACS to make access control decisions, a suite of CGI <br>
programs that provide DACS web services, and a collection of
utility commands that provide various support and
administrative functions for DACS. Some of these utilities,
such as <br>
dacshttp(1)[3] and sslclient(1)[4], are completely
general-purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DACS access control engine
and authentication components can also be used from the
command line, within a CGI environment or completely
independently of the Web.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For important information about
DACS, including installation instructions, please see
dacs.readme(7)[5] and dacs.install(7)[6].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About DACS <br>
NO WARRANTY <br>
This software is provided by Dss &quot;as is&quot; and any
express or implied warranties, including, but not limited
to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
<br>
particular purpose, or non-infringement, are disclaimed. In
no event shall Dss be liable for any direct, indirect,
incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages
<br>
(including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute
goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or
business interruption) however caused and on any theory of
<br>
liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort
(including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out
of the use of this software, even if advised of the <br>
possibility of such damage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By convention, the names of all
DACS web services begin with the prefix &quot;dacs_&quot;
(e.g., dacs_conf). Starting with release 1.4.17, all
commands that implement DACS functionality <br>
begin with the prefix &quot;dacs&quot; (e.g., dacsconf).
Many DACS web services have command analogues. The names of
web services that are used internally by DACS (i.e., they
are never <br>
called directly by users) begin with &quot;local_&quot;
(e.g., local_passwd_authenticate). General-purpose web
services and commands do not follow a naming convention,
other than not using <br>
any of the previously mentioned prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The document type definitions
(DTDs) that are maintained in the dtd-xsd directory are used
to document file formats or describe the arguments to a DACS
web service or its reply. <br>
In the current implementation, these DTD files are not used
during XML validation. Attributes of type CDATA may have
additional constraints on their values; consult the relevant
<br>
documentation. The files are technically not valid DTDs,
because they lack a document type declaration (DOCTYPE); an
appropriate DOCTYPE is generated programmatically at the
time <br>
a DTD is emitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important <br>
DACS does not prevent certain kinds of attacks against web
sites, such as Denial of service attacks[7], Cross-site
scripting (XSS)[8] or Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)[9].
<br>
When combined with appropriate web site protective measures,
however, DACS does provide mechanisms to make these types of
attacks more difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About the Manual Pages <br>
The technical documentation for DACS is provided as a set of
manual pages. From XML source files, HTML, nroff/troff, and
nroff output collections are generated during the <br>
installation procedure. In the HTML collection, an index
page[10] includes a table of contents, links to special
annotations within the technical documentation, and lists of
<br>
variables, configuration directives, and XML Document Type
Definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip <br>
Each HTML manual page contains a font size selection tool
near its bottom. If JavaScript is enabled, the currently
selected font size can be changed and a global preference
<br>
set. To choose a font size for the current page, click on
one of the four boxes. To make the current selection your
preference across manual pages, site visits, and browser
<br>
sessions, click on the &quot;set&quot; button, which will
set an HTTP cookie. If a preference has not been set in this
way (i.e., there is no cookie) and a manual page is visited
with <br>
the query parameter DACSMANFONT set to 0, 1, 2, or 3
(representing smallest to largest point sizes), the
corresponding font will be selected and the preference
automatically <br>
set (if a preference has been set, the parameter is
ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip <br>
The output of man(1)[11] for these manual pages is likely to
contain ANSI escape sequences (e.g., for bold face mark up).
For these pages to be rendered in a terminal window <br>
as intended, the pager used for this purpose may need to be
given an appropriate flag, such as -R for less(1)[12].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Areas of the documentation
labeled &quot;Security&quot; discuss important security
considerations; please pay special attention to them. Areas
labeled &quot;Tip&quot; provide pointers to time-saving <br>
(and sometimes aggravation-reducing) techniques and
recommended practices.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In pathnames and URLs that
appear in examples, the text &quot;...&quot; represents text
that has been omitted because it is not relevant to the
discussion at hand, or which may vary <br>
depending on configuration details, such as where something
has been installed (e.g., .../dacs/bin/dacshttp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless otherwise stated, URLs
used in examples are fictitious and most likely will not
work. The reserved domain name example.com is often used
(RFC 2606[13]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In instructions and examples, a
&rsquo;%&rsquo; is generally used to signify a command line
prompt:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% date <br>
Sun Apr 1 15:33:11 PDT 2007</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes another character is
used to signify a prompt, however, such as when
demonstrating the interactive mode of dacsexpr(1)[14]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt; 1 + 1 <br>
2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extended form of BNF
notation[15] is used to describe syntax concisely. We hope
it is both understandable and familiar, but some
inconsistencies and ambiguities may occur <br>
throughout the documentation; this is being improved slowly.
A term in a production may include a regular expression type
specification, with &rsquo;+&rsquo; meaning one or more
occurrences <br>
of the term, and &rsquo;*&rsquo; zero or more occurrences.
Any one of a set of characters is specified within square
brackets, and a range of consecutive characters (in ASCII
code sequence) <br>
is separated by a hyphen (e.g., [A-Za-z0-9&minus;_]+ means
&quot;one or more alphabetic characters, digits, hyphens, or
underscores&quot;). In other contexts, square brackets
indicate an <br>
optional term. Single and double quotes specify literal
characters. Note that XML DTDs use their own syntax, which
is somewhat different, and in some cases grammars followed
in <br>
relevant RFCs are respected for clarity or in examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key Concepts <br>
Some of the key concepts used throughout the DACS
documentation are defined in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">account <br>
A record, usually persistent, that associates an identity
(or username) with state information (such as whether
authentication is enabled or disabled), information that is
<br>
required to authenticate the identity (such as a digest of a
password string), and possibly other sign-on related
information. DACS does not provide mechanisms to administer
<br>
&quot;foreign&quot; account types. For instance, although it
can authenticate against them, DACS cannot create, modify,
delete, or list Unix or Windows accounts. Note that DACS
<br>
identities do not necessarily have a corresponding
account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authentication <br>
The procedure by which a person or program obtains
credentials that represent a DACS identity, usually by
asserting a DACS username that represents an identity and
providing <br>
information that only that identity is likely to know or
possess. After successful authentication, a person or
program is said to have authenticated. DACS can interface
with <br>
a wide variety of authentication methods and provides some
of its own; new methods can easily be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">authorization <br>
The procedure that determines, in a particular context,
whether a request for a given resource or object should be
allowed. If an identity is authorized to perform a certain
<br>
operation on the object, access is granted, otherwise it is
denied. Access control rules are one method of describing
which identity or identities should be granted - or <br>
denied - access to a particular resource. Coarse-grained
access control involves making a high-level decision of
whether access to an object should be granted; this is <br>
usually an all-or-nothing decision. Fine-grained access
control is used within a program to decide whether access to
a lower-level resource (some data, an administrative <br>
function, a menu) should be granted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that unlike some systems,
DACS does not predetermine which resources a particular user
(identity) can and cannot access; that is, an administrator
does not make a list <br>
of what rights each user has. Authorization is always
determined by rule evaluation, in real time, when a user
requests a resource. The only exemptions to this are some
<br>
optional features: Authorization Caching[16] and
Rlinks[17].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">credentials <br>
If authentication is successful, DACS returns information
that can be used in subsequent operations to represent the
authenticated identity. Credentials contain information <br>
about the identity, such as its name, and meta information,
such as the time at which the credentials expire and become
invalid. Credentials are protected cryptographically <br>
so that they are difficult to forge or alter. They must be
kept secret, so that the identity cannot be used by anyone
other than its owner, and must accompany a request made <br>
to a server so that DACS knows who is making the request.
The particular mechanism used for this is not important
provided credentials cannot be copied and reused; <br>
transporting credentials using the payload of an HTTP cookie
over an SSL/TLS connection is typical, although sending
credentials as the value of an HTTP extension header is <br>
another possibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although there is no specific
limit on the size of credentials as far as DACS is
concerned, since they can be encapsulated within an HTTP
cookie and returned to a browser, <br>
constraints on cookies imposed by browsers should be
carefully considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any jurisdiction can understand
credentials produced by any other jurisdiction within the
same federation. Therefore, a user only needs to be
authenticated once to access web <br>
services at any jurisdiction using that identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in DACS, credentials
do not give their owner any rights or convey any
authorization; DACS is not a capability-based system[18].
Credentials simply represent a DACS <br>
identity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refer to
dacs_authenticate(8)[19] for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">current request <br>
The event that has triggered the authorization check being
processed by dacs_acs(8)[20] is referred to as the current
request. For a request for a DACS-wrapped web resource, <br>
this will be the HTTP request that is received by the web
server for the resource. In situations where dacs_acs is not
involved, such as when dacscheck(1)[21] or <br>
dacsexpr(1)[14] are used, the current request and its
context are specified by command line arguments or are
obtained from the execution environment[22].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dacs_acs uses ${DACS::URI} as
the path component of the current request. It is obtained
from the uri element of the current request_rec within
httpd. This is the string that <br>
is used to match against access control rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other DACS components determine
the current HTTP request by examining several environment
variables: HTTP_HOST (or SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT),
REQUEST_URI, QUERY_STRING, <br>
and HTTPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of ${DACS::URI} and
the path component of ${Env::REQUEST_URI} are not
necessarily the same. After an internal redirect, for
example, the latter&rsquo;s value is from the <br>
original URL, while the former&rsquo;s is from the target of
the redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current request string is
important because it may be used to determine the current
federation[23] and current jurisdiction[24], and because it
is used when searching for <br>
the access control rule to apply to the request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS <br>
Consisting of CGI-based web services, an Apache 2.2/2.4
module, and a collection of utilities, DACS provides
authentication and authorization functionality. Transparent,
<br>
coarse-grained attribute-based access control is available
for web resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Programmatic, general-purpose
access control is available for virtually any program (using
dacscheck(1)[21]). This is completely decoupled from
Apache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS administrator <br>
An individual (or individuals) responsible for managing the
operation of DACS is called a DACS administrator (sometimes
just &quot;the administrator&quot;). This individual is not
<br>
necessarily a system administrator (e.g., superuser or
root), although a small number of optional components of
DACS must execute as user or group root. The DACS <br>
administrator need not be an Apache administrator; once
Apache has been configured for DACS it typically requires
very few modifications thereafter. The DACS administrator is
<br>
responsible for configuring and testing DACS (probably
installing and upgrading it, too), managing user accounts
and access control rules, safeguarding security, backing up
<br>
configuration and data files, and so on. The design of DACS
allows some delegation of responsibility, largely based on
file permissions. When invoked as a web service, each <br>
of the identities configured as a ADMIN_IDENTITY[25] is
effectively a DACS administrator; in this context, the
system superuser has no significance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS identity <br>
Each authenticated user is assigned a name that consists of
the name of the authenticating jurisdiction, its federation
name, and a username. Each of these naming components <br>
must be syntactically correct. In some contexts the
federation name is implicit; sometimes the jurisdiction name
is also implicit. Entities such as individuals (people, but
<br>
also programs, devices, etc.), federations, jurisdictions,
and groups have names. It is the responsibility of
jurisdictions to authenticate users. The syntax, meanings,
and <br>
uniqueness of names is also a jurisdictional issue, and
perhaps a federation-wide issue as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each real world entity typically
has a unique DACS identity, but this is left up to
authenticating jurisdictions. Two or more identities are
distinct if they do not refer to <br>
the same real world individual. Federated identity or single
sign-on (SSO) is the ability to recognize a user identity
across jurisdictions and even across federations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Important <br>
Keep in mind that regardless of the authentication method
and account information used, two identical usernames
(relative to the same jurisdiction and taking into account
<br>
NAME_COMPARE[26]) are implicitly assumed to refer to the
same identity by DACS. For instance, someone who
authenticated as auggie by providing the correct Unix
password <br>
is virtually indistinguishable from someone who
authenticated as auggie using an Information Card. User
credentials include information about the authentication
method <br>
involved in their creation and the user()[27] function can
be used to obtain this information, but it would be unwise
to base identities on this. It is strongly advised <br>
that a new DACS jurisdiction carefully develop an extensible
plan for user naming.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS-wrapped <br>
A web resource is said to be DACS-wrapped if the web server
responsible for the resource calls DACS (more specifically,
dacs_acs(8)[20]) to make an access control decision <br>
whenever it receives a request for the resource.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">federation <br>
A DACS federation consists of one or more jurisdictions. The
jurisdictions comprising a federation coordinate information
sharing through light-weight business practices <br>
implemented as a requirement of membership in a DACS
federation; in other words, the members of a federation
typically agree to observe certain rules of conduct to
preserve <br>
overall security and so that users can obtain maximum
benefit. A federation consisting of just one jurisdiction is
not unusual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">item type <br>
An item type is a name that maps to a VFS[28] (virtual
filestore) specification that configures how and where data
is stored. The level of indirection that they provide means
<br>
that access control rules, for example, can be configured to
be in regular files, a Berkeley DB database, a remote
database accessed by HTTP, and so on - all that is required
<br>
is that the item type acls be properly configured. Some item
types (like acls) are reserved and have special meaning to
DACS, while others can be used by a DACS administrator <br>
for other purposes. An item type name is case sensitive and
consists of alphanumerics, hyphens, and underscores, but
must begin with an alphabetic character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jurisdiction <br>
A DACS jurisdiction is an autonomous administrative entity
that authenticates its users, provides web services, or
both. It may correspond to an organization, department, web
<br>
server, or virtual host. Jurisdictions are sometimes created
simply as an administrative convenience. Each jurisdiction
is assigned a unique name within a federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A user&rsquo;s home jurisdiction
is a jurisdiction that can authenticate that user. In
situations where a user has multiple credentials obtained
from different jurisdictions, the <br>
effective home jurisdiction for a request depends on which
credentials are selected during authorization processing.
Configuration directives are available to restrict the <br>
number of sets of credentials that may accompany a
request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user agent <br>
A user agent is client-side software that interacts with
other software (a server application, typically) on behalf
of a user. A user is often a person but can also be <br>
software. A web browser, which is used to interact with a
web server, is an example of a user agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Naming <br>
DACS needs to name a variety of things so that they can be
referred to in expressions, access control rules,
configuration directives, and so on. While the URI syntax is
used to <br>
name some kinds of objects within DACS, DACS also has its
own concise naming schemes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
The terms current federation (current jurisdiction) and this
federation (this jurisdiction) are used in the documentation
to refer to the federation (jurisdiction) associated <br>
with the configuration context in effect while DACS
processes a request.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, the federation-name
component of a name is optional; if absent, the current
federation is assumed. Similarly, the jurisdiction-name may
be elided and the current <br>
jurisdiction is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Federations <br>
Syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">federation-name::</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEMO::</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The federation-name (usually
obtained from a FEDERATION_NAME[29] configuration directive)
must begin with an alphabetic character and is followed by
zero or more <br>
alphanumerics, hyphens, and underscores. A federation-name
is ordinarily treated case sensitively (but see the
NAME_COMPARE[26] configuration directive and the user()[27]
<br>
function for alternate behaviours). There is no a priori
limit on its length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FEDERATION_DOMAIN[30]
directive specifies the domain name suffix common to all
jurisdictions in a federation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Jurisdictions <br>
Syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[federation-name:: | [::]]
jurisdiction-name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEMO::DSS: <br>
::DSS: <br>
DSS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The jurisdiction-name (usually
obtained from a JURISDICTION_NAME[31] configuration
directive) must begin with an alphabetic character and is
followed by zero or more <br>
alphanumerics, hyphens, and underscores. A jurisdiction-name

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEMO::DSS:auggie <br>
::DSS:auggie <br>
DSS:auggie <br>
:auggie</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A full DACS identity includes a
federation name component and a jurisdiction name component,
in addition to the username. It is provided to DACS-wrapped
programs as the value <br>
of the DACS_IDENTITY[32] environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The username component, which is
available to CGI programs as the value of the
DACS_USERNAME[33] environment variable, consists of one or
more ASCII characters from the set <br>
of upper and lower case alphabetics, digits, and the
following punctuation characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! # $ % &amp; &rsquo; - . ; ? @
[ ^ _ &lsquo; { }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All characters having a value
less than 041 (octal) or greater than 0176 (octal) are
invalid, as are the following characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* , : + ( ) ~ &lt; &gt; = |
&nbsp;/ &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In addition to the alphanumeric characters,
RFC 2396[34] allows only the following characters
(&quot;pchar&quot;) to appear in the path component of a
URI:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- _ . ! ~ * &rsquo; ( ) % : @
&amp; = + $ ,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some valid email
addresses are not valid DACS usernames. For example,
*bob*@example.com, &quot;(bob)&quot;@example.com, and
b@example.com are valid mailbox names as <br>
defined by RFC 822[35] (Appendix D) and discussed in RFC
3696[36] (Section 3), but both are invalid as DACS
usernames. Unless quoted, the local-part component of an
<br>
email address, which precedes the &quot;@&quot; character in
the addr-spec, may not contain any of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">( ) &lt; &gt; @ , ; :
&nbsp;&quot; . [ ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, the space and all
US-ASCII control characters (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)
are disallowed. Without quotes, the local-part may consist
of any <br>
combination of alphabetics, digits, or any of the following
characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! # $ % &amp; &rsquo; * + - / =
? ^ _ &lsquo; . { | } ~</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A period (&quot;.&quot;) may be
used, but may not start or end the local-part, nor may two
or more consecutive periods appear. Within double quotes,
any ASCII character may <br>
appear if properly quoted (e.g., Auggie.&quot;
&quot;.O.&quot;&acute;&quot;.Doggie@example.com). The
maximum length of the local-part is 64 characters, and the
maximum length of the domain <br>
component that appears after the &quot;@&quot; character is
255 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is currently no way to
&quot;quote&quot; a DACS username, so some safe encoding
method or transformation must be applied to these names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DACS may create
identities for internal use having username components that
include characters that are normally invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A username is
case sensitive (but see the NAME_COMPARE[26] configuration
directive and the user()[27] function for alternate
behaviours). There is no a priori limit <br>
on its length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The recommended
practice is for jurisdictions to map their DACS usernames to
lower case during the authentication procedure where
possible and when the mappings are <br>
unique. The EXIT*[37] directive may be used for this
purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groups <br>
Syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[[federation-name:: | [::]]
%[jurisdiction-name]:groupname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A groupname must begin with an
alphabetic character and may be followed by any number of
alphanumeric, hyphen (&quot;-&quot;), and underscore
(&quot;_&quot;) characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%DEMO::DSS:friends <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A role descriptor string (also
called a role string or a role descriptor) consists of a
comma separated list of roles. The name of a role (a
Basic-Role) is constructed from <br>
upper and lower case letters, digits, hyphens, and
underscores. A Composite-Role is constructed from two or
more Basic-Role terms, separated by a slash character. Here
are <br>
three examples of a role descriptor:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">admin,wheel,root <br>
admin/hardware <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
A role descriptor string contains no white space characters
and may not begin or end with a comma or slash character.
Two or more consecutive commas are illegal, as are <br>
two or more consecutive slashes. <br>
The setvar()[38] function can be used to separate a
composite role into its basic roles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a DACS-identity
is a full or abbreviated DACS identity[40]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; a simple-name is
the username component of a DACS identity (i.e., without any
colons); consequently in this context a &quot;special&quot;
name, such as auth, is treated as :auth</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; role-descriptor
must be a valid DACS role string and groupname must be a
valid DACS group name (see dacs_authenticate(8)[41] and
dacs.groups(5)[42]);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; an IP address is
expressed in the Internet standard numeric dot notation
(e.g., 10.0.0.1); and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the lifetime of
credentials derived from the identity can be expressed
either as a given number of seconds (e.g,
&quot;e=+3600&quot;) or a given date in one of the following
<br>
formats (see strptime(3)[43]):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%a, %d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S GMT <br>
%d-%b-%Y <br>
%b %d, %Y <br>
%b %d <br>
%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When necessary, dates are
interpreted relative to the current time or date. The
lifetime is converted to its canonical form, which is the
absolute time and date in <br>
seconds since the Epoch, based on the jurisdiction&rsquo;s
clock. A date in the past can be specified; this might be
useful for testing, for instance. If the identity is not
<br>
used to create credentials, the expiry date is ignored,
although it must be syntactically correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the only
supported attribute value is &quot;a&quot;, which means that
the identity should be treated as an ADMIN_IDENTITY[25]
(refer to the -admin flag of dacscheck(1)[21]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A name expressed in the concise
syntax, gives a username and, optionally, roles and
attributes for the identity. It is used by dacscheck(1)[21],
for instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dacs Utility <br>
DACS utility commands are usually installed as separate
binaries, but DACS can (also or instead) be built with most
of them combined into a single binary that is installed as
<br>
dacs. The various utility programs may then be run as:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacs dacs-command
[dacsoptions] [command-options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">% dacs license <br>
% dacs dacskey -u j1.example.com outfile <br>
% dacs checkdigest &quot;pbkdf2[a=sha256,count=4098,
dklen=20]&quot; <br>
% dacs checkdigest 14</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Running the dacs utility without
arguments will show the list of available sub-commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start-up Processing <br>
Most DACS programs perform the following actions when they
start:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Determine the
&quot;mode&quot; in which they should operate; for example,
if the REMOTE_ADDR environment variable is present, programs
will in general assume they should run as a web <br>
application rather than as a utility command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Process a standard set of
command line arguments (dacsoptions[44])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Set the process umask to 007
to disallow world access for any created files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Disable a core dump so that
sensitive information cannot be revealed by examining them
(but see --enable-dump[45])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Refuse to operate if any
configuration file cannot be found or has an error</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. For web services, make the
DACS home directory the current working directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. If &quot;secure mode&quot;
has been enabled, web services will only process HTTPS
requests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. Verify that the version
required by a request is compatible with the version of DACS
receiving the request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Process any program-specific
command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DACS programs make an effort to
destroy sensitive information (such as passwords) as soon as
it is no longer needed and not to write potentially
sensitive information to log <br>
files unless specifically configured to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internals <br>
Some DACS components may call other components using HTTP
(possibly over SSL/TLS, depending on configuration). For
example, authentication modules may be invoked as web
services <br>
by dacs_authenticate(8)[41]. In all cases, these
&quot;internal&quot; HTTP calls may not result in a
redirection, such as through a 302 Found status code.
Although this can sometimes be an <br>
inconvenience, it is, in part, a security measure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip <br>
When debugging a problem that may involve an internal HTTP
request (especially related to authentication), verify that
DACS is not receiving a redirect. Internal HTTP <br>
requests may also fail mysteriously because of incorrect or
incomplete configuration of SSL/TLS parameters. Internal
HTTP requests over SSL/TLS use sslclient(1)[4], as does <br>
the dacshttp(1)[3] command. If you suspect that an
https-schemed URL may not be working, debug the problem
using sslclient and then dacshttp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To maintain data consistency,
DACS creates exclusive locks using the fcntl(2)[46] system
call on files written in the directory configured through
the TEMP_DIRECTORY[47] <br>
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging <br>
Most DACS services and utilities write various kinds of
messages to one or more log files. These messages can be
invaluable when trying to figure out what DACS is doing, for
<br>
security audits, or to see which DACS-wrapped resources are
being accessed and in what ways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please refer to dacs.conf(5)[48]
for information about configuration directives related to
logging. An assortment of command line flags, described
below, are also related to <br>
logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
&Acirc;&middot; DACS can emit log messages before
configuration processing is complete and configuration
directives associated with logging are not in effect during
this startup interval <br>
(see --enab le-hush-startup-logging[49]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Because
mod_auth_dacs[2] is an Apache module, the Apache logging
directives apply to it (and not the DACS directives) and its
log messages are written to Apache log <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Log files can
quickly become large, especially when the logging level is
set to debug or trace levels. Consider daily rotation or
truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The text of a
log message may occasionally span several lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of the
LOG_FORMAT[50] directive, which controls the appearance of
log messages, is defined in include/local.h as
LOG_FORMAT_DEFAULT_WEB for DACS web services <br>
and LOG_FORMAT_DEFAULT_CMD for everything else. Here is a
typical log message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Wed Jul 12 12:37:09 2006]
[trace] [83648,1060,-] [dacs_acs:&quot;acslib&quot;] Allow
<br>
clause grants access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Audit-Class Log Messages <br>
In the case of audit-class messages, a string within
parentheses may sometimes follow an identity, as in the
examples below. This string, called a tracker, associates
log <br>
messages with a particular origin and can be used to trace a
user&rsquo;s sequence of service requests using log messages
throughout a federation. This can be useful when <br>
debugging, looking for security problems, or forensic
analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For an unauthenticated user, the
tracker can only be derived heuristically, from elements of
the execution context. The user&rsquo;s IP address, user
agent string, and SSL client <br>
certificate, when available, are used. If two of these
tracker strings differ, the requests are typically coming
from different hosts, browsers, or users, but this is not
<br>
necessarily always the case. Similarly, if the same tracker
string is associated with two log messages, the service
requests are not necessarily being issued by the same <br>
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For an authenticated user, the
tracker string consists of the heuristically-derived string,
followed by a comma, followed by a string uniquely
associated with the user&rsquo;s <br>
credentials. This tracker has a high probability of being
unique and having a one-to-one mapping with a particular
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider these (condensed) log
file entries:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Wed Jul 12 15:56:24 2006]

/cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_current_credentials</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first two of the log
messages above, the tracker 7vJLWzv5 appears, meaning that
the two requests probably came from the same
(unauthenticated) user. With the third log <br>
message, the user has been authenticated and the tracker
7vJLWzv5,wA/Pudyp3f0 is used. Because these trackers all
share the same prefix, the first two requests probably also
<br>
came from someone who authenticated as DSS::HOME:bobo. The
last request, for /cgi-bin/dacs/dacs_current_credentials,
definitely came from that user. If this user were to <br>
signout and then issue more service requests anywhere in the
federation DSS, each log message would contain the tracker
7vJLWzv5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
Tracking the requests of anonymous users reliably is
difficult to do well. A cookie-based approach may do better
in some situations but has its own drawbacks (such as <br>
being totally ineffective when the user has disabled
cookies).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tracking User Activity <br>
DACS includes a feature, enabled as a build-time option (see
dacs.install(7)[51]), whereby a jurisdiction can track the
activity of all of its users (i.e., those users that <br>
authenticate at the jurisdiction). Each successful
authentication event, explicit signout event, and
user-submitted web service request event can be recorded at
the user&rsquo;s home <br>
jurisdiction in the format defined by
dacs_user_info.dtd[52]. This information can be valuable for
better understanding what is happening throughout a
federation, including <br>
helping to diagnose performance and security issues. It is
the basis of features like displays of recent account
activity, and it might also be used to create new
capabilities, <br>
such as a concurrent login limit or an adaptive
authentication component to implement layered authentication
or risk-based authentication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To specify where and how a home
jurisdiction should maintain these records, the user_info
item type must be defined at that jurisdiction; if it is not
defined, no records will be <br>
written at that jurisdiction, although the jurisdiction will
still try to send event records to other jurisdictions. For
maximum benefit, the feature should be enabled at all <br>
jurisdictions in a federation; all user activity throughout
the federation can then be logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a jurisdiction wants to
monitor the activity of its users at other jurisdictions, it
must allow those jurisdictions to invoke its dacs_vfs(8)[53]
service by adding an <br>
appropriate access control rule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security <br>
It is critical for any such rule to require the
dacs_admin()[54] predicate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Because the records are currently not keyed,
at present only the file item type is supported for this
purpose. A configuration directive similar to the following
would be <br>
used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VFS
&quot;[user_info]file://${Conf::FEDERATIONS_ROOT}/${Conf::FEDERATION_DOMAIN}/${Conf::JURISDICTION_NAME}/user_info&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
dacs_admin(8)[55] tools provides an interface to these
records. It should eventually be extended to collect and
organize records found at all jurisdictions in a <br>
federation to facilitate analysis. Because they are text
files with a relatively simple format, administrators should
not find it difficult to apply common text <br>
processing tools or write short, custom programs for this
purpose. Commands analogous to last(1)[56], who(1)[57], and
sa(8)[58] are being considered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Each
jurisdiction should write records to its own place (i.e.,
jurisdictions should not share the same VFS object for
user_info).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; This database
will grow indefinitely; an administrator is responsible for
rotating or truncating it. If previous and active sign on
information is important (see <br>
dacs_current_credentials(8)[59]), prune only the request
records (i.e., the acs elements). Another acceptable method
is to discard (or archive) some proportion of older <br>
records (say, half) and keep some of the newer records.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The data format
is subject to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A directive to
enable or disable this feature at run-time may be added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Internal
administrative events are not recorded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Because signing
off (via dacs_signout(8)[60]) is optional, the end of a
session can sometimes only be inferred or approximated from
the expiry of credentials or the time <br>
of the last recorded event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
DACS programs and web services get much of their run-time
configuration information by reading configuration files and
examining environment variables. Some configuration <br>
information can be provided at compile-time. Several command
line flags may be used to override default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
&Acirc;&middot; All dacsoptions flags are processed
left-to-right and must appear before any command-specific
flag or argument. The first flag or argument that is not
recognized as one <br>
of the dacsoptions terminates the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The most
important dacsoptions are those that specify the location of
configuration files and identify the jurisdiction section to
use within a configuration file. <br>
Depending on the program and how it is used, configuration
information may not be needed, may be optional, or may be
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; At most one of
the command line flags to select a jurisdiction section can
be specified. Refer to dacs.conf(5)[48] for additional
information on the configuration file <br>
and configuration processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many DACS utilities recognize
the following standard options, which are called
dacsoptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c dacs.conf <br>
This tells DACS where it can find a configuration file for
the jurisdiction on whose behalf it is acting. If this
argument is not present, depending on how it was built, DACS
<br>
may either try to use a compile-time specified file or it
will try to use the value of the environment variable
DACS_CONF[61]. For details, refer to Locating dacs.conf and
<br>
site.conf[62].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dname=value <br>
The effect of this flag is to define variable name (which
must be syntactically valid) in the DACS namespace to have
the value value. Any quotes around value are retained, <br>
provided the shell has not already stripped them off. This
flag may be repeated. These variables can subsequently be
tested during configuration processing and rule <br>
processing; for example, the value of a configuration
directive might depend on the value of a dacsoptions flag.
Defining a name that happens to correspond to a dacsoptions
<br>
flag has no effect other than to create the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All dacsoptions flags (excluding
this one) are automatically added to the DACS namespace as
they are processed. A flag that is a &quot;singleton&quot;
(e.g., -q) is initially assigned <br>
a value of one and is incremented on each subsequent
appearance. A flag of the form -flag value is equivalent to
-D-flag=value. Unused flags are undefined; if -q is not <br>
given, ${DACS::-q} will not be defined. For those flags that
have synonyms, a variable for each synonym is created. If
the name is used, explicitly or implicitly, later <br>
values replace earlier ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the dacsoptions
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c www.example.com -v --verbose
-Dfoo=&quot;baz&quot; -ll debug -D-ll=trace</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then variables will be defined
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${DACS::-c} is
&quot;www.example.com&quot; <br>
${DACS::-v} is &quot;2&quot; <br>
${DACS::--verbose} is &quot;2&quot; <br>
${DACS::foo} is &quot; <br>
${DACS::-ll} is &quot;trace&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The debugging level will be
debug and not trace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--checkdigest digest-desc <br>
Validate the syntax of digest descriptor digest-desc, as it
might appear as the value of the PASSWORD_DIGEST[63]
directive. In addition to the digest name, the given
argument <br>
names and values are checked. A numeric algorithm identifier
can be given as a synonym for the algorithm name. The
descriptor is printed in canonical form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--digests [digest-name] <br>
With no digest-name, list information about all available
cryptographic digest algorithms, otherwise only digest-name.
The information includes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the canonical
name for the digest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the
digest&rsquo;s block size, in bytes (&quot;bsize&quot;),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the digest size,
in bytes (&quot;dsize&quot;),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; the internal
password algorithm identifier (&quot;alg&quot;, an unsigned
integer), and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; its attributes:
whether the algorithm can be used with PASSWORD_DIGEST[63]
(&quot;Password&quot;), HMAC constructs (&quot;HMAC&quot;),
digital signatures (&quot;Sign&quot;), scrypt
(&quot;scrypt&quot;), PBKDF2 <br>
(&quot;PBKDF2&quot;), if it requires parameters
(&quot;Parameters&quot;), whether it produces a
variable-length digest (&quot;Varlen&quot;), and its
implementation (&quot;OpenSSL&quot;, &quot;DACS&quot;, or
&quot;System&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A digest size of zero also
indicates that there is a variable-length output, which may
depend on any of the arguments to the digest function. After
printing to stdout, the <br>
program exits immediately. For convenience, --digest is a
synonym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dumpenv <br>
Print all environment variables to stdout and then exit
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-dump <br>
By default, DACS web services and most commands disable core
dump generation as a security precaution. Because a core
dump can be useful when debugging, this flag allows it <br>
to be created. As programs that are allowed to produce a
core dump must change to the DACS_HOME directory, core dumps
will be written there. Use this flag with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-format fmt <br>
The output format is set to fmt, which is one of the
following keywords (case insensitive): file, html, json,
php, plain, text, xml, xmldtd, xmlsimple, xmlschema, uri, or
<br>
url. Not all output formats are supported by all programs.
This flag overrides any FORMAT[64] argument to a web
service, which in turn overrides a program&rsquo;s default
format. <br>
The default format depends on the particular program and way
it is invoked. For additional information, refer to the
description of the FORMAT argument[64].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ll logging-level <br>
The logging level is set to log-level, which is one of the
keywords recognized by the LOG_FILTER[65] directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--license <br>
Print the license for DACS to stdout and then exit
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q <br>
Be quiet. This is equivalent to setting the logging level to
warn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sc site.conf <br>
This tells DACS that it can find a configuration file for
the jurisdiction on whose behalf it is acting. If this
argument is not present, depending on how it was built, DACS
<br>
may either try to use a compile-time specified file or it
will try to use the value of the environment variable
DACS_CONF[61]. For details, refer to Locating dacs.conf and
<br>
site.conf[62].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--std <br>
This flags the end of the common arguments. The next command
line argument, if any, is specific to the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
Emit tracing information. This is equivalent to setting the
logging level to trace. (Also see debug_dacs[66].)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u config-uri <br>
This instructs DACS to use config-uri to select the
jurisdiction section to use in the configuration file. For
details, refer to The Jurisdiction Section[67].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-uj jurisdiction-name <br>
This instructs DACS to use the jurisdiction name
jurisdiction-name to select the jurisdiction section to use
in the configuration file. For details, refer to The
Jurisdiction <br>
Section[67].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-un <br>
This instructs DACS not to process site.conf or dacs.conf.
This may only be used with a small number of commands, such

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-up jurisdiction-name <br>
NOT IMPLEMENTED. This instructs DACS to use the jurisdiction
name jurisdiction-name to select the jurisdiction section to
use in the configuration file and tells it that the <br>
web server is acting as a forward proxy; that is,
jurisdiction-name does not necessarily &quot;own&quot; the
requested URL. For details, refer to The Jurisdiction
Section[67].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-us <br>
This instructs DACS to use the one-and-only jurisdiction
section that appears in the configuration file. That is, the
configuration file must contain exactly one jurisdiction
<br>
section and that is the one that should be used. For
details, refer to The Jurisdiction Section[67].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
--verbose <br>
Be more verbose, relative to the current logging level. This
flag may be repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print version information to stderr immediately and then
exit. If the -v (--verbose) flag appeared earlier on the
command line, also print version information for each DACS
<br>
source code file used by this program that was compiled with
a recognized revision identifier string. This information
can be helpful when debugging suspected build problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
Complete version information is available only for
statically linked programs. Also see dacsversion(1)[69] and
dacs_version(8)[70].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tip <br>
If no command line flag is given to specify the jurisdiction
section, the value of the environment variable
DEFAULT_JURISDICTION will be used as if given with the -uj
flag. <br>
This can be particularly useful when a host has only one
jurisdiction configured because it makes it unnecessary to
always specify the jurisdiction for DACS commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORT, REQUEST_URI <br>
May be used to determine the applicable jurisdiction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Whether using DACS, Apache, or both for authentication and
authorization, always test that resources are being
protected according to your requirements. This is especially
<br>
important when upgrading or reconfiguring DACS or
Apache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility and
interoperability with Apache authentication/authorization
features and configuration may change as Apache evolves. For
a particular set of DACS-wrapped <br>
resources (e.g., URLs in the scope of a given Location
section), it is easiest, safest, and most predictable if as
much as possible is delegated to DACS rather than combining
<br>
DACS with Apache authentication/authorization modules and
directives beyond the minimal configuration. Non-minimal
combinations may cause DACS or Apache to function
incorrectly, <br>
so they should be avoided or used with care. This is
particularly important with respect to Apache 2.4, which has
greatly expanded the number of directives associated with
<br>
authentication and authorization.</p>
