<p>CONVCAL(1) User&rsquo;s Manual CONVCAL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
convcal - convert dates to different formats</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
convcal [OPTIONS] [DATE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
convcal is part of the grace software package, an
application for two-dimensional data visualization. convcal
converts dates from and to various formats. The following
date for&acirc; <br>
mats are supported (hour, minutes and seconds are always
optional):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso 1999-12-31T23:59:59.999</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">european <br>
31/12/1999 23:59:59.999 or 31/12/99 23:59:59.999</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">us 12/31/1999 23:59:59.999 or
12/31/99 23:59:59.999</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">days 123456.789</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">seconds <br>
123456.789</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The formats are tried in the
following order : users&rsquo;s choice, iso, european and us
(there is no ambiguity between calendar formats and
numerical formats and therefore no order <br>
is specified for them).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
convcal reads the dates either on the command line or in the
standard input if the command line contains no date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user&rsquo;s choice for the
input format put one format before the other ones in the
trial list, this is mainly useful for US citizen which would
certainly prefer to have US format <br>
checked before european format. The default user&rsquo;s
choice (nohint) does nothing so the following formats of the
list are checked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The separators between various
fields can be any characters in the set: &quot; :/.-T&quot;.
One or more spaces act as one separator, other characters
can not be repeated, the T separator <br>
is allowed only between date and time, mainly for iso8601.
So the string &quot;1999-12 31:23-59&quot; is allowed (but
not recommended). The &rsquo;-&rsquo; character is used both
as a separator (it <br>
is traditionally used in iso8601 format) and as the unary
minus (for dates in the far past or for numerical dates).
When the year is between 0 and 99 and is written with two or
<br>
less digits, it is mapped to the era beginning at wrap year
and ending at wrap year + 99 as follows :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[wy ; 99] -&gt; [ wrap_year ;
100*(1 + wrap_year/100) - 1 ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[00 ; wy-1] -&gt; [ 100*(1 +
wrap_year/100) ; wrap_year + 99]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so for example if the wrap year
is set to 1950 (which is the default value), then the
mapping is :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">range [00 ; 49] is mapped to
[2000 ; 2049]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">range [50 ; 99] is mapped to
[1950 ; 1999]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">this is reasonably Y2K compliant
and is consistent with current use. Specifying year 1 is
still possible using more than two digits as follows :
&quot;0001-03-04&quot; is unambiguously <br>
March the 4th, year 1, even if the user&rsquo;s choice is us
format. However using two digits only is not recommended (we
introduce a 2050 bug here so this feature should be removed
at <br>
some point in the future ;-)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numerical dates (days and
seconds formats) can be specified using integer, real or
exponential formats (the &rsquo;d&rsquo; and &rsquo;D&rsquo;
exponant markers from fortran are supported in addition to
<br>
&rsquo;e&rsquo; and &rsquo;E&rsquo;). They are computed
according to a customizable reference date. The default
value is given by the REFDATE constant in the source file.
You can change this value as <br>
you want before compiling, and you can change it at will
using the -r command line option. The default value in the
distributed file is &quot;-4713-01-01T12:00:00&quot;, it is
a classical <br>
reference for astronomical events (note that the
&rsquo;-&rsquo; is used here both as a unary minus and as a
separator).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program can be used either
for Denys&rsquo;s and gregorian calendars. It does not take
into account leap seconds : you can think it works only in
International Atomic Time (TAI) <br>
and not in Coordinated Unified Time (UTC) ... Inexistant
dates are detected, they include year 0, dates between
1582-10-05 and 1582-10-14, February 29th of non leap years,
<br>
months below 1 or above 12, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
A summary of the options supported by convcal is included
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h prints the help message on
stderr and exits successfully</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i format <br>
set user&rsquo;s choice for input format, supported formats
are iso, european, us, days, seconds and nohint. At the
beginning the input format is nohint, which means the
pro&acirc; <br>
gram try to guess the format by itself, if the user&rsquo;s
choice does not allow to parse the date, other formats are
tried</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o format <br>
force output format, supported formats are iso, european,
us, days, seconds and nohint. At the beginning, the output
format is nohint, which means the program uses days <br>
format for dates read in any calendar format and uses
iso8601 for dates read in numerical format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r date <br>
set reference date (the date is read using the current input
format) at the beginning the reference is set according to
the REFDATE constant in the code, which is <br>
-4713-01-01T12:00:00 in the distributed file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w year <br>
set the wrap year to year</p>
