<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dc - desk calculator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dc [ file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dc is an arbitrary precision desk calculator. Ordinarily it
operates on decimal integers, but one may specify an input
base, output base, and a number of fractional digits to be
<br>
maintained. The overall structure of dc is a stacking
(reverse Polish) calculator. If an argument is given, input
is taken from that file until its end, then from the
standard <br>
input. The following constructions are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number The value of the number
is pushed on the stack. A number is an unbroken string of
the digits 0-9A-F or 0-9a-f. A hexadecimal number beginning
with a lower case letter <br>
must be preceded by a zero to distinguish it from the
command associated with the letter. It may be preceded by an
underscore _ to input a negative number. Numbers may <br>
contain decimal points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ - / * % ^ <br>
Add subtract multiply divide remainder or exponentiate the
top two values on the stack. The two entries are popped off
the stack; the result is pushed on the stack in <br>
their place. Any fractional part of an exponent is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sx <br>
Sx Pop the top of the stack and store into a register named
x, where x may be any character. Under operation S register
x is treated as a stack and the value is pushed on <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lx <br>
Lx Push the value in register x onto the stack. The register
x is not altered. All registers start with zero value. Under
operation L register x is treated as a stack and <br>
its top value is popped onto the main stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Duplicate the top value on the
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Print the top value on the
stack. The top value remains unchanged. P interprets the top
of the stack as an text string, removes it, and prints
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f Print the values on the
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q <br>
Q Exit the program. If executing a string, the recursion
level is popped by two. Under operation Q the top value on
the stack is popped and the string execution level is <br>
popped by that value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">x Treat the top element of the
stack as a character string and execute it as a string of dc
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Replace the number on the top
of the stack with its scale factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ ... ] <br>
Put the bracketed text string on the top of the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;x <br>
&gt;x <br>
=x Pop and compare the top two elements of the stack.
Register x is executed if they obey the stated relation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v Replace the top element on the
stack by its square root. Any existing fractional part of
the argument is taken into account, but otherwise the scale
factor is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! Interpret the rest of the line
as a shell command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Clear the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i The top value on the stack is
popped and used as the number base for further input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Push the input base on the top
of the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o The top value on the stack is
popped and used as the number base for further output. In
bases larger than 10, each &lsquo;digit&rsquo; prints as a
group of decimal digits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O Push the output base on the
top of the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">k Pop the top of the stack, and
use that value as a non-negative scale factor: the
appropriate number of places are printed on output, and
maintained during multiplication, <br>
division, and exponentiation. The interaction of scale
factor, input base, and output base will be reasonable if
all are changed together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">z Push the stack level onto the
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Z Replace the number on the top
of the stack with its length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? A line of input is taken from
the input source (usually the terminal) and executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">; : Used by bc for array
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scale factor set by k
determines how many digits are kept to the right of the
decimal point. If s is the current scale factor, sa is the
scale of the first operand, sb is <br>
the scale of the second, and b is the (integer) second
operand, results are truncated to the following scales.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+,- max(sa,sb) <br>
* min(sa+sb , max(s,sa,sb)) <br>
/ s <br>
% so that dividend = divisor*quotient + remainder; remainder
has sign of dividend <br>
^ min(sa&Atilde;|b|, max(s,sa)) <br>
v max(s,sa)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Print the first ten values of n!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
x where x is an octal number: an internal error. <br>
&lsquo;Out of headers&rsquo; for too many numbers being kept
around. <br>
&lsquo;Nesting depth&rsquo; for too many levels of nested
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
When the input base exceeds 16, there is no notation for
digits greater than F.</p>
