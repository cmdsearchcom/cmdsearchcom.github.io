<p>REFER(1) General Commands Manual REFER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
refer - preprocess bibliographic references for groff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
refer [ -benvCPRS ] [ -an ] [ -cfields ] [ -fn ] [ -ifields
] [ -kfield ] [ -lm,n ] [ -pfilename ] [ -sfields ] [ -tn ]
[ -Bfield.macro ] [ filename... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This file documents the GNU version of refer, which is part
of the groff document formatting system. refer copies the
contents of filename... to the standard output, except that
<br>
lines between .[ and .] are interpreted as citations, and
lines between .R1 and .R2 are interpreted as commands about
how citations are to be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each citation specifies a
reference. The citation can specify a reference that is
contained in a bibliographic database by giving a set of
keywords that only that reference con&acirc; <br>
tains. Alternatively it can specify a reference by supplying
a database record in the citation. A combination of these
alternatives is also possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each citation, refer can
produce a mark in the text. This mark consists of some label
which can be separated from the text and from other labels
in various ways. For each <br>
reference it also outputs groff commands that can be used by
a macro package to produce a formatted reference for each
citation. The output of refer must therefore be processed
<br>
using a suitable macro package. The -ms and -me macros are
both suitable. The commands to format a citation&rsquo;s
reference can be output immediately after the citation, or
the <br>
references may be accumulated, and the commands output at
some later point. If the references are accumulated, then
multiple citations of the same reference will produce a
sin&acirc; <br>
gle formatted reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interpretation of lines
between .R1 and .R2 as commands is a new feature of GNU
refer. Documents making use of this feature can still be
processed by Unix refer just by <br>
adding the lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.de R1 <br>
.ig R2 <br>
.. <br>
to the beginning of the document. This will cause troff to
ignore everything between .R1 and .R2. The effect of some
commands can also be achieved by options. These options <br>
are supported mainly for compatibility with Unix refer. It
is usually more convenient to use commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">refer generates .lf lines so
that filenames and line numbers in messages produced by
commands that read refer output will be correct; it also
interprets lines beginning with .lf <br>
so that filenames and line numbers in the messages and .lf
lines that it produces will be accurate even if the input
has been preprocessed by a command such as soelim(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
It is possible to have whitespace between a command line
option and its parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most options are equivalent to
commands (for a description of these commands see the
Commands subsection):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b no-label-in-text;
no-label-in-reference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e accumulate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n no-default-database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C compatible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P move-punctuation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S label &quot;(A.n|Q) &rsquo;,
&rsquo; (D.y|D)&quot;; bracket-label &quot; (&quot; )
&quot;; &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-an reverse An</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfields <br>
capitalize fields</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fn label %n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ifields <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k label L~%a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kfield <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l label A.nD.y%a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lm label A.n+mD.y%a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l,n label A.nD.y-n%a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lm,n label A.n+mD.y-n%a</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pfilename <br>
database filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sspec sort spec</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tn search-truncate n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options are equivalent to
the following commands with the addition that the filenames
specified on the command line are processed as if they were
arguments to the bibliog&acirc; <br>
raphy command instead of in the normal way:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B annotate X AP;
no-label-in-reference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bfield.macro <br>
annotate field macro; no-label-in-reference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options have no
equivalent commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Don&rsquo;t recognize lines
beginning with .R1/.R2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Bibliographic databases <br>
The bibliographic database is a text file consisting of
records separated by one or more blank lines. Within each
record fields start with a % at the beginning of a line.
Each <br>
field has a one character name that immediately follows the
%. It is best to use only upper and lower case letters for
the names of fields. The name of the field should be
fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by exactly one space, and then by the contents of the
field. Empty fields are ignored. The conventional meaning of
each field is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A The name of an author. If the
name contains a title such as Jr. at the end, it should be
separated from the last name by a comma. There can be
multiple occurrences of <br>
the A field. The order is significant. It is a good idea
always to supply an A field or a Q field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B For an article that is part of
a book, the title of the book.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C The place (city) of
publication.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">D The date of publication. The
year should be specified in full. If the month is specified,
the name rather than the number of the month should be used,
but only the first <br>
three letters are required. It is a good idea always to
supply a D field; if the date is unknown, a value such as in
press or unknown can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">E For an article that is part of
a book, the name of an editor of the book. Where the work
has editors and no authors, the names of the editors should
be given as A fields <br>
and , (ed) or , (eds) should be appended to the last
author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">G US Government ordering
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I The publisher (issuer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">J For an article in a journal,
the name of the journal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K Keywords to be used for
searching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">L Label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Journal issue number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">O Other information. This is
usually printed at the end of the reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P Page number. A range of pages
can be specified as m-n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q The name of the author, if the
author is not a person. This will only be used if there are
no A fields. There can only be one Q field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Technical report number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S Series name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Title. For an article in a
book or journal, this should be the title of the
article.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">V Volume number of the journal
or book.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X Annotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all fields except A and E,
if there is more than one occurrence of a particular field
in a record, only the last such field will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If accent strings are used, they
should follow the character to be accented. This means that
the AM macro must be used with the -ms macros. Accent
strings should not be quoted: <br>
use one &nbsp;rather than two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Citations <br>
The format of a citation is <br>
.[opening-text <br>
flags keywords <br>
fields <br>
.]closing-text</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The opening-text, closing-text
and flags components are optional. Only one of the keywords
and fields components need be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keywords component says to
search the bibliographic databases for a reference that
contains all the words in keywords. It is an error if more
than one reference if found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fields components specifies
additional fields to replace or supplement those specified
in the reference. When references are being accumulated and
the keywords component is <br>
non-empty, then additional fields should be specified only
on the first occasion that a particular reference is cited,
and will apply to all citations of that reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The opening-text and
closing-text component specifies strings to be used to
bracket the label instead of the strings specified in the
bracket-label command. If either of these <br>
components is non-empty, the strings specified in the
bracket-label command will not be used; this behaviour can
be altered using the [ and ] flags. Note that leading and
trail&acirc; <br>
ing spaces are significant for these components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flags component is a list of
non-alphanumeric characters each of which modifies the
treatment of this particular citation. Unix refer will treat
these flags as part of the <br>
keywords and so will ignore them since they are
non-alphanumeric. The following flags are currently
recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># This says to use the label
specified by the short-label command, instead of that
specified by the label command. If no short label has been
specified, the normal label <br>
will be used. Typically the short label is used with
author-date labels and consists of only the date and
possibly a disambiguating letter; the # is supposed to be
sug&acirc; <br>
gestive of a numeric type of label.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[ Precede opening-text with the
first string specified in the bracket-label command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">] Follow closing-text with the
second string specified in the bracket-label command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One advantages of using the [
and ] flags rather than including the brackets in
opening-text and closing-text is that you can change the
style of bracket used in the document <br>
just by changing the bracket-label command. Another
advantage is that sorting and merging of citations will not
necessarily be inhibited if the flags are used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a label is to be inserted
into the text, it will be attached to the line preceding the
.[ line. If there is no such line, then an extra line will
be inserted before the .[ <br>
line and a warning will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no special notation for
making a citation to multiple references. Just use a
sequence of citations, one for each reference. Don&rsquo;t
put anything between the citations. <br>
The labels for all the citations will be attached to the
line preceding the first citation. The labels may also be
sorted or merged. See the description of the &lt;&gt; label
expres&acirc; <br>
sion, and of the sort-adjacent-labels and
abbreviate-label-ranges command. A label will not be merged
if its citation has a non-empty opening-text or
closing-text. However, the <br>
labels for a citation using the ] flag and without any
closing-text immediately followed by a citation using the [
flag and without any opening-text may be sorted and merged
even <br>
though the first citation&rsquo;s opening-text or the second
citation&rsquo;s closing-text is non-empty. (If you wish to
prevent this just make the first citation&rsquo;s
closing-text .)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
Commands are contained between lines starting with .R1 and
.R2. Recognition of these lines can be prevented by the -R
option. When a .R1 line is recognized any accumulated
ref&acirc; <br>
erences are flushed out. Neither .R1 nor .R2 lines, nor
anything between them is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands are separated by
newlines or ;s. # introduces a comment that extends to the
end of the line (but does not conceal the newline). Each
command is broken up into words. <br>
Words are separated by spaces or tabs. A word that begins
with &quot; extends to the next &quot; that is not followed
by another &quot;. If there is no such &quot; the word
extends to the end of <br>
the line. Pairs of &quot; in a word beginning with &quot;
collapse to a single &quot;. Neither # nor ; are recognized
inside &quot;s. A line can be continued by ending it with ;
this works <br>
everywhere except after a #.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each command name that is marked
with * has an associated negative command no-name that
undoes the effect of name. For example, the no-sort command
specifies that references <br>
should not be sorted. The negative commands take no
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the following description
each argument must be a single word; field is used for a
single upper or lower case letter naming a field; fields is
used for a sequence of such let&acirc; <br>
ters; m and n are used for a non-negative numbers; string is
used for an arbitrary string; filename is used for the name
of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abbreviate* fields string1
string2 string3 string4 <br>
Abbreviate the first names of fields. An initial letter will
be separated from another initial letter by string1, from
the last name by string2, and <br>
from anything else (such as a von or de) by string3. These
default to a period followed by a space. In a hyphenated
first name, the initial of the <br>
first part of the name will be separated from the hyphen by
string4; this defaults to a period. No attempt is made to
handle any ambiguities that might <br>
result from abbreviation. Names are abbreviated before
sorting and before label construction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">abbreviate-label-ranges* string
<br>
Three or more adjacent labels that refer to consecutive
references will be abbreviated to a label consisting of the
first label, followed by string fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by the last label. This is mainly useful with numeric
labels. If string is omitted it defaults to -.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accumulate* Accumulate
references instead of writing out each reference as it is
encountered. Accumulated references will be written out
whenever a reference of the <br>
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.[ <br>
$LIST$ <br>
.]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is encountered, after all input
files have been processed, and whenever .R1 line is
recognized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">annotate* field string field is
an annotation; print it at the end of the reference as a
paragraph preceded by the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If string is omitted it will
default to AP; if field is also omitted it will default to
X. Only one field can be an annotation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">articles string... string... are
definite or indefinite articles, and should be ignored at
the beginning of T fields when sorting. Initially, the, a
and an are recognized <br>
as articles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bibliography filename... Write
out all the references contained in the bibliographic
databases filename... This command should come last in a
.R1/.R2 block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bracket-label string1 string2
string3 <br>
In the text, bracket each label with string1 and string2. An
occurrence of string2 immediately followed by string1 will
be turned into string3. The <br>
default behaviour is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bracket-label &quot;, &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">capitalize fields Convert fields
to caps and small caps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">compatible* Recognize .R1 and
.R2 even when followed by a character other than space or
newline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">database filename... Search the
bibliographic databases filename... For each filename if an
index filename.i created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will
be searched instead; <br>
each index can cover multiple databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date-as-label* string string is
a label expression that specifies a string with which to
replace the D field after constructing the label. See the
Label expressions subsec&acirc; <br>
tion for a description of label expressions. This command is
useful if you do not want explicit labels in the reference
list, but instead want to handle <br>
any necessary disambiguation by qualifying the date in some
way. The label used in the text would typically be some
combination of the author and date. <br>
In most cases you should also use the no-label-in-reference
command. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">date-as-label D.+yD.y%a*D.-y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would attach a disambiguating
letter to the year part of the D field in the reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default-database* The default
database should be searched. This is the default behaviour,
so the negative version of this command is more useful.
refer determines <br>
whether the default database should be searched on the first
occasion that it needs to do a search. Thus a
no-default-database command must be given <br>
before then, in order to be effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">discard* fields When the
reference is read, fields should be discarded; no string
definitions for fields will be output. Initially, fields are
XYZ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">et-al* string m n Control use of
et al in the evaluation of @ expressions in label
expressions. If the number of authors needed to make the
author sequence unambiguous is <br>
u and the total number of authors is t then the last t-u
authors will be replaced by string provided that t-u is not
less than m and t is not less than <br>
n. The default behaviour is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">et-al &quot; et al&quot; 2 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include filename Include
filename and interpret the contents as commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join-authors string1 string2
string3 <br>
This says how authors should be joined together. When there
are exactly two authors, they will be joined with string1.
When there are more than two <br>
authors, all but the last two will be joined with string2,
and the last two authors will be joined with string3. If
string3 is omitted, it will default <br>
to string1; if string2 is also omitted it will also default
to string1. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join-authors &quot; and &quot;
&quot;, &quot; &quot;, and &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will restore the default method
for joining authors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label-in-reference* When
outputting the reference, define the string [F to be the
reference&rsquo;s label. This is the default behaviour; so
the negative version of this command <br>
is more useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label-in-text* For each
reference output a label in the text. The label will be
separated from the surrounding text as described in the
bracket-label command. This is <br>
the default behaviour; so the negative version of this
command is more useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label string string is a label
expression describing how to label each reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">separate-label-second-parts
string <br>
When merging two-part labels, separate the second part of
the second label from the first label with string. See the
description of the &lt;&gt; label expres&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">move-punctuation* In the text,
move any punctuation at the end of line past the label. It
is usually a good idea to give this command unless you are
using superscripted <br>
numbers as labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reverse* string Reverse the
fields whose names are in string. Each field name can be
followed by a number which says how many such fields should
be reversed. If no <br>
number is given for a field, all such fields will be
reversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search-ignore* fields While
searching for keys in databases for which no index exists,
ignore the contents of fields. Initially, fields XYZ are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">search-truncate* n Only require
the first n characters of keys to be given. In effect when
searching for a given key words in the database are
truncated to the maximum of <br>
n and the length of the key. Initially n is 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short-label* string string is a
label expression that specifies an alternative (usually
shorter) style of label. This is used when the # flag is
given in the citation. <br>
When using author-date style labels, the identity of the
author or authors is sometimes clear from the context, and
so it may be desirable to omit the <br>
author or authors from the label. The short-label command
will typically be used to specify a label containing just a
date and possibly a disambiguating <br>
letter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort* string Sort references
according to string. References will automatically be
accumulated. string should be a list of field names, each
followed by a number, <br>
indicating how many fields with the name should be used for
sorting. + can be used to indicate that all the fields with
the name should be used. Also . <br>
can be used to indicate the references should be sorted
using the (tentative) label. (The Label expressions
subsection describes the concept of a tenta&acirc; <br>
tive label.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort-adjacent-labels* Sort
labels that are adjacent in the text according to their
position in the reference list. This command should usually
be given if the abbreviate- <br>
label-ranges command has been given, or if the label
expression contains a &lt;&gt; expression. This will have no
effect unless references are being accumu&acirc; <br>
lated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Label expressions <br>
Label expressions can be evaluated both normally and
tentatively. The result of normal evaluation is used for
output. The result of tentative evaluation, called the
tentative <br>
label, is used to gather the information that normal
evaluation needs to disambiguate the label. Label
expressions specified by the date-as-label and short-label
commands are <br>
not evaluated tentatively. Normal and tentative evaluation
are the same for all types of expression other than @, *,
and % expressions. The description below applies to normal
<br>
evaluation, except where otherwise specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">field <br>
field n <br>
The n-th part of field. If n is omitted, it defaults to
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&rsquo;string&rsquo; <br>
The characters in string literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@ All the authors joined as
specified by the join-authors command. The whole of each
author&rsquo;s name will be used. However, if the references
are sorted by author (that is <br>
the sort specification starts with A+), then authors&rsquo;
last names will be used instead, provided that this does not
introduce ambiguity, and also an initial subsequence of <br>
the authors may be used instead of all the authors, again
provided that this does not introduce ambiguity. The use of
only the last name for the i-th author of some ref&acirc;
<br>
erence is considered to be ambiguous if there is some other
reference, such that the first i-1 authors of the references
are the same, the i-th authors are not the same, <br>
but the i-th authors&rsquo; last names are the same. A
proper initial subsequence of the sequence of authors for
some reference is considered to be ambiguous if there is a
ref&acirc; <br>
erence with some other sequence of authors which also has
that subsequence as a proper initial subsequence. When an
initial subsequence of authors is used, the remaining <br>
authors are replaced by the string specified by the et-al
command; this command may also specify additional
requirements that must be met before an initial subsequence
can <br>
be used. @ tentatively evaluates to a canonical
representation of the authors, such that authors that
compare equally for sorting purpose will have the same
representa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%n <br>
%a <br>
%A <br>
%i <br>
%I The serial number of the reference formatted according to
the character following the %. The serial number of a
reference is 1 plus the number of earlier references with
<br>
same tentative label as this reference. These expressions
tentatively evaluate to an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr* If there is another
reference with the same tentative label as this reference,
then expr, otherwise an empty string. It tentatively
evaluates to an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr+n <br>
expr-n The first (+) or last (-) n upper or lower case
letters or digits of expr. Troff special characters (such as
&aacute;) count as a single letter. Accent strings are
retained <br>
but do not count towards the total.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.l expr converted to
lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.u expr converted to
uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.c expr converted to caps
and small caps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.r expr reversed so that the
last name is first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.a expr with first names
abbreviated. Note that fields specified in the abbreviate
command are abbreviated before any labels are evaluated.
Thus .a is useful only when you <br>
want a field to be abbreviated in a label but not in a
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.y The year part of
expr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.+y <br>
The part of expr before the year, or the whole of expr if it
does not contain a year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.-y <br>
The part of expr after the year, or an empty string if expr
does not contain a year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr.n The last name part of
expr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1~expr2 <br>
expr1 except that if the last character of expr1 is - then
it will be replaced by expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1 expr2 <br>
The concatenation of expr1 and expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1|expr2 <br>
If expr1 is non-empty then expr1 otherwise expr2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1&amp;expr2 <br>
If expr1 is non-empty then expr2 otherwise an empty
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expr1?expr2:expr3 <br>
If expr1 is non-empty then expr2 otherwise expr3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;expr&gt; The label is in two
parts, which are separated by expr. Two adjacent two-part
labels which have the same first part will be merged by
appending the second part of the <br>
second label onto the first label separated by the string
specified in the separate-label-second-parts command
(initially, a comma followed by a space); the resulting <br>
label will also be a two-part label with the same first part
as before merging, and so additional labels can be merged
into it. Note that it is permissible for the first <br>
part to be empty; this maybe desirable for expressions used
in the short-label command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(expr) The same as expr. Used
for grouping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The above expressions are listed
in order of precedence (highest first); &amp; and | have the
same precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macro interface <br>
Each reference starts with a call to the macro ]-. The
string [F will be defined to be the label for this
reference, unless the no-label-in-reference command has been
given. <br>
There then follows a series of string definitions, one for
each field: string [X corresponds to field X. The number
register [P is set to 1 if the P field contains a range of
<br>
pages. The [T, [A and [O number registers are set to 1
according as the T, A and O fields end with one of the
characters .?!. The [E number register will be set to 1 if
the [E <br>
string contains more than one name. The reference is
followed by a call to the ][ macro. The first argument to
this macro gives a number representing the type of the
reference. <br>
If a reference contains a J field, it will be classified as
type 1, otherwise if it contains a B field, it will type 3,
otherwise if it contains a G or R field it will be type 4,
<br>
otherwise if contains a I field it will be type 2, otherwise
it will be type 0. The second argument is a symbolic name
for the type: other, journal-article, book, article-in- <br>
book or tech-report. Groups of references that have been
accumulated or are produced by the bibliography command are
preceded by a call to the ]&lt; macro and followed by a call
to <br>
the ]&gt; macro.</p>
