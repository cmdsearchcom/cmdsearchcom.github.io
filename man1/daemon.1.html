<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
daemon(1) turns other processes into daemons. There are many
tasks that need to be performed to correctly set up a daemon
process. This can be tedious. daemon performs these <br>
tasks for other processes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The preparatory tasks that
daemon performs for other processes are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; First revoke any
setuid or setgid privileges that daemon may have been
installed with (by system administrators who laugh in the
face of danger).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Process command
line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Change the root
directory if the --chroot option was supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Change the
process uid and gid if the --user option was supplied. Only
root can use this option. Note that the uid of daemon itself
is changed, rather than just changing the <br>
uid of the client process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Read the system
configuration file (/etc/daemon.conf by default, or
specified by the --config option) unless the --noconfig
option was supplied. Then read the user&rsquo;s <br>
configuration file (~/.daemonrc), if any. Generic options
are processed first, then options specific to the daemon
with the given name. Note: The root directory and the user
<br>
must be set before access to the configuration file can be
attempted so neither --chroot nor --user options may appear
in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Disable core
file generation to prevent leaking sensitive information in
daemons run by root (unless the --core option was
supplied).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Become a daemon
process:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If daemon was
not invoked by init(8) or inetd(8):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Background the
process to lose process group leadership.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Start a new
process session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under SVR4,
background the process again to lose process session
leadership. This prevents the process from ever gaining a
controlling terminal. This only happens <br>
when SVR4 is defined and NO_EXTRA_SVR4_FORK is not defined
when libslack(3) is compiled. Before doing this, ignore
SIGHUP because when the session leader terminates, <br>
all processes in the foreground process group are sent a
SIGHUP signal (apparently). Note that this code may not
execute (e.g. when started by init(8) or inetd(8) or <br>
when either SVR4 was not defined or NO_EXTRA_SVR4_FORK was
defined when libslack(3) was compiled). This means that the
client can&rsquo;t make any assumptions about the <br>
SIGHUP handler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Change directory
to the root directory so as not to hamper umounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Clear the umask
to enable explicit file creation modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Close all open
file descriptors. If daemon was invoked by inetd(8), stdin,
stdout and stderr are left open since they are open to a
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Open stdin,
stdout and stderr to /dev/null in case something requires
them to be open. Of course, this is not done if daemon was
invoked by inetd(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the --name
option was supplied, create and lock a file containing the
process id of the daemon process. The presence of this
locked file prevents two instances of a <br>
daemon with the same name from running at the same time. The
standard location of the pidfile is /var/run for root or
/tmp for ordinary users. If the --pidfiles option <br>
was supplied, its argument specifies the directory in which
the pidfile will be placed. If the --pidfile option was
supplied, its argument specifies the name of the <br>
pidfile and the directory in which it will be placed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the --umask
option was supplied, set the umask to its argument.
Otherwise, set the umask to 022 to prevent clients from
accidentally creating group or world writable <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Set the current
directory if the --chdir option was supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Spawn the client
command and wait for it to terminate. The client command may
be specified as command line arguments or as the argument of
the --command option. If both the <br>
--command option and command line arguments are present, the
client command is the result of appending the command line
arguments to the argument of the --command option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the --syslog,
--outlog and/or --errlog options were supplied, the
client&rsquo;s standard output and/or standard error are
captured by daemon and sent to the respective syslog <br>
destinations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; When the client
terminates, daemon respawns it if the --respawn option was
supplied. If the client ran for less than 300 seconds (or
the value of the --acceptable option), <br>
then daemon sees this as an error. It will attempt to
restart the client up to five times (or the value of the
--attempts option) before waiting for 300 seconds (or the
value <br>
of the --delay option). This gives the administrator the
chance to correct whatever is preventing the client from
running without overloading system resources. If the --limit
<br>
option was supplied, daemon terminates after the specified
number of spawn attempt bursts. The default is zero which
means never give up, never surrender.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the client terminates and
the --respawn option wasn&rsquo;t supplied, daemon
terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If daemon
receives a SIGTERM signal, it propagates the signal to the
client and then terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If daemon
receives a SIGUSR1 signal (from another invocation of daemon
supplied with the --restart option), it sends a SIGTERM
signal to the client. If started with the <br>
--respawn option, the client process will be restarted after
it is killed by the SIGTERM signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If the
--foreground option was supplied, the client process is run
as a foreground process and is not turned into a daemon. If
daemon is connected to a terminal, so will the <br>
client process. If daemon is not connected to a terminal but
the client needs to be connected to a terminal, use the
--pty option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h, --help <br>
Display a help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display a version message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[level], --verbose[=level]
<br>
Set the message verbosity level to level (or 1 if level is
not supplied). daemon does not have any verbose messages so
this has no effect unless the --running option is <br>
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d[level], --debug[=level] <br>
Set the debug message level to level (or 1 if level is not
supplied). Level 1 traces high level function calls. Level 2
traces lower level function calls and shows <br>
configuration information. Level 3 adds environment
variables. Level 9 adds every return value from select(2) to
the output. Debug messages are sent to the destination <br>
specified by the --dbglog option (by default, the syslog(3)
facility, daemon.debug).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C path, --config=path <br>
Specify the configuration file to use. By default,
/etc/daemon.conf is the configuration file if it exists and
is not group or world writable and does not exist in a group
or <br>
world writable directory. The configuration file lets you
predefine options that apply to all clients and to
specifically named clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --noconfig <br>
Bypass the system configuration file, /etc/daemon.conf. Only
the user&rsquo;s ~/.daemonrc configuration file will be read
(if it exists).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name, --name=name <br>
Create and lock a pid file (/var/run/name.pid), ensuring
that only one daemon with the given name is active at the
same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X cmd, --command=cmd <br>
Specify the client command as an option. If a command is
specified along with its name in the configuration file,
then daemons can be started merely by mentioning their
name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">daemon --name ftumpch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Specifying the client
command in the configuration file means that no shell
features are available (i.e. no meta characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P /dir, --pidfiles=/dir <br>
Override the standard pidfile location. The standard pidfile
location is user dependent: root&rsquo;s pidfiles live in
/var/run. Normal users&rsquo; pidfiles live in /tmp. This
option <br>
can only be used with the --name option. Use this option if
these locations are unacceptable but make sure you
don&rsquo;t forget where you put your pidfiles. This option
is best <br>
used in configuration files or in shell scripts, not on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F /path, --pidfile=/path <br>
Override the standard pidfile name and location. The
standard pidfile location is described immediately above.
The standard pidfile name is the argument of the --name
option <br>
followed by .pid. Use this option if the standard pidfile
name and location are unacceptable but make sure you
don&rsquo;t forget where you put your pidfile. This option
should <br>
only be used in configuration files or in shell scripts, not
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user[:[group]],
--user=user[:[group]] <br>
Run the client as a different user (and group). This only
works for root. If the argument includes a :group specifier,
daemon will assume the specified group and no other. <br>
Otherwise, daemon will assume all groups that the specified
user is in. For backwards compatibility, &quot;.&quot; may
be used instead of &quot;:&quot; to separate the user and
group but since <br>
&quot;.&quot; may appear in user and group names,
ambiguities can arise such as using --user=u.g with users u
and u.g and group g. With such an ambiguity, daemon will
assume the user u <br>
and group g. Use --user=u.g: instead for the other
interpretation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R path, --chroot=path <br>
Change the root directory to path before running the client.
On some systems, only root can do this. Note that the path
to the client program and to the configuration file <br>
(if any) must be relative to the new root path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D path, --chdir=path <br>
Change the directory to path before running the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m umask, --umask=umask <br>
Change the umask to umask before running the client. umask
must be a valid octal mode. The default umask is 022.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e var=val, --env=var=val <br>
Set an environment variable for the client process. This
option can be used any number of times. If it is used, only
the supplied environment variables are passed to the <br>
client process. Otherwise, the client process inherits the
current set of environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --inherit <br>
Explicitly inherit environment variables. This is only
needed when the --env option is used. When this option is
used, the --env option adds to the inherited environment,
<br>
rather than replacing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U, --unsafe <br>
Allow reading an unsafe configuration file and execution of
an unsafe executable. A configuration file or executable is
unsafe if it is group or world writable or is in a <br>
directory that is group or world writable (following
symbolic links). If an executable is a script interpreted by
another executable, then it is considered unsafe if the <br>
interpreter is unsafe. If the interpreter is /usr/bin/env
(with an argument that is a command name to be searched for
in $PATH), then that command must be safe. By default, <br>
daemon(1) will refuse to read an unsafe configuration file
or to execute an unsafe executable when run by root. This
option overrides that behaviour and hence should never be
<br>
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --safe <br>
Deny reading an unsafe configuration file and execution of
an unsafe executable. By default, daemon(1) will allow
reading an unsafe configuration file and execution of an
<br>
unsafe executable when run by ordinary users. This option
overrides that behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --core <br>
Allow the client to create a core file. This should only be
used for debugging as it could lead to security holes in
daemons run by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --respawn <br>
Respawn the client when it terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a #, --acceptable=# <br>
Specify the minimum acceptable duration in seconds of a
client process. The default value is 300 seconds. It cannot
be set to less than 10 seconds except by root when used in
<br>
conjunction with the --idiot option. This option can only be
used with the --respawn option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">less than this, it is considered
to have failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A #, --attempts=# <br>
Number of attempts to spawn before delaying. The default
value is 5. It cannot be set to more than 100 attempts
except by root when used in conjunction with the --idiot
<br>
option. This option can only be used with the --respawn
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L #, --delay=# <br>
Delay in seconds between each burst of spawn attempts. The
default value is 300 seconds. It cannot be set to less than
10 seconds except by root when used in conjunction with <br>
the --idiot option. This option can only be used with the
--respawn option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M #, ---limit=# <br>
Limit the number of spawn attempt bursts. The default value
is zero which means no limit. This option can only be used
with the --respawn option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--idiot <br>
Turn on idiot mode in which daemon will not enforce the
minimum or maximum values normally imposed on the
--acceptable, --attempts and --delay option arguments. The
--idiot <br>
option must appear before any of these options. Only the
root user may use this option because it can turn a slight
misconfiguration into a lot of wasted CPU effort and log
<br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --foreground <br>
Run the client in the foreground. The client is not turned
into a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p[noecho], --pty[=noecho] <br>
Connect the client to a pseudo terminal. This option can
only be used with the --foreground option. This is the
default when the --foreground option is supplied and
daemon&rsquo;s <br>
standard input is connected to a terminal. This option is
only necessary when the client process must be connected to
a controlling terminal but daemon itself has been run <br>
without a controlling terminal (e.g. from cron(8) or a
pipeline).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the noecho argument is
supplied with this option, the client&rsquo;s side of the
pseudo terminal will be set to noecho mode. Use this only if
there really is a terminal involved <br>
and input is being echoed twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l spec, --errlog=spec <br>
Send daemon&rsquo;s standard output and error to the syslog
destination or file specified by spec. If spec is of the
form &quot;facility.priority&quot;, then output is sent to
syslog(3). <br>
Otherwise, output is appended to the file whose path is
given in spec. By default, output is sent to daemon.err.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b spec, --dbglog=spec <br>
Send daemon&rsquo;s debug output to the syslog destination
or file specified by spec. If spec is of the form
&quot;facility.priority&quot;, then output is sent to
syslog(3). Otherwise, <br>
output is appended to the file whose path is given in spec.
By default, output is sent to daemon.debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o spec, --output=spec <br>
Capture the client&rsquo;s standard output and error and
send it to the syslog destination or file specified by spec.
If spec is of the form &quot;facility.priority&quot;, then
output is <br>
sent to syslog(3). Otherwise, output is appended to the file
whose path is given in spec. By default, output is discarded
unless the --foreground option is present. In this <br>
case, the client&rsquo;s stdout and stderr are propagated to
daemon&rsquo;s stdout and stderr respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O spec, --stdout=spec <br>
Capture the client&rsquo;s standard output and send it to
the syslog destination or file specified by spec. If spec is
of the form &quot;facility.priority&quot;, then output is
sent to <br>
syslog(3). Otherwise, stdout is appended to the file whose
path is given in spec. By default, stdout is discarded
unless the --foreground option is present, in which case,
<br>
the client&rsquo;s stdout is propagated to daemon&rsquo;s
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E spec, --stderr=spec <br>
Capture the client&rsquo;s standard error and send it to the
syslog destination specified by spec. If spec is of the form
&quot;facility.priority&quot;, then stderr is sent to
syslog(3). <br>
Otherwise, stderr is appended to the file whose path is
given in spec. By default, stderr is discarded unless the
--foreground option is present, in this case, the
client&rsquo;s <br>
stderr is propagated to daemon&rsquo;s stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--running <br>
Check whether or not a named daemon is running, then exit(3)
with EXIT_SUCCESS if the named daemon is running or
EXIT_FAILURE if it isn&rsquo;t. If the --verbose option is
<br>
supplied, print a message before exiting. This option can
only be used with the --name option. Note that the --chroot,
--user, --name, --pidfiles and --pidfile (and possibly <br>
--config) options must be the same as for the target daemon.
Note that the --running option must appear before any
--pidfile or --pidfiles option when checking if another <br>
user&rsquo;s daemon is running otherwise you might get an
error about the pidfile directory not being writable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restart <br>
Instruct a named daemon to terminate and restart its client
process. This option can only be used with the --name
option. Note that the --chroot, --user, --name, --pidfiles
<br>
and --pidfile (and possibly --config) options must be the
same as for the target daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stop <br>
Stop a named daemon then exit(3). This option can only be
used with the --name option. Note that the --chroot, --user,
--name, --pidfiles and --pidfile (and possibly <br>
--config) options must be the same as for the target
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As with all other programs, a --
argument signifies the end of options. Any options that
appear on the command line after -- are part of the client
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/daemon.conf, ~/.daemonrc - define default options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line of the configuration
file consists of a client name or &rsquo;*&rsquo;, followed
by whitespace, followed by a comma separated list of
options. Blank lines and comments (&rsquo;#&rsquo; to end
<br>
of the line) are ignored. Lines may be continued with a
&rsquo;&acute; character at the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*
errlog=daemon.err,output=local0.err,core <br>
test1 syslog=local0.debug,debug=9,verbose=9,respawn <br>
test2 syslog=local0.debug,debug=9,verbose=9,respawn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line options are
processed first to look for a --config option. If no
--config option was supplied, the default file,
/etc/daemon.conf, is used. If the user has their <br>
own configuration file (~/.daemonrc) it is also used. If the
configuration files contain any generic (&rsquo;*&rsquo;)
entries, their options are applied in order of appearance.
If the <br>
--name option was supplied and the configuration files
contain any entries with the given name, their options are
then applied in order of appearance. Finally, the command
line <br>
options are applied again. This ensures that any generic
options apply to all clients by default. Client specific
options override generic options. User options override
system <br>
wide options. Command line options override everything
else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the configuration
files are not opened and read until after any --chroot
and/or --user command line options are processed. This means
that the configuration file paths <br>
and the client&rsquo;s file path must be relative to the
--chroot argument. It also means that the configuration
files and the client executable must be readable/executable
by the user <br>
specified by the --user argument. It also means that the
--chroot and --user options must not appear in the
configuration file. Also note that the --name must not
appear in the <br>
configuration file either.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If you specify (in a configuration file) that all clients
allow core file generation, there is no way to countermand
that for any client (without using an alternative <br>
configuration file). So don&rsquo;t do that. The same
applies to respawning and foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible for the client
process to obtain a controlling terminal under BSD. If
anything calls open(2) on a terminal device without the
O_NOCTTY flag, the process doing so <br>
will obtain a controlling terminal and then be susceptible
to unintended termination by a SIGHUP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients run in the foreground
with a pseudo terminal don&rsquo;t respond to job control
(i.e. suspending with Control-Z doesn&rsquo;t work). This is
because the client belongs to an orphaned <br>
process group (it starts in its own process session) so the
kernel won&rsquo;t send it SIGSTOP signals. However, if the
client is a shell that supports job control, it&rsquo;s
subprocesses <br>
can be suspended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clients can only be restarted if
they were started with the --respawn option. Using --restart
on a non-respawning daemon client is equivalent to using
--stop.</p>
