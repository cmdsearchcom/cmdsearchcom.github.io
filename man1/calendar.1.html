<p>CALENDAR(1) BSD General Commands Manual CALENDAR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
calendar &acirc; reminder service</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
calendar [-abw] [-A num] [-B num] [-l num] [-e num] [-f
calendarfile] [-t [[[cc]yy]mm]dd]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The calendar utility checks the current directory or the
directory specified by the CALENDAR_DIR environment variable
for a file named calendar and displays lines that begin with
<br>
either today&rsquo;s date or tomorrow&rsquo;s. On Fridays,
events on Friday through Monday are displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A num Print lines from today
and next num days (forward, future). Defaults to one. (same
as -l)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Process the
&acirc;calendar&acirc; files of all users and mail the
results to them. This requires superuser privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B num Print lines from today
and previous num days (backward, past).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Enforce special date
calculation mode for Cyrillic calendars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l num Print lines from today
and next num days (forward, future). Defaults to one. (same
as -A)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e num Print lines from today
and next num days, only if today is Friday (forward,
future). Defaults to two, which causes calendar to print
entries through the weekend on Fridays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f calendarfile <br>
Use calendarfile as the default calendar file. If this file
is not accessible, the system-wide default is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t [[[cc]yy]mm]dd <br>
Act like the specified value is &acirc;today&acirc; instead
of using the current date. If yy is specified, but cc is
not, a value for yy between 69 and 99 results in a cc value
of 19. <br>
Otherwise, a cc value of 20 is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Print day of the week name in
front of each event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To handle calendars in your
national code table you can specify
&acirc;LANG=&lt;locale_name&gt;&acirc; in the calendar file
as early as possible. To handle national Easter names in the
calendars, <br>
&acirc;Easter=&lt;national_name&gt;&acirc; (for Catholic
Easter) or &acirc;Paskha=&lt;national_name&gt;&acirc; (for
Orthodox Easter) can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A special locale name exists:
&acirc;utf-8&acirc;. Specifying &acirc;LANG=utf-8&acirc;
indicates that the dates will be read using the C locale,
and the descriptions will be encoded in UTF-8. This is <br>
usually used for the distributed calendar files. The
&acirc;CALENDAR&acirc; variable can be used to specify the
style. Only &acirc;Julian&acirc; and &acirc;Gregorian&acirc;
styles are currently supported. Use <br>
&acirc;CALENDAR=&acirc; to return to the default
(Gregorian).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enforce special date
calculation mode for Cyrillic calendars you should specify
&acirc;LANG=&lt;local_name&gt;&acirc; and
&acirc;BODUN=&lt;bodun_prefix&gt;&acirc; where
&lt;local_name&gt; can be ru_RU.UTF-8, uk_UA.UTF-8 <br>
or by_BY.UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the locale is reset to
the user&rsquo;s default for each new file that is read.
This is so that locales from one file do not accidentally
carry over into another file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other lines should begin with a
month and day. They may be entered in almost any format,
either numeric or as character strings. If proper locale is
set, national months and <br>
weekdays names can be used. A single asterisk
(&lsquo;*&rsquo;) matches every month. A day without a month
matches that day of every week. A month without a day
matches the first of that <br>
month. Two numbers default to the month followed by the day.
Lines with leading tabs default to the last entered date,
allowing multiple line specifications for a single date.
<br>
&acirc;Easter&acirc; (may be followed by a positive or
negative integer) is Easter for this year.
&acirc;Paskha&acirc; (may be followed by a positive or
negative integer) is Orthodox Easter for this <br>
year. Weekdays may be followed by &acirc;-4&acirc; ...
&acirc;+5&acirc; (aliases last, first, second, third,
fourth) for moving events like &acirc;the last Monday in
April&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By convention, dates followed by
an asterisk (&acirc;*&acirc;) are not fixed, i.e., change
from year to year.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Day descriptions start after the
first &lt;tab&gt; character in the line; if the line does
not contain a &lt;tab&gt; character, it isn&rsquo;t printed
out. If the first character in the line is a <br>
&lt;tab&gt; character, it is treated as the continuation of
the previous description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The calendar file is
preprocessed by cpp(1), allowing the inclusion of shared
files such as company holidays or meetings. If the shared
file is not referenced by a full pathname, <br>
cpp(1) searches in the current (or home) directory first,
and then in the directory /etc/calendar, and finally in
/usr/share/calendar. Empty lines and lines protected by the
C <br>
commenting syntax (/* ... */) are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some possible calendar entries
(a sequence denotes a &lt;tab&gt; character):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARDS <br>
The calendar program previously selected lines which had the
correct date anywhere in the line. This is no longer true:
the date is only recognized when it occurs at the beginning
<br>
of a line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The calendar command will only display lines that use a
&lt;tab&gt; character to separate the date and description,
or that begin with a &lt;tab&gt;. This is different than in
previous <br>
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Fl t flag argument syntax is
from the original FreeBSD calendar program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l and -e flags are
Debian-specific enhancements. Option -e used to be called in
Debian, but this option is now used differently by upstream.
Also, the original calendar pro&acirc; <br>
gram did not accept 0 as an argument to the -A flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &acirc;utf-8&acirc; as a
locale name is a Debian-specific enhancement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
A calendar command appeared in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
calendar doesn&rsquo;t handle all Jewish holidays or moon
phases.</p>
