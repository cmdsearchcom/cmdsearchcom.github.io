<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SAOimage is a utility for displaying astronomical images
which runs under the X11 window environment. Image files can
be read directly, or image data may be passed through a <br>
named pipe (Unix) or a mailbox (VMS) from IRAF display
tasks. SAOimage provides a large selection of options for
zooming, panning, scaling, coloring, pixel readback, display
<br>
blinking, and region specification. User interactions are
generally performed with the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SAOimage desktop includes, a
main image display window, a button menu panel, a display
magnifier, a pan and zoom reference image, and a color bar.
A color table graph window <br>
can be brought up by clicking on the color bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WORLD COORDINATE SYSTEMS <br>
saoimage tracks world coordinate systems as well as pixel
coordinates within the image, if WCS information is present.
Several single character keyboard commands have been <br>
added. c prints the world coordinate (RA and Dec as
hh:mm:ss.sss dd:mm:ss.ss and Lat Long as dd.ddddd dd.ddddd)
and image pixel coordinate, along with the value of that
pixel to <br>
standard output. w executes the command set by -wcscom,
substituting that same world coordinate string for %s. b
prints the world coordinate RA and Dec in the FK4/B1950
system. <br>
j prints the world coordinate RA and Dec in the FK5/J2000
system. g prints the world coordinates as galactic longitude
and latitude. e prints the world coordinates as ecliptic
<br>
longitude and latitude. i prints the world coordinates as
the image header defines them. h toggles between degrees and
sexigesimal units for RA and Dec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-blue Set the color of all graphics to be blue. Some
inexpensive systems use a monochrome monitor connected to
one of the three color outputs on the computer. That color
must <br>
be specified to make the graphics visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-bordercolor colorname <br>
Specify the color of all subwindow borders. The color name
must be a recognized X color (there are many). This is a
style issue. -bc may be used instead of -bordercolor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-byteswap <br>
Switch the bytes order between big-endian and little-endian
order. This may be needed where data has been copied from
another machine or if there is some confusion about <br>
the FITS file format. This switch toggles the previous
setting. -bswap may be used instead of -byteswap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-coord <br>
Set the coordinate tracking state initially on or off. In
coordinate tracking, the coordinates of the mouse and value
of the pixel under it are printed in the upper-left <br>
text area, above the main display window. +/-ct can be used
instead of +/-coord.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display nodename:0.0 <br>
Specify the name of the X display server. This makes it
possible to run the SAOimage program on a machine other than
the one connected to your display screen, with no dif&acirc;
<br>
ference in appearance or use. By default, SAOimage gets the
server name from the DISPLAY environment variable. See the
xhost manual page for more details. The display <br>
server cannot be changed once SAOimage is running. -display
may be abbreviated -d.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dfits <br>
Image file is a FITS file (see -fits), but in unexpected
byteswapped order. The FITS standard is not swapped, but
some naive VAX applications may swap it (see -bswap).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fbconfig filename <br>
Specify an alternate frame buffer configuration file for use
with IRAF. By default, the file installed with SAOimage
(/usr/local/lib/imtoolrc) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fits Image file is a FITS file.
If the image filename ends in .fits, this switch is not
necessary. Only T=SIMPLE array types are supported. The
header BITPIX card must be 8 <br>
(unsigned byte), 16 (signed short), 32 (signed int), -32
(float), -64 (double), or -16 (unsigned short). (The last
two are not recognized standards). IEEE floats are not <br>
converted if that is not the machine format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fk4 If WCS information is
available in the image header, track the cursor in FK4/B1950
right ascension and declination as well as pixel
coordinates. These coordinates, fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by B1950 will be fed to an external program if the w
command is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fk5 If WCS information is
available in the image header, track the cursor in FK5/J2000
right ascension and declination as well as pixel
coordinates. These coordinates, fol&acirc; <br>
lowed by J2000 will be fed to an external program if the w
command is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gal If WCS information is
available in the image header, track the cursor in galactic
longitude and latitude as well as pixel coordinates. These
coordinates, followed by ga&acirc; <br>
lactic will be fed to an external program if the w command
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gd geometry <br>
Specify the size of the image display subwindow and/or the
screen position of SAOimage. The format is a standard X
geometry statement. This switch works like -geometry, <br>
except that width and height (if given) are applied to the
display subwindow. The overall SAOimage window is sized
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-geometry geometry <br>
Specify the size and/or the screen position of SAOimage. The
format is a standard X geometry statement. Both size and
position may be specified, or only the size or the <br>
position. Width and height refer to the dimensions of
SAOimage&rsquo;s desktop window (see -gd for sizing just the
image display window). +x and +y refer to the upper left
cor&acirc; <br>
ner in screen coordinates. -x positions the right edge from
the right edge of the screen. -y would positions the lower
edge from the bottom of the screen. Width and <br>
height below a minimum size are defaulted to the minimum.
Specifying the default minimum size (-geometry 0x0) also
triggers SAOimage to use smaller dimensions for its <br>
internal windows. Once SAOimage is running, use the window
manager&rsquo;s normal size and move mechanisms to make
adjustments to SAOimage&rsquo;s main window. -geometry may
be <br>
abbreviated -g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-green <br>
Set the color of all graphics to be green. See -blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-histeq may be abbreviated -hi.
<br>
Set the scaling mode for histogram equalization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-horizgraph <br>
Use a horizontal auxiliary color graph window, with a color
bar along the bottom. See -vertgraph. -hg can be used as a
shorthand for -horizgraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i2 width height <br>
Image file is a signed short integer array file of the given
dimensions. If the file is square and has no added padding,
the dimensions are not necessary. -shortarray <br>
width height has the same function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i4 width height <br>
Image file is a signed long integer array file of the given
dimensions. If the file is square and has no added padding,
the dimensions are not necessary. -longarray width <br>
height has the same function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-idev pipename <br>
Specify the name of the named pipe used for listening. The
default is /dev/imt1o, which is the default used by IRAF.
See -odev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-imtool <br>
Open/close the named input pipe connection and wait for
input from IRAF. When open, SAOimage emulates IRAF&rsquo;s
imtool. IRAF&rsquo;s image loading and cursor read-back
functions <br>
are supported. Unlike imtool, SAOimage has only one frame
buffer; IRAF&rsquo;s frame buffer numbers are ignored.
Listening on the pipe is possible even while reading image
<br>
files directly. The connection may be opened, closed, or
re-opened at any time. When supported, the default mode is
commonly to start with the IRAF connection open. See <br>
-idev, -odev, and -pros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lfrac [fraction of histogram
numerical peak] <br>
Set the linear scaling limits to the values where the pixel
value distribution is at a given fraction of its peak</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-linear <br>
Set the scaling mode to linear.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log [exponent for exponential
curve] <br>
Set the scaling mode to log (exponential), and set the
exponent for the curve function e sup n if given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lowerleft <br>
First pixel in file represents the lower left of the image,
assuming the lines of input run left to right on the screen.
This is the IRAF standard and the SAOimage <br>
default. See -rotate, -upperleft, and -zero. -lowerleft may
be abbreviated -ll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lprbuttons <br>
Include the button menu in the hardcopy image (only on color
workstations). The default on color workstations includes
the area above the button panel, but excludes the <br>
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mag magnification <br>
Set the magnification factor of the magnifier. This factor
relates the magnifier to the magnification of the display
window. The default is 4; the magnifier magnifies the <br>
image to 4 times the magnification of the main display
window (but never less than zoom 1 of the original
data).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-magnifier <br>
Set the magnifier tracking state initially on or off. With
magnifier tracking, the magnifier window is continuously
updated to show a magnification of the image the image <br>
under the mouse. +/-mt can be used instead of
+/-magnifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-max [max val] <br>
Set the maximum for the image value range used to compute
scaling. The default is to take the maximum from the image
shown in the display window. -max with no value <br>
resets the default. If the maximum value in the displayed
image is lower than the given maximum, the image&rsquo;s
maximum vale is used for the scaling range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-min [min val] <br>
Set the minimum for the image value range used to compute
scaling. The default is to take the minimum from the image
shown in the display window. -min with no value <br>
resets the default. If the minimum value in the displayed
image is higher than the given minimum, the image&rsquo;s
minimum vale is used for the scaling range.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mtf Give the button panel a
chiseled look popularized by HP&rsquo;s widget set. This
appearance may contrast less with other applications being
used at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-name filename <br>
This switch is only needed if the filename starts with a
number or might otherwise be recognized as a switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-odev pipename <br>
Specify the name of the named pipe used for sending
feedback. The default is /dev/imt1i, which is the default
used by IRAF. See -idev.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-oif Image file is an IRAF image
header file in OIF format. If the image filename ends in
.imh, this switch is not necessary. IRAF STF and QPOE
formats are not supported. <br>
Complex data cannot be handled. The data must have at least
2 dimensions. Only the first plane of multidimensional
images is read. The data file is read directly by <br>
SAOimage (see -imtool and -pros).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-one The file coordinate of the
first pixel is (1,1). The real coordinates of the center of
the first pixel are (1.0,1.0). This is the IRAF standard and
the default for SAOim&acirc; <br>
age. The second pixel is (2,1). See -zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-palette number <br>
Specify the number of read/write color cells to reserve. On
color workstations, SAOimage reserves color cells in the
default colormap for its own use. SAOimage reserves <br>
as many color cells as it can get, up to the number given
(the default is 200). If the number given is negative,
SAOimage comes up in overlay mode, using 1/2 + 2 of the <br>
color cells for overlays and graphics. In verbose mode (see
-verbose), SAOimage tells you how many cells it is able to
use for display colors. This number can be re- <br>
entered at run-time, unless -palette 1 is given, in which
case SAOimage stays in halftone mode. -p is an acceptable
shorthand for -palette.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-panboxav | -panboxsum |
-panboxsamp | -panboxmax <br>
These switches select the kind of image reduction used to
fit a picture of the entire image into the pan window. Each
pixel is computed from a block of image pixels by <br>
averaging, summing, sampling, or taking the maximum. The
default is to show the maximum from each block. When zooming
in the main display involves reduction, subsampling <br>
is always used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pros Virtually identical to the
+imtool switch. The difference occurs when the user writes
the saved regions to a disk file. imtool emulation includes
writing only an IRAF <br>
list file giving center coordinates only. With -pros,
SAOimage&rsquo;s normal region descriptor file will be
written in place of the simpler list file. One may switch
between <br>
this mode and +imtool, or close the IRAF connection with
-imtool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet <br>
Disable verbose mode;-q may also be used. See -verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r4 width height <br>
Image file is a real*4 array file of the given dimensions.
If the file is square and has no added padding, the
dimensions are not necessary. -floatarray width height has
<br>
the same function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r8 width height <br>
Image file is a real*8 array file of the given dimensions.
If the file is square and has no added padding, the
dimensions are not necessary. -doublearray width height has
<br>
the same function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-red Set the color of all
graphics to be red. See -blue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rmax [max val] <br>
Set maximum value for reading from the image file. This
value is used as the maximum value when images are
pre-scaled to fit the 16 bit (signed short) working
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rmin [min val] <br>
Set minimum value for reading from the image file. This
value is used as the minimum value when images are
pre-scaled to fit the 16 bit (signed short) working
buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rotate 1,2,or 3 <br>
Rotate the image 90, 180, or 270 degrees (respectively)
before displaying it. Rotation is applied after conversion
to a lower left coordinate system (-ll) if such
conver&acirc; <br>
sion is also requested. This is useful for images when the
CCD was not mounted North-up. -rot can be used as a
shorthand for -rotate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scalebias scale bias <br>
The data in the image file should be scaled and biased to
get the true image value (TrueValue = (scale * FileValue) +
bias). This cannot be used with the -fits image type <br>
(scale and bias are in the FITS header), nor with -imtool or
-pros (they are passed by IRAF). -sb is a shorthand for
-scalebias.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-skip bytes <br>
Skip over the given number of bytes at the head of the file
before reading data. This is used to skip header information
or the first image if two images are stored in <br>
one file. -header and -sk are aliases for -skip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sqrt [inverse of exponent for
geometric curve] <br>
Set the scaling function to square root (geometric), and set
the inverse of the exponent for the x sup {1/n} curve, if
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u1 width height <br>
Image file is an unsigned byte array file of the given
dimensions. If the file is square and has no added padding,
the dimensions are not necessary. -chararray width <br>
height has the same function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u2 width height <br>
Image file is a unsigned short integer array file of the
given dimensions. If the file is square and has no added
padding, the dimensions are not necessary. -ushortarray <br>
width height has the same function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-upperleft <br>
First pixel in file represents the upper left of the image,
assuming the lines of input run left to right on the screen
(see -rotate and -lowerleft). This switch does not <br>
override IRAF WCS image coordinates. -upperleft may be
abbreviated -ul.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+/-verbose <br>
Set verbose mode on or off. In verbose mode, informative
statements are printed to the terminal window when various
actions are taken. The default mode is to be verbose. <br>
+/-v can be used instead of +/-verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vertgraph <br>
Use a vertical auxiliary color graph window, with a color
bar along the left side. See -horizgraph. -vg can be used as
a shorthand for -vertgraph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wcscom [format for command to
be executed] <br>
Set the command to be executed when the w key is struck,
where the world coordinates are substituted for %s in the
string. Underscores should be used instead of spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wrap [number of wraps within
scaling range] <br>
Set the scaling mode to wrapped linear, and set the number
of wraps for this mode, if given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zero The file coordinate of the
first pixel is (0,0). The real coordinates of the center of
the first pixel are (0.5,0.5) which makes the very edge
(0,0). This is the standard <br>
coordinate system for image displays, but not the default
for SAOimage. The second pixel is indexed (1,0). See
-one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zf zoom factor <br>
Zoom the initial display of the image by zoom factor. A
number larger than one makes the image larger by that
factor, using that many display pixels per image pixel. A
<br>
fractional zoom factor displays that the image with that
fraction of a display pixel per image pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
Refer to the SAOimage User Manual for detailed descriptions
of all functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most control actions take place
within the context of a mode. Modes are selected by clicking
on menu buttons in the top row of the button panel. Each
menu mode brings up its <br>
own submenu buttons (the lower row in the button panel) for
mode specific selections. Actions and submodes are selected
by clicking on buttons in the submenu row of the menu <br>
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mouse controls specific
functions in both the main display window and the pan/zoom
window. In the main display window, the function of the
mouse is determined by the mode <br>
and submode selections from the button menu. The function
can also be recognized by the appearance of the mouse
pointer icon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The button interface is designed
to be user friendly. The user is encouraged to try any and
all buttons to become familiar with their functions. To
exit, use the QUIT button in <br>
the etc submenu (click on etc, then click on QUIT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reading images <br>
To read an image directly from a file, give its name
anywhere on the command line. The -name switch is needed
only when the image file name could be mistaken for a number
or <br>
switch. SAOimage recognizes the .fits and .imh filename
suffixes as belonging to FITS and IRAF OIF files. All other
file types must be specified by an appropriate file type
<br>
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raw array file types must be
specified by an array data type switch (-u1, -u2, -i2, -i4,
-r4, -r8) followed by width and height dimensions. To skip
over a file header, use the <br>
-sk switch followed by the number of bytes. This can also be
used to skip over entire images, if more than one are stored
in the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use with IRAF <br>
To emulate imtool and communicate with IRAF tasks, use
either the -imtool or -pros switch. The two switches
indicate which file format to use in recording saved cursors
or <br>
regions. With -imtool, an IRAF list file containing only
center coordinates is used (like that of imtool). With
-pros, a file containing a full description of the saved
cursors <br>
and their dimensions is used. The latter file can be read by
tasks in the IRAF PROS spatial package for making image
masks and performing image analyses. Both file types are
<br>
ASCII and can be read and edited by the user. In either
case, the file is not actually written until the user clicks
on the write button in the region submenu. Both file types
<br>
can be read back to reproduce the saved cursors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New command input <br>
A new command line can be entered at any time, by selecting
the new button in the etc submenu or striking the N key on
the keyboard. This allows the user to read in new images,
<br>
change in and out of -imtool or pros mode, set new scaling
parameters, or change the number of reserved display color
cells. Most command line switches (except -d, -g, -gd, <br>
-red, -green, -blue, and -vertgraph) will be accepted at any
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a new command line is
requested, the previous command line is presented in an
emacs-like popup editor for editing. Ctrl-N clears the
previous line. Striking the RETURN key <br>
enters the line in the popup window as the new command.
Ctrl-C returns with no action taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the mouse <br>
Most mouse interactions are based on mouse dragging (holding
a button down while moving the mouse). The user should try
clicking and/or dragging the mouse in each subwindow to <br>
become familiar with its functions. Modes selected in the
button panel determine the response to the mouse buttons in
the main display window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Scale mode, the mouse buttons
control blinking of displays (saved by clicking with the
same mouse button in the blink submenu button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Color mode, mouse dragging
stretches and shifts the color map as per the contrast/bias,
threshold/saturation, and gamma submenu selections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the color graph window, color
table vertexes may be added or moved by clicking or dragging
with the LEFT (red), MIDDLE (green), or RIGHT (blue) mouse
buttons. The graph will <br>
update continuously only if tracking is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Cursor mode, the mouse
controls the size and locations of cursors. The rule is:
LEFT button for position, MIDDLE button for size, and RIGHT
button for angle or deletion <br>
(depending on the cursor).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cursors <br>
For box and ellipse cursors, MIDDLE button sizing is
restricted depending on whether dragging started on a side
or near a corner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the point cursor, the LEFT
and MIDDLE buttons save the current mouse pointer position
with a + or - indication, while the RIGHT button deletes
saved points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the polygon cursor, the
MIDDLE button adds or moves a single vertex, while the RIGHT
button will delete vertexes. The LEFT button moves the whole
polygon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When annuli is set for a box,
circle, or ellipse cursor, the MIDDLE button adds or resizes
an annulus, while the RIGHT button deletes annuli.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For manipulating cursors, the
ovlay selection in the Color submenu, enables the cursor to
track smoothly as an overlay graphic. The region submenu
button brings up another sub&acirc; <br>
menu with selections to display, review, and edit the saved
regions, and read from or write to disk files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pan and zoom <br>
In Pan mode, and in the pan window (regardless of mode), the
LEFT button selects the center of the image, while the
MIDDLE button selects the edge of the display, zoomed from
the <br>
given center. When either function is dragged, the rectangle
in the pan window shows the area that would appear in the
display when the button is released.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys <br>
In the cursor mode, the S and E keys, save the current
cursor in a region list, while the D and DELETE keys can be
used to forget a region. At any time, with the pointer in
the <br>
display or pan windows, the T key prints a table of pixel
values at the pointer position to stdout. The 4 arrow keys
can be used for fine movement of the pointer in any window.
<br>
The SHIFT and SHIFT LOCK keys will reverse the magnifier
window, color graph window and coordinate tracking status.
The N key summons the pop-up editor for new command input.
<br>
The A key raises and redraws all of SAOimage&rsquo;s
windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
