<p>CWEB(1) General Commands Manual CWEB(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ctangle, cweave - translate CWEB to C and/or TeX</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ctangle [-bhp] [+s] webfile[.w] [{changefile[.ch]|-}
[outfile[.c]]] <br>
cweave [-befhpx] [+s] webfile[.w] [{changefile[.ch]|-}
[outfile[.tex]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ctangle program converts a CWEB source document into a C
program that may be compiled in the usual way. The output
file includes #line specifications so that debugging can
<br>
be done in terms of the CWEB source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cweave program converts the
same CWEB file into a TeX file that may be formatted and
printed in the usual way. It takes appropriate care of
typographic details like page <br>
layout and the use of indentation, italics, boldface, etc.,
and it supplies extensive cross-index information that it
gathers automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CWEB allows you to prepare a
single document containing all the information that is
needed both to produce a compilable C program and to produce
a well-formatted document <br>
describing the program in as much detail as the writer may
desire. The user of CWEB ought to be familiar with TeX as
well as C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line should have
one, two, or three names on it. The first is taken as the
CWEB file (and .w is added if there is no extension). If
that file cannot be opened, the <br>
extension .web is tried instead. (But .w is recommended,
since .web usually implies Pascal.) If there is a second
name, it is a change file (and .ch is added if there is no
<br>
extension). The change file overrides parts of the WEB file,
as described in the documentation. If there is a third name,
it overrides the default name of the output file, <br>
which is ordinarily the same as the name of the input file
(but on the current directory) with the extension .c or
.tex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options in the command line may
be either turned off with - (if they are on by default) or
turned on with + (if they are off by default). In fact, the
options are processed from <br>
left to right, so a sequence like -f +f corresponds to +f
(which is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -b option suppresses the
banner line that normally appears on your terminal when
ctangle or cweave begins. The -h option suppresses the happy
message that normally appears <br>
if the processing was successful. The -p option suppresses
progress reports (starred module numbers) as the processing
takes place. If you say -bhp, you get nothing but error <br>
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The +s option prints statistics
about memory usage at the end of a run (assuming that the
programs have been compiled with the -DSTAT switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three other options
applicable to cweave only: -f means do not force a newline
after every statement in the formatted output. -e inhibits
the enclosure of C material <br>
formatted by cweave in brackets PB{...}. Such brackets are
normally inserted so that special hooks can be used by
cweb-latex and similar programs. -x means omit the index and
<br>
table of contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable CWEBINPUTS is used to search for
the input files, or the system default if CWEBINPUTS is not
set. See tex(1) for the details of the searching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The location of the files mentioned below varies from system
to system. Use the kpsewhich utility to find their
locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cwebmac.tex <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Don Knuth wrote WEB for TeX and Pascal. Silvio Levy designed
and developed CWEB by adapting the WEB conventions to C and
by recoding everything in CWEB. Knuth began using CWEB <br>
and made further refinements. Many other helpers are
acknowledged in the CWEB manual.</p>
