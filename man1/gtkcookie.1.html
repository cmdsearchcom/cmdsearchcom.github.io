<b>gtkcookie</b> supports the command flags common to all Gtk applications.
  There are no <b>gtkcookie</b>-specific flags.

On startup, <b>gtkcookie</b> will try to find your Netscape cookie file by
  looking for <b>~/.netscape/cookies</b>. If <b>~/.netscape/cookies</b> is
  found, <b>gtkcookie</b> will load the file and show it in a multi-column list.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Opening_a_cookie_file"><a class="selflink" href="#Opening_a_cookie_file">Opening
  a cookie file</a></h2>
Regardless of whether <b>gtkcookie</b> finds your cookie file, or you have to
  open it manually, when you open the file, all of your Netscape cookies are
  displayed in whatever order Netscape wrote them into the file.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Sorting_a_cookie_file"><a class="selflink" href="#Sorting_a_cookie_file">Sorting

You can sort the cookies by any column by clicking on the heading for that
  column.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Human-readable_dates"><a class="selflink" href="#Human-readable_dates">Human-readable
  dates</a></h2>
The final column is actually not stored in your cookie file, but is a
  translation of Netscape's native date field. Netscape stores the date as the
  number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 (familiar to anyone who's spent any time on
  Unix), but <b>gtkcookie</b> translates those dates into human-readable expiry
  dates in the final column.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Editing_cookies"><a class="selflink" href="#Editing_cookies">Editing
  cookies</a></h2>
To edit a cookie, double-click on the cookie, and a cookie edit dialogue will
  pop up. You'll notice that the date, in seconds since the epoch (the epoch is
  1 Jan 1970), is not an editable field, whereas the human-readable date is.
  Follow the format presented in the edit dialogue box, and as you edit the
  human-readable date, the expiry date in seconds since the epoch will update
  itself. Please note (as repeated in the bugs section below) that although
  dates later than 2038 are supposed to present problems, (you'll see the date
  in seconds since the epoch become -1) dates on or after 2036 seem to present
  problems. I'm still looking into this.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Searching_for_text_strings"><a class="selflink" href="#Searching_for_text_strings">Searching
  for text strings</a></h2>
Under the <b>Edit</b> menu, select <b>Find</b>. Type in a string or substring
  that you wish to find, and press the <b>Find</b> button. If the string or
  substring is found anywhere in a cookie, that cookie will become selected, and
  the view will scroll to that cookie, if necessary. Pressing <b>Find</b> again
  will search for the next instance, or pop up a &quot;not found&quot; dialogue
  box if the string wasn't found. In its current version, <b>gtkcookie</b> isn't
  yet smart enough to re-start a search from the top of the cookie list, so if
  you need to search from the top, hightlight the first cookie, and then do your
  search.

Right click on a cookie, and select &quot;Delete&quot; from the popup menu, or

Press the &quot;Create Cookie&quot; button. A cookie with dummy values will be
  added to the cookie list, and the &quot;Edit Cookie&quot; dialogue box will
  pop up so that you can edit the new cookie to your liking. Note that even if
  you press &quot;Cancel&quot; immediately after creating a new cookie, the new
  cookie, with its dummy values, will still be in the list. You'll have to
  delete the cookie manually.

1. The &quot;Edit Cookie&quot; dialogue has problems with on-the-fly conversion
  of human-readable dates to the number of seconds since the epoch for dates
  later than 2036. For some reason, despite the fact that the date is supposed
  to overflow in 2038, the C function strptime flubs up the conversion for dates
  larger than 1036.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unfortunately, this means that when you edit a cookie whose expiry date is after
  2036, the edit dialogue box shows the number of seconds since the epoch as -1.
  There is currently no workaround to this problem, besides moving the date back
  2 years.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
2. Although the &quot;find&quot; feature is supposed to always highlight and
  scroll to any found item, sometimes, the item becomes highlighted, but is
  outside the current view.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
3. The file open and save dialogues don't show directories beginning with a dot
  (such as <b>.netscape</b>!) but typing such directory names manually will
  work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
4. Double-clicking in the scroll bar will pop up the &quot;Edit Cookie&quot;
  dialogue box for the currently highlighted cookie.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
5. Editing the cookie file while Netscape is running is futile, because Netscape
  will re-write the cookie file when you exit Netscape, based on what's in its
  memory, not what's in the cookie file. A popup menu in my programme warns you
  of a running netscape... unless you're running Netscape 4.5. Netscape 4.5
  doesn't seem to create the same lock file that earlier Netscapes used to.
