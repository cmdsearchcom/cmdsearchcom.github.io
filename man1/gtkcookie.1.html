<p>gtkcookie(1) General Commands Manual gtkcookie(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gtkcookie - edit Netscape cookie file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gtkcookie [ Gtk options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Options <br>
gtkcookie supports the command flags common to all Gtk
applications. There are no gtkcookie-specific flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What happens at startup <br>
On startup, gtkcookie will try to find your Netscape cookie
file by looking for ~/.netscape/cookies. If
~/.netscape/cookies is found, gtkcookie will load the file
and show it in <br>
a multi-column list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Opening a cookie file <br>
Regardless of whether gtkcookie finds your cookie file, or
you have to open it manually, when you open the file, all of
your Netscape cookies are displayed in whatever order
Net&acirc; <br>
scape wrote them into the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sorting a cookie file <br>
You can sort the cookies by any column by clicking on the
heading for that column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Human-readable dates <br>
The final column is actually not stored in your cookie file,
but is a translation of Netscape&rsquo;s native date field.
Netscape stores the date as the number of seconds since 1
Jan <br>
1970 (familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s spent any time on
Unix), but gtkcookie translates those dates into
human-readable expiry dates in the final column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing cookies <br>
To edit a cookie, double-click on the cookie, and a cookie
edit dialogue will pop up. You&rsquo;ll notice that the
date, in seconds since the epoch (the epoch is 1 Jan 1970),
is not an <br>
editable field, whereas the human-readable date is. Follow
the format presented in the edit dialogue box, and as you
edit the human-readable date, the expiry date in seconds
<br>
since the epoch will update itself. Please note (as repeated
in the bugs section below) that although dates later than
2038 are supposed to present problems, (you&rsquo;ll see the
date <br>
in seconds since the epoch become -1) dates on or after 2036
seem to present problems. I&rsquo;m still looking into
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching for text strings <br>
Under the Edit menu, select Find. Type in a string or
substring that you wish to find, and press the Find button.
If the string or substring is found anywhere in a cookie,
that <br>
cookie will become selected, and the view will scroll to
that cookie, if necessary. Pressing Find again will search
for the next instance, or pop up a &quot;not found&quot;
dialogue box <br>
if the string wasn&rsquo;t found. In its current version,
gtkcookie isn&rsquo;t yet smart enough to re-start a search
from the top of the cookie list, so if you need to search
from the top, <br>
hightlight the first cookie, and then do your search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deleting cookies <br>
Right click on a cookie, and select &quot;Delete&quot; from
the popup menu, or click on the cookie and press
&quot;Del&quot; on your keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating cookies <br>
Press the &quot;Create Cookie&quot; button. A cookie with
dummy values will be added to the cookie list, and the
&quot;Edit Cookie&quot; dialogue box will pop up so that you
can edit the new cookie <br>
to your liking. Note that even if you press
&quot;Cancel&quot; immediately after creating a new cookie,
the new cookie, with its dummy values, will still be in the
list. You&rsquo;ll have to <br>
delete the cookie manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.netscape/cookies <br>
The Netscape cookie file in your home directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
1. The &quot;Edit Cookie&quot; dialogue has problems with
on-the-fly conversion of human-readable dates to the number
of seconds since the epoch for dates later than 2036. For
some reason, <br>
despite the fact that the date is supposed to overflow in
2038, the C function strptime flubs up the conversion for
dates larger than 1036.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately, this means that
when you edit a cookie whose expiry date is after 2036, the
edit dialogue box shows the number of seconds since the
epoch as -1. There is currently <br>
no workaround to this problem, besides moving the date back
2 years.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Although the &quot;find&quot;
feature is supposed to always highlight and scroll to any
found item, sometimes, the item becomes highlighted, but is
outside the current view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. The file open and save
dialogues don&rsquo;t show directories beginning with a dot
(such as .netscape!) but typing such directory names
manually will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Double-clicking in the scroll
bar will pop up the &quot;Edit Cookie&quot; dialogue box for
the currently highlighted cookie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Editing the cookie file while
Netscape is running is futile, because Netscape will
re-write the cookie file when you exit Netscape, based on
what&rsquo;s in its memory, not what&rsquo;s <br>
in the cookie file. A popup menu in my programme warns you
of a running netscape... unless you&rsquo;re running
Netscape 4.5. Netscape 4.5 doesn&rsquo;t seem to create the
same lock file <br>
that earlier Netscapes used to.</p>
