<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
iverilog is a compiler that translates Verilog source code
into executable programs for simulation, or other netlist
formats for further processing. The currently supported
tar&acirc; <br>
gets are vvp for simulation, and fpga for synthesis. Other
target types are added as code generators are
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
iverilog accepts the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Bbase The iverilog program uses
external programs and configuration files to preprocess and
compile the Verilog source. Normally, the path used to
locate these tools is built <br>
into the iverilog program. However, the -B switch allows the
user to select a different set of programs. The path given
is used to locate ivlpp, ivl, code generators and <br>
the VPI modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cfile -ffile <br>
These flags specify an input file that contains a list of
Verilog source files. This is similar to the command file of
other Verilog simulators, in that it is a file that <br>
contains the file names instead of taking them on the
command line. See Command Files below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dmacro Defines macro macro with
the string &lsquo;1&rsquo; as its definition. This form is
normally only used to trigger ifdef conditionals in the
Verilog source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dmacro=defn <br>
Defines macro macro as defn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Pparameter=value <br>
Override (i.e. defparam) a parameter in a root module. This
allows the user to override at compile time (defparam) a
parameter in a root module instance. For example, <br>
-Pmain.foo=2 overrides the parameter foo in the root
instance main with the value 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dname Activate a class of
compiler debugging messages. The -d switch may be used as
often as necessary to activate all the desired messages.
Supported names are scopes, <br>
eval_tree, elaborate, and synth2; any other names are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Preprocess the Verilog
source, but do not compile it. The output file is the
Verilog input, but with file inclusions and macro references
expanded and removed. This is <br>
useful, for example, to preprocess Verilog source for use by
other compilers.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g1995|-g2001|-g2001-noconfig|-g2005|-g2005-sv|-g2009|-g2012
<br>
Select the Verilog language generation to support in the
compiler. This selects between IEEE1364-1995, IEEE1364-2001,
IEEE1364-2005, IEEE1800-2005, IEEE1800-2009, or <br>
IEEE1800-2012. Icarus Verilog currently defaults to the
IEEE1364-2005 generation of the language. This flag is used
to restrict the language to a set of keywords/fea&acirc;
<br>
tures, this allows simulation of older Verilog code that may
use newer keywords and for compatibility with other tools.
Much of the IEEE1800 generations functionality is <br>
not currently supported. The IEEE1800 generations do parse
all the keywords, so they can be used to verify that
IEEE1364 compliant Verilog code does not use any of the <br>
new IEEE1800 keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gverilog-ams|-gno-verilog-ams
<br>
Enable or disable (default) support for Verilog-AMS. Very
little Verilog-AMS specific functionality is currently
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gspecify|-gno-specify <br>
Enable or disable (default) specify block support. When
enabled, specify block code is elaborated. When disabled,
specify blocks are parsed but ignored. Specify blocks <br>
are commonly not needed for RTL simulation, and in fact can
hurt performance of the simulation. However, disabling
specify blocks reduces accuracy of full-timing simula&acirc;
<br>
tions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstd-include|-gno-std-include
<br>
Enable (default) or disable the search of a standard
installation include directory after all other explicit
include directories. This standard include directory is a
<br>
convenient place to install standard header files that a
Verilog program may include.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-grelative-include|-gno-relative-include
<br>
Enable or disable (default) adding the local files directory
to the beginning of the include file search path. This
allows files to be included relative to the current <br>
file not the more common files are only found in the working
directory or in the specified include file search path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gxtypes|-gno-xtypes <br>
Enable (default) or disable support for extended types.
Enabling extended types allows for new types that are
supported by Icarus Verilog as extensions beyond the
base&acirc; <br>
line Verilog. It may be necessary to disable extended types
if compiling code that clashes with the few new keywords
used to implement the type system.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gio-range-error|-gno-io-range-error
<br>
The standards requires that a vectored port have matching
ranges for its port declaration as well as any net/register
declaration. It was common practice in the past to <br>
only specify the range for the net/register declaration and
some tools still allow this. By default any mismatch is
reported as a error. Using -gno-io-range-error will <br>
produce a warning instead of a fatal error for the case of a
vectored net/register and a scalar port declaration.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstrict-ca-eval|-gno-strict-ca-eval
<br>
The standard requires that if any input to a continuous
assignment expression changes value, the entire expression
is re-evaluated. By default, parts of the expression <br>
that do not depend on the changed input value(s) are not
re-evaluated. If an expression contains a call to a function
that doesn&rsquo;t depend solely on its input values or <br>
that has side effects, the resulting behavior will differ
from that required by the standard. Using -gstrict-ca-eval
will force standard compliant behavior (with some <br>
loss in performance).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gstrict-expr-width|-gno-strict-expr-width
<br>
Enable or disable (default) strict compliance with the
standard rules for determining expression bit lengths. When
disabled, the RHS of a parameter assignment is evalu&acirc;
<br>
ated as a lossless expression, as is any expression
containing an unsized constant number, and unsized constant
numbers are not truncated to integer width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Iincludedir <br>
Append directory includedir to list of directories searched
for Verilog include files. The -I switch may be used many
times to specify several directories to search, the <br>
directories are searched in the order they appear on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mpath This is equivalent to
-Mall=path. Preserved for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Mmode=path <br>
Write into the file specified by path a list of files that
contribute to the compilation of the design. If mode is all
or prefix, this includes files that are included by <br>
include directives and files that are automatically loaded
by library support as well as the files explicitly specified
by the user. If mode is include, only files that <br>
are included by include directives are listed. If mode is
module, only files that are specified by the user or that
are automatically loaded by library support are <br>
listed. The output is one file name per line, with no
leading or trailing space. If mode is prefix, files that are
included by include directives are prefixed by &quot;I
&quot; and <br>
other files are prefixed by &quot;M &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mmodule <br>
Add this module to the list of VPI modules to be loaded by
the simulation. Many modules can be specified, and all will
be loaded, in the order specified. The system mod&acirc;
<br>
ule is implicit and always included. If a System Function
Table file (&lt;module&gt;.sft) exists for the module it
will be loaded automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Npath This is used for
debugging the compiler proper. Dump the final netlist form
of the design to the specified file. It otherwise does not
affect operation of the compiler. <br>
The dump happens after the design is elaborated and
optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename <br>
Place output in the file filename. If no output file name is
specified, iverilog uses the default name a.out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-pflag=value <br>
Assign a value to a target specific flag. The -p switch may
be used as often as necessary to specify all the desired
flags. The flags that are used depend on the target <br>
that is selected, and are described in target specific
documentation. Flags that are not used are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Synthesize. Normally, if the
target can accept behavioral descriptions the compiler will
leave processes in behavioral form. The -S switch causes the
compiler to perform <br>
synthesis even if it is not necessary for the target. If the
target type is a netlist format, the -S switch is
unnecessary and has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s topmodule <br>
Specify the top level module to elaborate. Icarus Verilog
will by default choose modules that are not instantiated in
any other modules, but sometimes that is not suffi&acirc;
<br>
cient, or instantiates too many modules. If the user
specifies one or more root modules with -s flags, then they
will be used as root modules instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tmin|typ|max <br>
Use this switch to select min, typ or max times from
min:typ:max expressions. Normally, the compiler will simply
use the typ value from these expressions (printing a <br>
warning for the first ten it finds) but this switch will
tell the compiler explicitly which value to use. This will
suppress the warning that the compiler is making a <br>
choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ttarget <br>
Use this switch to specify the target output format. See the
TARGETS section below for a list of valid output
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Turn on verbose messages.
This will print the command lines that are executed to
perform the actual compilation, along with version
information from the various compo&acirc; <br>
nents, as well as the version of the product as a whole. You
will notice that the command lines include a reference to a
key temporary file that passes information to <br>
the compiler proper. To keep that file from being deleted at
the end of the process, provide a file name of your own in
the environment variable IVERILOG_ICONFIG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the selected target is vvp,
the -v switch is appended to the shebang line in the
compiler output file, so directly executing the compiler
output file will turn on ver&acirc; <br>
bose messages in vvp. This extra verbosity can be avoided by
using the vvp command to indirectly execute the compiler
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the version of the
compiler, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wclass Turn on different
classes of warnings. See the WARNING TYPES section below for
descriptions of the different warning groups. If multiple -W
switches are used, the warning <br>
set is the union of all the requested classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ylibdir <br>
Append the directory to the library module search path. When
the compiler finds an undefined module, it looks in these
directories for files with the right name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ysuffix <br>
Add suffix to the list of accepted file name suffixes used
when searching a library for cells. The list defaults to the
single entry .v.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODULE LIBRARIES <br>
The Icarus Verilog compiler supports module libraries as
directories that contain Verilog source files. During
elaboration, the compiler notices the instantiation of
undefined <br>
module types. If the user specifies library search
directories, the compiler will search the directory for
files with the name of the missing module type. If it finds
such a <br>
file, it loads it as a Verilog source file, they tries again
to elaborate the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Library module files should
contain only a single module, but this is not a requirement.
Library modules may reference other modules in the library
or in the main design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TARGETS <br>
The Icarus Verilog compiler supports a variety of targets,
for different purposes, and the -t switch is used to select
the desired target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">null The null target causes no
code to be generated. It is useful for checking the syntax
of the Verilog source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vvp This is the default. The vvp
target generates code for the vvp runtime. The output is a
complete program that simulates the design but must be run
by the vvp command. The <br>
-pfileline=1 option can be used to add procedural statement
debugging opcodes to the generated code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fpga This is a synthesis target
that supports a variety of fpga devices, mostly by EDIF
format output. The Icarus Verilog fpga code generator can
generate complete designs or <br>
EDIF macros that can in turn be imported into larger designs
by other tools. The fpga target implies the synthesis -S
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vhdl This target produces a VHDL
translation of the Verilog netlist. The output is a single
file containing VHDL entities corresponding to the modules
in the Verilog source <br>
code. Note that only a subset of the Verilog language is
supported. See the wiki for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING TYPES <br>
These are the types of warnings that can be selected by the
-W switch. All the warning types (other than all) can also
be prefixed with no- to turn off that warning. This is most
<br>
useful after a -Wall argument to suppress isolated warning
types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all This enables the
anachronisms, implicit, portbind, select-range, timescale,
and sensitivity-entire-array warning categories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">anachronisms <br>
This enables warnings for use of features that have been
deprecated or removed in the selected generation of the
Verilog language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implicit <br>
This enables warnings for creation of implicit declarations.
For example, if a scalar wire X is used but not declared in
the Verilog source, this will print a warning at <br>
its first use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">portbind <br>
This enables warnings for ports of module instantiations
that are not connected but probably should be. Dangling
input ports, for example, will generate a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">select-range <br>
This enables warnings for constant out of bound selects.
This includes partial or fully out of bound selects as well
as a select containing a &rsquo;bx or &rsquo;bz in the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timescale <br>
This enables warnings for inconsistent use of the timescale
directive. It detects if some modules have no timescale, or
if modules inherit timescale from another file. <br>
Both probably mean that timescales are inconsistent, and
simulation timing can be confusing and dependent on
compilation order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">infloop This enables warnings
for always statements that may have runtime infinite loops
(has paths with no or zero delay). This class of warnings is
not included in -Wall and <br>
hence does not have a no- variant. A fatal error message
will always be printed when the compiler can determine that
there will definitely be an infinite loop (all paths <br>
have no or zero delay).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you suspect an always
statement is producing a runtime infinite loop use this flag
to find the always statements that need to have their logic
verified. It is <br>
expected that many of the warnings will be false positives,
since the code treats the value of all variables and signals
as indeterminate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensitivity-entire-vector <br>
This enables warnings for when a part select within an
&quot;always @*&quot; statement results in the entire vector
being added to the implicit sensitivity list. Although this
be&acirc; <br>
haviour is prescribed by the IEEE standard, it is not what
might be expected and can have performance implications if
the vector is large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensitivity-entire-array <br>
This enables warnings for when a word select within an
&quot;always @*&quot; statement results in the entire array
being added to the implicit sensitivity list. Although this
be&acirc; <br>
haviour is prescribed by the IEEE standard, it is not what
might be expected and can have performance implications if
the array is large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSTEM FUNCTION TABLE FILES <br>
If the source file name as a .sft suffix, then it is taken
to be a system function table file. A System function table
file is used to describe to the compiler the return types
<br>
for system functions. This is necessary because the compiler
needs this information to elaborate expressions that contain
these system functions, but cannot run the sizetf
func&acirc; <br>
tions since it has no run-time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the table is
ASCII, one function per line. Empty lines are ignored, and
lines that start with the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character are
comment lines. Each non-comment line starts with <br>
the function name, then the vpi type (i.e. vpiSysFuncReal).
The following types are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpiSysFuncReal <br>
The function returns a real/realtime value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpiSysFuncInt <br>
The function returns an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vpiSysFuncSized &lt;wid&gt;
&lt;signed|unsigned&gt; <br>
The function returns a vector with the given width, and is
signed or unsigned according to the flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND FILES <br>
The command file allows the user to place source file names
and certain command line switches into a text file instead
of on a long command line. Command files can include C or
<br>
C++ style comments, as well as # comments, if the # starts
the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file name <br>
A simple file name or file path is taken to be the name of a
Verilog source file. The path starts with the first
non-white-space character. Variables are substituted in <br>
file names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c cmdfile -f cmdfile <br>
A -c or -f token prefixes a command file, exactly like it
does on the command line. The cmdfile may be on the same
line or the next non-comment line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y libdir <br>
A -y token prefixes a library directory in the command file,
exactly like it does on the command line. The parameter to
the -y flag may be on the same line or the next <br>
non-comment line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables in the libdir are
substituted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+incdir+includedir <br>
The +incdir+ token in command files gives directories to
search for include files in much the same way that -I flags
work on the command line. The difference is that mul&acirc;
<br>
tiple +includedir directories are valid parameters to a
single +incdir+ token, although you may also have multiple
+incdir+ lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variables in the includedir are
substituted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+libext+ext <br>
The +libext token in command files fives file extensions to
try when looking for a library file. This is useful in
conjunction with -y flags to list suffixes to try in <br>
each directory before moving on to the next library
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+libdir+dir <br>
This is another way to specify library directories. See the
-y flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+libdir-nocase+dir <br>
This is like the +libdir statement, but file names inside
the directories declared here are case insensitive. The
missing module name in a lookup need not match the file <br>
name case, as long as the letters are correct. For example,
&quot;foo&quot; matches &quot;Foo.v&quot; but not
&quot;bar.v&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+define+NAME=value <br>
The +define+ token is the same as the -D option on the
command line. The value part of the token is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+parameter+NAME=value <br>
The +parameter+ token is the same as the -P option on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+timescale+value <br>
The +timescale+ token is used to set the default timescale
for the simulation. This is the time units and precision
before any &lsquo;timescale directive or after a
&lsquo;resetall <br>
directive. The default is 1s/1s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+toupper-filename <br>
This token causes file names after this in the command file
to be translated to uppercase. This helps with situations
where a directory has passed through a DOS machine, <br>
and in the process the file names become munged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+tolower-filename <br>
This is similar to the +toupper-filename hack described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+integer-width+value <br>
This allows the programmer to select the width for integer
variables in the Verilog source. The default is 32, the
value can be any desired integer value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+width-cap+value <br>
This allows the programmer to select the width cap for
unsized expressions. If the calculated width for an unsized
expression exceeds this value, the compiler will issue <br>
a warning and limit the expression width to this value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VARIABLES IN COMMAND FILES <br>
In certain cases, iverilog supports variables in command
files. These are strings of the form &quot;$(varname)&quot;
or &quot;${varname}&quot;, where varname is the name of the
environment variable <br>
to read. The entire string is replaced with the contents of
that variable. Variables are only substituted in contexts
that explicitly support them, including file and directory
<br>
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Variable values come from the
operating system environment, and not from preprocessor
defines elsewhere in the file or the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PREDEFINED MACROS <br>
The following macros are predefined by the compiler:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__ICARUS__ = 1 <br>
This is always defined when compiling with Icarus
Verilog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">__VAMS_ENABLE__ = 1 <br>
This is defined if Verilog-AMS is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
These examples assume that you have a Verilog source file
called hello.v in the current directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compile hello.v to an
executable file called a.out:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iverilog hello.v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compile hello.v to an
executable file called hello:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iverilog -o hello hello.v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To compile and run explicitly
using the vvp runtime:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iverilog -ohello.vvp -tvvp
hello.v</p>
