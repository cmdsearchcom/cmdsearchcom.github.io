<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tiffmakemosaic - splits one or more TIFF file into mosaic(s)
(set(s) <br>
of TIFF or JPEG files smaller than a chosen size that would
reproduce <br>
the original file if glued together)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
tiffmakemosaic [options] file1.tif [file2.tif...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
tiffmakemosaic takes one or more single-image TIFF files and
creates, for each one of these, a mosaic (if needed). A
mosaic is a set of TIFF files that would reproduce the
origi&acirc; <br>
nal image if glued together (e.g. with ImageMagick or
GraphicsMagick&rsquo;s montage command). Unless an explicit
dimension is requested, all pieces of a mosaic have the same
width <br>
and length and these dimensions are submultiples of the
original image&rsquo;s dimensions. They are chosen so that
each piece of the mosaic is smaller than a given size.
Therefore, <br>
even if the original image is huge and wouldn&rsquo;t fit
into the computer&rsquo;s memory, which prevents it to be
opened by most software, the pieces will be small enough to
be opened eas&acirc; <br>
ily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A mosaic is produced as soon as
the full provided image doesn&rsquo;t meet the requirements
of needed memory to open (option -M below), width, or size
(option -g below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If requested, it will add some
overlap to the adjacent pieces (either of a fixed amount of
pixels, or of a percentage of the pieces&rsquo; width resp.
length, will appear on two <br>
pieces if they share a common border).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names given to the output
files that contain the pieces are created by adding the row
and column numbers of the piece after the name of the
original image and before the <br>
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCES <br>
In principle, generating pieces from a large TIFF file can
also be achieved with several tools, as tiffcrop,
ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick (one has to first compute and
specify <br>
explicitly the dimensions and positions of the pieces,
though). However, most of the programs start with opening
and deciphering the whole image either in memory or in a
huge <br>
temporary file on the disk, which makes them quite slow, and
often unable to complete the task by lack of memory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast, tiffmakemosaic
avoids opening the whole image, which yields speedup and
guarantees successful termination of the process even on
computers with modest memory. Eg. to <br>
make a mosaic of 64 JPEG files requesting less than 512 MiB
of memory to open from a RGB image of 103168x63232 pixels,
on a computer with 16 GiB of RAM and an i5 CPU,
tiffmakemo&acirc; <br>
saic needs 2.5 minutes while GraphicsMagick needs 70
minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Do not report TIFF errors or
warnings. Under Windows, they are reported with noisy dialog
boxes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M &lt;size in MiB&gt; <br>
Dimensions of the pieces of each mosaic will be computed so
that no more than the specified amount of memory will be
required to open one of them. Defaults to 1024 MiB = 1 <br>
GiB = 1073741824 bytes. A value of zero means no limit on
the dimensions to achieve a goal of memory requirement (but
there may be other limits, e.g. the installed memory <br>
in the computer during production of the mosaic).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m [width divisor in
pixels]x[length divisor in pixels] <br>
If either dimension is provided, the pieces of the mosaic
will be integer multiples of this dimension. If a divisor is
zero or is not provided, this option adds no con&acirc; <br>
strain on the corresponding piece dimension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, -m 8x0 will
require that the width of the pieces be a multiple of 8
pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g [width in pixels]x[length in
pixels] <br>
If either dimension is provided, the pieces of the mosaic
will have exactly this dimension (ignoring the -m option if
present), except perhaps for the last piece of each <br>
row or the last piece of each column if the dimension is not
an exact divisor of the corresponding dimension of the full
image. If a dimension is zero or is not provided, <br>
it is replaced with the largest value which is compatible
with the memory limit (option -M) and divides the
corresponding full image dimension by a power of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -M 2048 -g x200
will require pieces of length exactly 200 pixels (but the
pieces in the last row at the bottom of the image may be
shorter) and width equal to <br>
W/2^n where W is the width of the full image and 2^n is the
largest integer power of 2 such that a piece of size W/2^n x
200 pixels requires less than 2048 MiB of memory <br>
to open.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O &lt;number of pixels |
fraction%&gt; <br>
The adjacent pieces will overlap by that amount: if the
border of a piece is not on a outer border of the full
image, then the piece will be extended in the corresponding
<br>
direction by the requested amount. If the amount is given in
percent (a decimal number between 0 and 100 included,
followed by the &lsquo;%&rsquo; symbol), the overlap amount
will be <br>
the corresponding fraction of the piece&rsquo;s width (if
overlapping across a vertical border) resp. length
(horizontal border). Horizontal and vertical overlaps can be
differ&acirc; <br>
ent. If the amount is given as a number of pixels (must be a
nonnegative decimal integer number), the overlap amount will
be the specified amount, disregarding the actual <br>
dimensions of the pieces. However, the overlap will be
truncated down to a piece&rsquo;s width resp. length if it
would be larger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, produced mosaics
have no overlap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j[#] Requests output of JPEG
files rather than the default TIFF. Optional number # in the
range 0 to 100 indicates wanted JPEG quality (default is
75).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If several of -j and -c options
are given, only the last one takes effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;method&gt;[:opt[:opt]...]
<br>
Requests output of TIFF files compressed with method. Method
can be &lsquo;none&rsquo; for no compression,
&lsquo;jpeg&rsquo;, &lsquo;lzw&rsquo;, &lsquo;zip&rsquo;...
as provided by the LibTIFF library (see libtiff <br>
(3TIFF)). By default, the same compression as in the input
TIFF file is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Method-specific details of the
wished compression can be specified by adding one or several
group of characters starting with a colon &lsquo;:&rsquo;
after the methods&rsquo;s name, as <br>
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG method: <br>
:# set compression quality level as in option -j (see
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LZW, Deflate (zip) and LZMA2
options: <br>
:# set predictor value <br>
:p# set compression level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, -c lzw:2 to get
LZW-encoded data with horizontal differencing, -c zip:3:p9
for Deflate encoding with maximum compression level and
floating point predictor, <br>
-c jpeg:r:50 for JPEG-encoded RGB data at quality 50%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If several of -j and -c options
are given, only the last one takes effect.</p>
