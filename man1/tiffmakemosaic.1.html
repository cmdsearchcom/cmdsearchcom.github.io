tiffmakemosaic takes one or more single-image TIFF files and creates, for each
  one of these, a mosaic (if needed). A mosaic is a set of TIFF files that would
  reproduce the original image if glued together (e.g. with ImageMagick or
  GraphicsMagick's montage command). Unless an explicit dimension is requested,
  all pieces of a mosaic have the same width and length and these dimensions are
  submultiples of the original image's dimensions. They are chosen so that each
  piece of the mosaic is smaller than a given size. Therefore, even if the
  original image is huge and wouldn't fit into the computer's memory, which
  prevents it to be opened by most software, the pieces will be small enough to
  be opened easily.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A mosaic is produced as soon as the full provided image doesn't meet the
  requirements of needed memory to open (option -M below), width, or size
  (option -g below).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If requested, it will add some overlap to the adjacent pieces (either of a fixed
  amount of pixels, or of a percentage of the pieces' width resp. length, will
  appear on two pieces if they share a common border).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names given to the output files that contain the pieces are created by
  adding the row and column numbers of the piece after the name of the original
  image and before the extension.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PERFORMANCES"><a class="selflink" href="#PERFORMANCES">PERFORMANCES</a></h1>
In principle, generating pieces from a large TIFF file can also be achieved with
  several tools, as tiffcrop, ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick (one has to first
  compute and specify explicitly the dimensions and positions of the pieces,
  though). However, most of the programs start with opening and deciphering the
  whole image either in memory or in a huge temporary file on the disk, which
  makes them quite slow, and often unable to complete the task by lack of
  memory.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In contrast, tiffmakemosaic avoids opening the whole image, which yields speedup
  and guarantees successful termination of the process even on computers with
  modest memory. Eg. to make a mosaic of 64 JPEG files requesting less than 512
  MiB of memory to open from a RGB image of 103168x63232 pixels, on a computer
  with 16 GiB of RAM and an i5 CPU, tiffmakemosaic needs 2.5 minutes while
  GraphicsMagick needs 70 minutes.

      zero means no limit on the dimensions to achieve a goal of memory
      requirement (but there may be other limits, e.g. the installed memory in
      the computer during production of the mosaic).

      not provided, this option adds no constrain on the corresponding piece
      dimension.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For instance, -m 8x0 will require that the width of the pieces be a multiple
      of 8 pixels.

      except perhaps for the last piece of each row or the last piece of each

      dimension of the full image. If a dimension is zero or is not provided, it
      is replaced with the largest value which is compatible with the memory
      limit (option -M) and divides the corresponding full image dimension by a
      power of two.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For example, -M 2048 -g x200 will require pieces of length exactly 200
      pixels (but the pieces in the last row at the bottom of the image may be
      shorter) and width equal to W/2^n where W is the width of the full image
      and 2^n is the largest integer power of 2 such that a piece of size W/2^n
      x 200 pixels requires less than 2048 MiB of memory to open.

      piece will be extended in the corresponding direction by the requested

      100 included, followed by the `%' symbol), the overlap amount will be the
      corresponding fraction of the piece's width (if overlapping across a
      vertical border) resp. length (horizontal border). Horizontal and vertical
      overlaps can be different. If the amount is given as a number of pixels
      (must be a nonnegative decimal integer number), the overlap amount will be
      the specified amount, disregarding the actual dimensions of the pieces.
      However, the overlap will be truncated down to a piece's width resp.
      length if it would be larger.
