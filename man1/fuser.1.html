<p>FUSER(1) User Commands FUSER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fuser - identify processes using files or sockets</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fuser [-fuv] [-a|-s] [-4|-6] [-c|-m|-n space] [ -k [-i] [-M]
[-w] [-SIGNAL] ] name ... <br>
fuser -l <br>
fuser -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
fuser displays the PIDs of processes using the specified
files or file systems. In the default display mode, each
file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of
access:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c current directory. <br>
e executable being run. <br>
f open file. f is omitted in default display mode. <br>
F open file for writing. F is omitted in default display
mode. <br>
r root directory. <br>
m mmap&rsquo;ed file or shared library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser returns a non-zero return
code if none of the specified files is accessed or in case
of a fatal error. If at least one access has been found,
fuser returns zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to look up processes
using TCP and UDP sockets, the corresponding name space has
to be selected with the -n option. By default fuser will
look in both IPv6 and IPv4 <br>
sockets. To change the default, behavior, use the -4 and -6
options. The socket(s) can be specified by the local and
remote port, and the remote address. All fields are <br>
optional, but commas in front of missing fields must be
present:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[lcl_port][,[rmt_host][,[rmt_port]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Either symbolic or numeric
values can be used for IP addresses and port numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser outputs only the PIDs to
stdout, everything else is sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a, --all <br>
Show all files specified on the command line. By default,
only files that are accessed by at least one process are
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Same as -m option, used for
POSIX compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Silently ignored, used for
POSIX compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --kill <br>
Kill processes accessing the file. Unless changed with
-SIGNAL, SIGKILL is sent. An fuser process never kills
itself, but may kill other fuser processes. The effective
<br>
user ID of the process executing fuser is set to its real
user ID before attempting to kill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --interactive <br>
Ask the user for confirmation before killing a process. This
option is silently ignored if -k is not present too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list-signals <br>
List all known signal names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m NAME, --mount NAME <br>
NAME specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block
device that is mounted. All processes accessing files on
that file system are listed. If a directory file is <br>
specified, it is automatically changed to NAME/. to use any
file system that might be mounted on that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M --ismountpoint <br>
Request will be fulfilled only if NAME specifies a
mountpoint. This is an invaluable seatbelt which prevents
you from killing the machine if NAME happens to not be a
<br>
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Kill only processes which
have write access. This option is silently ignored if -k is
not present too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n SPACE, --namespace SPACE <br>
Select a different name space. The name spaces file (file
names, the default), udp (local UDP ports), and tcp (local
TCP ports) are supported. For ports, either the port <br>
number or the symbolic name can be specified. If there is no
ambiguity, the shortcut notation name/space (e.g. 80/tcp)
can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --silent <br>
Silent operation. -u and -v are ignored in this mode. -a
must not be used with -s.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SIGNAL <br>
Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing
processes. Signals can be specified either by name (e.g.
-HUP) or by number (e.g. -1). This option is silently <br>
ignored if the -k option is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user <br>
Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose mode. Processes are
shown in a ps-like style. The fields PID, USER and COMMAND
are similar to ps. ACCESS shows how the process accesses the
file. Verbose mode <br>
will also show when a particular file is being access as a
mount point, knfs export or swap file. In this case kernel
is shown instead of the PID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4, --ipv4 <br>
Search only for IPv4 sockets. This option must not be used
with the -6 option and only has an effect with the tcp and
udp namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6, --ipv6 <br>
Search only for IPv6 sockets. This option must not be used
with the -4 option and only has an effect with the tcp and
udp namespaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Reset all options and set the
signal back to SIGKILL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/proc location of the proc file system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
fuser -km /home <br>
kills all processes accessing the file system /home in any
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :;
else something; fi <br>
invokes something if no other process is using
/dev/ttyS1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser telnet/tcp <br>
shows all processes at the (local) TELNET port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
Processes accessing the same file or file system several
times in the same way are only shown once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the same object is specified
several times on the command line, some of those entries may
be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser may only be able to gather
partial information unless run with privileges. As a
consequence, files opened by processes belonging to other
users may not be listed and exe&acirc; <br>
cutables may be classified as mapped only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installing fuser SUID root will
avoid problems associated with partial information, but may
be undesirable for security and privacy reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">udp and tcp name spaces, and
UNIX domain sockets can&rsquo;t be searched with kernels
older than 1.3.78.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accesses by the kernel are only
shown with the -v option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -k option only works on
processes. If the user is the kernel, fuser will print an
advice, but take no action beyond that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
fuser -m /dev/sgX will show (or kill with the -k flag) all
processes, even if you don&rsquo;t have that device
configured. There may be other devices it does this for
too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fuser cannot report on any
processes that it doesn&rsquo;t have permission to look at
the file descriptor table for. The most common time this
problem occurs is when looking for TCP <br>
or UDP sockets when running fuser as a non-root user. In
this case fuser will report no access</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mount -m option will match
any file within the save device as the specified file, use
the -M option as well if you mean to specify only the mount
point.</p>
