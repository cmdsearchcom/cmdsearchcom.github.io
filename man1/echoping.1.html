<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
echoping - tests a remote host with TCP or UDP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
echoping [-4] [-6] [-v] [-V] [-ffill] [-ttimeout] [-c] [-d]
[-u] [-ssize] [-nnumber] [-wdelay] [-hurl-or-path] [-R]
[-iurl] [-ppriority] [-Ptos] [-C] [-S] [-A] [-a] [-mplugin]
<br>
hostname [:port] [plugin options...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
echoping is a small program to test (approximatively)
performances of a remote Internet host by sending it TCP
&quot;echo&quot; packets. It can use other protocols as well
(HTTP - which <br>
makes it a good tool to test Web servers, UDP
&quot;echo&quot;, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoping simply shows the
elapsed time, including the time to set up the TCP
connection and to transfer the data. Therefore, it is
unsuitable to physical line raw throughput mea&acirc; <br>
sures (unlike bing or treno). On the other end, the action
it performs are close from, for instance, a HTTP request and
it is meaningful to use it (carefully) to measure Web
per&acirc; <br>
formances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENT <br>
hostname[:port] <br>
Name (or address) of the server to test. For HTTP, you can
specify a port number. For HTTP and IPv6, you can use RFC
2732 syntax (you will probably need to escape the <br>
brackets from the shell). The name can be an IDN (Unicode
domain name).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v Verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Displays the compiled-in
configuration of echoping. Useful for bug reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s nnn Size of the data to send.
Large values can produce strange results with some echo
servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n nnn Numbers of repeated
tests. With this option, you have also the minimum, maximum,
average and median time, as well as the standard deviation.
The median is the value such <br>
that half of the measures are under it and the other half is
above. When you measure highly variables values, like it is
often the case on the whole Internet, median is <br>
better than average to avoid &quot;extreme&quot; values. You
can check the &quot;value&quot; of the average by looking at
the standard deviation: very roughly, if the standard
deviation is <br>
more than the half of the average, the average does not mean
anything. (See a book about statistics for the details: the
reality is far more complicated.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w nnn Number of seconds to wait
between two tests (default is one). On systems which have
usleep(), you can write it as a fractional number, such as
3.14. Otherwise, use inte&acirc; <br>
gers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t nnn Number of seconds to wait
a reply before giving up. For TCP, this is the maximum
number of seconds for the whole connection (setup and data
exchange).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Use UDP instead of TCP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Use the &quot;discard&quot;
service instead of echo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Use the &quot;chargen&quot;
service instead of echo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h url-or-path <br>
Use the HTTP protocol (instead of echo) for the given URL.
If the hostname is the Web server, the argument has to be a
path, a relative URL (for instance &rsquo;/&rsquo; or <br>
&rsquo;/pics/foobar.gif&rsquo;). If the hostname is a
proxy/cache like Squid, the argument has to be an absolute
URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Accept HTTP status codes 3xx
(redirections) as normal responses (the default is to regard
them as errors)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i url Use the ICP protocol
(instead of echo) for the given URL. The URL has to be an
absolute one. This is mostly for testing Squid Web
proxy/caches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Force the proxy (if you use
one) to ignore the cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Force the proxy (if you use
one) to revalidate data with the original server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Use the SSL/TLS
(cryptography) protocol. For HTTP tests only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Use the SMTP protocol
(instead of echo) for the given server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Use only IPv4 (even if the
target machine has an IPv6 address)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Use only IPv6 (even if the
target machine has an IPv4 address)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f character <br>
Fill the packet with this character (default is random
filling)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Tries to display actual data
transfer duration only, not total time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N n Displays an average which
excludes values (&quot;outliers&quot;) which are further
than +/- N*standard deviation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p n Send packets with the
socket priority to the integer n. The mapping of the socket
priority into a network layer or a link layer priority
depends upon the network protocol <br>
and link protocol in use. For more details see SO_PRIORITY
in socket(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P n Set the IP type of service
octet in the transmitted packets to the least significant
eight bits of the integer n. See ip(7) or ip(4) (depending
on your Unix). <br>
/usr/include/netinet/ip.h may contain interesting constants
for setting Type Of Service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m plugin <br>
Load the given plugin. The plugin is first searched in the
normal library directories (see ld.so(8) ) then in
/usr/lib/echoping. You can type ls in /usr/lib/echoping to
<br>
get an idea of the available plugins. The documentation for
a given plugin is in echoping_PLUGINNAME(1) The
plugin-specific options appear after the hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
echoping -v foobar.example.com <br>
Tests the remote machine with TCP echo (one test).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoping -n 5 -w 10
foobar.example.com <br>
Tests the remote machine with TCP echo (five tests, every
ten seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoping -h / foobar.example.com
<br>
Tests the remote Web server and asks its home page. Note you
don&rsquo;t indicate the whole URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoping -h
http://www.example.com/ cache.example.com:3128 <br>
Tests the remote Web proxy-cache and asks a Web page. Note
that you must indicate the whole URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoping -n 3 -m whois
foobar.example.com -d tao.example.org <br>
Loads the whois plugin and query the host
foobar.example.com. &quot;-d tao.example.org&quot; are
options specific to the whois plugin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echoping -u -P 0xa0
foobar.example.com <br>
Sends several UDP Echo packets with an IP Precedence of
5.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IP TYPE OF SERVICE OCTET <br>
The IP packet header contains 8 bits named the &quot;type of
service octet&quot;. The value of the octet is set with the
-P option. The effects of the octet are defined differently
in <br>
RFC791 Internet Protocol and RFC2474 Definition of the
Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and
IPv6 Headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC791 defines Precedence which
has ascending priorities 0 through to 7, and the bits Delay,
Throughput, Reliability, and Cost which indicates the
application&rsquo;s preference for <br>
the properties of the packet&rsquo;s path through the
network. Precedence is in the most significant three bits of
the type of service octet, followed in decending
significance order <br>
by the D, T, R and C bits. The least significant bit must be
zero. Only one of the D, T, R or C bits may be set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RFC2474 defines the Distributed
Services Code Point, or DSCP. This acts as a selector
between 64 possible behaviours that the network can apply to
the packet. The DSCP is in <br>
the most significant six bits of the type of service octet.
The remaining least significant two bits of the octet must
be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The numeric arguments to -p and
-P can be in decimal (such as 11), octal (such as 013) or
hexadecimal (such as 0x0b). So padding decimal arguments
with leading zeros will change <br>
the value read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may need to be superuser to
set some -p or -P values (precedence on Linux, for
instance).</p>
