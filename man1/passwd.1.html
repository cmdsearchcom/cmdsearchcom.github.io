<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
passwd - update user&rsquo;s authentication tokens</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
passwd [-k] [-l] [-u [-f]] [-d] [-e] [-n mindays] [-x
maxdays] [-w warndays] [-i inactivedays] [-S] [--stdin]
[username]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The passwd utility is used to update user&rsquo;s
authentication token(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This task is achieved through
calls to the Linux-PAM and Libuser API. Essentially, it
initializes itself as a &quot;passwd&quot; service with
Linux-PAM and utilizes configured password <br>
modules to authenticate and then update a user&rsquo;s
password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A simple entry in the global
Linux-PAM configuration file for this service would be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# passwd service entry that does strength checking of <br>
# a proposed password before updating it. <br>
# <br>
passwd password requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=3 <br>
passwd password required pam_unix.so use_authtok <br>
#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note, other module types are not
required for this application to function correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-k, --keep <br>
The option -k is used to indicate that the update should
only be for expired authentication tokens (passwords); the
user wishes to keep their non-expired tokens as before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --lock <br>
This option is used to lock the password of specified
account and it is available to root only. The locking is
performed by rendering the encrypted password into an <br>
invalid string (by prefixing the encrypted string with an
!). Note that the account is not fully locked - the user can
still log in by other means of authentication such <br>
as the ssh public key authentication. Use chage -E 0 user
command instead for full account locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--stdin <br>
This option is used to indicate that passwd should read the
new password from standard input, which can be a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --unlock <br>
This is the reverse of the -l option - it will unlock the
account password by removing the ! prefix. This option is
available to root only. By default passwd will refuse <br>
to create a passwordless account (it will not unlock an
account that has only &quot;!&quot; as a password). The
force option -f will override this protection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --delete <br>
This is a quick way to delete a password for an account. It
will set the named account passwordless. Available to root
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --expire <br>
This is a quick way to expire a password for an account. The
user will be forced to change the password during the next
login attempt. Available to root only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Force the specified operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --minimum DAYS <br>
This will set the minimum password lifetime, in days, if the
user&rsquo;s account supports password lifetimes. Available
to root only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --maximum DAYS <br>
This will set the maximum password lifetime, in days, if the
user&rsquo;s account supports password lifetimes. Available
to root only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --warning DAYS <br>
This will set the number of days in advance the user will
begin receiving warnings that her password will expire, if
the user&rsquo;s account supports password lifetimes. <br>
Available to root only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --inactive DAYS <br>
This will set the number of days which will pass before an
expired password for this account will be taken to mean that
the account is inactive and should be disabled, if <br>
the user&rsquo;s account supports password lifetimes.
Available to root only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --status <br>
This will output a short information about the status of the
password for a given account. Available to root user
only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember the following two
principles <br>
Protect your password. <br>
Don&rsquo;t write down your password - memorize it. In
particular, don&rsquo;t write it down and leave it anywhere,
and don&rsquo;t place it in an unencrypted file! Use
unrelated pass&acirc; <br>
words for systems controlled by different organizations.
Don&rsquo;t give or share your password, in particular to
someone claiming to be from computer support or a vendor.
<br>
Don&rsquo;t let anyone watch you enter your password.
Don&rsquo;t enter your password to a computer you
don&rsquo;t trust or if things &quot;look funny&quot;;
someone may be trying to hijack your <br>
password. Use the password for a limited time and change it
periodically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose a hard-to-guess password.
<br>
passwd through the calls to the pam_cracklib PAM module will
try to prevent you from choosing a really bad password, but
it isn&rsquo;t foolproof; create your password wisely. <br>
Don&rsquo;t use something you&rsquo;d find in a dictionary
(in any language or jargon). Don&rsquo;t use a name
(including that of a spouse, parent, child, pet, fantasy
character, famous <br>
person, and location) or any variation of your personal or
account name. Don&rsquo;t use accessible information about
you (such as your phone number, license plate, or social
<br>
security number) or your environment. Don&rsquo;t use a
birthday or a simple pattern (such as &quot;qwerty&quot;,
&quot;abc&quot;, or &quot;aaa&quot;). Don&rsquo;t use any of
those backwards, followed by a <br>
digit, or preceded by a digit. Instead, use a mixture of
upper and lower case letters, as well as digits or
punctuation. When choosing a new password, make sure
it&rsquo;s <br>
unrelated to any previous password. Use long passwords (say
at least 8 characters long). You might use a word pair with
punctuation inserted, a passphrase (an understand&acirc;
<br>
able sequence of words), or the first letter of each word in
a passphrase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These principles are partially
enforced by the system, but only partly so. Vigilance on
your part will make the system much more secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODE <br>
On successful completion of its task, passwd will complete
with exit code 0. An exit code of 1 indicates an error
occurred. Textual errors are written to the standard error
<br>
stream.</p>
