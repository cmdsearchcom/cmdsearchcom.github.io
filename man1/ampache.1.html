Ampache - is a Web-based Audio file manager.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Ampache is implemented with MySQL, and PHP. It allows you to view, edit, and
  play your audio files via the web. It has support for playlists, artist and
  album views, album art, random play, playback via Http, on the Fly Transcoding
  and Downsampling, Vote based playback, Mpd and Icecast, Integrated Flash
  Player, as well as per user themes and song play tracking. You can also Link
  multiple Ampache servers together using XML-RPC. Ampache supports GETTEXT
  translations and has a full translation of many languages.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The following scripts are included in Ampache and can be used to automate some
  aspects of Ampache.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
catalog_update.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can automate the update of all, or some of your local catalogs by using the
  bin/catalog_update.inc file. By default this will run a clean, verify and
  update on all of your local catalogs. You can optionally specify the name of
  the catalog and it will only update the specified catalog. Very useful when
  used with cron or crontab.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
dump_art.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can output all of the album art stored in ampache to the filesystem. It will
  output the image stored in the database to the directory of the first file in
  the album. This can cause problems f your files are not in their own
  directories. You can specify the filename to be written by modifying the
  config file options relating to album_art_preferred_filename. Ampache will by
  default output meta data directory files for linux.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
delete_disabled.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you would like to delete all of the disabled songs in Ampache you can run the
  bin/delete_disabled.inc to delete all of the songs that are disabled in
  Ampache. Naturally this requires the user you run the script as to have
  permissions to delete the files in question. By default this script will not
  work if you run it. You must open it and delete or comment out the line that
  says $debug=true for it to actually work.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
sort_files.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can have Ampache automatically rename and move all of your files based on
  the meta data in Ampache using the bin/sort_files.inc script. This requires
  write access to the files in question. The files will be renamed and moved
  based on their respective File and Folder patterns as defined by the catalog.
  Ampache will also by default sort your files into A-Z sub-folders to reduce
  the number of folders at the top level. You can turn this off by editing the
  file and setting the $alphabet_prefix to false, or commenting it out.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
fix_filenames.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Ampache provides some additional tools to help you cope with Character set
  mis-matches. These scripts must be run from the command line. After making any
  changes to your tags or the filenames please make sure you update your catalog
  and that your local client has the character set and fonts required to display
  the tag information. This script looks through the path of your local catalogs
  for filenames who contain characters that do not exist in the currently
  configured site_charset. It will prompt you for a source character charset, if
  none is specified it will use the current output_encoding value from iconv().
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
print_tags.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can also look at the raw tags inside a file by running the included
  print_tags.inc file. This example takes advantage of the hexcat application to
  get the hex values of the output. You will need to compare the reported HEX
  value to the HEX value according to the defined charset.
<div class="Pp"></div>
php /bin/print_tags.inc [FILE]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
migrate_config.inc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is used to migrate your ampache.cfg.php config file from php4 formating to
  php5 formating. This is done to decrease the parsing time of ampache.cfg.php.
  This is generally not needed unless you are upgrading from 3.3.3.5 to 3.4.x.
  debian/ampache.postinst runs this script automatically if needed.
