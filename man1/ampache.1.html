<p>AMPACHE(1) Sound AMPACHE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
Ampache - is a Web-based Audio file manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Ampache is implemented with MySQL, and PHP. It allows you to
view, edit, and play your audio files via the web. It has
support for playlists, artist and album views, album art,
<br>
random play, playback via Http, on the Fly Transcoding and
Downsampling, Vote based playback, Mpd and Icecast,
Integrated Flash Player, as well as per user themes and song
play <br>
tracking. You can also Link multiple Ampache servers
together using XML-RPC. Ampache supports GETTEXT
translations and has a full translation of many
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following scripts are included in Ampache and can be
used to automate some aspects of Ampache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">catalog_update.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can automate the update of
all, or some of your local catalogs by using the
bin/catalog_update.inc file. By default this will run a
clean, verify and update on all of your <br>
local catalogs. You can optionally specify the name of the
catalog and it will only update the specified catalog. Very
useful when used with cron or crontab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dump_art.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can output all of the album
art stored in ampache to the filesystem. It will output the
image stored in the database to the directory of the first
file in the album. This can <br>
cause problems f your files are not in their own
directories. You can specify the filename to be written by
modifying the config file options relating to
album_art_pre&acirc; <br>
ferred_filename. Ampache will by default output meta data
directory files for linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">delete_disabled.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you would like to delete all
of the disabled songs in Ampache you can run the
bin/delete_disabled.inc to delete all of the songs that are
disabled in Ampache. Naturally this <br>
requires the user you run the script as to have permissions
to delete the files in question. By default this script will
not work if you run it. You must open it and delete or <br>
comment out the line that says $debug=true for it to
actually work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort_files.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can have Ampache
automatically rename and move all of your files based on the
meta data in Ampache using the bin/sort_files.inc script.
This requires write access to the <br>
files in question. The files will be renamed and moved based
on their respective File and Folder patterns as defined by
the catalog. Ampache will also by default sort your files
<br>
into A-Z sub-folders to reduce the number of folders at the
top level. You can turn this off by editing the file and
setting the $alphabet_prefix to false, or commenting it
out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fix_filenames.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ampache provides some additional
tools to help you cope with Character set mis-matches. These
scripts must be run from the command line. After making any
changes to your tags or <br>
the filenames please make sure you update your catalog and
that your local client has the character set and fonts
required to display the tag information. This script looks
<br>
through the path of your local catalogs for filenames who
contain characters that do not exist in the currently
configured site_charset. It will prompt you for a source
character <br>
charset, if none is specified it will use the current
output_encoding value from iconv().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print_tags.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also look at the raw
tags inside a file by running the included print_tags.inc
file. This example takes advantage of the hexcat application
to get the hex values of the <br>
output. You will need to compare the reported HEX value to
the HEX value according to the defined charset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">php /bin/print_tags.inc
[FILE]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">migrate_config.inc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is used to migrate your
ampache.cfg.php config file from php4 formating to php5
formating. This is done to decrease the parsing time of
ampache.cfg.php. This is generally <br>
not needed unless you are upgrading from 3.3.3.5 to 3.4.x.
debian/ampache.postinst runs this script automatically if
needed.</p>
