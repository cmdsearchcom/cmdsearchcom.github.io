<p>GRANDVIZIER(1) User Contributed Perl Documentation
GRANDVIZIER(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
grandvizier - DNSSEC-Tools dtrealms GUI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
grandvizier &lt;realms-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
THIS NEEDS MAJOR EDITTING!!!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: This is an early
prototype. Consider it to be beta quality, if not alpha.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grandvizier is a GUI tool for
use with monitoring and controlling the DNSSEC-Tools
dtrealms program. It displays information on the current
state of the realms dtrealms is <br>
managing. The user may control some aspects of
dtrealms&rsquo;s execution using grandvizier menu
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grandvizier creates a window in
which to display information about each realms. (These
realms are those in dtrealms&rsquo;s current realms file.)
For each realm, it displays the realm <br>
name and the count of zones in each of these four states:
normal, ZSK rollover, KSK rollover, and KSK phase 6 wait
state. As the rollover status of the zones in each realm
<br>
changes, grandvizier will update its display for that realm.
Inactive realms, realms listed in the realms file but which
are not in currently being run, are displayed but have <br>
no useful information to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user may also hide realms
from the display. These realms, if in the active state, will
continue to execute; however, their information will not be
displayed. Display state <br>
for each realm will persist across grandvizier
executions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu commands are available for
some control over dtrealms. Display and execution options
for grandvizier are also available through menu commands.
More information about the <br>
menu commands is available in the MENU COMMANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grandvizier is only intended to
be started by dtrealms, not directly by a user. There are
two ways to have dtrealms start grandvizier. First, realmctl
may be given the -display <br>
option. Second, the -display option may be given on
dtrealms&rsquo; command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
grandvizier takes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display <br>
Tells dtrealms to execute grandvizier as a child
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-maxrealms <br>
Tells grandvizier how many realms to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
Displays the version information for grandvizier and the
DNSSEC-Tools package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Displays a usage message and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SCREEN LAYOUT <br>
The grandvizier window is laid out as a series of
&quot;stripes&quot;. The top stripe contains status
information about dtrealms, the second stripe contains
column headers, and the bulk <br>
of the window consists of realm stripes. The list below
provides more detail on the contents of each stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the ROW COLORS section for a
discussion of the colors used for the zone stripes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; dtrealms
information stripe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The information stripe contains
five pieces of information: dtrealms&rsquo;s current realms
file, the count of rolling zones, the count of stopped
zones, the count of zones to be <br>
displayed, and the amount of time dtrealms waits between
processing its queue. Coincidentally, that last datum is
also the amount of time between grandvizier screen
updates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; column headers
stripe</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This stripe contains the column
headers for the columns of each realm stripe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; realm
stripes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each realm managed by dtrealms
(i.e., every realm in the current realms file) will have a
realm stripe which describes that realm&rsquo;s current
state. The stripe is divided into <br>
two sections: realm identification and the realm&rsquo;s
zone counts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The realm identification section
contains the name of the realm and the realm&rsquo;s rollrec
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The realm&rsquo;s zone counts
section contains the number of zones in normal state, ZSK
rollover, KSK rollover, and KSK phase 6 wait state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the ROW COLORS section for a
discussion of the colors used for the realm stripes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ROW COLORS <br>
The default grandvizier configuration displays each realm in
its own row with a rotating set of colors. The rows
alternate with blue, red, and green, as defined in the X11
<br>
rgb.txt file. Row coloring can be turned off (and on) with
configuration options and menu commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU COMMANDS <br>
A number of menu commands are available to control the
behavior of grandvizier and to send commands to dtrealms.
These commands are discusses in this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Menu <br>
The commands in this menu are basic GUI commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Halt
Dtrealms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dtrealms&rsquo;s execution is
halted immediately. As a result, grandvizier&rsquo;s
execution will also be halted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">grandvizier will stop
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Menu <br>
The commands in this menu control the appearance and
behavior of grandvizier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Row Colors
(toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item is a toggle to
turn on or off the coloring of realm stripes. If row
coloring is turned off, realm stripes will all be the same
color. If row coloring is <br>
turned on, realm stripes will be displayed in varying
colors. See the ROW COLORS section for a discussion of row
coloring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Inactive Realms
Display (toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item is a toggle to
turn on or off the display of inactive realms. If display is
turned off, realm stripes for inactive realms will not be
displayed. If display <br>
is turned on, realm stripes for all realms will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Modification
Commands (toggle)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some situations, it may be
desirable to turn off grandvizier&rsquo; ability to send
commands to dtrealms. This menu item is a toggle to turn on
or off this ability.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Font Size</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item allows selection
of font size of text displayed in the main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, changing the font size
causes the window to grow and shrink as required. However,
on Mac OS X there seems to be a problem when the size
selected increases the <br>
window size to be greater than will fit on the screen. If
the font size is subsequently reduced, the window size does
not shrink in response.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Realms to
Display</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This menu item allows selection
of the number of realms to be displayed in the main
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Control Menu <br>
The commands in this menu are GUI interfaces for the
realmctl commands related to general realm management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stop Selected
Realm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selected realm will be moved
to the inactive state. This only has an effect on active
realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A realm may be selected by
clicking on its realm stripe. If this command is selected
without a realm having been selected, a dialog box is
displayed from which a currently <br>
active realm may be chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Stop All
Realms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All realms will be moved to the
inactive state. This has no effect on currently inactive
realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Restart Selected
Inactive Realm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The selected realm will be moved
from the inactive state to the active state. The realm will
enter the active state at the same point from which it
entered the inactive <br>
state. This only has an effect on inactive realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A realm may be selected by
clicking on its realm stripe. If this command is selected
without a realm having been selected, a dialog box is
displayed from which a currently <br>
inactive realm may be chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Restart All
Stopped Realms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All realms will be moved from
the inactive state to the roll state. The realms will enter
the roll state at the same point from which they entered the
inactive state. This <br>
has no effect on currently active realms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; DS Published for
All Zones in Selected Realm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command is used to indicate
that all the zones in KSK rollover phase 6 in the selected
realm have new DS records published by their parents. It
moves all these realms <br>
from KSK phase 6 to KSK phase 7. There is no effect on
realms not in KSK rollover phase 6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display Menu <br>
The commands in this menu provide control over what is being
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The realmstripe commands allow
all, some, or none of the realm stripes to be displayed.
Undisplayed active realms will continue to be active, but
they will do so without the <br>
grandvizier window indicating this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Realm
Selection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A dialog box is displayed that
holds a list of the realms currently managed by dtrealms.
The user may select which realms should be displayed by
clicking on the realm&rsquo;s <br>
checkbox. Realms with a selected checkbox will be displayed;
realms without a selected checkbox will not be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Refresh
Display</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refresh the grandvizier display.
The display will automatically refresh after a certain
number of updates; this command forces it to happen
immediately upon invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help Menu <br>
The commands in this menu provide assistance to the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display a window containing help
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
Several aspects of grandvizier&rsquo; behavior may be
controlled from configuration files. Configuration value may
be specified in the DNSSEC Tools configuration file or in a
more <br>
specific rc.grandvizier. The system-wide grandvizier
configuration file is in the DNSSEC-Tools configuration
directory and is named grandvizier.conf. Multiple
rc.grandvizier <br>
files may exist on a system, but only the one in the
directory in which grandvizier is executed is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are the available
configuration values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">colors Turn on/off use of colors
on realm stripes. <br>
fontsize The size of the font in the output window. <br>
inactivecolor The background color used for inactive zones.
<br>
maxrealms The number of realms to display. <br>
modify Turn on/off execution of dtrealms modification
commands. <br>
showinactive Turn on/off display of inactive zones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rc.grandvizier file is only
searched for in the directory in which grandvizier is
executed. The potential problems inherent in this may cause
these grandvizier-specific <br>
configuration files to be removed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file is in the &quot;field
value&quot; format, where field specifies the output aspect
and value defines the value for that field. The following
are the recognized fields:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Empty lines and comments are
ignored. Comment lines are lines that start with an
octothorpe (&rsquo;#&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spaces are not allowed in the
configuration values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose your inactivecolors
carefully. The only foreground color used is black, so your
background colors must work well with black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
grandvizier is implemented in Perl/Tk, so both Perl and
Perl/Tk must be installed on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
grandvizier has several potential problems that must be
taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">development environment <br>
grandvizier was developed and tested on a single-user system
running X11 using a relatively small number of zones. While
it works fine in this environment, it has not been <br>
run on a system with many users or in a situation where the
system console hasn&rsquo;t been in use by the grandvizier
user.</p>
