<p>HTOP(1) Utils HTOP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
htop - interactive process viewer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
htop [-dChusv]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is similar to top, but allows
you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see
all the processes running on the system, along with their
full command lines, as well <br>
as viewing them as a process tree, selecting multiple
processes and acting on them all at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tasks related to processes
(killing, renicing) can be done without entering their
PIDs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
options too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d --delay=DELAY <br>
Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C --no-color --no-colour <br>
Start htop in monochrome mode</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help <br>
Display a help message and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p --pid=PID,PID... <br>
Show only the given PIDs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s --sort-key COLUMN <br>
Sort by this column (use --sort-key help for a column
list)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u --user=USERNAME <br>
Show only the processes of a given user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v --version <br>
Output version information and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS <br>
The following commands are supported while in htop:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up, Alt-k <br>
Select (hightlight) the previous process in the process
list. Scroll the list if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Down, Alt-j <br>
Select (hightlight) the next process in the process list.
Scroll the list if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left, Alt-h <br>
Scroll the process list left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right, Alt-l <br>
Scroll the process list right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PgUp, PgDn <br>
Scroll the process list up or down one window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home Scroll to the top of the
process list and select the first process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End Scroll to the bottom of the
process list and select the last process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-A, ^ <br>
Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e.
beginning of line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-E, $ <br>
Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Space <br>
Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on
multiple processes, like &quot;kill&quot;, will then apply
over the list of tagged processes, instead of the currently
highlighted <br>
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">U Untag all processes (remove
all tags added with the Space key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s Trace process system calls: if
strace(1) is installed, pressing this key will attach it to
the currently selected process, presenting a live update of
system calls issued by <br>
the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l Display open files for a
process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key will
display the list of file descriptors opened by the
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F1, h, ? <br>
Go to the help screen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F2, S <br>
Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters
displayed at the top of the screen, set various display
options, choose among color schemes, and select which
col&acirc; <br>
umns are displayed, in which order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F3, / <br>
Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed
processes. The currently selected (highlighted) command will
update as you type. While in search mode, pressing <br>
F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F4, Incremental process
filtering: type in part of a process command line and only
processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel
filtering, enter the Filter option again <br>
and press Esc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F5, t <br>
Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the
relations between them as a tree. Toggling the key will
switch between tree and your previously selected sort <br>
view. Selecting a sort view will exit tree view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F6 On sorted view, select a
field for sorting, also accessible through &lt; and &gt;.
The current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the
header. On tree view, expand or col&acirc; <br>
lapse the current subtree. A &quot;+&quot; indicator in the
tree node indicates that it is collapsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F7, ] <br>
Increase the selected process&rsquo;s priority (subtract
from &rsquo;nice&rsquo; value). This can only be done by the
superuser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F8, [ <br>
Decrease the selected process&rsquo;s priority (add to
&rsquo;nice&rsquo; value)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F9, k <br>
&quot;Kill&quot; process: sends a signal which is selected
in a menu, to one or a group of processes. If processes were
tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes. If none is
<br>
tagged, sends to the currently selected process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F10, q <br>
Quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Invert the sort order: if sort
order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and
vice-versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+, - When in tree view mode,
expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed a
&quot;+&quot; sign shows to the left of the process
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a (on multiprocessor machines)
<br>
Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u Show only processes owned by a
specified user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Sort by memory usage (top
compatibility key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">P Sort by processor usage (top
compatibility key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Sort by time (top
compatibility key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F &quot;Follow&quot; process: if
the sort order causes the currently selected process to move
in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is
useful for monitoring a process: <br>
this way, you can keep a process always visible on screen.
When a movement key is used, &quot;follow&quot; loses
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K Hide kernel threads: prevent
the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed in the
process list. (This is a toggle key.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H Hide user threads: on systems
that represent them differently than ordinary processes
(such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads
from userspace processes in <br>
the process list. (This is a toggle key.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Show full paths to running
programs, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ctrl-L <br>
Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numbers <br>
PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight
will be moved to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS <br>
The following columns can display data about each process. A
value of &rsquo;-&rsquo; in all the rows indicates that a
column is unsupported on your system, or currently
unimplemented in <br>
htop. The names below are the ones used in the
&quot;Available Columns&quot; section of the setup screen.

waited-for children (see MAJFLT above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTIME (UTIME+) <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All other flags <br>
Currently unsupported (always displays &rsquo;-&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIG FILE <br>
By default htop reads its configuration from the
XDG-compliant path ~/.config/htop/htoprc -- the
configuration file is overwritten by htop&rsquo;s in-program
Setup configuration, so it <br>
should not be hand-edited. If no user configuration exists
htop tries to read the system-wide configuration from
/etc/htoprc and as a last resort, falls back to its hard
coded <br>
defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may override the location of
the configuration file using the $HTOPRC environment
variable (so you can have multiple configurations for
different machines that share the same <br>
home directory, for example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MEMORY SIZES <br>
Memory sizes in htop are displayed as they are in tools from
the GNU Coreutils (when ran with the --human-readable
option). This means that sizes are printed in powers of
1024. <br>
(e.g., 1023M = 1072693248 Bytes)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The decision to use this
convention was made in order to conserve screen space and
make memory size representations consistent throughout
htop.</p>
