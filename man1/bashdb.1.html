<p>bashdb(1) GNU Tools bashdb(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
bashdb - bash debugger script</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
bashdb [options] [--] script-name [script options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bashdb [options] -c
execution-string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bash --debugger
[bash-options...] script-name [script options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
&quot;bashdb&quot; is a bash script to which arranges for
another bash script to be debugged. The debugger has a
similar command interface as gdb(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way this script arranges
debugging to occur is by including (or actually
&quot;source&quot;-ing) some debug-support code and then
sourcing the given script or command string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One problem with sourcing a
debugged script is that the program name stored in $0 will
be &quot;bashdb&quot; rather than the name of the script to
be debugged. The debugged script will <br>
appear in a call stack not as the top item but as the item
below &quot;bashdb&quot;. If this is of concern, use the
last form given above, &quot;bash --debugger&quot;
script-name [script-options].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you used bashdb script and
need to pass options to the script to be debugged, add
&quot;--&quot; before the script name. That will tell bashdb
not to try to process any further options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the reference manual
&lt;http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/bashdb.html&gt; for how to
to call the debugger from inside your program or arrange for
the debugger to get called when your <br>
program is sent a signal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h | --help <br>
Print a usage message on standard error and exit with a
return code of 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A | --annotation level <br>
Sets to output additional stack and status information which
allows front-ends such as emacs to track what&rsquo;s going
on without polling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is needed in for regression
testing. Using this option is equivalent to issuing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set annotation LEVEL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inside the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B | --basename <br>
In places where a filename appears in debugger output give
just the basename only. This is needed in for regression
testing. Using this option is equivalent to issuing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set basename on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inside the debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n | nx <br>
Normally the debugger will read debugger commands in
&quot;~/.bashdbinit&quot; if that file exists before
accepting user interaction. &quot;.bashdbinit&quot; is
analogus to Perl&rsquo;s &quot;.perldb&quot; or <br>
GNU gdb&rsquo;s &quot;.gdbinit&quot;: a user might want to
create such a debugger profile to add various user-specific
customizations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the &quot;-n&quot; option
this initialization file will not be read. This is useful in
regression testing or in tracking down a problem with
one&rsquo;s &quot;.bashdbinit&quot; profile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command-string <br>
Instead of specifying the name of a script file, one can
give an execution string that is to be debugged. Use this
option to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you invoke the debugger via
&quot;bash --debugger&quot;, the filename that will appear
in source listing or in a call stack trace will be the
artificial name *BOGUS*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q | --quiet <br>
Do not print introductory version and copyright information.
This is again useful in regression testing where we
don&rsquo;t want to include a changeable copyright date in
the <br>
regression-test matching.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x debugger-cmdfile <br>
Run the debugger commands debugger-cmdfile before accepting
user input. These commands are read however after any
&quot;.bashdbinit&quot; commands. Again this is useful
running <br>
regression-testing debug scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L | --library debugger-library
<br>
The debugger needs to source or include a number of
functions and these reside in a library. If this option is
not given the default location of library is relative to the
<br>
installed bashdb script: &quot;../lib/bashdb&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T | --tempdir
temporary-file-directory <br>
The debugger needs to make use of some temporary filesystem
storage to save persistent information across a subshell
return or in order to evaluate an expression. The default
<br>
directory is &quot;/tmp&quot; but you can use this option to
set the directory where debugger temporary files will be
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t | --tty tty-name <br>
Debugger output usually goes to a terminal rather than
STDOUT which the debugged program may use. Determination of
the tty or pseudo-tty is normally done automatically. <br>
However if you want to control where the debugger output
goes, use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want output to go to
STDOUT use &amp;1. Note: the &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo; may have to
be escaped or quoted to avoid shell interpretation with
forking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V | --version <br>
Show version number and no-warranty and exit with return
code 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X | --trace <br>
Similar to &quot;&quot;set -x&quot;&quot; line tracing
except that by default the location of each line, the bash
level, and subshell level are printed. You might be able to
get something <br>
roughly similar if you set &quot;PS4&quot; as follows</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">export
PS4=&rsquo;(${BASH_SOURCE}:${LINENO}): ${FUNCNAME[0]}0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In contrast however to
&quot;&quot;set -x&quot;&quot; tracing, indentation of the
original program is also preserved in the source output. And
if you interrupt the program with a break (a <br>
&quot;SIGINT&quot; signal), you will go into the debugger
(assuming your program doesn&rsquo;t trap
&quot;SIGINT&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The &quot;bashdb&quot; script and &quot;--debugger&quot;
option assume a version of bash with debugging support. That
is you can&rsquo;t debug bash scripts using the
standard-issue version 2.05b bash or <br>
earlier versions. In versions after 3.0, debugging should
have been enabled when bash was built. (I think this is
usually the case though.) If you try to run the bashdb
script on <br>
such as shell, may get the message:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sorry, you need to use a
debugger-enabled version of bash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging startup time can be
slow especially on large bash scripts. Scripts created by
GNU autoconf are at thousands of lines line and it is not
uncommon for them to be tens of <br>
thousands of lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a provision to address
this problem by including a fast file-to-array read routine
(readarray), but the bashdb package has to be compiled in a
special way which needs <br>
access to the bash source code and objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another reason of the debugger
slowness is that the debugger has to intercept every line
and check to see if some action is to be taken for this and
this is all in bash code. A <br>
better and faster architecture would be for the debugger to
register a list of conditions or stopping places inside the
bash code itself and have it arrange to call the debugger
<br>
only when a condition requiring the debugger arises. Checks
would be faster as this would be done in C code and access
to internal structures would make this more efficient.</p>
