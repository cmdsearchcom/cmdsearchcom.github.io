<p>java(1) General Commands Manual java(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
java - the Java application launcher</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
java [ options ] class [ argument ... ] <br>
java [ options ] -jar file.jar [ argument ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">options <br>
Command-line options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">class <br>
Name of the class to be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.jar <br>
Name of the jar file to be invoked. Used only with -jar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument <br>
Argument passed to the main function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The java tool launches a Java application. It does this by
starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified
class, and invoking that class&rsquo;s main method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The method must be declared
public and static, it must not return any value, and it must
accept a String array as a parameter. The method declaration
must look like the follow&acirc; <br>
ing:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">public static void main(String
args[])</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the first non-option
argument is the name of the class to be invoked. A
fully-qualified class name should be used. If the -jar
option is specified, the first <br>
non-option argument is the name of a JAR archive containing
class and resource files for the application, with the
startup class indicated by the Main-Class manifest
header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Java runtime searches for
the startup class, and other classes used, in three sets of
locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed
extensions, and the user class path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-option arguments after the
class name or JAR file name are passed to the main
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The launcher has a set of standard options that are
supported on the current runtime environment and will be
supported in future releases. In addition, the current
implementa&acirc; <br>
tions of the virtual machines support a set of non-standard
options that are subject to change in future releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standard Options <br>
-client</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the Java HotSpot Client
VM. A 64-bit capable jdk currently ignores this option and
instead uses the Java Hotspot Server VM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For default VM selection, see
Server-Class Machine Detection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select the Java HotSpot Server
VM. On a 64-bit capable jdk only the Java Hotspot Server VM
is supported so the -server option is implicit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For default VM selection, see
Server-Class Machine Detection</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:libname[=options] <br>
Load native agent library libname, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:hprof</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:jdwp=help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentlib:hprof=help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information, see JVMTI
Agent Command Line Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-agentpath:pathname[=options]
<br>
Load a native agent library by full pathname. For more
information, see JVMTI Agent Command Line Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-classpath classpath</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-cp classpath <br>
Specify a list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP
archives to search for class files. Class path entries are
separated by colons (:). Specifying -classpath or -cp
over&acirc; <br>
rides any setting of the CLASSPATH environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -classpath and -cp are not
used and CLASSPATH is not set, the user class path consists
of the current directory (.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special convenience, a
class path element containing a basename of * is considered
equivalent to specifying a list of all the files in the
directory with the extension <br>
.jar or .JAR (a java program cannot tell the difference
between the two invocations). <br>
For example, if directory foo contains a.jar and b.JAR, then
the class path element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR,
except that the order of jar files is unspecified. All <br>
jar files in the specified directory, even hidden ones, are
included in the list. A classpath entry consisting simply of
* expands to a list of all the jar files in the cur&acirc;
<br>
rent directory. The CLASSPATH environment variable, where
defined, will be similarly expanded. Any classpath wildcard
expansion occurs before the Java virtual machine is <br>
started -- no Java program will ever see unexpanded
wildcards except by querying the environment. For example;
by invoking System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more information on class
paths, see Setting the Class Path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Dproperty=value <br>
Set a system property value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d32</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d64 <br>
Request that the program to be run in a 32-bit or 64-bit
environment, respectively. If the requested environment is
not installed or is not supported, an error is reported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently only the Java HotSpot
Server VM supports 64-bit operation, and the
&quot;-server&quot; option is implicit with the use of -d64.
And the &quot;-client&quot; option is ignored with the <br>
use of -d64. This is subject to change in a future
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If neither -d32 nor -d64 is
specified, the default is to run in a 32-bit environment,
except for 64-bit only systems. This is subject to change in
a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enableassertions[:&lt;package
name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class name&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ea[:&lt;package
name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class name&gt; ] <br>
Enable assertions. Assertions are disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments,
enableassertions or -ea enables assertions. With one
argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the switch enables
assertions in the specified package and any subpackages.
<br>
If the argument is simply &quot;...&quot;, the switch
enables assertions in the unnamed package in the current
working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the switch <br>
enables assertions in the specified class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a single command line
contains multiple instances of these switches, they are
processed in order before loading any classes. So, for
example, to run a program with asser&acirc; <br>
tions enabled only in package com.wombat.fruitbat (and any
subpackages), the following command could be used: <br>
java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -enableassertions and -ea
switches apply to all class loaders and to system classes
(which do not have a class loader). There is one exception
to this rule: in their <br>
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. A separate switch is provided to enable <br>
asserts in all system classes; see -enablesystemassertions
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disableassertions[:&lt;package
name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class name&gt; ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-da[:&lt;package
name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class name&gt; ] <br>
Disable assertions. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With no arguments,
disableassertions or -da disables assertions. With one
argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the switch disables
assertions in the specified package and any subpack&acirc;
<br>
ages. If the argument is simply &quot;...&quot;, the switch
disables assertions in the unnamed package in the current
working directory. With one argument not ending in
&quot;...&quot;, the <br>
switch disables assertions in the specified class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To run a program with assertions
enabled in package com.wombat.fruitbat but disabled in class
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, the following command could be
used: <br>
java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -disableassertions and -da
switches apply to all class loaders and to system classes
(which do not have a class loader). There is one exception
to this rule: in their <br>
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. A separate switch is provided to enable <br>
asserts in all system classes; see -disablesystemassertions
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-enablesystemassertions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-esa <br>
Enable asserts in all system classes (sets the default
assertion status for system classes to true).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-disablesystemassertions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dsa <br>
Disables asserts in all system classes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jar <br>
Execute a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The first
argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a startup
class name. In order for this option to work, the manifest
<br>
of the JAR file must contain a line of the form Main-Class:
classname. Here, classname identifies the class having the
public static void main(String[] args) method that <br>
serves as your application&rsquo;s starting point. See the
Jar tool reference page and the Jar trail of the Java
Tutorial @ <br>
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jar for information
about working with Jar files and Jar-file manifests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you use this option, the
JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other user
class path settings are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that JAR files that can be
run with the &quot;java -jar&quot; option can have their
execute permissions set so they can be run without using
&quot;java -jar&quot;. Refer to Java Archive <br>
(JAR) Files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-javaagent:jarpath[=options]
<br>
Load a Java programming language agent, see
java.lang.instrument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:class <br>
Display information about each class loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:gc <br>
Report on each garbage collection event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose:jni <br>
Report information about use of native methods and other
Java Native Interface activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Display version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version:release <br>
Specifies that the version specified by release is required
by the class or jar file specified on the command line. If
the version of the java command invoked does not meet <br>
this specification and an appropriate implementation is
found on the system, the appropriate implementation will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">release not only can specify an
exact version, but can also specify a list of versions
called a version string. A version string is an ordered list
of version ranges separated <br>
by spaces. A version range is either a version-id, a
version-id followed by a star (*), a version-id followed by
a plus sign (+) , or two version-ranges combined using an
<br>
ampersand (&amp;). The star means prefix match, the plus
sign means this version or greater, and the ampersand means
the logical anding of the two version-ranges. For example:
<br>
-version:&quot;1.5.0_04 1.5*&amp;1.5.1_02+&quot; <br>
The meaning of the above is that the class or jar file
requires either version 1.5.0_02, or a version with 1.5 as a
version-id prefix and that is not less than 1.5.1_02. The
<br>
exact syntax and definition of version strings may be found
in Appendix A of the Java Network Launching Protocol &amp;
API Specification (JSR-56).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For jar files, the usual
preference is to specify version requirements in the jar
file manifest rather than on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the following NOTES section
for important policy information on the use of this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showversion <br>
Display version information and continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Display information about
non-standard options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-Standard Options <br>
-Xint <br>
Operate in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code
is disabled, and all bytecodes are executed by the
interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the Java
<br>
HotSpot VMs&rsquo; adaptive compiler will not be present in
this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbatch <br>
Disable background compilation. Normally the VM will compile
the method as a background task, running the method in
interpreter mode until the background compilation is <br>
finished. The -Xbatch flag disables background compilation
so that compilation of all methods proceeds as a foreground
task until completed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath:bootclasspath
<br>
Specify a colon-separated list of directories, JAR archives,
and ZIP archives to search for boot class files. These are
used in place of the boot class files included in <br>
the Java 2 SDK. Note: Applications that use this option for
the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar should not be
deployed as doing so would contravene the Java 2 <br>
Runtime Environment binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath/a:path <br>
Specify a colon-separated path of directires, JAR archives,
and ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap class
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xbootclasspath/p:path <br>
Specify a colon-separated path of directires, JAR archives,
and ZIP archives to prepend in front of the default
bootstrap class path. Note: Applications that use this <br>
option for the purpose of overriding a class in rt.jar
should not be deployed as doing so would contravene the Java
2 Runtime Environment binary code license.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xcheck:jni <br>
Perform additional checks for Java Native Interface (JNI)
functions. Specifically, the Java Virtual Machine validates
the parameters passed to the JNI function as well <br>
as the runtime environment data before processing the JNI
request. Any invalid data encountered indicates a problem in
the native code, and the Java Virtual Machine will <br>
terminate with a fatal error in such cases. Expect a
performance degradation when this option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xfuture <br>
Perform strict class-file format checks. For purposes of
backwards compatibility, the default format checks performed
by the Java 2 SDK&rsquo;s virtual machine are no stricter
<br>
than the checks performed by 1.1.x versions of the JDK
software. The -Xfuture flag turns on stricter class-file
format checks that enforce closer conformance to the <br>
class-file format specification. Developers are encouraged
to use this flag when developing new code because the
stricter checks will become the default in future <br>
releases of the Java application launcher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xnoclassgc <br>
Disable class garbage collection. Use of this option will
prevent memory recovery from loaded classes thus increasing
overall memory usage. This could cause OutOfMemory&acirc;
<br>
Error to be thrown in some applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xincgc <br>
Enable the incremental garbage collector. The incremental
garbage collector, which is off by default, will reduce the
occasional long garbage-collection pauses during <br>
program execution. The incremental garbage collector will at
times execute concurrently with the program and during such
times will reduce the processor capacity avail&acirc; <br>
able to the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xloggc:file <br>
Report on each garbage collection event, as with
-verbose:gc, but log this data to file. In addition to the
information -verbose:gc gives, each reported event will be
<br>
preceeded by the time (in seconds) since the first
garbage-collection event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always use a local file system
for storage of this file to avoid stalling the JVM due to
network latency. The file may be truncated in the case of a
full file system and <br>
logging will continue on the truncated file. This option
overrides -verbose:gc if both are given on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmsn <br>
Specify the initial size, in bytes, of the memory allocation
pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024 greater than
1MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilo&acirc; <br>
bytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is
chosen at runtime based on system configuration. For more
information, see HotSpot Ergonomics <br>
Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xms6291456 <br>
-Xms6144k <br>
-Xms6m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmxn <br>
Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory allocation
pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2MB.
Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, <br>
or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen
at runtime based on system configuration. For more
information, see HotSpot Ergonomics <br>
Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xmx83886080 <br>
-Xmx81920k <br>
-Xmx80m</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC
platforms, the upper limit for this value is approximately
4000m minus overhead amounts. On Solaris 2.6 and x86
platforms, the upper limit <br>
is approximately 2000m minus overhead amounts. On Linux
platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2000m minus
overhead amounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xprof <br>
Profiles the running program, and sends profiling data to
standard output. This option is provided as a utility that
is useful in program development and is not intended <br>
to be be used in production systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xrs <br>
Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java virtual
machine (JVM).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a previous release, the
Shutdown Hooks facility was added to allow orderly shutdown
of a Java application. The intent was to allow user cleanup
code (such as closing <br>
database connections) to run at shutdown, even if the JVM
terminates abruptly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sun&rsquo;s JVM catches signals
to implement shutdown hooks for abnormal JVM termination.
The JVM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM to initiate the
running of shutdown hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The JVM uses a similar mechanism
to implement the pre-1.2 feature of dumping thread stacks
for debugging purposes. Sun&rsquo;s JVM uses SIGQUIT to
perform thread dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications embedding the JVM
frequently need to trap signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM,
which can lead to interference with the JVM&rsquo;s own
signal handlers. The -Xrs com&acirc; <br>
mand-line option is available to address this issue. When
-Xrs is used on Sun&rsquo;s JVM, the signal masks for
SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not changed by the
JVM, <br>
and signal handlers for these signals are not installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two consequences of
specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o SIGQUIT thread dumps are not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o User code is responsible for
causing shutdown hooks to run, for example by calling
System.exit() when the JVM is to be terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Xssn <br>
Set thread stack size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-XX:+UseAltSigs <br>
The VM uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 by default, which can
sometimes conflict with applications that signal-chain
SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. The -XX:+UseAltSigs option will cause
<br>
the VM to use signals other than SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 as the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
The -version:release command line option places no
restrictions on the complexity of the release specification.
However, only a restricted subset of the possible release
specifi&acirc; <br>
cations represent sound policy and only these are fully
supported. These policies are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Any version, represented by
not using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Any version greater than an
arbitrarily precise version-id. For example: <br>
&quot;1.5.0_03+&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Would utilize any version
greater than 1.5.0_03. This is useful for a case where an
interface was introduced (or a bug fixed) in the release
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A version greater than an
arbitrarily precise version-id, bounded by the upper bound
of that release family. For example: <br>
&quot;1.5.0_03+&amp;1.5*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. &quot;Or&quot; expressions of
items 2. or 3. above. For example: <br>
&quot;1.4.2_05+&amp;1.4* 1.5+&quot; <br>
Similar to item 2. this is useful when a change was
introduced in a release (1.5) but also made available in
updates to previous releases.</p>
