<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The shellinaboxd daemon implements a webserver that listens
on the specified port. The web server publishes one or more
services that will be displayed in a VT100 emulator <br>
implemented as an AJAX web application. By default, the port
is 4200 and the default service URL is
http://localhost:4200/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no particular service was
requested, the server launches /bin/login querying the user
for their username and password. It then starts the
user&rsquo;s default login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any modern JavaScript and CSS
enabled browser will be able to access the published service
without requiring additional plugins.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following command line parameters control the operation
of the daemon:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b | --background[=pidfile] <br>
Launch shellinaboxd as a background daemon process.
Optionally, write the process id to pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c | --cert=certdir <br>
If built with SSL/TLS support enabled, the daemon will look
in certdir for any certificates. If unspecified, this
defaults to the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the browser negotiated a
Server Name Identification the daemon will look for a
matching certificate-SERVERNAME.pem file. This allows for
virtual hosting of multiple <br>
server names on the same IP address and port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no SNI handshake took place,
it falls back on using the certificate in the
certificate.pem file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The administrator should make
sure that there are matching certificates for each of the
virtual hosts on this server, and that there is a generic
certificate.pem file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no suitable certificate is
installed, shellinaboxd will attempt to invoke
/usr/bin/openssl and create a new self-signed certificate.
This only succeeds if, after dropping <br>
privileges, shellinaboxd has write permissions for
certdir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most browsers show a warning
message when encountering a self-signed certificate and then
allow the user the option of accepting the certificate. Due
to this usability prob&acirc; <br>
lem, and due to the perceived security implications, the use
of auto-generated self-signed certificates is intended for
testing or in intranet deployments, only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cert-fd=fd <br>
Instead of providing a --cert directory, it is also possible
to provide a filedescriptor fd where the certificate and key
can be retrieved. While this option disables SNI <br>
support, it does offer an alternative solution for securely
providing the private key data to the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--css=filename <br>
Sometimes, it is not necessary to replace the entire style
sheet using the --static-file option. But instead a small
incremental change should be made to the visual
appear&acirc; <br>
ance of the terminal. The --css option provides a means to
append additional style rules to the end of the default
styles.css sheet. More than one --css option can be given
<br>
on the same command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cgi[=portrange] <br>
Instead of running shellinaboxd as a permanent process, it
can be demand-loaded as a CGI web server extension. When
doing so, it will spawn a server that lives for the
dura&acirc; <br>
tion of the user&rsquo;s session. If an optional portrange
of the form MINPORT-MAXPORT has been provided, the server
limits itself to these port numbers. They should be
configured <br>
to pass through the firewall.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --cgi option is mutually
exclusive with the --background, --pidfile and --port
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to be useful as a CGI
script, the shellinaboxd binary probably will have to be
made setuid-root. This is currently a discouraged
configuration. Use with care.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d | --debug <br>
Enables debugging mode, resulting in lots of log messages on
stderr. This option is mutually exclusive with --quiet and
--verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f | --static-file=url:file <br>
The daemon serves various built-in resources from URLs
underneath the service mount points. One or more
--static-file options allow for overriding these resources
with cus&acirc; <br>
tomized externally provided files. The url can either be an
absolute or a relative path. In the former case, it
overrides exactly one built-in resource for one specific
<br>
service, whereas in the latter case it overrides resources
for each defined service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following resources are
available for customization:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">beep.wav audio sample that gets
played whenever the terminal BEL is sounded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">favicon.ico favicon image file
that is displayed in the browser&rsquo;s navigation bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ShellInABox.js JavaScript file
implementing the AJAX terminal emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">styles.css CSS style file that
controls the visual appearance of the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print-styles.css CSS style file
that controls the visual appearance of printed pages when
using the VT100 transparent printing feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not recommended to
override the root HTML page for a particular service.
Instead, move the service to an anonymous URL and serve a
static-file that references the <br>
service in an &lt;iframe&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of a file, it is
possible to provide the name of a directory. This turns
shellinaboxd into a simple web server that publishes all of
the files in that particular <br>
directory. This option can be helpful when publishing a more
complex root HTML page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g | --group=gid <br>
When started as root, the server drops most privileges at
start up. Unless overridden by the --group option, it
switches to nogroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When already running as an
unprivileged user, group changes are not possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If running with SSL/TLS support
enabled, the certificates must be accessible to the
unprivileged user and/or group that the daemon runs as.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h | --help <br>
Display a brief usage message showing the valid command line
parameters.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--linkify=[none|normal|aggressive]
<br>
the daemon attempts to recognize URLs in the terminal output
and makes them clickable. This is not necessarily a
fool-proof process and both false negatives and false
posi&acirc; <br>
tives are possible. By default, only URLs starting with a
well known protocol of http://, https://, ftp://, or mailto:
are recognized. In aggressive mode, anything that <br>
looks like a hostname, URL or e-mail address is recognized,
even if not preceded by a protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--localhost-only <br>
Normally, shellinaboxd listens on all available network
interfaces. When operating behind a reverse-proxy that is
not always desirable. This command line option tells the
<br>
daemon to only listen on the loopback interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-beep <br>
not only are audible signals undesired in some working
environments, but browser support for media playback is
often buggy, too. Setting this option suppresses all audio
<br>
playback and enables the visual bell by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n | --numeric <br>
When running in --verbose mode, the daemon prints an
Apache-style log file to stderr. By default, host names of
peers get resolved before logging them. As DNS look-ups can
<br>
be expensive, it is possible to request logging of numeric
IP addresses, instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pidfile=pidfile <br>
The shellinaboxd daemon can be configured to store its
process identifier in pidfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p | --port=port <br>
Unless overridden by this option, the web server listens on
port 4200 for incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd can distinguish
between SSL/TLS requests and unencrypted requests. It also
knows how to negotiate Server Name Identification, allowing
the use of a single port <br>
for all types of requests even when virtual hosting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s | --service=service <br>
One or more services can be registered on different URL
paths: <br>
SERVICE := &lt;url-path&gt; &rsquo;:&rsquo; APPLICATION</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a pre-defined
application, &rsquo;LOGIN&rsquo;, which causes the daemon to
invoke /bin/login requesting the user&rsquo;s name and
password, and starting his login shell. This is the <br>
default option for the root user, if no --service was
defined. Starting /bin/login requires root privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is another pre-defined
application, &rsquo;SSH&rsquo;. Instead of invoking
/bin/login, it calls ssh. This is the default option for
unprivileged users, if no --service was <br>
defined. This operation is available to both privileged and
regular users. If the optional host parameter is omitted,
shellinaboxd connects to localhost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, an application
can be specified by providing a user description, a working
directory, and a command line: <br>
APPLICATION := &rsquo;LOGIN&rsquo; | &rsquo;SSH&rsquo; [
&rsquo;:&rsquo; &lt;host&gt; ] | USER &rsquo;:&rsquo; CWD
&rsquo;:&rsquo; CMD</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER := &lt;username&gt;
&rsquo;:&rsquo; &lt;groupname&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The working directory can either
be given as an absolute path, or it can be the user&rsquo;s
home directory: <br>
CWD := &rsquo;HOME&rsquo; : &lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command that shellinaboxd
executes can either be specified as the &rsquo;SHELL&rsquo;
keyword, denoting the user&rsquo;s default login shell, or
an arbitrary command line: <br>
CMD := &rsquo;SHELL&rsquo; : &lt;cmdline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;cmdline&gt; supports
expansion of variables of the form ${VAR}. Supported
variables are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${columns} number of
columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${gid} numeric group id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${group} group name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${home} home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${lines} number of rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${peer} name of remote peer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${realip} value of HTTP header
field &rsquo;X-Real-IP&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${uid} numeric user id.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${url} the URL that serves the
terminal session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">${user} user name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other than the environment
variables of $TERM, $COLUMNS, $LINES, $SHELLINABOX_PEERNAME,
$SHELLINABOX_REALIP and $SHELLINABOX_URL, services can have
environment variables <br>
passed to them, by preceding the &lt;cmdline&gt; with space
separated variable assignments of the form KEY=VALUE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lt;cmdline&gt; supports
single and double quotes, as well as backslashes for
escaping characters in the familiar fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that when invoking
shellinaboxd from a command line shell, additional quoting
might be required to prevent the shell from expanding the
variables prior to pass&acirc; <br>
ing them to the daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no explicit --service has
been requested, shellinaboxd defaults to attaching the
default service to the root directory of the web server. For
root, this is /bin/login, <br>
and for unprivileged users, this is ssh localhost. This is
equivalent to saying --service=/:LOGIN, or --service=/:SSH,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that for SSH service
to work properly, we need a running ssh server on local
system with enabled password authentication. If we are using
&lt;host&gt; parameter, same <br>
conditions must be true on that remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t | --disable-ssl <br>
By default, shellinaboxd redirectes all incoming HTTP
requests to their equivalent HTTPS URLs. If promoting of
connections to encrypted SSL/TLS sessions is undesired, this
<br>
behavior can be disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is also useful
during testing or for deployment in trusted intranets, if
SSL certificates are unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-ssl-menu <br>
If the user should not be able to switch between HTTP and
HTTPS modes, this choice can be removed from the context
menu. The user can still make this choice by directly <br>
going to the appropriate URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q | --quiet <br>
Suppresses all messages to stderr. This option is mutually
exclusive with --debug and --verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u | --user=uid <br>
If started as root, the server drops privileges by changing
to nobody, unless the uid has been overridden by this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more details, refer to the
description of the --group option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user-css=styles <br>
The visual appearance of the terminal emulator can be
customized through user-selectable style sheets. These style
sheets will show up as options in the right-click context
<br>
menu of the terminal emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Styles sheet make up either
independently selectable on/off options, or multiple style
sheets can be grouped together. When forming a group, only
one member of the group can <br>
be active at any given time. This is used for
multiple-choice options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Multiple independent groups are
separated by semicolons: <br>
STYLES := GROUP { &rsquo;;&rsquo; GROUP }*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The members of a group are
separated by commas: <br>
GROUP := OPTION { &rsquo;,&rsquo; OPTION }*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Groups with exactly one member
are used for options that can be independently turned on and
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options include a human readable
label that will be shown in the context menu, followed by
the name of the CSS file. They also must include an
indicator showing whether the <br>
option should initially be turned on or turned off. Within a
group, exactly one option should be turned on: <br>
OPTION := &lt;label&gt; &rsquo;:&rsquo; [ &rsquo;-&rsquo; |
&rsquo;+&rsquo; ] &lt;css-file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user&rsquo;s selection of
options will be persisted in a cookie. This means, the
default settings of options as passed on the command line
only takes effect the very first <br>
time the user visits the terminal emulator in his browser.
On all subsequent visits, the user&rsquo;s preferences take
precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v | --verbose <br>
Enables logging of Apache-style log file to stderr. This
option is mutually exclusive with --debug and --quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Prints the version number of the binary and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
There are no configuration files or permanent settings for
shellinaboxd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A small number of run-time
configuration options are available from a context menu that
becomes available when clicking the right mouse button.
These options get persisted in a <br>
browser cookie.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many sites already have a web
server running and would like to integrate shellinaboxd into
their existing site. This is most commonly done by means of
a reverse-proxy entry for <br>
the main web server. For Apache this would require adding an
option such as: <br>
&lt;Location /shell&gt; <br>
ProxyPass http://localhost:4200/ <br>
Order allow,deny <br>
Allow from all <br>
&lt;/Location&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using a different web
server, refer to that server&rsquo;s documentation on how to
configure reverse proxy operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using a reverse proxy, the
--localhost-only option would normally be enabled as well.
In addition, the --disable-ssl might also be considered
depending on the exact config&acirc; <br>
uration details of the reverse proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
shellinaboxd Attaches a web-enabled login shell to
https://localhost:4200/. If the user connected without SSL,
the session will automatically be promoted. Unless SSL
certifi&acirc; <br>
cates can be found in the current directory, the daemon will
automatically generate suitable self-signed certificates. If
the command was invoked by a non-root user, <br>
the daemon uses ssh instead of /bin/login for the
session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -t <br>
Attaches a web-enabled login shell to http://localhost:4200/
with SSL/TLS support disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -t -f
beep.wav:/dev/null <br>
Runs all services with the audible-bell permanently
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -s
/:SSH:example.org <br>
The terminal connects to a ssh session on example.org.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -t -s
/:AUTH:HOME:/bin/bash <br>
Interactively request the user&rsquo;s name and password
prior to launching a Bourne shell. This command can be run
by unprivileged users. But if doing so, it only allows <br>
this particular user to log in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -c certificates -u
shellinabox -g shellinabox <br>
If the certificates directory exists and is writable by the
shellinabox user and group, self-signed SSL certificates
will be generated in this directory. This might <br>
require creating an appropriately named user first. Running
this command as root allows any user on the system to log in
at http://localhost:4200/. Sessions will <br>
automatically be promoted to SSL/TLS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -t -s /:LOGIN -s
/who:nobody:nogroup:/:w <br>
In addition to the login shell at http://localhost:4200,
show a list of currently logged in users when accessing
http://localhost:4200/who. This command must be run <br>
as root in order to be able to change to nobody:nogroup as
requested by the service description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd -t -s
&rsquo;/:root:root:/:wy60 -c /bin/login&rsquo; <br>
Instead of the standard ANSI/VT100 terminal, publish a Wyse
60&acirc;&cent; terminal. Again, this command should be run
as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd --css
white-on-black.css <br>
Loads the white-on-black.css style sheet from the current
directory and appends it to the built-in styles.css sheet.
This causes the terminal to always render white <br>
text on a black background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shellinaboxd --user-css
Normal:+black-on-white.css,Reverse:-white-on-black.css <br>
Allow the user to select whether they want text to be
rendered normally or in reverse video. This command line
option adds a new entry to the right-click context <br>
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The daemon returns a non-zero exit code in case of failure.
With the exception of a small number of common error cases
that are handled explicitly, most errors result in printing
<br>
a &quot;Check failed&quot; message. This does not typically
indicate a bug in the program but is instead its normal way
of reporting errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common failure conditions are
reusing a port that is already in use, lack of sufficient
privileges to run a service, failure to find SSL/TLS
certificates, and failure to write <br>
newly generated certificates to the certification
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
chmod(1), last(1), login(1), sh(1), shells(5),
openssl(1SSL), w(1), wy60(1), xterm(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY <br>
The daemon uses privilege separation techniques to allow it
to drop privileges early. It is aware of setuid flags and
restricts some operations when launched as a setuid
applica&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Despite these safety features, a
bug could conceivably lead to a determined attacker gaining
elevated privileges. It is therefore strongly discouraged to
set the setuid flag on <br>
the binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The expected deployment would be
from a system rc script launched by /sbin/init. For extra
security, the --group and --user options should be used to
change to a dedicated user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Due to browser limitations, some features might not be
available to users of all browers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Konqueror does not allow for
reliable interception of CTRL keys. If you press a key
together with the CTRL modifier, it continues performing the
browser&rsquo;s predefined behavior for <br>
this particular key combination. In most cases, it also
fails to report the correct key to the terminal emulator. As
a work-around, pressing both the CTRL and the WINDOWS key
<br>
sometimes works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some browsers, most notably IE
on Windows, disallow interception of ALT keys and always
interpret these keys as menu accelerators. As a work-around,
many UNIX applications allow <br>
pressing ESC, instead of ALT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using non-US keyboard
layouts, some browser do not allow for reliably determining
shifted ALT keys. Please report these cases if they turn out
to be a problem, as work- <br>
arounds might be possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to the native clipboard
is typically not possible. Instead, an internal clipboard
accessible from the right-button context menu is used for
all but IE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some browsers restrict the
number of concurrent connections to a server. This restricts
how many AJAX terminals can be opened simultaneously. If
this becomes a problem, users can <br>
typically reconfigure their browsers to raise the limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There have been reports of the
VLC plugin on Linux/x86_64 crashing Firefox when the browser
page gets reloaded. Setting the --no-beep option eliminates
all references to VLC and <br>
thus appears to work around this crash.</p>
