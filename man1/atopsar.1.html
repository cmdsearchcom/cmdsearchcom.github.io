<p>ATOPSAR(1) General Commands Manual ATOPSAR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
atopsar - Advanced System Activity Report (atop related)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
atopsar [-flags...] [-r file|date ] [-R cnt ] [-b hh:mm ]
[-e hh:mm ] <br>
atopsar [-flags...] interval [ samples ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program atopsar can be used to report statistics on
system level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the first synopsis line (no
sampling interval specified), atopsar extracts data from a
raw logfile that has been recorded previously by the program
atop (option -w of the atop <br>
program). <br>
You can specify the name of the logfile with the -r option
of the atopsar program. When a daily logfile of atop is
used, named /var/log/atop/atop_YYYYMMDD (where YYYYMMDD <br>
reflects the date), the required date of the form YYYYMMDD
can be specified with the -r option instead of the filename,
or the symbolic name &rsquo;y&rsquo; can be used for
yesterday&rsquo;s daily <br>
logfile (this can be repeated so &rsquo;yyyy&rsquo;
indicates the logfile of four days ago). If the -r option is
not specified at all, today&rsquo;s daily logfile is used by
default. <br>
The starting and ending times of the report can be defined
using the options -b and -e followed by a time argument of
the form hh:mm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the second synopsis line,
atopsar reads actual activity counters from the kernel with
the specified interval (in seconds) and the specified number
of samples (optionally). <br>
When atopsar is activated in this way it immediately sends
the output for every requested report to standard output. If
only one type of report is requested, the header is <br>
printed once and after every interval seconds the
statistical counters are shown for that period. If several
reports are requested, a header is printed per sample
followed by <br>
the statistical counters for that period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some generic flags can be
specified to influence the behaviour of the atopsar
program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S By default the timestamp at
the beginning of a line is suppressed if more lines are
shown for one interval. With this flag a timestamp is given
for every output-line (easier <br>
for post-processing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a By default certain resources
as disks and network interfaces are only shown when they
were active during the interval. With this flag all
resources of a given type are <br>
shown, even if they were inactive during the interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x By default atopsar only uses
colors if output is directed to a terminal (window). These
colors might indicate that a critical occupation percentage
has been reached (red) <br>
or has been almost reached (cyan) for a particular resource.
See the man-page of atop for a detailed description of this
feature (section COLORS). <br>
With the flag -x the use of colors is suppressed
unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C By default atopsar only uses
colors if output is directed to a terminal (window). These
colors might indicate that a critical occupation percentage
has been reached (red) <br>
or has been almost reached (cyan) for a particular resource.
See the man-page of atop for a detailed description of this
feature (section COLORS). <br>
With the flag -C colors will always be used, even if output
is not directed to a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Use markers at the end of a
line to indicate that a critical occupation percentage has
been reached (&rsquo;*&rsquo;) or has been almost reached
(&rsquo;+&rsquo;) for particular resources. The <br>
marker &rsquo;*&rsquo; is similar to the color red and the
marker &rsquo;+&rsquo; to the color cyan. See the man-page
of atop for a detailed description of these colors (section
COLORS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Repeat the header line within
a report for every N detail lines. The value of N is
determined dynamically in case of output to a tty/window
(depending on the number of <br>
lines); for output to a file or pipe this value is 23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Summarize cnt samples into
one sample. When the logfile contains e.g. samples of 10
minutes, the use of the flag &rsquo;-R 6&rsquo; shows a
report with one sample for every hour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT DESCRIPTION <br>
Depending on the requested report, a number of columns with
output values are produced. The values are mostly presented
as a number of events per second.</p>

contains the following columns per cpu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usr% Percentage of cpu-time
consumed in user mode (program text) for all active

priority) is indicated in the nice%-column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice% Percentage of cpu time

consumed in system mode (kernel text) for all active
processes. A high percentage usually indicates a lot of
system calls being issued.</p>
