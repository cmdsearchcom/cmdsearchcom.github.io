<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
join-dctrl - perform relational join on data in dctrl
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
join-dctrl [ options ] filename filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join-dctrl --version</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">join-dctrl --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
join-dctrl performs a relational join operation on data
given to it in Debian control file format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A join field must be specified
using either the switches -1 and -2 or the switch -j.
Conceptually, the program creates all ordered pairs of
records that can be formed by having <br>
a record from the first file as the first member of the pair
and having a record from the second file as the second
member of the pair; and then it deletes all such pairs where
<br>
the join fields are not equal. Effectively, each of the
input files is treated as a relational database table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every input file must be in
ascending order on its join field; this allows the program
to work fast. The sort-dctrl(1) program can be used to make
it so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-1 field, --1st-join-field=field <br>
Specify the join field of the first input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-2 field, --2nd-join-field=field
<br>
Specify the join field of the second input file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j field, --join-field=field
<br>
Specify a common join field for all files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a fileno,
--unpairable-from=fileno <br>
Specify that unmatched paragraphs from the first (if 1 is
given) or the second (if 2 is given) file are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o fieldspec,
--output-fields=fieldspec <br>
Specify which fields are included in the output. Fields are
separated by commas (more than one -o option can be used,
too). Each field is specified in the format <br>
fileno.field in which fileno is the ordinal number of the
input file from which the field is drawn (either 1 or 2),
and field gives the name of the field to use. As a <br>
special case, simple 0 can be used instead of fileno.field
to refer to the common value of the join fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the field (not
including the file number) is used in the output as the name
of the field. However, a different name for output purposes
can be specified by <br>
suffixing the field specification by a colon and the
preferred visible name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the option -o
0,1.Version:Old-Version,2.Version specifies that the first
field in any output record should be the join field, the
second field should be Old- <br>
Version drawing its data from the Version field of the first
input file, and the third field should be Version drawing
its data from the field with the same name in the <br>
second input file, and these are the only fields in an
output record.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no -o option is given, all
fields of all the records being joined are included in the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l level, --errorlevel=level
<br>
Set log level to level. level is one of fatal, important,
informational and debug, but the last may not be available,
depending on the compile-time options. These cate&acirc;
<br>
gories are given here in order; every message that is
emitted when fatal is in effect, will be emitted in the
important error level, and so on. The default is
important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print out version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --copying <br>
Print out the copyright license. This produces much output;
be sure to redirect or pipe it somewhere (such as your
favourite pager).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print out a help summary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
join-dctrl will treat each file named on the command line as
a relational database table. A file called - represents the
program&rsquo;s standard input stream. Currently, exactly
two <br>
files must be named.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
The standard input stream may be used as input as specified
above in the OPERANDS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
All input to join-dctrl is in the format of a Debian control
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Debian control (dctrl) file is
a semistructured single-table database stored in a
machine-parseable text file. Such a database consists of a
set of records; each record is a <br>
mapping from field names to field content. Textually,
records are separated by empty lines, while each field is
encoded as one or more nonempty lines inside a record. A
field <br>
starts with its name, followed by a colon, followed by the
field content. The colon must reside on the first line of
the field, and the first line must start with no whitespace.
<br>
Subsequent lines, in contrast, always start with linear
whitespace (one or more space or tab characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each input file must be in the
ascending order of its join field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The standard locale environment, specifically its character
set setting, affects the interpretation of input and output
as character streams.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Standard UNIX signals have their usual meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
All output is sent to the standard output stream. The output
is in the format of a Debian control file, described above
in the INPUT FILES section. The output will be in the <br>
ascending order of the join field, if that field is included
in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
There are no output files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
This utility exits with 0 when successful. It uses a nonzero
exit code inconsistently when an error is noticed (this is a
bug).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
In case of errors in the input, the output will be partially
or completely garbage. In case of errors in invocation, the
program will refuse to function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Suppose that a file containing data about binary packages
for the AMD64 architecture contained in the Debian squeeze
(6.0) release, section main, is in the current directory and
<br>
named Packages. Suppose that we are currently on a Debian
system. Suppose further that the current directory does not
contain files named stat and pkg. The following commands
<br>
gives, for each package currently installed and available in
Debian squeeze (6.0), its currently installed version (as
Old-Version) and the version in squeeze (as New-Version):
<br>
$ sort-dctrl -kPackage /var/lib/dpkg/status &gt; stat <br>
$ sort-dctrl -kPackage Packages &gt; pkg <br>
$ join-dctrl -j Package -o
0,1.Version:Old-Version,2.Version:New-Version stat pkg</p>
