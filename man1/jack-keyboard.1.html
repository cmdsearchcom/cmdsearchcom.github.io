<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>jack-keyboard</b> is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that allows you to
  send JACK MIDI events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard. It's somewhat similar
  to <b>vkeybd</b>, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the keyboard
  mapping is much better - it uses the same layout as trackers (like Impulse
  Tracker) did, so you have two and half octaves under your fingers.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KEY_BINDINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#KEY_BINDINGS">KEY
  BINDINGS</a></h1>
Keyboard mapping is the same as in Impulse Tracker. This is your QWERTY
  keyboard:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
		   +----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+
		   | 2  | 3  |    | 5  | 6  | 7  |    | 9  | 0  |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		| Q  | W  | E  | R  | T  | Y  | U  | I  | O  | P  |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		       | S  | D  |    | G  | H  | J  |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		    | Z  | X  | C  | V  | B  | N  | M  |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		
</pre>
And this is MIDI mapping:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
		   +----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+
		   |C#5 |D#5 |    |F#5 |G#5 |A#5 |    |C#6 |D#6 |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		| C5 | D5 | E5 | F5 | G5 | A5 | B5 | C6 | D6 | E6 |
		+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		       |C#4 |D#4 |    |F#4 |G#4 |A#4 |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		    | C4 | D4 | E4 | F4 | G4 | A4 | B4 |
		    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
		
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Spacebar is a sustain key. Holding it when pressing or releasing key will make
  that key sustained, i.e. Note Off MIDI event won't be sent after releasing the
  key. To release (stop) all the sustained notes, press and release spacebar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Holding Shift when pressing note will make it louder (it increases velocity).
  Holding Ctrl will do the opposite. You can change the default velocity by
  moving the Velocity slider. You can change the &quot;high&quot; and
  &quot;low&quot; velocity values by moving the slider while holding Shift or
  Ctrl keys.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pressing &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot; keys on numeric keypad changes the
  octave your keyboard is mapped to. Pressing &quot;*&quot; and &quot;/&quot; on
  numeric keypad changes MIDI program (instrument). Pressing Insert or Delete
  keys will connect <b>jack-keyboard</b> to the next/previous MIDI input port
  (it will cycle between running instances of ghostess, for example). Home and
  End keys change the MIDI channel. Page Up and Page Down keys switch the MIDI
  bank.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Esc works as a panic key - when you press it, all sound stops.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SETTING_CHANNEL/BANK/PROGRAM_NUMBER_DIRECTLY"><a class="selflink" href="#SETTING_CHANNEL/BANK/PROGRAM_NUMBER_DIRECTLY">SETTING
  CHANNEL/BANK/PROGRAM NUMBER DIRECTLY</a></h1>
To switch directly to a channel, bank or program, enter its number on the
  numeric keypad (it won't be shown in any way) and press Home or End (to change
  channel), Page Up or Page Down (to change bank) or &quot;/&quot; or
  &quot;*&quot; (to change program). For example, to change to program number
  123, type, on the numeric keypad, &quot;123/&quot;, without quotes.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TITLEBAR"><a class="selflink" href="#TITLEBAR">TITLEBAR</a></h1>
When <b>-G</b> xor <b>-T</b> is given, some informational messages in the title
  bar appear. They are supposed to be self explanatory. If you see
  &quot;bank/program change not sent&quot;, it means that the bank/program
  numbers as seen in the title bar were not sent. In other words, synth the
  <b>jack-keyboard</b> is connected to may use different values. This happens at
  startup and after switching between synths (using Insert/Delete keys). To send
  bank/program change at startup, use <b>-b</b> and <b>-p</b> parameters. To
  automatically send bank/program change after reconnect, use the <b>-u</b>
  option.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PIANOLA_MODE"><a class="selflink" href="#PIANOLA_MODE">PIANOLA
  MODE</a></h1>
In addition to the MIDI output port, <b>jack-keyboard</b> also opens MIDI input
  (listening) port. MIDI events going into this port will be passed to the
  output port unmodified, except for channel number, which will be set to the
  one <b>jack-keyboard</b> is configured to use. Note On and Note Off MIDI
  events will cause visible effect (pressing and releasing) on keys, just like
  if they were being pressed using keyboard or mouse.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>jack-keyboard</b> will never connect to it's own MIDI input port. It will
  also refuse to connect to any other client whose name begins in
  &quot;jack-keyboard&quot;, unless the &quot;-k&quot; option is given. It is,
  however, possible to connect these ports manually, using <b>jack_connect</b>
  or <b>qjackctl</b>; this may create feedback loop.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Key grabbing is unreliable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many PC keyboards have problems with polyphony. For example, with the one I'm
  using right now, it's impossible to press &quot;c&quot;, &quot;v&quot; and
  &quot;b&quot; at the same time. It's a hardware problem, not the software one.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The spin widgets used to set channel/bank/program number don't take focus, so
  the value cannot be entered into them in the usual way. It's because
  <b>jack-keyboard</b> already uses numeric keys for different purposes. You can
  still directly enter channel/bank/program in a way described above.</div>
