<p>JACK-KEYBOARD(1) JACK-KEYBOARD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
jack-keyboard - A virtual keyboard for JACK MIDI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
jack-keyboard [ -C ] [ -G ] [ -K ] [ -T ] [ -V ] [ -a input
port ] [ -k ] [ -r rate ] [ -t ] [ -u ] [ -c channel ] [ -b
bank ] [ -p program ] [ -l layout ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C Enable &quot;keyboard cue&quot; - two horizontal lines
over a part of keyboard; keys under the lower line are
mapped to the lower row of your PC keyboard; keys under the
upper line <br>
are mapped to the upper row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Disable GUI. It makes
jack-keyboard look like it did before version 2.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K Grab the keyboard. This makes
jack-keyboard receive keyboard events even when it does not
have focus. In other words, you can play while mousing in a
different window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: It&rsquo;s not reliable
yet. It does not work when some other application keeps the
keyboard grabbed. It does not work with GNOME. Even when it
seems to work, some key&acirc; <br>
board events may get lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Toggle titlebar, on which
channel/bank/program information is shown. With -G option,
it disables titlebar; otherwise it enables it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version number to
standard output and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a input port <br>
Automatically connect to the named input port. Note that
this may cause problems with LASH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Allow connecting to other
instances of jack-keyboard (see PIANOLA MODE below). Without
this option, jack-keyboard will refuse to connect to any
JACK client whose name <br>
starts in &quot;jack-keyboard&quot;; this is to prevent
loops. Note that it&rsquo;s impossible to connect instance
of jack-keyboard to itself, even with this option set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r rate <br>
Set rate limit to rate, in Kbaud. Limit defined by the MIDI
specification is 31.25. By default this parameter is zero,
that is, rate limiting is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Send all MIDI messages with
zero time offset, making them play as soon as they reach the
synth. This was the default behavior before version 1.6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u By default, jack-keyboard
does not send program/bank change messages after
reconnecting, so the newly connected instrument remains at
previous settings. This option <br>
changes that behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c channel <br>
Set initial MIDI channel to channel; by default it&rsquo;s
1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b bank <br>
Set initial MIDI bank to bank. With this option,
jack-keyboard will send the bank/program change once, when
it connects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p program <br>
Set initial MIDI program to program. With this option,
jack-keyboard will send the bank/program change once, when
it connects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l layout <br>
Specify the layout of computer keyboard being used. Valid
arguments are QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY, and DVORAK. Default is
QWERTY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
jack-keyboard is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that
allows you to send JACK MIDI events (play ;-) using your PC
keyboard. It&rsquo;s somewhat similar to vkeybd, except it
uses <br>
JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the keyboard mapping is much
better - it uses the same layout as trackers (like Impulse
Tracker) did, so you have two and half octaves under your
<br>
fingers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEY BINDINGS <br>
Keyboard mapping is the same as in Impulse Tracker. This is
your QWERTY keyboard:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+----+----+ +----+----+----+
+----+----+ <br>
| 2 | 3 | | 5 | 6 | 7 | | 9 | 0 | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ <br>
| Q | W | E | R | T | Y | U | I | O | P | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ <br>
| S | D | | G | H | J | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ <br>
| Z | X | C | V | B | N | M | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And this is MIDI mapping:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+----+----+ +----+----+----+
+----+----+ <br>
|C#5 |D#5 | |F#5 |G#5 |A#5 | |C#6 |D#6 | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ <br>
| C5 | D5 | E5 | F5 | G5 | A5 | B5 | C6 | D6 | E6 | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ <br>
|C#4 |D#4 | |F#4 |G#4 |A#4 | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ <br>
| C4 | D4 | E4 | F4 | G4 | A4 | B4 | <br>
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Spacebar is a sustain key.
Holding it when pressing or releasing key will make that key
sustained, i.e. Note Off MIDI event won&rsquo;t be sent
after releasing the key. To release <br>
(stop) all the sustained notes, press and release
spacebar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Holding Shift when pressing note
will make it louder (it increases velocity). Holding Ctrl
will do the opposite. You can change the default velocity by
moving the Velocity <br>
slider. You can change the &quot;high&quot; and
&quot;low&quot; velocity values by moving the slider while
holding Shift or Ctrl keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing &quot;-&quot; and
&quot;+&quot; keys on numeric keypad changes the octave your
keyboard is mapped to. Pressing &quot;*&quot; and
&quot;/&quot; on numeric keypad changes MIDI program
(instrument). Pressing <br>
Insert or Delete keys will connect jack-keyboard to the
next/previous MIDI input port (it will cycle between running
instances of ghostess, for example). Home and End keys <br>
change the MIDI channel. Page Up and Page Down keys switch
the MIDI bank.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Esc works as a panic key - when
you press it, all sound stops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING CHANNEL/BANK/PROGRAM
NUMBER DIRECTLY <br>
To switch directly to a channel, bank or program, enter its
number on the numeric keypad (it won&rsquo;t be shown in any
way) and press Home or End (to change channel), Page Up or
Page <br>
Down (to change bank) or &quot;/&quot; or &quot;*&quot; (to
change program). For example, to change to program number
123, type, on the numeric keypad, &quot;123/&quot;, without
quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TITLEBAR <br>
When -G xor -T is given, some informational messages in the
title bar appear. They are supposed to be self explanatory.
If you see &quot;bank/program change not sent&quot;, it
means that <br>
the bank/program numbers as seen in the title bar were not
sent. In other words, synth the jack-keyboard is connected
to may use different values. This happens at startup and
<br>
after switching between synths (using Insert/Delete keys).
To send bank/program change at startup, use -b and -p
parameters. To automatically send bank/program change after
<br>
reconnect, use the -u option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIANOLA MODE <br>
In addition to the MIDI output port, jack-keyboard also
opens MIDI input (listening) port. MIDI events going into
this port will be passed to the output port unmodified,
except <br>
for channel number, which will be set to the one
jack-keyboard is configured to use. Note On and Note Off
MIDI events will cause visible effect (pressing and
releasing) on keys, <br>
just like if they were being pressed using keyboard or
mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jack-keyboard will never connect
to it&rsquo;s own MIDI input port. It will also refuse to
connect to any other client whose name begins in
&quot;jack-keyboard&quot;, unless the &quot;-k&quot; option
is <br>
given. It is, however, possible to connect these ports
manually, using jack_connect or qjackctl; this may create
feedback loop.</p>

jackd(1), ghostess(1), qjackctl(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Key grabbing is unreliable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many PC keyboards have problems
with polyphony. For example, with the one I&rsquo;m using
right now, it&rsquo;s impossible to press &quot;c&quot;,
&quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; at the same time. It&rsquo;s
a hardware prob&acirc; <br>
lem, not the software one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The spin widgets used to set
channel/bank/program number don&rsquo;t take focus, so the
value cannot be entered into them in the usual way.
It&rsquo;s because jack-keyboard already uses <br>
numeric keys for different purposes. You can still directly
enter channel/bank/program in a way described above.</p>
