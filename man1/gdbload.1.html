<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gdbload - load ASCII formatted data into an HP 100LX
database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gdbload [-an] database [ input ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gdbload loads ASCII formatted data into an HP 100LX
database. database is the name of the 100LX database to
modify. input is the name of a file of ASCII data to load
into the <br>
database. If no input file is specified, the standard input
is used. The ASCII file format is one exported by many
database packages as well as by gdbdump(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
gdbload recognizes the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Add the records from the
ASCII file to the database, keeping the records already
present in the database. By default, the records in the
ASCII file replace those <br>
already in the database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not back up the database
file. By default, the original, unmodified database file is
left in a file with the same name and a .bak extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Format Description <br>
The input to this program is an ASCII text file which starts
with a line containing field names. This line indicates the
order in which fields appear on subsequent lines. Not <br>
all fields of the database need be specified; unspecified
fields will be left blank in all added records. Field names
are not case distinct and ampersands (&amp;) are ignored in
<br>
comparing field names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This first line is followed by
one line for each record of the database. Note that any of
these lines may be split into multiple lines if needed, by
placing a backslash ( at <br>
the ends of lines which are continued. Also note that string
fields may span multiple lines provided they are quoted.
Apart from line splitting according to these rules, each
<br>
&quot;logical&quot; line contains all of the fields whose
names were listed on the first line, in the same order as on
the first line. The fields (and the field names, on the
first line) <br>
are separated by commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exactly how each field should
appear depends on its type. Text fields, category fields,
number fields, and note fields should have their text quoted
if it contains commas or <br>
newlines. The following escape sequences are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Carriage return (ASCII 13).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line feed (ASCII 10).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0n nnn are octal digits
representing a character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nn are hexadecimal digits
representing a character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other character following a
backslash is treated as a standard character with no special
meaning, i.e., backslash and quote marks can be escaped by
preceding them with a <br>
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Date fields should appear in the
format YYYYMMDD; for example, August 15, 1993 should appear
as 19930815. Time fields appear in the format HHMM, where HH
is in the range 00-23. <br>
Date and time fields may also be left blank, i.e., nothing
between the commas.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Radio buttons and check boxes
are turned off if the field is empty or contains a 0; they
are turned on otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No other field types, including
application-defined types, are accepted by gdbload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output from gdbdump(1)
matches this input format, unless the -n flag is given to
gdbdump(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS <br>
When the newly constructed database is first opened by the
100LX, it will (erroneously) be reported as being empty.
This is because gdbload does not construct database indexes,
<br>
and the 100LX expects the index for the current
&quot;subset&quot; to be valid. The situation is remedied by
pressing F6 and selecting any &quot;subset&quot; (even the
current one!) This will <br>
rebuild the index for that &quot;subset&quot;, causing
records to display normally. The delay caused by the rebuild
depends on the size of the database (among other things),
and ranges <br>
from imperceptible for small databases up to several
minutes. This delay will occur whenever a new
&quot;subset&quot; is selected for the first time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdbload will not attempt to
modify HP 100LX Appointment Book and World Time
databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gdbload will not allow you to
specify data for application-defined fields of a
database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program cannot handle
password-protected databases. Attempts to load data into
password-protected databases will have unpredictable
results.</p>
