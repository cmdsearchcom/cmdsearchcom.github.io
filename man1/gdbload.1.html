gdbload - load ASCII formatted data into an HP 100LX database

<b>gdbload</b> [<b>-an</b>] <i>database</i> [ <i>input</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>gdbload</b> loads ASCII formatted data into an HP 100LX database.
  <i>database</i> is the name of the 100LX database to modify. <i>input</i> is
  the name of a file of ASCII data to load into the database. If no input file
  is specified, the standard input is used. The ASCII file format is one
  exported by many database packages as well as by <i>gdbdump</i>(1).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Options"><a class="selflink" href="#Options">Options</a></h2>
<b>gdbload</b> recognizes the following options:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Add the records from the ASCII file to the database,
      keeping the records already present in the database. By default, the
      records in the ASCII file replace those already in the database.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Do not back up the database file. By default, the original,
      unmodified database file is left in a file with the same name and a .bak
      extension.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Input_Format_Description"><a class="selflink" href="#Input_Format_Description">Input
  Format Description</a></h2>
The input to this program is an ASCII text file which starts with a line
  containing field names. This line indicates the order in which fields appear
  on subsequent lines. Not all fields of the database need be specified;
  unspecified fields will be left blank in all added records. Field names are
  not case distinct and ampersands (&amp;) are ignored in comparing field names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This first line is followed by one line for each record of the database. Note
  that any of these lines may be split into multiple lines if needed, by placing
  a backslash (\) at the ends of lines which are continued. Also note that
  string fields may span multiple lines provided they are quoted. Apart from
  line splitting according to these rules, each &quot;logical&quot; line
  contains all of the fields whose names were listed on the first line, in the
  same order as on the first line. The fields (and the field names, on the first
  line) are separated by commas.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Exactly how each field should appear depends on its type. Text fields, category
  fields, number fields, and note fields should have their text quoted if it
  contains commas or newlines. The following escape sequences are understood:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>\r</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Carriage return (ASCII 13).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>\n</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Line feed (ASCII 10).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>\nnn</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">nnn are octal digits representing a character.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>\xnn</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">nn are hexadecimal digits representing a character.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any other character following a backslash is treated as a standard character
  with no special meaning, i.e., backslash and quote marks can be escaped by
  preceding them with a backslash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Date fields should appear in the format YYYYMMDD; for example, August 15, 1993
  should appear as 19930815. Time fields appear in the format HHMM, where HH is
  in the range 00-23. Date and time fields may also be left blank, i.e., nothing
  between the commas.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Radio buttons and check boxes are turned off if the field is empty or contains a
  0; they are turned on otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
No other field types, including application-defined types, are accepted by
  <b>gdbload.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output from <i>gdbdump</i>(1) matches this input format, unless the
  <b>-n</b> flag is given to <i>gdbdump</i>(1).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNINGS"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></h1>
When the newly constructed database is first opened by the 100LX, it will
  (erroneously) be reported as being empty. This is because <b>gdbload</b> does
  not construct database indexes, and the 100LX expects the index for the
  current &quot;subset&quot; to be valid. The situation is remedied by pressing
  F6 and selecting any &quot;subset&quot; (even the current one!) This will
  rebuild the index for that &quot;subset&quot;, causing records to display
  normally. The delay caused by the rebuild depends on the size of the database
  (among other things), and ranges from imperceptible for small databases up to
  several minutes. This delay will occur whenever a new &quot;subset&quot; is
  selected for the first time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>gdbload</b> will not attempt to modify HP 100LX Appointment Book and World
  Time databases.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>gdbload</b> will not allow you to specify data for application-defined fields
  of a database.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program cannot handle password-protected databases. Attempts to load data
  into password-protected databases will have unpredictable results.
