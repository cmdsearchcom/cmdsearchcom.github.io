<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P file, --printwd=file <br>
Print the last working directory to the specified file. This
option is not meant to be used directly. Instead, it&rsquo;s
used from a special shell script that automatically <br>
changes the current directory of the shell to the last
directory the Midnight Commander was in. Source the file
/usr/share/mc/bin/mc.sh (bash and zsh users) or <br>
/usr/share/mc/bin/mc.csh (tcsh users) respectively to define
mc as an alias to the appropriate shell script.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --slow <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If specified, the first path
name is the directory to show in the selected panel; the
second path name is the directory to be shown in the other
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overview <br>
The screen of the Midnight Commander is divided into four
parts. Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two
directory panels. By default, the second line from the
bottom <br>
of the screen is the shell command line, and the bottom line
shows the function key labels. The topmost line is the menu
bar line. The menu bar line may not be visible, but <br>
appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or
press the F9 key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Midnight Commander provides
a view of two directories at the same time. One of the
panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the
current panel). Almost all opera&acirc; <br>
tions take place on the current panel. Some file operations
like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of the
unselected panel as a destination (don&rsquo;t worry, they
always <br>
ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see
the sections on the Directory Panels, the Left and Right
Menus and the File Menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can execute system commands
from the Midnight Commander by simply typing them.
Everything you type will appear on the shell command line,
and when you press Enter the Mid&acirc; <br>
night Commander will execute the command line you typed;
read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys sections to
learn more about the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse Support <br>
The Midnight Commander comes with mouse support. It is
activated whenever you are running on an xterm(1) terminal
(it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin
connection <br>
to another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on
a Linux console and have the gpm mouse server running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you left click on a file in
the directory panels, that file is selected; if you click
with the right button, the file is marked (or unmarked,
depending on the previous <br>
state).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double-clicking on a file will
try to execute the command if it is an executable program;
and if the extension file has a program specified for the
file&rsquo;s extension, the speci&acirc; <br>
fied program is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, it is possible to execute
the commands assigned to the function key labels by clicking
on them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default auto repeat rate for
the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This may be changed
to other values by editing the ~/.config/mc/ini file and
changing the <br>
mouse_repeat_rate parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are running the Midnight
Commander with the mouse support, you can get the default
mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding down
the Shift key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys <br>
Some commands in the Midnight Commander involve the use of
the Control (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the Meta
(sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this manual
<br>
we will use the following abbreviations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-&lt;chr&gt; <br>
means hold the Control key while typing the character
&lt;chr&gt;. Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and
type f.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-&lt;chr&gt; <br>
means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing
&lt;chr&gt;. If there is no Meta or Alt key, type ESC,
release it, then type the character &lt;chr&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">S-&lt;chr&gt; <br>
means hold the Shift key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All input lines in the Midnight
Commander use an approximation to the GNU Emacs
editor&rsquo;s key bindings (default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may redefine key bindings.
See redefine hotkey bindings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for more info. All other key
bindings (described in this manual) relative to default
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many sections which
tell about the keys. The following are the most
important.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The File Menu section documents
the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in the
File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of
these commands perform some <br>
action, usually on the selected file or the tagged
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Directory Panels section
documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a
target for a later action (the action is usually one from
the file menu).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Shell Command Line section
list the keys which are used for entering and editing
command lines. Most of these copy file names and such from
the directory panels to the com&acirc; <br>
mand line (to avoid excessive typing) or access the command
line history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Line Keys are used for
editing input lines. This means both the command line and
the input lines in the query dialogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redefine hotkey bindings <br>
Hotkey bindings may be read from external file
(keymap-file). Initially, Mignight Commander creates key
bindings using keymap defined in the source code. Then, two
files <br>
/usr/share/mc/mc.keymap and /etc/mc/mc.keymap are loaded
always, sequentially reassigned key bindings defined
earlier. User-defined keymap-file is searched on the
following <br>
algorithm (to the first one found):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) command line option -K
&lt;keymap&gt; or --keymap=&lt;keymap&gt; <br>
2) Environment variable MC_KEYMAP <br>
3) Parameter keymap in section [Midnight-Commander] of
config file. <br>
4) File ~/.config/mc/mc.keymap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line option, environment
variable and parameter in config file may contain the
absolute path to the keymap-file (with the extension .keymap
or without it). Search of <br>
keymap-file will occur in (to the first one found):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) ~/.config/mc <br>
2) /etc/mc/ <br>
3) /usr/share/mc/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous Keys <br>
Here are some keys which don&rsquo;t fall into any of the
other categories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter if there is some text in
the command line (the one at the bottom of the panels), then
that command is executed. If there is no text in the command
line then if the selec&acirc; <br>
tion bar is over a directory the Midnight Commander does a
chdir(2) to the selected directory and reloads the
information on the panel; if the selection is an executable
<br>
file then it is executed. Finally, if the extension of the
selected file name matches one of the extensions in the
extensions file then the corresponding command is exe&acirc;
<br>
cuted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-l repaint all the information
in the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x c run the Chmod command on a
file or on the tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x o run the Chown command on
the current file or on the tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x l run the hard link
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x s run the absolute symbolic
link command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x v run the relative symbolic
link command. See the File Menu section for more information
about symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x i set the other panel
display mode to information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x q set the other panel
display mode to quick view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x ! execute the External
panelize command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x h run the add directory to
hotlist command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-! executes the Filtered view
command, described in the view command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-? executes the Find file
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-c pops up the quick cd
dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-o when the program is being
run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under an xterm, it
will show you the output of the previous command. When ran
on the Linux console, the <br>
Midnight Commander uses an external program (cons.saver) to
handle saving and restoring of information on the
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the subshell support is
compiled in, you can type C-o at any time and you will be
taken back to the Midnight Commander main screen, to return
to your application just type <br>
C-o. If you have an application suspended by using this
trick, you won&rsquo;t be able to execute other programs
from the Midnight Commander until you terminate the
suspended applica&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory Panels <br>
This section lists the keys which operate on the directory
panels. If you want to know how to change the appearance of
the panels take a look at the section on Left and Right <br>
Menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab, C-i <br>
change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the
new current panel and the old current panel becomes the new
other panel. The selection bar moves from the old <br>
current panel to the new current panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Insert, C-t <br>
to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo
sequence). To untag files, just retag a tagged file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-e to change charset of panel
you may use M-e (Alt-e). Recoding is made from selected
codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you
may select &quot;directory up&quot; <br>
(..) in active panel. To cancel the charsets in all
directories, select &quot;No translation &quot; in the
dialog of encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j <br>
used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and
the bottom one, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-t toggle the current display
listing to show the next display listing mode. With this it
is possible to quickly switch to brief listing, long
listing, user defined listing <br>
mode, and back to the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-&nbsp;(control-backslash) <br>
show the directory hotlist and change to the selected
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ (plus) <br>
this is used to select (tag) a group of files. The Midnight
Commander will prompt for a selection options. When Files
only checkbox is on, only files will be selected. <br>
If Files only is off, as files as directories will be
selected. When Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regular
expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell
<br>
(* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for
one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging
of files is done with normal regular expressions (see <br>
ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection
will be case sensitive characters. If Case sensitive is off,
the case will be ignored. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(backslash) <br>
use the &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">up-key, C-p <br>
move the selection bar to the previous entry in the
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">down-key, C-n <br>
move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">home, a1, Alt-&lt; <br>
move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">end, c1, Alt-&gt; <br>
move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">next-page, C-v <br>
move the selection bar one page down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prev-page, Alt-v <br>
move the selection bar one page up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-o If the currently selected
file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel
and moves the selection to the next file. If the currently
selected file is not a <br>
directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and
moves the selection to the next file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-i make the current directory
of the current panel also the current directory of the other
panel. Put the other panel to the listing mode if needed. If
the current panel is <br>
panelized, the other panel doesn&rsquo;t become
panelized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-PageUp, C-PageDown <br>
only when supported by the terminal: change to
&quot;..&quot; and to the currently selected directory
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-y moves to the previous
directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the &lt;
with the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-u moves to the next
directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the &gt;
with the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H <br>
displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the
&rsquo;v&rsquo; with the mouse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick search <br>
The Quick search mode allows you to perform fast file search
in file panel. Press C-s or Alt-s to start a filename search
in the directory listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the search is active, the
user input will be added to the search string instead of the
command line. If the Show mini-status option is enabled the
search string is shown on <br>
the mini-status line. When typing, the selection bar will
move to the next file starting with the typed letters. The
Backspace or DEL keys can be used to correct typing
mistakes. <br>
If C-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If quick search is started with
double pressing of C-s, the previous quick search pattern
will be used for current search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Besides the filename characters,
you can also use wildcard characters &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;?&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell Command Line <br>
This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive
typing when entering shell commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Enter <br>
copy the currently selected file name to the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Enter <br>
same a Alt-Enter. May not work on remote systems and some
terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-Shift-Enter <br>
copy the full path name of the currently selected file to
the command line. May not work on remote systems and some
terminals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Tab <br>
does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname
completion for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x t, C-x C-t <br>
copy the tagged files (or if there are no tagged files, the
selected file) of the current panel (C-x t) or of the other
panel (C-x C-t) to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-x p, C-x C-p <br>
the first key sequence copies the current path name to the
command line, and the second one copies the unselected
panel&rsquo;s path name to the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-q the quote command can be
used to insert characters that are otherwise interpreted by
the Midnight Commander (like the &rsquo;+&rsquo; symbol)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-p, Alt-n <br>
use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p
takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-h displays the history for
the current input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General Movement Keys <br>
The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use
common code to handle moving. Therefore they accept exactly
the same keys. Each of them also accepts some keys of its
<br>
own.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other parts of the Midnight
Commander use some of the same movement keys, so this
section may be of use for those parts too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up, C-p <br>
moves one line backward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Down, C-n <br>
moves one line forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Home, A1 <br>
moves to the beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">End, C1 <br>
move to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The help viewer and the file
viewer accept the following keys in addition the to ones
mentioned above:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">u, d moves one half of a page up
or down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">g, G moves to the beginning or
to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Line Keys <br>
The input lines (they are used for the command line and for
the query dialogs in the program) accept these keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-a puts the cursor at the
beginning of line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-e puts the cursor at the end
of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-b, move-left <br>
move the cursor one position left.</p>

cutting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-w copies the text between the
cursor and the mark to a kill buffer and removes the text
from the input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-w copies the text between
the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-y yanks back the contents of
the kill buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-k kills the text from the
cursor to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-p, Alt-n <br>
Use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p
takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-C-h, Alt-Backspace <br>
delete one word backward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-Tab <br>
does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname

&quot;Options&quot; and &quot;Right&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Left and Right Menus allow
you to modify the appearance of the left and right directory
panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The File Menu lists the actions
you can perform on the currently selected file or the tagged
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Command Menu lists the
actions which are more general and bear no relation to the
currently selected file or the tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Options Menu lists the
actions which allow you to customize the Midnight
Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Left and Right (Above and Below)
Menus <br>
The outlook of the directory panels can be changed from the
Left and Right menus (they are named Above and Below when
the horizontal panel split is chosen from the Layout options
<br>
dialog).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Listing Mode... <br>
The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files,
there are four different listing modes available: Full,
Brief, Long and User. The full directory view shows the file
<br>
name, the size of the file and the modification time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The brief view shows only the
file name and it has two columns (therefore showing twice as
many files as other views). The long view is similar to the
output of ls -l command. <br>
The long view takes the whole screen width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you choose the
&quot;User&quot; display format, then you have to specify
the display format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user display format must
start with a panel size specifier. This may be
&quot;half&quot; or &quot;full&quot;, and they specify a
half screen panel and a full screen panel respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the panel size, you may
specify the two columns mode on the panel, this is done by
adding the number &quot;2&quot; to the user format
string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After this you add the name of
the fields with an optional size specifier. This are the
available fields you may display:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name displays the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size displays the file size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bsize is an alternative form of
the size format. It displays the size of the files and for
directories it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type displays a one character
wide type field. This character is similar to what is
displayed by ls with the -F flag - * for executable files, /
for directories, @ for links, <br>
= for sockets, - for character devices, + for block devices,
| for pipes, ~ for symbolic links to directories and ! for
stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mark an asterisk if the file is
tagged, a space if it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mtime file&rsquo;s last
modification time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">atime file&rsquo;s last access
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctime file&rsquo;s status change
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perm a string representing the
current permission bits of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mode an octal value with the
current permission bits of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nlink the number of links to the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ngid the GID (numeric).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nuid the UID (numeric).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner the owner of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group the group of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inode the inode of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also you can use following
keywords to define the panel layout:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">space a space in the display
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">| add a vertical line to the
display format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To force one field to a fixed
size (a size specifier), you just add : followed by the
number of characters you want the field to have. If the
number is followed by the symbol +, <br>
then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the
program finds out that there is more space on the screen, it
will then expand that field.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the Full display
corresponds to this format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">half type name | size |
mtime</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And the Long display corresponds
to this format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">full perm space nlink space
owner space group space size space mtime space name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a nice user display
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">half name | size:7 | type
mode:3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panels may also be set to the
following modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Info The info view display
information related to the currently selected file and if
possible information about the current file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tree The tree view is quite
similar to the directory tree feature. See the section about
it for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick View <br>
In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced viewer that
displays the contents of the currently selected file, if you
select the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), <br>
you will have access to the usual viewer commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort Order... <br>
The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by
modification time, by access time, and by inode information
modification time, by size, by inode and unsorted. In the
Sort <br>
order dialog box you can choose the sort order and you may
also specify if you want to sort in reverse order by
checking the reverse box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default directories are
sorted before files but this can be changed from the Panel
options menu (option Mix all files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filter... <br>
The filter command allows you to specify a shell pattern
(for example *.tar.gz) which the files must match to be
shown. Regardless of the filter pattern, the directories and
the <br>
links to directories are always shown in the directory
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reread <br>
The reread command reload the list of files in the
directory. It is useful if other processes have created or
removed files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Menu <br>
The Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard
shortcuts for commands appearing in the file menu. The
escape sequences for the function keys are terminfo
capabilities <br>
kf1 trough kf10. On terminals without function key support,
you can achieve the same functionality by pressing the ESC
key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0
(cor&acirc; <br>
responding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The File menu has the following
commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help (F1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invokes the built-in hypertext
help viewer. Inside the help viewer, you can use the Tab key
to select the next link and the Enter key to follow that
link. The keys Space and <br>
Backspace are used to move forward and backward in a help
page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu (F2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Invoke the user menu. The user
menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and
add extra features to the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View (F3, F13)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View the currently selected
file. By default this invokes the Internal File Viewer but
if the option &quot;Use internal view&quot; is off, it
invokes an external file viewer specified by <br>
the VIEWER environment variable. If VIEWER is undefined, the
PAGER environment variable is tried. If PAGER is also
undefined, the &quot;view&quot; command is invoked. If you
use F13 <br>
instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any
formatting or preprocessing to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filtered View (Alt-!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command prompts for a
command and its arguments (the argument defaults to the
currently selected file name), the output from such command
is shown in the internal file <br>
viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit (F4, F14)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press F4 to edit the highlighted
file. Press F14 (usually F14) to start the editor with a
new, empty file. Currently they invoke the vi editor, or the
editor specified in the <br>
EDITOR environment variable, or the Internal File Editor if
the use_internal_edit option is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy (F5, F15)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press F5 to pop up an input
dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged
files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
directory/filename you specify in the <br>
input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in
the non-selected panel. Space for destination file may be
preallocated relative to preallocate_space configure option.
<br>
During this process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the
operation. For details about source mask (which will be
usually either * or ^$ depending on setting of Use shell
<br>
patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination see Mask
copy/rename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F15 (usually F15) is similar,
but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It
always operates on the selected file, regardless of any
tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, it is possible
to do the copy in the background by clicking on the
background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box). The
Background Jobs is used to con&acirc; <br>
trol the background process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Link (C-x l)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a hard link to the
current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Absolute symlink (C-x s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a absolute symbolic link
to the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative symLink (C-x v)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create a relative symbolic link
to the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To those of you who don&rsquo;t
know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like
copying the file, but both the source filename and the
destination filename represent the <br>
same file image. For example, if you edit one of these
files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some
people call links aliases or shortcuts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A hard link appears as a real
file. After making it, there is no way of telling which one
is the original and which is the link. If you delete either
one of them the other one is <br>
still intact. It is very difficult to notice that the files
represent the same image. Use hard links when you
don&rsquo;t even want to know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A symbolic link is a reference
to the name of the original file. If the original file is
deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy to
notice that the files represent <br>
the same image. The Midnight Commander shows an
&quot;@&quot;-sign in front of the file name if it is a
symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it
shows a tilde (~)). The <br>
original file which the link points to is shown on
mini-status line if the Show mini-status option is enabled.
Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the confusion that
can be <br>
caused by hard links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you press &quot;C-x s&quot;
Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the complete
path+filename of the original file and suggest a name for
the link. You can change either one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you may want to change
the absolute path of the original into a relative path. An
absolute path starts from the root directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt;
/home/frodo/new/mc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A relative link describes the
original file&rsquo;s location starting from the location of
the link itself:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt;
../new/mc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can force Midnight Commander
to suggest a relative path by pressing &quot;C-x v&quot;
instead of &quot;C-x s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename/Move (F6, F16)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press F6 to pop up an input
dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged
files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
directory/filename you specify in the <br>
input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in
the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy (F5)
operation above, most of the things are quite similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F16 (usually F16) is similar,
but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It
always operates on the selected file, regardless of any
tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some systems, it is possible
to do the copy in the background by clicking on the
background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box). The
Background Jobs is used to con&acirc; <br>
trol the background process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mkdir (F7)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pop up an input dialog and
creates the directory specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete (F8)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete the currently selected
file or the tagged files in the currently selected panel.
During the process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick cd (Alt-c) Use the quick
cd command if you have full command line and want to cd
somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select group (+)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is used to select (tag) a
group of files. The Midnight Commander will prompt for a
selection options. When Files only checkbox is on, only
files will be selected. If Files <br>
only is off, as files as directories will be selected. When
Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regular expression is
much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for
<br>
zero or more characters and ? standing for one character).
If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done
with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When Case <br>
sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be case
sensitive characters. If Case sensitive is off, the case
will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unselect group (</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Used to unselect a group of
files. This is the opposite of the Select group command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quit (F10, Shift-F10)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminate the Midnight
Commander. Shift-F10 is used when you want to quit and you
are using the shell wrapper. Shift-F10 will not take you to
the last directory you visited <br>
with the Midnight Commander, instead it will stay at the
directory where you started the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick cd <br>
This command is useful if you have a full command line and
want to cd somewhere without having to yank and paste the
command line. This command pops up a small dialog, where you
<br>
enter everything you would enter after cd on the command
line and then you press enter. This features all the things
that are already in the internal cd command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command Menu <br>
The Directory tree command shows a tree figure of the
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Find file&quot;
command allows you to search for a specific file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Swap panels&quot;
command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Switch panels
on/off&quot; command shows the output of the last shell
command. This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD
console.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Compare
directories&quot; command compares the directory panels with
each other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make
the panels identical. There are three compare <br>
methods. The quick method compares only file size and file
date. The thorough method makes a full byte-by-byte compare.
The thorough method is not available if the machine does
<br>
not support the mmap(2) system call. The size-only compare
method just compares the file sizes and does not check the
contents or the date times, it just checks the file
size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;External
panelize&quot; allows you to execute an external program,
and make the output of that program the contents of the
current panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Command history&quot;
command shows a list of typed commands. The selected command
is copied to the command line. The command history can also
be accessed by typing Alt-p or <br>
Alt-n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Directory
hotlist&quot; command makes changing of the current
directory to often used directories faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Screen list&quot;
command shows a dialog window with the list of currently
running internal editors, viewers and other MC modules that
support this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Edit extension
file&quot; command allows you to specify programs to
executed when you try to execute, view, edit and do a bunch
of other thing on files with certain extensions <br>
(filename endings).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Edit menu file&quot;
command may be used for editing the user menu (which appears
by pressing F2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory Tree <br>
The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the
directories. You can select a directory from the figure and
the Midnight Commander will change to that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways to invoke the
tree. The real directory tree command is available from
Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view from the
Left or Right menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To get rid of long delays the
Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by scanning only
a small subset of all the directories. If the directory
which you want to see is miss&acirc; <br>
ing, move to its parent directory and press C-r (or F2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use the following
keys:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General movement keys are
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enter. In the directory tree,
exits the directory tree and changes to this directory in
the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this
directory in the other panel and <br>
stays in tree view mode in the current panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-r, F2 (Rescan). Rescan this
directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date: it
is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which
don&rsquo;t exist any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F3 (Forget). Delete this
directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter
from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree
figure press F2 in its parent <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F4 (Static/Dynamic). Toggle
between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static
navigation mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the static navigation mode
you can use the Up and Down keys to select a directory. All
known directories are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the dynamic navigation mode
you can use the Up and Down keys to select a sibling
directory, the Left key to move to the parent directory, and
the Right key to move to a child <br>
directory. Only the parent, sibling and children directories
are shown, others are left out. The tree figure changes
dynamically as you traverse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F5 (Copy). Copy the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F6 (RenMov). Move the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F7 (Mkdir). Make a new directory
below this directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F8 (Delete). Delete this
directory from the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-s, Alt-s. Search the next
directory matching the search string. If there is no such
directory these keys will move one line down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C-h, Backspace. Delete the last
character of the search string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any other character. Add the
character to the search string and move to the next
directory which starts with these characters. In the tree
view you must first activate the <br>
search mode by pressing C-s. The search string is shown in
the mini status line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following actions are
available only in the directory tree. They aren&rsquo;t
supported in the tree view.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F1 (Help). Invoke the help
viewer and show this section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Esc, F10. Exit the directory
tree. Do not change the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mouse is supported. A
double-click behaves like Enter. See also the section on
mouse support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find File <br>
The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for
the search and the filename to be searched for. By pressing
the Tree button you can select the start directory from <br>
the directory tree figure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Option form whole words. Like
grep -w.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can start the search by
pressing the OK button. During the search you can stop from
the Stop button and continue from the Start button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can browse the filelist with
the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir button will change to
the directory of the currently selected file. The Again
button will ask for the <br>
parameters for a new search. The Quit button quits the
search operation. The Panelize button will place the found
files to the current directory panel so that you can do
addi&acirc; <br>
tional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete and so
on). After panelizing you can press C-r to return to the
normal file listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;Enable ignore
directories&rsquo; checkbox and input field below it allow
to set up the list of directories that should be skip during
the search files (for example, you may want <br>
to avoid searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is
mounted across a slow link). List components must be
separated with a colon, here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative paths are supported
also. The following example shows how to skip special
directories of version control systems: <br>
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attention: input field can
contain a dot (.), this means the current absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may consider using the
External panelize command for some operations. Find file
command is for simple queries only, while using External
panelize you can do as mysterious <br>
searches as you would like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">External panelize <br>
The External panelize allows you to execute an external
program, and make the output of that program the contents of
the current panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you want to
manipulate in one of the panels all the symbolic links in
the current directory, you can use external panelization to
run the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find . -type l -print</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon command completion, the
directory contents of the panel will no longer be the
directory listing of the current directory, but all the
files that are symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to panelize all of
the files that have been downloaded from your FTP server,
you can use this awk command to extract the file name from
the transfer log files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">awk &rsquo;$9 ~! /incoming/ {
print $9 }&rsquo; &lt; /var/log/xferlog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may want to save often used
panelize commands under a descriptive name, so that you can
recall them quickly. You do this by typing the command on
the input line and pressing <br>
Add new button. Then you enter a name under which you want
the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that
command from the list and do not have to type it again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hotlist <br>
The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the
directories in the directory hotlist. The Midnight Commander
will change to the directory corresponding to the selected
<br>
label. From the hotlist dialog, you can remove already
created label/directory pairs and add new ones. To add new
directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command
<br>
(C-x h), which adds the current directory into the directory
hotlist, asking just for the label for the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This makes cd to often used
directories faster. You may consider using the CDPATH
variable as described in internal cd command
description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extension File Edit <br>
This will invoke your editor on the file
~/.config/mc/mc.ext. The format of this file following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All lines starting with # or
empty lines are thrown away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lines starting in the first
column should have following format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword/expr, i.e. everything
after the slash until new line is expr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">keyword can be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell - expr is an extension (no
wildcards). File matches it its name ends with expr.
Example: shell/.tar matches *.tar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regex - expr is a regular
expression. File matches if its name matches the regular
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">directory <br>
- expr is a regular expression. File matches if it is a
directory and its name matches the regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type - expr is a regular
expression. File matches if the output of file %f without
the initial &quot;filename:&quot; part matches regular
expression expr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default <br>
- matches any file. expr is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include <br>
- denotes a common section. expr is the name of the
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other lines should start with a
space or tab and should be of the format: keyword=command
(with no spaces around =), where keyword should be: Open
(invoked on Enter or double <br>
click), View (F3), Edit (F4) or Include (to add rules from
the common section). command is any one-line shell command,
with the simple macro substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rules are matched from top to
bottom, thus the order is important. If the appropriate
action is missing, search continues as if this rule
didn&rsquo;t match (i.e. if a file matches <br>
the first and second entry and View action is missing in the
first one, then on pressing F3 the View action from the
second entry will be used). default should match all the
<br>
actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Background Jobs <br>
This lets you control the state of any background Midnight
Commander process (only copy and move files operations can
be done in the background). You can stop, restart and kill
<br>
a background job from here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu File Edit <br>
The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be
customized by the user. When you access the user menu, the
file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it
exists, <br>
but only if it is owned by user or root and is not
world-writable. If no such file found, ~/.config/mc/menu is
tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default
sys&acirc; <br>
tem-wide menu /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of the menu file is
very simple. Lines that start with anything but space or tab
are considered entries for the menu (in order to be able to
use it like a hot key, the <br>
first character should be a letter). All the lines that
start with a space or a tab are the commands that will be
executed when the entry is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an option is selected all
the command lines of the option are copied to a temporary
file in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then
that file is executed. This <br>
allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the menus.
Also simple macro substitution takes place before executing
the menu code. For more information, see macro
substitu&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a sample mc.menu
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Dump the currently selected
file <br>
od -c %f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Edit a bug report and send it
to root <br>
I=&lsquo;mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX&lsquo; ||
exit 1 <br>
vi $I <br>
mail -s &quot;Midnight Commander bug&quot; root &lt; $I <br>
rm -f $I</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Read mail <br>
emacs -f rmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Read Usenet news <br>
emacs -f gnus</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H Call the info hypertext
browser <br>
info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">J Copy current directory to
other panel recursively <br>
tar cf - . | (cd %D &amp;&amp; tar xvpf -)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">K Make a release of the current
subdirectory <br>
echo -n &quot;Name of distribution file: &quot; <br>
read tar <br>
ln -s %d &lsquo;dirname %d&lsquo;/$tar <br>
cd .. <br>
tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
<br>
X Extract the contents of a compressed tar file <br>
tar xzvf %f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default Conditions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each menu entry may be preceded
by a condition. The condition must start from the first
column with a &rsquo;=&rsquo; character. If the condition is
true, the menu entry will be the default <br>
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Condition syntax: =
&lt;sub-cond&gt; <br>
or: = &lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ... <br>
or: = &lt;sub-cond&gt; &amp; &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sub-condition is one of
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">y &lt;pattern&gt; syntax of
current file matching pattern? <br>
(for edit menu only) <br>
f &lt;pattern&gt; current file matching pattern? <br>
F &lt;pattern&gt; other file matching pattern? <br>
d &lt;pattern&gt; current directory matching pattern? <br>
D &lt;pattern&gt; other directory matching pattern? <br>
t &lt;type&gt; current file of type? <br>
T &lt;type&gt; other file of type? <br>
x &lt;filename&gt; is it executable filename? <br>
! &lt;sub-cond&gt; negate the result of sub-condition</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pattern is a normal shell
pattern or a regular expression, according to the shell
patterns option. You can override the global value of the
shell patterns option by writing <br>
&quot;shell_patterns=x&quot; on the first line of the menu
file (where &quot;x&quot; is either 0 or 1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type is one or more of the
following characters:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n not a directory <br>
r regular file <br>
d directory <br>
l link <br>
c character device <br>
b block device <br>
f FIFO (pipe) <br>
s socket <br>
x executable file <br>
t tagged</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example &rsquo;rlf&rsquo;
means either regular file, link or fifo. The &rsquo;t&rsquo;
type is a little special because it acts on the panel
instead of the file. The condition &rsquo;=t t&rsquo; is
true if <br>
there are tagged files in the current panel and false if
not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the condition starts with
&rsquo;=?&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;=&rsquo; a debug trace
will be shown whenever the value of the condition is
calculated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The conditions are calculated
from left to right. This means <br>
= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n <br>
is calculated as <br>
( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) &amp; (t n)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a sample of the use of
conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
<br>
L List the contents of a compressed tar-archive <br>
gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addition Conditions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the condition begins with
&rsquo;+&rsquo; (or &rsquo;+?&rsquo;) instead of
&rsquo;=&rsquo; (or &rsquo;=?&rsquo;) it is an addition
condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will be
included in the menu. If the con&acirc; <br>
dition is false the menu entry will not be included in the
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can combine default and
addition conditions by starting condition with
&rsquo;+=&rsquo; or &rsquo;=+&rsquo; (or &rsquo;+=?&rsquo;
or &rsquo;=+?&rsquo; if you want debug trace). If you want
to use two different conditions, <br>
one for adding and another for defaulting, you can precede a
menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with
&rsquo;+&rsquo; and another starting with
&rsquo;=&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comments are started with
&rsquo;#&rsquo;. The additional comment lines must start
with &rsquo;#&rsquo;, space or tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options Menu <br>
The Midnight Commander has some options that may be toggled
on and off in several dialogs which are accessible from this
menu. Options are enabled if they have an asterisk or
&quot;x&quot; <br>
in front of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Configuration command pops
up a dialog from which you can change most of settings of
the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Layout command pops up a
dialog from which you specify a bunch of options how mc
looks like on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Panel options command pops
up a dialog from which you specify options of file manager
panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Confirmation command pops up
a dialog from which you specify which actions you want to
confirm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Display bits command pops up
a dialog from which you may select which characters is your
terminal able to display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Learn keys command pops up a
dialog from which you test some keys which are not working
on some terminals and you may fix them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Virtual FS command pops up a
dialog from which you specify some VFS related options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Save setup command saves the
current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus. A
small number of other settings is saved, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration <br>
The options in this dialog are divided into several groups:
&quot;File operation options&quot;, &quot;Esc key
mode&quot;, &quot;Pause after run&quot; and &quot;Other
options&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File operation options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose operation. This toggles
whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are
verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If
you have a slow terminal, you <br>
may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is
automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is
less than 9600 bps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compute totals. If this option
is enabled, the Midnight Commander computes total byte sizes
and total number of files prior to any Copy, Rename and
Delete operations. This will <br>
provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense
of some speed. This option has no effect, if Verbose
operation is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Classic progressbar. If this
option is enabled, the progressbar of Copy/Move/Delete
operations is always grown form left to right. If disabled,
the growing direction of pro&acirc; <br>
gressbar follows to direction of Copy/Move/Delete operation:
from left panel to right one and vice versa. Enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mkdir autoname When you press F7
to create a new directory, the input line in popup dialog
will be filled by name of current file or directory in
active panel. Disabled by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preallocate space Preallocate
space for whole target file, if possible, before copy
operation. Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Esc key mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default the Midnight
Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix. Therefore, you
should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But there is a
possibility to use a single <br>
press of ESC key for that action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single press. By default this
option is disabled. If you&rsquo;ll enable it, the ESC key
will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see
Timeout option below), and if no extra <br>
keys have arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a
cancel key (ESC ESC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Timeout. This options is used to
setup the time interval (in microseconds) for single press
of ESC key. By default, this inrerval is one second (1000000
microseconds). Also the <br>
timeout can be set via KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment
variable (also in microseconds), which has higher priority
than Timeout option value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pause after run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After executing your commands,
the Midnight Commander can pause, so that you can examine
the output of the command. There are three possible settings
for this variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Never. Means that you do not
want to see the output of your command. If you are using the
Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to
see the output of the com&acirc; <br>
mand by typing C-o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ondumbterminals. You will get
the pause message on terminals that are not capable of
showing the output of the last command executed (any
terminal that is not an xterm or the <br>
Linux console).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Always. The program will pause
after executing all of your commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use internal editor. If this
option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit
files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in
the EDITOR environment vari&acirc; <br>
able is used. If no editor is specified, vi is used. See the
section on the internal file editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use internal viewer. If this
option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view
files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the
PAGER environment variable <br>
is used. If no pager is specified, the view command is used.
See the section on the internal file viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto menus. If this option is
enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup. Useful
for building menus for non-unixers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drop down menus. When this
option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as
soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise, you will only get
the menu title, and you will <br>
have to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or with
the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using hotkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shell Patterns. By default the
Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like
regular expressions. The following conversions are performed
to achieve this: the &rsquo;*&rsquo; is <br>
replaced by &rsquo;.*&rsquo; (zero or more characters); the
&rsquo;?&rsquo; is replaced by &rsquo;.&rsquo; (exactly one
character) and &rsquo;.&rsquo; by the literal dot. If the
option is disabled, then the regular expres&acirc; <br>
sions are the ones described in ed(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Complete: show all. By default
the Midnight Commander pops up all possible completions if
the completion is ambiguous only when you press Alt-Tab for
the second time. For the <br>
first time, it just completes as much as possible and beeps
in the case of ambiguity. Enable this option if you want to
see all possible completions even after pressing Alt-Tab
<br>
the first time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotating dash. If this option is
enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the
upper right corner as a work in progress indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cd follows links. This option,
if set, causes the Midnight Commander to follow the logical
chain of directories when changing current directory either
in the panels, or using <br>
the cd command. This is the default behavior of bash. When
unset, the Midnight Commander follows the real directory
structure, so cd .. if you&rsquo;ve entered that directory
through a <br>
link will move you to the current directory&rsquo;s real
parent and not to the directory where the link was
present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Safe delete. If this option is
enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries
unintentionally becomes more difficult. The default
selection in the confirmation dialogs <br>
for deletion changes from &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;No&quot;.
This option is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto save setup. If this option
is enabled, when you exit the Midnight Commander the
configurable options of the Midnight Commander are saved in
the ~/.config/mc/ini file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Layout <br>
The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the
general layout of screen. The options in this dialog are
divided into several groups: &quot;Panel split&quot;,
&quot;Console output&quot; and <br>
&quot;Other options&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panel split</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rest of the screen area is
used for the two directory panels. You can specify whether
the area is split to the panels in Vertical <br>
or Horizontal direction. Panel layout can be changed using
Alt-, (Alt-comma) shortcut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Equal split. By default, panels
have equal sizes. Using this option you can specify an
unequal split.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Console output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the Linux or FreeBSD console
you can specify how many lines are shown in the output
window. This option is available if Midnight Commander runs
on native console only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menu bar visible. If enabled,
main menu of Midnight Commander is always visible on the top
row of screen above panels. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command prompt. If enabled,
command line is avalable. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keybar visible. If enabled, 10
lables associated with F1-F10 keys are located at the bottom
row of screen. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hintbar visible. If enabled, the
one-line hints are visible below panels. Enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XTerm window title. When run in
a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the
terminal window title to the current working directory and
updates it when necessary. <br>
If your terminal emulator is broken and you see some
incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off
this option. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show free space. If enabled,
free space and total space of current file system is shown
at the bottom frame of panel. Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Panel options <br>
Main panel options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show mini-status. If enabled,
one line of status information about the currently selected
item is shown at the bottom of the panels. Enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use SI size units. If this
option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use SI units
(powers of 1000) when displaying any byte sizes. The
suffixes (k, m ...) are shown in lower&acirc; <br>
case. If disabled (default), Midnight Commander will use
binary units (powers of 1024) and the suffixes are shown in
upper case (K, M ...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mix all files. If this option is
enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed together.
If the option is desabled (default), directories (and links
to directories) are <br>
shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show backup files. If enabled,
the Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde.
Otherwise, they won&rsquo;t be shown (like GNU&rsquo;s ls
option -B). Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Show hidden files. If enabled,
the Midnight Commander will show all files that start with a
dot (like ls -a). Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fast directory reload. If this
option is enabled, the Midnight Commander will use a trick
to determine if the directory contents have changed. The
trick is to reload the direc&acirc; <br>
tory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this
means that reloads only happen when files are created or
deleted. If what changes is the i-node for a file in the
<br>
directory (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc)
the display is not updated. In these cases, if you have the
option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with
<br>
C-r). Disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mark moves down. If enabled, the
selection bar will move down when you mark a file (with
Insert key). Enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reverse files only. Allow revert
selection of files only. Enabled by default. If enabled, the
reverse selection is applied to files only, not to
directories. The selection of <br>
directories is untouched. If off, the reverse selection is
applied to files as well to directories: all unselected
items become selected, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Simple swap. If both panels
contain file listing, simple swap means that panels exchange
its screen positions: left panel become right one, and vice
versa. If this option is <br>
unchecked, file listing panels exchange its content keeping
listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Auto save panels setup. If this
option is enabled, when you exit the Midnight Commander the
current settings of panels are saved in the
~/.config/mc/panels.ini file. Disabled <br>
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Navigation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lynx-like motion. If this option
is enabled, you may use the arrows keys to automatically
chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory and the
shell command line is empty. <br>
By default, this setting is off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Page scrolling. If set (the
default), panel will scroll by half the display when the
cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel,
otherwise it will just scroll a file <br>
at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse page scrolling. Controls
whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is done by pages or
line by line on the panels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File highlight</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify whether
permissions and file types should be highlighted with
distinctive Colors. If the permission highlighting is
enabled, the parts of the perm and mode dis&acirc; <br>
play fields which apply to the user running Midnight
Commander are highlighted with the color defined by the
selected keyword. If the file type highlighting is enabled,
file <br>
names are colored according to rules described in
/etc/mc/filehighlight.ini file. See Filenames Highlight for
more info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick search</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify how the Quick
search mode should work: case insensitively, case
sensitively or be matched to the panel sort order: case
sensitive or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Confirmation <br>
In this dialog you configure the confirmation options for
file deletion, overwriting files, execution by pressing
enter, quitting the program, directory hotlist entries
deletion <br>
and history cleanup. <br>
and.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display bits <br>
This is used to configure the range of visible characters on
the screen. This setting may be 7-bits if your
terminal/curses supports only seven output bits, ISO-8859-1
displays <br>
all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is
for those terminals that can display full 8 bit
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Learn keys <br>
This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys,
cursor arrows and some other keys to make them work properly
on your terminal. They often don&rsquo;t, since many
terminal <br>
databases are incomplete or broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can move around with the Tab
key and with the vi moving keys (&rsquo;h&rsquo; left,
&rsquo;j&rsquo; down, &rsquo;k&rsquo; up and &rsquo;l&rsquo;
right). Once you press any cursor movement key and it is
recognized, you can <br>
use that key as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can test keys just by
pressing each of them. When you press a key and it is
recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name of
that key. Once a key is marked OK it <br>
starts working as usually, e.g. F1 pressed the first time
will just check that the F1 key works, but after that it
will show help. The same applies to the arrow keys. The Tab
<br>
key should be working always.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If some keys do not work
properly then you won&rsquo;t see OK appear after pressing
one of these. Then you may want to redefine it. Do it by
pressing the button with the name of that <br>
key (either by the mouse or by Enter or Space after
selecting the button with Tab or arrows). Then a message box
will appear asking you to press that key. Do it and wait
until <br>
the message box disappears. If you want to abort, just press
Escape once and wait.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you finish with all the
keys, you can Save them. The definitions for the keys you
have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM]
section of your ~/.config/mc/ini <br>
file (where TERM is the name of your current terminal). The
definitions of the keys that were already working properly
are not saved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual FS <br>
This option gives you control over the settings of the
Virtual File System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Midnight Commander keeps in
memory the information related to some of the virtual file
systems to speed up the access to the files in the file
system (for example, directory <br>
listings fetched from FTP servers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, in order to access the
contents of compressed files (for example, compressed tar
files) the Midnight Commander needs to create temporary
uncompressed files on your disk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since both the information in
memory and the temporary files on disk take up resources,
you may want to tune the parameters of the cached
information to decrease your resource <br>
usage or to maximize the speed of access to frequently used
file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the format of the tar
archives, the Tar filesystem needs to read the whole file
just to load the file entries. Since most tar files are
usually kept compressed (plain <br>
tar files are species in extinction), the tar file system
has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary
location and then access the uncompressed file as a regular
tar <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, since we all love to browse
files and tar files all over the disk, it&rsquo;s common
that you will leave a tar file and then re-enter it later.
Since decompression is slow, the <br>
Midnight Commander will cache the information in memory for
a limited time. When the timeout expires, all the resources
associated with the file system are released. The <br>
default timeout is set to one minute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The FTP File System (ftpfs)
allows you to browse directories on remote FTP servers. It
has several options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp anonymous password is the
password used when you login as &quot;anonymous&quot;. Some
sites require a valid e-mail address. On the other hand, you
probably don&rsquo;t want to give your <br>
real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially if you
are not using spam filtering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftpfs keeps the directory
listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache. The cache
expire time is configurable with the ftpfs directory cache
timeout option. A low value for <br>
this option may slow down every operation on the ftpfs
because every operation would require sending a request to
the FTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can define an FTP proxy host
for doing FTP. Note that most modern firewalls are fully
transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so FTP
proxies are considered obso&acirc; <br>
lete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Always use ftp proxy is not
set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for
certain hosts. See FTP File System for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is set, the
program will do two things: consult the
/usr/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names
that are local (if the host name starts with a <br>
dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and to assume that any
hostnames without dots in their names are directly
accessible. All other hosts will be accessed through the
specified <br>
FTP proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can enable using ~/.netrc
file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers.
See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use passive mode enables using
FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is
initiated by the client, not by the server. This option is
recommended and enabled by <br>
default. If this option is turned off, the data connection
is initiated by the server. This may not work with some
firewalls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Save Setup <br>
At startup the Midnight Commander will try to load
initialization information from the ~/.config/mc/ini file.
If this file doesn&rsquo;t exist, it will load the
information from the <br>
system-wide configuration file, located in
/usr/share/mc/mc.ini. If the system-wide configuration file
doesn&rsquo;t exist, MC uses the default settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Save Setup command creates
the ~/.config/mc/ini file by saving the current settings of
the Left, Right and Options menus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you activate the auto save
setup option, MC will always save the current settings when
exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There also exist settings which
can&rsquo;t be changed from the menus. To change these
settings you have to edit the setup file with your favorite
editor. See the section on Special <br>
Settings for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Executing operating system
commands <br>
You may execute commands by typing them directly in the
Midnight Commander&rsquo;s input line, or by selecting the
program you want to execute with the selection bar in one of
the pan&acirc; <br>
els and hitting Enter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you press Enter over a file
that is not executable, the Midnight Commander checks the
extension of the selected file against the extensions in the
Extensions File. If a match <br>
is found then the code associated with that extension is
executed. A very simple macro expansion takes place before
executing the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The cd internal command <br>
The cd command is interpreted by the Midnight Commander, it
is not passed to the command shell for execution. Thus it
may not handle all of the nice macro expansion and
substi&acirc; <br>
tution that your shell does, although it does some of
them:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tilde substitution. The (~) will
be substituted with your home directory, if you append a
username after the tilde, then it will be substituted with
the login directory of the <br>
specified user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, ~guest is the home
directory for the user guest, while ~/guest is the directory
guest in your home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous directory. You can jump
to the directory you were previously by using the special
directory name &rsquo;-&rsquo; like this: cd -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDPATH directories. If the
directory specified to the cd command is not in the current
directory, then The Midnight Commander uses the value in the
environment variable CDPATH <br>
to search for the directory in any of the named
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example you could set your
CDPATH variable to ~/src:/usr/src, allowing you to change
your directory to any of the directories inside the ~/src
and /usr/src directories, from <br>
any place in the file system by using its relative name (for
example cd linux could take you to /usr/src/linux).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Macro Substitution <br>
When accessing a user menu, or executing an extension
dependent command, or running a command from the command
line input, a simple macro substitution takes place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The macros are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%i The indent of blank space,
equal the cursor column position. For edit menu only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%y The syntax type of current
file. For edit menu only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%k The block file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%e The error file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%m The current menu name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%f and %p <br>
The current file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%x The extension of current file
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%b The current file name without
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%d The current directory
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%F The current file in the
unselected panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%D The directory name of the
unselected panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%t The currently tagged
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T The tagged files in the
unselected panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%u and %U <br>
Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files
are untagged. You can use this macro only once per menu file
entry or extension file entry, because next time <br>
there will be no tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%s and %S <br>
The selected files: The tagged files if there are any.
Otherwise the current file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%cd This is a special macro that
is used to change the current directory to the directory
specified in front of it. This is used primarily as an
interface to the Virtual File <br>
System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%view This macro is used to
invoke the internal viewer. This macro can be used alone, or
with arguments. If you pass any arguments to this macro,
they should be enclosed in <br>
brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments are: ascii to
force the viewer into ascii mode; hex to force the viewer
into hex mode; nroff to tell the viewer that it should
interpret the bold and under&acirc; <br>
line sequences of nroff; unformatted to tell the viewer to
not interpret nroff commands for making the text bold or
underlined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%% The % character</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%{some text} <br>
Prompt for the substitution. An input box is shown and the
text inside the braces is used as a prompt. The macro is
substituted by the text typed by the user. The user can <br>
press ESC or F10 to cancel. This macro doesn&rsquo;t work on
the command line yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%var{ENV:default} <br>
If environment variable ENV is unset, the default is
substituted. Otherwise, the value of ENV is substituted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The subshell support <br>
The subshell support is a compile time option, that works
with the shells: bash, tcsh and zsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the subshell code is
activated the Midnight Commander will spawn a concurrent
copy of your shell (the one defined in the SHELL variable
and if it is not defined, then the <br>
one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in a pseudo
terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you
execute a command, the command will be passed to the
subshell as if <br>
you had typed it. This also allows you to change the
environment variables, use shell functions and define
aliases that are valid until you quit the Midnight
Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are using bash you can
specify startup commands for the subshell in your
~/.local/share/mc/bashrc file and special keyboard maps in
the ~/.local/share/mc/inputrc file. <br>
tcsh users may specify startup commands in the
~/.local/share/mc/tcshrc file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the subshell code is used,
you can suspend applications at any time with the sequence
C-o and jump back to the Midnight Commander, if you
interrupt an application, you will <br>
not be able to run other external commands until you quit
the application you interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An extra added feature of using
the subshell is that the prompt displayed by the Midnight
Commander is the same prompt that you are currently using in
your shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The OPTIONS section has more
information on how you can control the subshell code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chmod <br>
The Chmod window is used to change the attribute bits in a
group of files and directories. It can be invoked with the
C-x c key combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Chmod window has two parts -
Permissions and File.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the File section are
displayed the name of the file or directory and its
permissions in octal form, as well as its owner and
group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Permissions section there
is a set of check buttons which correspond to the file
attribute bits. As you change the attribute bits, you can
see the octal value change in <br>
the File section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To move between the widgets
(buttons and check buttons) use the arrow keys or the Tab
key. To change the state of the check buttons or to select a
button use Space. You can <br>
also use the hotkeys on the buttons to quickly activate
them. Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters on the
buttons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set the attribute bits, use
the Enter key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When working with a group of
files or directories, you just click on the bits you want to
set or clear. Once you have selected the bits you want to
change, you select one of the <br>
action buttons (Set marked or Clear marked).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, to set the attributes
exactly to those specified, you can use the [Set all]
button, which will act on all the tagged files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Marked all] set only marked
attributes to all selected files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Set marked] set marked bits in
attributes of all selected files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Clean marked] clear marked bits
in attributes of all selected files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Set] set the attributes of one
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Cancel] cancel the Chmod
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Chown <br>
The Chown command is used to change the owner/group of a
file. The hot key for this command is C-x o.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Advanced Chown <br>
The Advanced Chown command is the Chmod and Chown command
combined into one window. You can change the permissions and
owner/group of files at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Operations <br>
When you copy, move or delete files the Midnight Commander
shows the file operations dialog. It shows the files
currently being processed and uses up to three progress
bars. <br>
The file bar indicates the percentage of the current file
that has been processed so far. The count bar shows how many
of the tagged files have been handled. The bytes bar <br>
indicates the percentage of the total size of the tagged
files that has been handled. If the verbose option is off,
the file and bytes bars are not shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two buttons at the
bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip button will skip the
rest of the current file. Pressing the Abort button will
abort the whole operation, the <br>
rest of the files are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three other dialogs
which you can run into during the file operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The error dialog informs about
error conditions and has three choices. Normally you select
either the Skip button to skip the file or the Abort button
to abort the operation <br>
altogether. You can also select the Retry button if you
fixed the problem from another terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The replace dialog is shown when
you attempt to copy or move a file on the top of an existing
file. The dialog shows the dates and sizes of the both
files. Press the Yes button <br>
to overwrite the file, the No button to skip the file, the
All button to overwrite all the files, the None button to
never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the
<br>
source file is newer than the target file. You can abort the
whole operation by pressing the Abort button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The recursive delete dialog is
shown when you try to delete a directory which is not empty.
Press the Yes button to delete the directory recursively,
the No button to skip the <br>
directory, the All button to delete all the directories and
the None button to skip all the non-empty directories. You
can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort
but&acirc; <br>
ton. If you selected the Yes or All button you will be asked
for a confirmation. Type &quot;yes&quot; only if you are
really sure you want to do the recursive delete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have tagged files and
perform an operation on them only the files on which the
operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped files
are left tagged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mask Copy/Rename <br>
The copy/move operations let you translate the names of
files in an easy way. To do it, you have to specify the
correct source mask and usually in the trailing part of the
des&acirc; <br>
tination specify some wildcards. All the files matching the
source mask are copied/renamed according to the target mask.
If there are tagged files, only the tagged files
match&acirc; <br>
ing the source mask are renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are other options which
you can set:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Follow links</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">determines whether make the
symlinks and hardlinks in the source directory (recursively
in subdirectories) new links in the target directory or
whether would you like to copy <br>
their content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dive into subdirs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">determines the behavior when the
source directory is about to be copied, but the target
directory already exists. The default action is to copy the
contents of the source direc&acirc; <br>
tory into the target directory. Enabling this option causes
copying the source directory itself into the target
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you want to copy
directory /foo containing file bar to /bla/foo, which is an
already existing directory. Normally (when Dive into subdirs
is not set), mc would copy <br>
file /foo/bar into the file /bla/foo/bar. By enabling this
option the /bla/foo/foo directory will be created, and
/foo/bar will be copied into /bla/foo/foo/bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preserve attributes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">determines whether to preserve
the permissions, timestamps and (if you are root) the
ownership of the original files. If this option is not set,
the current value of the umask <br>
will be respected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use shell patterns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When this option is on you can
use the &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;?&rsquo; wildcards in the
source mask. They work like they do in the shell. In the
target mask only the &rsquo;*&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&lt;digit&gt;&rsquo; wildcards are <br>
allowed. The first &rsquo;*&rsquo; wildcard in the target
mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source
mask, the second &rsquo;*&rsquo; corresponds to the second
group and so on. The &rsquo;1&rsquo; <br>
wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the
source mask, the &rsquo;2&rsquo; wildcard corresponds to the
second group and so on all the way up to &rsquo;9&rsquo;.
The &rsquo; &rsquo; wildcard is the <br>
whole filename of the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source mask is
&quot;*.tar.gz&quot;, the destination is
&quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be copied is
&quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be &quot;foo.tgz&quot;
in &quot;/bla&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suppose you want to swap
basename and extension so that &quot;file.c&quot; would
become &quot;c.file&quot; and so on. The source mask for
this is &quot;*.*&quot; and the destination is
&quot;2.1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use shell patterns off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the shell patterns option
is off the MC doesn&rsquo;t do automatic grouping anymore.
You must use &rsquo;.&rsquo; expressions in the source mask
to specify meaning for the wildcards in <br>
the target mask. This is more flexible but also requires
more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar to the
situation when the shell patterns option is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source mask is
&quot;^.tar.gz$&quot;, the destination is
&quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be copied is
&quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be
&quot;/bla/foo.tgz&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s suppose you want to
swap basename and extension so that &quot;file.c&quot; will
become &quot;c.file&quot; and so on. The source mask for
this is &quot;^.$&quot; and the destination is <br>
&quot;2.1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Case Conversions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also change the case of
the filenames. If you use &rsquo;&rsquo; or &rsquo;n the
target mask, the next character will be converted to
uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you use &rsquo;U&rsquo; or
&rsquo;n the target mask, the next characters will be
converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to
the next &rsquo;&acute; or next &rsquo;U&rsquo;, &rsquo;r
the end of <br>
the file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;&rsquo; and &rsquo;re
stronger than &rsquo;U&rsquo; and &rsquo; For example, if
the source mask is &rsquo;*&rsquo; ( Use shell patterns on)
or &rsquo;^$&rsquo; ( Use shell patterns off) and the target
mask is &rsquo;*&rsquo; the file names will be converted to
have <br>
initial upper case and otherwise lower case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use &rsquo;&acute;
as a quote character. For example, &rsquo;\&rsquo; is a
backslash and &rsquo; is an asterisk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stable symlinks</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">commands Midnight Commander,
that it should change symlinks in the target, so that
they&rsquo;ll point to the same location as it did before.
With absolute symbolic links this does <br>
nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will recompute
its value, adding necessary ../ and other directory parts
and making the value as short as possible (most modern <br>
filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus
don&rsquo;t waste much disk space).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Select/Unselect Files <br>
The dialog of group of files and directories selection or
uselection. The input line allow enter the regular
expression of filenames that will be
selected/unselected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Files only checkbox is on,
only files will be selected. If Files only is off, as files
as directories will be selected. When Shell Patterns
checkbox is on, the regular <br>
expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell
(* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for
one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging
<br>
of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed
(1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will
be case sensitive characters. If Case sensitive is off, the
<br>
case will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Diff Viewer <br>
The mcdiff is a visual diff tool. You can compare two files
and edit them in-place (diffs are updated dynamically). You
can browse and view a working copy from popular version <br>
control systems (GIT, Subversion, etc).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following shortcuts are

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal File Viewer <br>
The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII
and hex. To toggle between modes, use the F4 key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The viewer will try to use the
best method provided by your system or the file type to
display the information. Some character sequences, which
appear most often in preformatted <br>
manual pages, are displayed bold and underlined, thus making
a pretty display of your files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When in hex mode, the search
function accepts text in quotes and constant numbers. Text
in quotes is matched exactly after removing the quotes. Each
number matches one byte. <br>
You can mix quoted text with constants like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;String&quot; -1 0xBB 012
&quot;more text&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that 012 is an octal
number. -1 is converted to 0xFF.</p>

key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro commands;
regular expression search and <br>
replace; shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported by the
terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent;
tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sections:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options of editor in
ini-file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The editor is very easy to use
and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do what, just
consult the appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys are:
Shift movement keys do text high&acirc; <br>
lighting. Ctrl-Ins copies to the file mcedit.clip and
Shift-Ins pastes from mcedit.clip. Shift-Del cuts to
mcedit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted text. Mouse
highlight&acirc; <br>
ing also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by
holding down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let
normal terminal mouse highlighting work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To define a macro, press Ctrl-R
and then type out the key strokes you want to be executed.
Press Ctrl-R again when finished. You can then assign the
macro to any key you like by <br>
pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press
Ctrl-A and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed
if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key,
pro&acirc; <br>
vided that the key is not used for any other function. Once
defined, the macro commands go into the file
~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros You can delete a
macro by deleting <br>
the appropriate line in this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To change charset of displayed
text may use M-e (Alt-e). Recoding is made from selected
codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you
may select &quot;&lt;No translation&gt;&quot; <br>
in charset selection dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F19 will format the currently
highlighted block (plain text or C or C++ code or another).
This is controlled by the file /usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc
which is copied to <br>
~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc in your home
directory the first time you use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The editor also displays non-us
characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set
display bits to 7 bits in the options menu to keep the
spacing clean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options of editor in ini-file
<br>
Some editor options of ini-file are described in this
section. Options are placed in [Midnight-Commander]
section</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
<br>
Search autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just
from begin of file to cursor position (0)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen selector <br>
Midnight Commander supports running many internal modules
(such as editor, viewer and diff viewer) simultaneously and
switching between them without closing open files. Using
<br>
several file managers at a time, however, is not currently
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s call each of these
modules a screen. There are three ways to switch between
screens, using one of these global shortcuts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-} switch to the next
screen;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-{ switch to the previous
screen;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alt-&lsquo; open a dialog window
with the list of currently open screens (or use the
&quot;Screen list&quot; menu item).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Completion <br>
Let the Midnight Commander type for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attempt to perform completion on
the text before current position. MC attempts completion
treating the text as variable (if the text begins with $),
username (if the text begins <br>
with ~), hostname (if the text begins with @) or command (if
you are on the command line in the position where you might
type a command, possible completions then include shell <br>
reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn.
If none of these matches, filename completion is
attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filename, username, variable and
hostname completion works on all input lines, command
completion is command line specific. If the completion is
ambiguous (there are more dif&acirc; <br>
ferent possibilities), MC beeps and the following action
depends on the setting of the Complete: show all option in
the Configuration dialog. If it is enabled, a list of all
<br>
possibilities pops up next to the current position and you
can select with the arrow keys and Enter the correct entry.
You can also type the first letters in which the
possibil&acirc; <br>
ities differ to move to a subset of all possibilities and
complete as much as possible. If you press Alt-Tab again,
only the subset will be shown in the listbox, otherwise the
<br>
first item which matches all the previous characters will be
highlighted. As soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog
disappears, but you can hide it by canceling keys Esc, F10
and <br>
left and right arrow keys. If Complete: show all is
disabled, the dialog pops up only if you press Alt-Tab for
the second time, for the first time MC just beeps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Virtual File System <br>
The Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to
access the file system; this code layer is known as the
virtual file system switch. The virtual file system switch
allows <br>
the Midnight Commander to manipulate files not located on
the Unix file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently the Midnight Commander
is packaged with some Virtual File Systems (VFS): the local
file system, used for accessing the regular Unix file
system; the ftpfs, used to <br>
manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol;
the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files;
the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file
sys&acirc; <br>
tems (the default file system for Linux systems), fish (for
manipulating files over shell connections such as rsh and
ssh). If the code was compiled with sftpfs (for
manipulat&acirc; <br>
ing files over SFTP connections). If the code was compiled
with smbfs support, you can manipulate files on remote
systems with the SMB (CIFS) protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A generic extfs (EXTernal
virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand
VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The VFS switch code will
interpret all of the path names used and will forward them
to the correct file system, the formats used for each one of
the file systems is described <br>
later in their own section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FTP File System <br>
The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files
on remote machines. To actually use it, you can use the FTP
link item in the menu or directly change your current <br>
directory using the cd command to a path name that looks
like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user, port and remote-dir
elements are optional. If you specify the user element, the
Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as that
user, otherwise it will use <br>
anonymous login or the login name from the ~/.netrc file.
The optional pass element is the password used for the
connection. Using the password in the VFS directory name is
not <br>
recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear
text and can be saved to the directory history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To enable using FTP proxy,
prepend ! (an exclamation sign) to the hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
<br>
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages <br>
ftp://!behind.firewall.edu/pub <br>
ftp://guest@remote-host.com:40/pub <br>
ftp://miguel:xxx@server/pub</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please check the Virtual File
System dialog box for ftpfs options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tar File System <br>
The tar file system provides you with read-only access to
your tar files and compressed tar files by using the chdir
command. To change your directory to a tar file, you change
<br>
your current directory to the tar file by using the
following syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/filename.tar/utar://[dir-inside-tar]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mc.ext file already provides
a shortcut for tar files, this means that usually you just
point to a tar file and press return to enter into the tar
file, see the Extension <br>
File Edit section for details on how this is done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mc-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc-3.0/vfs
<br>
/ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar/utar://</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latter specifies the full
path of the tar archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FIle transfer over SHell
filesystem <br>
The fish file system is a network based file system that
allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if
they were local. To use this, the other side has to either
<br>
run fish server, or has to have bash-compatible shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To connect to a remote machine,
you just need to chdir into a special directory which name
is in the following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user, options and remote-dir
elements are optional. If you specify the user element, the
Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote machine
as that user, otherwise <br>
it will use your login name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The available options are: <br>
&rsquo;C&rsquo; - use compression; <br>
&rsquo;r&rsquo; - use rsh instead of ssh; <br>
port - specify the port used by remote server. <br>
If the remote-dir element is present, your current directory
on the remote machine will be set to this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
<br>
sh://joe@want.compression.edu:C/private <br>
sh://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private <br>
sh://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SFTP (SSH File Transfer
Protocol) filesystem <br>
The SFTP file system is a network based file system that
allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if
they were local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To connect to a remote machine,
you just need to chdir into a special directory which name
is in the following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">sftp://[user@]machine:[port]/[remote-dir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user, port and remote-dir
elements are optional. If you specify the user element, the
Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote machine
as that user, otherwise it <br>
will use your login name. port - specify the port used by
remote server (22 by default). If the remote-dir element is
present, your current directory on the remote machine will
<br>
be set to this one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sftp://onlyrsh.mx/linux/local
<br>
sftp://joe:password@want.compression.edu/private <br>
sftp://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private <br>
sftp://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undelete File System <br>
On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs
undelete facilities, you will have the undelete file system
available. Recovery of deleted files is only available on
<br>
ext2 file systems. The undelete file system is just an
interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve all of the
deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract
the <br>
selected files into a regular partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use this file system, you
have to chdir into the special file name formed by the
&quot;undel://&quot; prefix and the file name where the
actual file system resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to recover deleted
files on the second partition of the first SCSI disk on
Linux, you would use the following path name:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undel://sda2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may take a while for the
undelfs to load the required information before you start
browsing files there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMB File System <br>
The smbfs allows you to manipulate files on remote machines
with SMB (or CIFS) protocol. These include Windows for
Workgroups, Windows 9x/ME/XP, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and
<br>
Samba. To actually use it, you may try to use the panel
command &quot;SMB link...&quot; (accessible from the
menubar) or you may directly change your current directory
to it using the cd <br>
command to a path name that looks like this:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">smb://[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user, service and remote-dir
elements are optional. The user, domain and password can be
specified in an input dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">smb://machine/Share <br>
smb://other_machine <br>
smb://guest@machine/Public/Irlex</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTernal File System <br>
extfs allows you to integrate numerous features and file
types into GNU Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Extfs filesystems can be divided
into two categories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Stand-alone filesystems,
which are not associated with any existing file. They
represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree. You
can invoke them by typing &rsquo;cd <br>
fsname://&rsquo; where fsname is an extfs short name (see
below). Examples of such filesystems include audio (list
audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages
in the <br>
system).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to list CD-Audio
tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd audio://</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. &rsquo;Archive&rsquo;
filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent
contents of a file as a directory tree. It can consist of
&rsquo;real&rsquo; files compressed in an archive (urar,
<br>
rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a mailbox (mailfs)
or parts of a patch (patchfs). To access such filesystems
&rsquo;fsname://&rsquo; should be appended to the archive
name. Note <br>
that the archive itself can be on another vfs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to list contents of
a zip archive documents.zip type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd documents.zip/uzip://</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many aspects, you could treat
extfs like any other directory. For instance, you can add it
to the hotlist or change to it from directory history. An
important limitation is <br>
that you cannot invoke shell commands inside extfs, just
like any other non-local VFS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Common extfs scripts included
with Midnight Commander are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a access &rsquo;A:&rsquo;
DOS/Windows diskette (cd a://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">apt front end to Debian&rsquo;s
APT package management system (cd apt://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">audio audio CD ripping and
playing (cd audio:// or cd device/audio://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bpp package of Bad Penguin
GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.bpp/bpp://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deb package of Debian GNU/Linux
distribution (cd file.deb/deb://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dpkg Debian GNU/Linux installed
packages (cd deb://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hp48 view and copy files to/from
a HP48 calculator (cd hp48://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lslR browsing of lslR listings
as found on many FTPs (cd filename/lslR://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mailfs mbox-style mailbox files
support (cd mailbox/mailfs://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">patchfs <br>
extfs to handle unified and context diffs (cd
filename/patchfs://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpm RPM package (cd
filename/rpm://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rpms RPM database management (cd
rpms://).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha
<br>
archivers (cd archive/xxxx:// where xxxx is one of: ulha,
urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You could bind file
type/extension to specified extfs as described in the
Extension File Edit section. Here is an example entry for
Debian packages:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regex/.deb$ <br>
Open=%cd %p/deb://</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors <br>
The Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal
supports color using the terminal database and your terminal
name. Sometimes it gets confused, so you may force color
<br>
mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b flag
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the program is compiled with
the Slang screen manager instead of ncurses, it will also
check the variable COLORTERM, if it is set, it has the same
effect as the -c flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may specify terminals that
always force color mode by adding the color_terminals
variable to the Colors section of the initialization file.
This will prevent the Midnight <br>
Commander from trying to detect if your terminal supports
color. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Colors] <br>
color_terminals=linux,xterm <br>
color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program can be compiled with
both ncurses and slang, ncurses does not provide a way to
force color mode: ncurses uses just the information in the
terminal database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Midnight Commander provides
a way to change the default colors. Currently the colors are
configured using the environment variable MC_COLOR_TABLE or
the Colors section in <br>
the initialization file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Colors section, the
default color map is loaded from the base_color variable.
You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal by
using the terminal name as the key <br>
in this section. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Colors] <br>
base_color= <br>
xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format for the color
definition is:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The colors are optional, and the
keywords are: normal, selected, disabled, marked,
markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged,
commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, <br>
inputhistory, commandhistory. Button bar colors are:
bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar color: statusbar. Menu
colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel,
menuinactive. <br>
Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus,
dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal,
errdhotfocus, errdtitle. Help colors are: helpnormal,
hel&acirc; <br>
pitalic, helpbold, helplink, helpslink, helptitle. Viewer
color are: viewbold, viewunderline, viewselected. Editor
colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked,
editwhitespace, <br>
editlinestate. Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal, pmenusel,
pmenutitle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header determines the color of
panel header, the line that contains column titles and sort
mode indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">input determines the color of
input lines used in query dialogs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gauge determines the color of
the filled part of the progress bar (gauge), which is used
to show the user the progress of file operations, such as
copying.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disabled determines the color of
the widget that cannot be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The dialog boxes use the
following colors: dnormal is used for the normal text,
dfocus is the color used for the currently selected
component, dhotnormal is the color used to <br>
differentiate the hotkey color in normal components, whereas
the dhotfocus color is used for the highlighted color in the
currently selected component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Menus use the same scheme but
uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel and
menuinactive tags instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Help uses the following colors:
helpnormal is used for normal text, helpitalic is used for
text which is emphasized in italic in the manual page,
helpbold is used for text which <br>
is emphasized in bold in the manual page, helplink is used
for not selected hyperlinks and helpslink is used for
selected hyperlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Popup menu uses following
colors: pmenunormal is used for non-selected menu items and
as a main color of popup menu window, pmenusel is used for
selected menu item, pmenutitle is <br>
used for popup menu title.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible colors are: black,
gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow,
blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan,
lightgray and white. And <br>
there is a special keyword for transparent background. It is
&rsquo;default&rsquo;. The &rsquo;default&rsquo; can only be
used for background color. Another special keyword
&quot;base&quot; means mc&rsquo;s main col&acirc; <br>
ors. When 256 colors are available, they can be specified
either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and
gray0 to gray23. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Colors] <br>
base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes can be any of bold,
underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if
more than one are desired. The special word &quot;none&quot;
means no attributes, without attempt&acirc; <br>
ing to fall back to base_color. Example:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Skins <br>
You can change the appearance of Midnight Commander. To do
this, you must specify a file that contain descriptions of
colors and lines to draw boxes. Redefining of the colors is
<br>
entirely compatible with the assignment of colors, as
described in Section Colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your skin contains any of
256-color definitions, you should define the
&rsquo;256colors&rsquo; key set to TRUE value in [skin]
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A skin-file is searched on the
following algorithm (to the first one found):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) command line option -S
&lt;skin&gt; or --skin=&lt;skin&gt; <br>
2) Environment variable MC_SKIN <br>
3) Parameter skin in section [Midnight-Commander] in config

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Compatibility <br>
Appointment of color by skin-files fully compatible with the
appointment of the colors described in Colors. section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, reassignment of
colors has priority over the skin file and is
complementary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames Highlight <br>
Section [filehighlight] in current skin-file contains key
names as highlight groups and values as color pairs. Color
pairs is documented in Skins section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rules of filenames highlight are
placed in /usr/share/mc/filehighlight.ini file
(~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini). Name of section in this
file must be equal to parameters names <br>
in [filehighlight] section (in current skin-file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys in these groups are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type file type. If present, all
other options are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">regexp regular expression. If
present, &rsquo;extensions&rsquo; option is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extensions <br>
list of extensions of files. Separated by &rsquo;;&rsquo;
sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extensions_case <br>
(make sense only with &rsquo;extensions&rsquo; parameter)
make &rsquo;extensions&rsquo; rule case sensitive (true) or
not (false).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;type&rsquo; key may have
values: <br>
- FILE (all files) <br>
- FILE_EXE <br>
- DIR (all directories) <br>
- LINK_DIR <br>
- LINK (all links except stale link) <br>
- HARDLINK <br>
- SYMLINK <br>

- DEVICE_BLOCK <br>
- DEVICE_CHAR <br>
- SPECIAL (all special files) <br>
- SPECIAL_SOCKET <br>
- SPECIAL_FIFO <br>
- SPECIAL_DOOR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special Settings <br>
Most of the Midnight Commander settings can be changed from
the menus. However, there are a small number of settings
which can only be changed by editing the setup file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These variables may be set in
your ~/.config/mc/ini file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clear_before_exec <br>
By default the Midnight Commander clears the screen before
executing a command. If you would prefer to see the output
of the command at the bottom of the screen, edit <br>
your ~/.config/mc/ini file and change the value of the field
clear_before_exec to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">confirm_view_dir <br>
If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that
directory. If this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for
confirmation before changing the directory if you have <br>
files tagged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftpfs_retry_seconds <br>
This value is the number of seconds the Midnight Commander
will wait before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server
that has denied the login. If the value is zero, the <br>
login will no be retried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">max_dirt_limit <br>
Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in
the internal file viewer. Normally this value is not
significant, because the code automatically adjusts the <br>
number of updates to skip according to the rate of incoming
keystrokes. However, on very slow machines or terminals with
a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make <br>
screen updates too jumpy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It seems that setting
max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior, and that is
the default value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mouse_move_pages_viewer <br>
Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or
line by line on the internal file viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">only_leading_plus_minus <br>
Allow special treatment for &rsquo;+&rsquo;,
&rsquo;-&rsquo;, &rsquo;*&rsquo; in the command line
(select, unselect, reverse selection) only if the command
line is empty. You don&rsquo;t need to quote those
char&acirc; <br>
acters in the middle of the command line. On the other hand,
you cannot use them to change selection when the command
line is not empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">show_output_starts_shell <br>
This variable only works if you are not using the subshell
support. When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the
user screen, if this one is set, you will get a fresh <br>
shell. Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back to
the Midnight Commander.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeformat_recent <br>
Change the time format used to display dates less than 6
months from now. See strftime or date man page for the
format specification. If this option is absent, default <br>
timeformat is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">timeformat_old <br>
Change the time format used to display dates older than 6
months from now or for dates in the future. See strftime or
date man page for the format specification. If this <br>
option is absent, default timeformat is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">torben_fj_mode <br>
If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work
slightly different on the panels, instead of moving the
selection to the first and last files in the panels, they
<br>
will act as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The home key will: Go up to the
middle line, if below it; else go to the top line unless it
is already on the top line, in this case it will go to the
first file in the <br>
panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The end key has a similar
behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it; else go to
the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom line,
in such case it will move <br>
the selection to the last file name in the panel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_file_to_guess_type <br>
If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file
command to match the file types listed on the mc.ext
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xtree_mode <br>
If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the
file system on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload
the other panel with the contents of the selected <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fish_directory_timeout <br>
This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry
in seconds. The default value is 900 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clipboard_store <br>
This variable contains path (with options) to the external
clipboard utility like &rsquo;xclip&rsquo; to read text into
X selection from file. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clipboard_store=xclip -i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clipboard_paste <br>
This variable contains path (with options) to the external
clipboard utility like &rsquo;xclip&rsquo; to print the
selection to standard out. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">clipboard_pastee=xclip -o</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autodetect_codeset <br>
This option allows use the &lsquo;enca&rsquo; command to
autodetect codeset of text files in internal viewer and
editor. List of valid values can be obtain by the
&lsquo;enca --list lan&acirc; <br>
guages | cut -d : -f1&rsquo; command. Option must be located
in the [Misc] section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autodetect_codeset=russian</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Terminal databases <br>
The Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system
terminal database without requiring root privileges. The
Midnight Commander searches in the system initialization
file <br>
(the mc.lib file located in the Midnight Commander library
directory) and in the ~/.config/mc/ini file for the section
&quot;terminal:your-terminal-name&quot; and then for the
section <br>
&quot;terminal:general&quot;, each line of the section
contains a key symbol that you want to define, followed by
an equal sign and the definition for the key. You can use
the special \ <br>
form to represent the escape character and the ^x to
represent the control-x character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible key symbols
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">f0 to f20 Function keys f0-f20
<br>
bs backspace <br>
home home key <br>
end end key <br>
up up arrow key <br>
down down arrow key <br>
left left arrow key <br>
right right arrow key <br>
pgdn page down key <br>
pgup page up key <br>
insert the insert character <br>
delete the delete character <br>
complete to do completion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to define the key
insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set this in the ini
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">insert=\[Op</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also now you can use extended
learn keys. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctrl-alt-right=\[[1;6C <br>
ctrl-alt-left=\[[1;6D</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This means that ctrl+alt+left
sends a \[[1;6D escape sequence and therefore Midnight
Commander interprets &quot;\[[1;6D&quot; as
Ctrl-Alt-Left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The complete key symbol
represents the escape sequences used to invoke the
completion process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you
can define other keys to do the same work (on <br>
those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys
everywhere).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Full paths below may vary between installations. They are
also affected by the MC_DATADIR environment variable. If
it&rsquo;s set, its value is used instead of /usr/share/mc
in the <br>
paths below.</p>
