<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppreplay [ option ... ] [
VAR=value ] [ target ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mppr [ option ... ] [ VAR=value
] [ target ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makeppreplay tries to do the
same things makepp did. It does this solely based on the
remembered build info, saving much time by not reading
makefiles, not parsing commands, not <br>
scanning files and not looking at every repository file, to
see whether it fits. But unlike makepp it reuses all
repository links it finds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It does not know about phony or
default targets, so you have to give it real files or
directories, as a shortcut for all files makepp has built
therein. By default it builds all <br>
files makepp built in the current or chosen directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This approach is only correct
when there are no structural changes, i.e. no different
modules to be linked, no moved files, no different
&quot;#include&quot; statements, which should <br>
possibly have caused those files to be (re)built. After
updating from version control, or when building against a
repository, where others may have caused such changes, you
<br>
should call makepp once after potential changes (e.g. in the
morning after an overnight repository update), to be sure
your build infos are up to date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Not reading makefiles means, it
will not know any subs (Perl functions) defined in them. For
this you should put all your functions into an external
module. It will also not <br>
know about any variable settings, which is only a problem if
your Perl code accesses them (because in rule actions they
have already been expanded).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TODO <br>
This is still experimental and imperfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Build up a
complete dependency tree starting from the given targets and
decide which of them to build based on their build check
methods. That requires the method to be <br>
remembered in the build info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; After
implementing the previous bullet item, accept more makepp
opts, like &quot;-j&quot; or &quot;--dont-build&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Allow build
cache with implicit &quot;--no-populate-bc&quot; (because
makeppreplay doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a correct build).
Makepp might later publish to the build cache anything it
<br>
retains.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Have makepp
remember build info for all failed commands and for those it
didn&rsquo;t attempt because their dependencies failed. This
is only partially possible, because <br>
dependencies may only be found out after building the files
that require them. What should happen with (a has no build
info):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a: b <br>
b: c <br>
cmd_producing_a_and_b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options include some of the makepp options, plus two new
ones, for loading modules that would normally be loaded from
a makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A filename <br>
--args-file=filename <br>
--arguments-file=filename <br>
Read the file and parse it as possibly quoted whitespace-
and/or newline-separated options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C directory <br>
--directory=directory <br>
Cd to the given directory before loading the makefile and
trying to build the targets. This is more or less equivalent
to specifying a directory with &quot;-F&quot;, except that
<br>
subsequent &quot;-C&quot;, &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-F&quot;,
&quot;-I&quot; and &quot;-R&quot; options are interpreted
relative to the new directory, rather than the old one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c <br>
--root-dir <br>
--root-directory <br>
Cd up to the directory containing a RootMakeppfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I directory <br>
--include=directory <br>
--include-dir=directory <br>
Add directory to Perl load path @INC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? <br>
-h <br>
--help <br>
Print out a brief summary of the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k <br>
--keep-going <br>
Build as many files as possible, even if some of them have
errors. By default, makepp stops when it encounters the
first error, even if there are other files that need to be
<br>
built that don&rsquo;t depend on the erroneous file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log=logfilename <br>
--log-file=logfilename <br>
Changes the name of the log file to the indicated name. By
default, the log file is called .makepp/log. This file is
readable with makepplog, mppl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M module[=arg,...] <br>
--module=module[=arg,...] <br>
Load module and import any functions it exports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--dry-run <br>
--just-print <br>
--recon <br>
Print out commands without actually executing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-log <br>
Don&rsquo;t bother writing a detailed description of what
was done to the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-print-directory <br>
Turn off the entering or leaving directory messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--profile <br>
Output raw timestamps before and after each action.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s perl-expression <br>
--sed=perl-expression <br>
Run the perl expression against the command before. running
it, like for preprocessor &quot;-s &rsquo;s/ -c / -E /;
s/.oig&rsquo;&quot;. This would transform a compilation
command (&quot;-c&quot;) <br>
into a preprocessor (&quot;-E&quot;) invocation, changing
the .o suffix to .i, which is a conventional suffix for
preprocessed C. Or you might want to add some debug output
to your <br>
linker. If you have only one command in the rule, you can do
this by substituting it into the first space: &quot;-s
&rsquo;s/ / -Wl,-t /&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the command is altered,
nothing is remembered about this, i.e. makepp will think you
have manually modified the file, causing a rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that (unlike makepp)
makeppreplay does not parse the command, so it won&rsquo;t
notice that the target filename was changed. So you must
still request the .o target, even <br>
though a .i will be built. And makeppclean won&rsquo;t know
to remove it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t <br>
--temporary <br>
Makeppreplay modifies the build info of all files it touched
and of all dependencies it found modified. It marks them in
such a way that makepp nevertheless knows that it <br>
needs to rescan these files. But with this option you can
prevent these modifications, so that makepp will simply
consider all files makeppreplay created as incorrect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Print out the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-warn <br>
Don&rsquo;t print any warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Probably the most common use is relinking either a program
or a library after editing a source file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">makeppreplay subdir/foo.o
bin/bar <br>
mppr subdir/foo.o lib/libbar.so</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Makeppreplay looks at the following environment
variable:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$MAKEPPREPLAYFLAGS <br>
Any options you may want to always pass.</p>
