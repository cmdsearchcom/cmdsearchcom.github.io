<p style="margin-top: 1em">qstat -B [-f [-1]][-W
site_specific] [-l] [server_name...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qstat -t</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The qstat command is used to request the status of jobs,
queues, or a batch server. The requested status is written
to standard out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When requesting job status,
synopsis format 1 or 2, qstat will output information about
each job_identifier or all jobs at each destination. Jobs
for which the user does not <br>
have status privilege are not displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When requesting queue or server
status, synopsis format 3 through 5, qstat will output
information about each destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f Specifies that a full status display be written to
standard out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a &quot;All&quot; jobs are
displayed in the alternative format, see the Standard Output
section. If the operand is a destination id, all jobs at
that destination are displayed. <br>
If the operand is a job id, information about that job is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e If the operand is a job id or
not specified, only jobs in executable queues are displayed.
Setting the PBS_QSTAT_EXECONLY environment variable will
also enable this <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Job status is displayed in
the alternative format. For a destination id operand, status
for jobs at that destination which are not running are
displayed. This <br>
includes jobs which are queued, held or waiting. If an
operand is a job id, status for that job is displayed
regardless of its state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r If an operand is a job id,
status for that job is displayed. For a destination id
operand, status for jobs at that destination which are
running are displayed, this <br>
includes jobs which are suspended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n In addition to the basic
information, nodes allocated to a job are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 In combination with -n, the
-1 option puts all of the nodes on the same line as the job
ID. In combination with -f, attributes are not folded to fit
in a terminal win&acirc; <br>
dow. This is intended to ease the parsing of the qstat
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s In addition to the basic
information, any comment provided by the batch administrator
or scheduler is shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Show size information in
giga-bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Show size information, disk
or memory in mega-words. A word is considered to be 8
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R In addition to other
information, disk reservation information is shown. Not
applicable to all systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Normal qstat output displays
a summary of the array instead of the entire array, job for
job. qstat -t expands the output to display the entire
array. Note that arrays <br>
are now named with brackets following the array name; for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo sleep 20 | qsub -t 0-299
189[].pali</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Individual jobs in the array are
now also noted using square brackets instead of dashes; for
example, here is part of the output of qstat -t for the
preceding array:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">189[299].napali STDIN[299] dbeer
0 Q batch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Job status is displayed in
the alternative format. If an operand is a job id, status
for that job is displayed. For a destination id operand,
status for jobs at that <br>
destination which are owned by the user(s) listed in
user_list are displayed. The syntax of the user_list is:
<br>
user_name[@host][,user_name[@host],...] <br>
Host names may be wild carded on the left end, e.g.
&quot;*.nasa.gov&quot;. User_name without a
&quot;@host&quot; is equivalent to &quot;user_name@*&quot;,
that is at any host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Specifies that the request is
for queue status and that the operands are destination
identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Specifies that the request is
for queue status which should be shown in the alternative
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Specifies that the request is
for batch server status and that the operands are the names
of servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Specifies that the output is
to be displayed in XML form. This option is only valid with
the -f option or by itself, which will also specify the -f
full status dis&acirc; <br>
play.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Specifies that the long name
of the job (or the job name appended with the suffix alias)
should be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
If neither the -Q nor the -B option is given, the operands
on the qstat command must be either job identifiers or
destinations identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the operand is a job
identifier, it must be in the following form: <br>
sequence_number[.server_name][@server] <br>
where sequence_number.server_name is the job identifier
assigned at submittal time, see qsub. If the .server_name is
omitted, the name of the default server will be used. If
<br>
@server is supplied, the request will be for the job
identifier currently at that Server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the operand is a destination
identifier, it is one of the following three forms: <br>
queue <br>
@server <br>
queue@server <br>
If queue is specified, the request is for status of all jobs
in that queue at the default server. If the @server form is
given, the request is for status of all jobs at that <br>
server. If a full destination identifier, queue@server, is
given, the request is for status of all jobs in the named
queue at the named server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -Q option is given, the
operands are destination identifiers as specified above. If
queue is specified, the status of that queue at the default
server will be given. If <br>
queue@server is specified, the status of the named queue at
the named server will be given. If @server is specified, the
status of all queues at the named server will be given. <br>
If no destination is specified, the status of all queues at
the default server will be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -B option is given, the
operand is the name of a server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD OUTPUT <br>
Displaying Job Status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If job status is being displayed
in the default format and the -f option is not specified,
the following items are displayed on a single line, in the
specified order, separated <br>
by white space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job identifier assigned by
PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job name given by the
submitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job owner</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the CPU time used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job state: <br>
C - Job is completed after having run/ <br>
E - Job is exiting after having run. <br>
H - Job is held. <br>
Q - job is queued, eligible to run or routed. <br>
R - job is running. <br>
T - job is being moved to new location. <br>
W - job is waiting for its execution time <br>
(-a option) to be reached. <br>
S - (Unicos only) job is suspend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the queue in which the job
resides</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If job status is being displayed
and the -f option is specified, the output will depend on
whether qstat was compiled to use a Tcl interpreter. See the
configuration section for <br>
details. If Tcl is not being used, full display for each job
consists of the header line: <br>
Job Id: job identifier <br>
Followed by one line per job attribute of the form: <br>
attribute_name = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the options -a, -i,
-r, -u, -n, -s, -G or -M are provided, the alternative
display format for jobs is used. The following items are
displayed on a single line, in the <br>
specified order, separated by white space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job identifier assigned by
PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The queue in which the job
currently resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The job name given by the
submitter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The session id (if the job is
running).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of nodes requested
by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of cpus or tasks
requested by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of memory requested
by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Either the cpu time, if
specified, or wall time requested by the job, (hh:mm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The job&rsquo;s current
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of cpu time or wall
time used by the job (hh:mm). <br>
If the -R option is provided, the line contains:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job identifier assigned by
PBS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the job owner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The queue in which the job
currently resides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of nodes requested
by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The number of cpus or tasks
requested by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of memory requested
by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Either the cpu time or wall
time requested by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The job&rsquo;s current
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of cpu time or wall
time used by the job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of SRFS space
requested on the big file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of SRFS space
requested on the fast file system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- The amount of space requested
on the parallel I/O file system. <br>
The last three fields may not contain useful information at
all sites or on all systems. <br>
Note: Remaining walltime does not account for walltime
multiplication factors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displaying Queue Status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If queue status is being
displayed and the -f option was not specified, the following
items are displayed on a single line, in the specified
order, separated by white space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the queue name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum number of jobs
that may be run in the queue concurrently</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the total number of jobs in
the queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the enable or disabled status
of the queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the started or stopped status
of the queue</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- for each job state, the name
of the state and the number of jobs in the queue in that
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the type of queue, execution
or routing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If queue status is being
displayed and the -f option is specified, the output will
depend on whether qstat was compiled to use a Tcl
interpreter. See the configuration section <br>
for details. If Tcl is not being used, the full display for
each queue consists of the header line: <br>
Queue: queue_name <br>
Followed by one line per queue attribute of the form: <br>
attribute_name = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -q option is specified,
queue information is displayed in the alternative format:
The following information is displayed on a single line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the queue name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum amount of memory a
job in the queue may request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum amount of cpu time
a job in the queue may request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum amount of wall
time a job in the queue may request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum amount of nodes a
job in the queue may request</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the number of jobs in the
queue in the running state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the number of jobs in the
queue in the queued state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum number (limit) of
jobs that may be run in the queue concurrently</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the state of the queue given
by a pair of letters: <br>
- either the letter E if the queue is Enabled or D if
Disabled, and <br>
- either the letter R if the queue is Running (started) or S
if Stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Displaying Server Status</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If batch server status is being
displayed and the -f option is not specified, the following
items are displayed on a single line, in the specified
order, separated by white <br>
space:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the server name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the maximum number of jobs
that the server may run concurrently</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the total number of jobs
currently managed by the server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- the status of the server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- for each job state, the name
of the state and the number of jobs in the server in that
state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If server status is being
displayed and the -f option is specified, the output will
depend on whether qstat was compiled to use a Tcl
interpreter. See the configuration section <br>
for details. If Tcl is not being used, the full display for
the server consist of the header line: <br>
Server: server name <br>
Followed by one line per server attribute of the form: <br>
attribute_name = value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STANDARD ERROR <br>
The qstat command will write a diagnostic message to
standard error for each error occurrence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
If qstat is compiled with an option to include a Tcl
interpreter, using the -f flag to get a full display causes
a check to be made for a script file to use to output the
<br>
requested information. The first location checked is
$HOME/.qstatrc. If this does not exist, the next location
checked is administrator configured. If one of these is
found, a <br>
Tcl interpreter is started and the script file is passed to
it along with three global variables. The command line
arguments are split into two variable named flags and
operands <br>
. The status information is passed in a variable named
objects . All of these variables are Tcl lists. The flags
list contains the name of the command (usually
&quot;qstat&quot;) as its <br>
first element. Any other elements are command line option
flags with any options they use, presented in the order
given on the command line. They are broken up individually
so <br>
that if two flags are given together on the command line,
they are separated in the list. For example, if the user
typed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qstat -QfWbigdisplay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the flags list would contain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qstat -Q -f -W bigdisplay</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operands list contains all
other command line arguments following the flags. There will
always be at least one element in operands because if no
operands are typed by the <br>
user, the default destination or server name is used. The
objects list contains all the information retrieved from the
server(s) so the Tcl interpreter can run once to format <br>
the entire output. This list has the same number of elements
as the operands list. Each element is another list with two
elements. The first element is a string giving the <br>
type of objects to be found in the second. The string can
take the values &quot;server&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;,
&quot;job&quot; or &quot;error&quot;. The second element
will be a list in which each element is a sin&acirc; <br>
gle batch status object of the type given by the string
discussed above. In the case of &quot;error&quot;, the list
will be empty. Each object is again a list. The first
element is the <br>
name of the object. The second is a list of attributes. The
third element will be the object text. All three of these
object elements correspond with fields in the structure <br>
batch_status which is described in detail for each type of
object by the man pages for pbs_statjob(3), pbs_statque(3),
and pbs_statserver(3). Each attribute in the second
ele&acirc; <br>
ment list whose elements correspond with the attrl
structure. Each will be a list with two elements. The first
will be the attribute name and the second will be the
attribute <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
Upon successful processing of all the operands presented to
the qstat command, the exit status will be a value of
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the qstat command fails to
process any operand, the command exits with a value greater
than zero.</p>
