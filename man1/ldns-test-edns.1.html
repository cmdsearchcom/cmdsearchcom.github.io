<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ldns-test-edns - test if dns cache supports EDNS and
DNSSEC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ldns-test-edns [ -i ] { ip }</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ldns-test-edns tests a DNS cache and checks if it supports
EDNS0 and DNSSEC types so that it can be used as a
dnssec-enabled DNS cache. It sends two queries to the cache,
one <br>
for the root key and one for a DS record. These must
succeed, the answer must have EDNS, that type and
signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the IP address is good for
DNSSEC, it is printed with &rsquo;OK&rsquo;. Otherwise short
description is given of the failure. If OK is given, the
cache should be good to use as a cache <br>
for a local configured DNSSEC validator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tool assumes the root is
signed and Sweden is signed. Also, the queries are sent with
the CD flag, the tool does not check that the results are
validated, but that they can <br>
be validated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-i option enables a mode where the working IP addresses are
printed after another, with no other explanations, and if
none work or no IP addresses are on the input,
&rsquo;off&rsquo; is <br>
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ldns-test-edns takes one or more
IP addresses, it checks them in turn. IPv4 and IPv6
addresses can be given. The exit value is for the last
checked IP address: 0 is OK, 1 is <br>
failure, 2 is some sort of network failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
Written by the ldns team as an example for ldns usage.</p>
