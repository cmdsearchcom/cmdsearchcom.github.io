pwgen - generate pronounceable passwords
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>pwgen</b> [ <i>OPTION</i> ] [ <i>pw_length</i> ] [ <i>num_pw</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>pwgen</b> program generates passwords which are designed to be easily
  memorized by humans, while being as secure as possible. Human-memorable
  passwords are never going to be as secure as completely completely random
  passwords. In particular, passwords generated by <b>pwgen</b> without the
  <b>-s</b> option should not be used in places where the password could be
  attacked via an off-line brute-force attack. On the other hand, completely
  randomly generated passwords have a tendency to be written down, and are
  subject to being compromised in that fashion.

The <b>pwgen</b> program is designed to be used both interactively, and in shell
  scripts. Hence, its default behavior differs depending on whether the standard
  output is a tty device or a pipe to another program. Used interactively,
  <b>pwgen</b> will display a screenful of passwords, allowing the user to pick
  a single password, and then quickly erase the screen. This prevents someone
  from being able to &quot;shoulder surf&quot; the user's chosen password.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When standard output (stdout) is not a tty, <b>pwgen</b> will only generate one
  password, as this tends to be much more convenient for shell scripts, and in
  order to be compatible with previous versions of this program.

This version of <b>pwgen</b> was written by Theodore Ts'o
  &lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;. It is modelled after a program originally written
  by Brandon S. Allbery, and then later extensively modified by Olaf Titz, Jim
  Lynch, and others. It was rewritten from scratch by Theodore Ts'o because the
  original program was somewhat of a hack, and thus hard to maintain, and
  because the licensing status of the program was unclear.
