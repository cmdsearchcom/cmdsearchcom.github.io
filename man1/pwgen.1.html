<p>PWGEN(1) General Commands Manual PWGEN(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pwgen - generate pronounceable passwords</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pwgen [ OPTION ] [ pw_length ] [ num_pw ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pwgen program generates passwords which are designed to
be easily memorized by humans, while being as secure as
possible. Human-memorable passwords are never going to be as
<br>
secure as completely completely random passwords. In
particular, passwords generated by pwgen without the -s
option should not be used in places where the password could
be <br>
attacked via an off-line brute-force attack. On the other
hand, completely randomly generated passwords have a
tendency to be written down, and are subject to being
compro&acirc; <br>
mised in that fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The pwgen program is designed to
be used both interactively, and in shell scripts. Hence, its
default behavior differs depending on whether the standard
output is a tty device <br>
or a pipe to another program. Used interactively, pwgen will
display a screenful of passwords, allowing the user to pick
a single password, and then quickly erase the screen. <br>
This prevents someone from being able to &quot;shoulder
surf&quot; the user&rsquo;s chosen password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When standard output (stdout) is
not a tty, pwgen will only generate one password, as this
tends to be much more convenient for shell scripts, and in
order to be compatible with <br>
previous versions of this program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-0, --no-numerals <br>
Don&rsquo;t include numbers in the generated passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1 Print the generated passwords
one per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --no-capitalize <br>
Don&rsquo;t bother to include any capital letters in the
generated passwords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --alt-phonics <br>
This option doesn&rsquo;t do anything special; it is present
only for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B, --ambiguous <br>
Don&rsquo;t use characters that could be confused by the
user when printed, such as &rsquo;l&rsquo; and
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, or &rsquo;0&rsquo; or &rsquo;O&rsquo;. This
reduces the number of possible passwords significantly, and
<br>
as such reduces the quality of the passwords. It may be
useful for users who have bad vision, but in general use of
this option is not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --capitalize <br>
Include at least one capital letter in the password. This is
the default if the standard output is a tty device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Print the generated passwords
in columns. This is the default if the standard output is a
tty device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --num-passwords=num <br>
Generate num passwords. This defaults to a screenful if
passwords are printed by columns, and one password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --numerals <br>
Include at least one number in the password. This is the
default if the standard output is a tty device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H, --sha1=/path/to/file[#seed]
<br>
Will use the sha1&rsquo;s hash of given file and the
optional seed to create password. It will allow you to
compute the same password later, if you remember the file,
seed, and <br>
pwgen&rsquo;s options used. ie: pwgen -H
~/your_favorite.mp3#your@email.com gives a list of possibles
passwords for your pop3 account, and you can ask this list
again and <br>
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: The passwords generated
using this option are not very random. If you use this
option, make sure the attacker can not obtain a copy of the
file. Also, note that <br>
the name of the file may be easily available from the
~/.history or ~/.bash_history file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print a help message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --secure <br>
Generate completely random, hard-to-memorize passwords.
These should only be used for machine passwords, since
otherwise it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that users will
simply <br>
write the password on a piece of paper taped to the
monitor...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --no-vowels <br>
Generate random passwords that do not contain vowels or
numbers that might be mistaken for vowels. It provides less
secure passwords to allow system administrators to not <br>
have to worry with random passwords accidentally contain
offensive substrings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --symbols <br>
Include at least one special character in the password.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHOR <br>
This version of pwgen was written by Theodore Ts&rsquo;o
&lt;tytso@alum.mit.edu&gt;. It is modelled after a program
originally written by Brandon S. Allbery, and then later
extensively mod&acirc; <br>
ified by Olaf Titz, Jim Lynch, and others. It was rewritten
from scratch by Theodore Ts&rsquo;o because the original
program was somewhat of a hack, and thus hard to maintain,
and <br>
because the licensing status of the program was unclear.</p>
