<p>DB_DUMP(1) BerkeleyDB Utilities DB_DUMP(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
db_dump - Write database file using flat-text format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
db_dump [-klNpRrV] [-b blob-dir] [-d ahr] [-f output] [-h
home] [-P password] [-s database] [-D bytes] file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db_dump [-kNpV] [-d ahr] [-f
output] [-h home] -m database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db_dump185 [-p] [-f output]
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The db_dump utility reads the database file and writes it to
the standard output using a portable flat-text format
understood by the db_load utility. The file argument must be
a <br>
file produced using the Berkeley DB library functions. The
db_dump185 utility is similar to the db_dump utility, except
that it reads databases in the format used by Berkeley DB
<br>
versions 1.85 and 1.86.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b blob-dir <br>
Specifies the directory where BLOB data is stored for the
database you are dumping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Dump the specified database
in a format helpful for debugging the Berkeley DB library
routines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Display all information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h Display only page headers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Do not display the free-list
or pages on the free list. This mode is used by the recovery
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format of the -d
option is not standard and may change, without notice,
between releases of the Berkeley DB library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D bytes <br>
Specifies the maximum number of bytes to dump for each
key/data item found in the specified database. This option
is only valid when -da is also specified. This option <br>
overrides the value set for the &quot;set_data_len&quot;
parameter in your DB_CONFIG file, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f output <br>
Write to the specified output file instead of to the
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h home <br>
Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
default, the current working directory is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Dump record numbers from
Queue and Recno databases as keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l List the databases stored in
the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Do not acquire shared region
mutexes while running. Other problems, such as potentially
fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as well. This
option is intended <br>
only for debugging errors, and should not be used under any
other circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P password <br>
Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB
utilities overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be
aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems <br>
where unprivileged users can see command-line arguments or
where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
containing the command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p If characters in either the
key or data items are printing characters (as defined by
isprint(3)), use printing characters in file to represent
them. This option permits <br>
users to use standard text editors and tools to modify the
contents of databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: different systems may have
different notions about what characters are considered
printing characters, and databases dumped in this manner may
be less portable to <br>
external systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Aggressively salvage data
from a possibly corrupt file. The -R flag differs from the
-r option in that it will return all possible data from the
file at the risk of also <br>
returning already deleted or otherwise nonsensical items.
Data dumped in this fashion will almost certainly have to be
edited by hand or other means before the data is <br>
ready for reload into another database</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Salvage data from a possibly
corrupt file. When used on a uncorrupted database, this
option should return equivalent data to a normal dump, but
most likely in a different <br>
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s database <br>
Specify a single database to dump. If no database is
specified, all databases in the database file are
dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Write the library version
number to the standard output, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping and reloading Hash
databases that use user-defined hash functions will result
in new databases that use the default hash function.
Although using the default hash func&acirc; <br>
tion may not be optimal for the new database, it will
continue to work correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dumping and reloading Btree
databases that use user-defined prefix or comparison
functions will result in new databases that use the default
prefix and comparison functions. In <br>
this case, it is quite likely that the database will be
damaged beyond repair permitting neither record storage or
retrieval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only available workaround
for either case is to modify the sources for the db_load
utility to load the database using the correct hash, prefix,
and comparison functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db_dump utility output
format is documented in the Dump Output Formats section of
the Berkeley DB Reference Guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The db_dump utility may be used
with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the -h
option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the
utility was run in a directory <br>
containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to avoid
environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
db_dump should always be given the chance to detach from
<br>
the environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_dump to
release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it
an interrupt signal (SIGINT).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even when using a Berkeley DB
database environment, the db_dump utility does not use any
kind of database locking if it is invoked with the -d, -R,
or -r arguments. If used <br>
with one of these arguments, the db_dump utility may only be
safely run on databases that are not being modified by any
other process; otherwise, the output may be corrupt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The db_dump utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an
error occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DB_HOME <br>
If the -h option is not specified and the environment
variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the
database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.</p>
