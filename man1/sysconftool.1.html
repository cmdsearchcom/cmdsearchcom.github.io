<p>SYSCONFTOOL(1) sysconftool SYSCONFTOOL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sysconftool - install configuration files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sysconftool [options] [filename.dist...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
sysconftool is a development utility that helps to install
application configuration files. sysconftool allows an
existing application to be upgraded without losing the older
<br>
version&rsquo;s configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A new version of an application
often introduces new configuration settings. Sometimes
obsolete configuration settings are removed. Existing
configuration settings may also now <br>
have additional options, or certain options are no longer
valid any more. Because of this, an application upgrade
usually installs a fresh set of configuration files,
containing <br>
a default configuration that&rsquo;s known to work. Keeping
the existing files carries the risk of the application
failing to function properly due to a configuration that is
no longer <br>
valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A typical application
installation script copies over configuration files with
default settings. Existing configuration files are backed up
or overwritten. With sysconftool, an <br>
application will install a configuration file names
filename.dist, instead of filename. Then, the
application&rsquo;s installation script runs sysconftool.
sysconftool copies <br>
filename.dist to filename, but also checks if filename from
an older version of the application already exist. If
filename an older sysconftool-installed configuration file,
it&rsquo;s <br>
configuration settings replace the defaults in
filename.dist, which is then subsequently installed as
filename. sysconftool is smart enough to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Remove
configuration settings that no longer exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Add new
configuration settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Do not preserve
an older configuration setting if there&rsquo;s a
possibility that it is no longer valid in the new version of
the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysconftool produces a short
report when it runs. The report lists every configuration
setting in $filename.dist, and its disposition. The possible
dispositions are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">new <br>
This a new configuration setting that wasn&rsquo;t found in
the existing $filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unchanged <br>
This setting&rsquo;s value was taken from the existing
$filename, replacing the default value provided by
$filename.dist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPDATED <br>
This setting has been previously set in $filename, but the
setting&rsquo;s value may no longer be valid in the new
version of the application, so its default value is taken
from <br>
$filename.dist, and it may need to be manually adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All this logic is based on some
additional metadata that must be included in each
configuration file, that sysconftool reads. For this to
work, both the old and the new version <br>
of the application must be sysconftool-ized. sysconftool
operates in a fail-safe mode. If the old version did not use
sysconftool, $filename is backed up to $filename.bak, and
<br>
$filename is copied to $filename. This is what would
essentially happen anyway without sysconftool. The local
configuration needs to be reentered into $filename, so
nothing is <br>
lost. However, the next upgrade will see sysconftool do its
job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADDING SYSCONFTOOL SUPPORT TO AN
EXISTING APPLICATION <br>
sysconftool requires the application to use autoconf and
automake. The first step is to run the sysconftoolize script
from the application&rsquo;s source directory.
sysconftoolize <br>
creates a symbolic link to the sysconftool script from the
current directory, and appends a default install-configure
rule to Makefile.am. sysconftoolize with the --copy option
<br>
copies the script, instead of creating a symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running sysconftoolize the
macro AC_PROG_SYSCONFTOOL must be manually added to
configure.in, and Makefile.am must be modified as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Makefile.am must be modified to
install configuration files as filename.dist instead of
filename. The default install-configure rule assumes that
sysconf_DATA lists all <br>
configuration files in sysconfdir, and runs sysconftool on
them. This will usually have to be modified, according to
the application&rsquo;s individual needs. Finally,
Makefile.am must <br>
be modified to distribute the sysconftool script in the
application&rsquo;s source distribution. Adding sysconftool
to EXTRA_DIST is what&rsquo;s needed in most cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, certain sysconftool
magic incantations must be added to the application&rsquo;s
configuration files, see sysconftool(7)[1] for more
information. The last step involves <br>
updating the application&rsquo;s INSTALL instructions, so
that the application can be properly installed. The
following instructions must be added to INSTALL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Run &quot;make
install-configure&quot; after &quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If this is the first
sysconftool-ized version, DO NOT simply copy over the old
configuration files, and overwrite the new configuration
files. Instead, manually edit each <br>
configuration file, and manually reset each configuration
setting. This is because the new configuration files include
the magic code for sysconftool, which would be lost <br>
when the configuration file is overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If this is not the first
sysconftool-ized version, the output of make
install-configure must be reviewed in order to manually
adjust or tweak what sysconftool did. Many large <br>
configuration files can result in lots of output, so the
output of make install-configure should be saved into a
file, and reviewed.</p>
