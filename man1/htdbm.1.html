<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUMMARY <br>
htdbm is used to manipulate the DBM format files used to
store usernames and password for basic authentication of
HTTP users via mod_authn_dbm. See the dbmmanage
documentation <br>
for more information about these DBM files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b Use batch mode; i.e., get the password from the command
line rather than prompting for it. This option should be
used with extreme care, since the password is clearly
vis&acirc; <br>
ible on the command line. For script use see the -i
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Read the password from stdin
without verification (for script usage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Create the passwdfile. If
passwdfile already exists, it is rewritten and truncated.
This option cannot be combined with the -n option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Display the results on
standard output rather than updating a database. This option
changes the syntax of the command line, since the passwdfile
argument (usually the <br>
first one) is omitted. It cannot be combined with the -c
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Use MD5 encryption for
passwords. On Windows and Netware, this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B Use bcrypt encryption for
passwords. This is currently considered to be very
secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C This flag is only allowed in
combination with -B (bcrypt encryption). It sets the
computing time used for the bcrypt algorithm (higher is more
secure but slower, default: <br>
5, valid: 4 to 31).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Use crypt() encryption for
passwords. The default on all platforms but Windows and
Netware. Though possibly supported by htdbm on all
platforms, it is not supported by the <br>
httpd server on Windows and Netware. This algorithm is
insecure by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Use SHA encryption for
passwords. Facilitates migration from/to Netscape servers
using the LDAP Directory Interchange Format (ldif). This
algorithm is insecure by today&rsquo;s <br>
standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Use plaintext passwords.
Though htdbm will support creation on all platforms, the
httpd daemon will only accept plain text passwords on
Windows and Netware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Print each of the usernames
and comments from the database on stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verify the username and
password. The program will print a message indicating
whether the supplied password is valid. If the password is
invalid, the program exits with <br>
error code 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Delete user. If the username
exists in the specified DBM file, it will be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Interpret the final parameter
as a comment. When this option is specified, an additional
string can be appended to the command line; this string will
be stored in the <br>
&quot;Comment&quot; field of the database, associated with
the specified username.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
The filename of the DBM format file. Usually without the
extension .db, .pag, or .dir. If -c is given, the DBM file
is created if it does not already exist, or updated if <br>
it does exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">username <br>
The username to create or update in passwdfile. If username
does not exist in this file, an entry is added. If it does
exist, the password is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">password <br>
The plaintext password to be encrypted and stored in the DBM
file. Used only with the -b flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TDBTYPE <br>
Type of DBM file (SDBM, GDBM, DB, or
&quot;default&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM
file formats in existence, and with all likelihood,
libraries for more than one format may exist on your system.
The <br>
three primary examples are SDBM, NDBM, GNU GDBM, and
Berkeley/Sleepycat DB 2/3/4. Unfortunately, all these
libraries use different file formats, and you must make sure
that the <br>
file format used by filename is the same format that htdbm
expects to see. htdbm currently has no way of determining
what type of DBM file it is looking at. If used against the
<br>
wrong format, will simply return nothing, or may create a
different DBM file with a different name, or at worst, it
may corrupt the DBM file if you were attempting to write to
<br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One can usually use the file
program supplied with most Unix systems to see what format a
DBM file is in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
htdbm returns a zero status (&quot;true&quot;) if the
username and password have been successfully added or
updated in the DBM File. htdbm returns 1 if it encounters
some problem accessing <br>
files, 2 if there was a syntax problem with the command
line, 3 if the password was entered interactively and the
verification entry didn&rsquo;t match, 4 if its operation
was inter&acirc; <br>
rupted, 5 if a value is too long (username, filename,
password, or final computed record), 6 if the username
contains illegal characters (see the Restrictions section),
and 7 if <br>
the file is not a valid DBM password file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
htdbm /usr/local/etc/apache/.htdbm-users jsmith</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adds or modifies the password
for user jsmith. The user is prompted for the password. If
executed on a Windows system, the password will be encrypted
using the modified Apache <br>
MD5 algorithm; otherwise, the system&rsquo;s crypt() routine
will be used. If the file does not exist, htdbm will do
nothing except return an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htdbm -c
/home/doe/public_html/.htdbm jane</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creates a new file and stores a
record in it for user jane. The user is prompted for the
password. If the file exists and cannot be read, or cannot
be written, it is not altered <br>
and htdbm will display a message and return an error
status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htdbm -mb /usr/web/.htdbm-all
jones Pwd4Steve</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encrypts the password from the
command line (Pwd4Steve) using the MD5 algorithm, and stores
it in the specified file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS <br>
Web password files such as those managed by htdbm should not
be within the Web server&rsquo;s URI space -- that is, they
should not be fetchable with a browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of the -b option is
discouraged, since when it is used the unencrypted password
appears on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When using the crypt()
algorithm, note that only the first 8 characters of the
password are used to form the password. If the supplied
password is longer, the extra characters <br>
will be silently discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SHA encryption format does
not use salting: for a given password, there is only one
encrypted representation. The crypt() and MD5 formats
permute the representation by <br>
prepending a random salt string, to make dictionary attacks
against the passwords more difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The SHA and crypt() formats are
insecure by today&rsquo;s standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTRICTIONS <br>
On the Windows platform, passwords encrypted with htdbm are
limited to no more than 255 characters in length. Longer
passwords will be truncated to 255 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MD5 algorithm used by htdbm
is specific to the Apache software; passwords encrypted
using it will not be usable with other Web servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usernames are limited to 255
bytes and may not include the character :.</p>
