<p>CCONTROL(1) CCONTROL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccontrol - wrapper to control distcc, ccache and more</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gcc ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c++ ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ld ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccontrol
[--section=&lt;section&gt;] &lt;name&gt; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccontrol
[--section=&lt;section&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ccontrol(1) program takes over the roles of the compiler
and linker, and reads a configuration file to decide what to
do before invoking them. This is particularly useful for
<br>
centralized control over commands and options, such as
enabling distcc(1) and ccache(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ccontrol(1) is invoked
under its own name with no arguments, it prints out the
settings which apply in this directory (unless --section is
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Versions are named after the
last person to report a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Normally ccontrol(1) is invoked as a symboling link to cc,
make, etc, so it can identify what is being invoked by
examining its own name. It can also be invoked under its own
<br>
name, in which case ccontrol-specific arguments can be
supplied. The first non-option argument will be used to
identify the invocation, eg. &quot;ccontrol gcc
...&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
supported, when invoked as ccontrol:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--section=&lt;section&gt; <br>
This is treated as the &quot;current directory&quot; for the
purposes of evaluating the configuration file. As all real
directories must begin with a &quot;/&quot; using an
argument which does <br>
not, is a good way of overriding configuration for this
particular invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
ccontrol&acirc;s configuration file is
$HOME/.ccontrol/config. If this cannot be read (and
written), your compilations will all fail. It is normal to
have several different <br>
configuration files in this directory, and make default a
symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNTAX <br>
A configuration file consists of sections, led by a
&quot;[path]&quot; header and followed by indented
&quot;name = value&quot; entries. The first section is
usually labelled &quot;[*]&quot; to set up the <br>
defaults. At the very least, you must set the
&quot;cc&quot;, &quot;c++&quot;, &quot;make&quot; and
&quot;ld&quot; values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccontrol will read every section
which matches the current directory, so you can override
values on a per-directory basis. The &quot;[path]&quot;
header of each section is a shell-style <br>
wildcard (see glob(7)) which indicates the directory or
directories it applies to. Usually this will end in a
&quot;*&quot; to include all subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All paths beginning with
&quot;~&quot; are relative to the user&acirc;s home
directory. A path may be specified as a directory, in which
case ccontrol will append the program name to the <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following settings are
available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cc <br>
Followed by = specifies the path of the compiler to be
invoked when ccontrol is invoked as &quot;cc&quot; or
&quot;gcc&quot;. ccontrol will fail to compile C programs if
this is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c++ <br>
Followed by = specifies the path of the compiler to be
invoked when ccontrol is invoked as &quot;c&quot; or
&quot;g&quot;. ccontrol will fail to compile C++ programs if
this is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ld <br>
Followed by = specifies the path of the linker to be invoked
when ccontrol is invoked as &quot;ld&quot;. ccontrol will
fail to link programs if this is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make <br>
Followed by = specifies the path of the binary to be invoked
when ccontrol is invoked as &quot;make&quot;. ccontrol will
fail to make if this is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccache <br>
Followed by = specifies the path of &quot;ccache&quot;, and
indicates that ccache is to be used where appropriate. If
followed by disable, or not set, ccache will not be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc <br>
Followed by = specifies the path of &quot;distcc&quot;, and
indicates that distcc is to be used where appropriate. If
followed by disable, or not set, or distcc-hosts is not set,
<br>
distcc will not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distcc-hosts <br>
Followed by = specifies the distcc servers to use, as per
the DISTCC_HOSTS environment variable in distcc(1). Followed
by disable disables distcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">distc++-hosts <br>
The same as distcc-hosts, but only applies to Ccompilations.
If not set, distcc-hosts is used. You can thus disable
distcc for C compilations by setting &quot;distc++-hosts
<br>
disable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpus <br>
Followed by = and a number of CPUs, set to the number of
CPUs you have (the default is &quot;1&quot;). ccontrol uses
this to tune the degree of parallelism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no-parallel <br>
Followed by = and a space-separated list of wildcards,
suppresses parallel make for any make target matching one of
those. This option is needed because ccontrol(1) usually
<br>
forces make(1) to perform all actions in parallel, but this
can be confusing when an error occurs, and breaks
poorly-written makefiles. Followed by disable, enables
parallel <br>
make for all targets: this is useful to re-enable parallel
make in a subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice <br>
Followed by = and a priority level from -19 to 20, causes
ccontrol to try to set its priority to this value. Default
is 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include <br>
Followed by = specifies a file to include at the current
point. The effect is exactly as if the contents of the
included file were literally inserted. Can be used at file
<br>
level to include sections. Can also be used within sections
to include section fragments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add make <br>
Followed by = specifies an argument to be added to each
invocation of make. This can be specified multiple times to
add multiple arguments. Followed by disable removes any <br>
arguments previously specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">add env <br>
Followed by = specifies an environment variable to be set,
such as &quot;add env = CCACHE_DIR=/tmp&quot;. This can be
specified multiple times to set multiple environment
variables. <br>
Followed by disable removes any arguments previously
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verbose <br>
By itself, indicates that ccontrol(1) is to spit lots of
crap out to standard error about what it&acirc;s doing to
your innocent command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lock-file <br>
Specify a particular lock file to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
This is the minimal configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[*] <br>
cc = /usr/bin/gcc <br>
c++ = /usr/bin/g++ <br>
ld = /usr/bin/ld <br>
make = /usr/bin/make</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have multiple locations
(such as a laptop) it is common to have a &quot;global&quot;
file which is included from every configuration file, like
so:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Configuration file for when
I&rsquo;m at work. Lots of distcc hosts! <br>
include = ~/.ccontrol/global</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[*] <br>
distcc-hosts = snab swarm1 swarm3 swarm4 swarm5 fandango2
mingo <br>
distc++-hosts = snab mingo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a complete configuration
file with several common scenarios:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[*] <br>
cc = /usr/bin/gcc-4.0 <br>
c++ = /usr/bin/g++-4.0 <br>
ld = /usr/bin/ld <br>
make = /usr/bin/make <br>
# Comment this back in for debugging <br>
# verbose <br>
distcc = /usr/bin/distcc <br>
distcc-hosts = snab swarm1 swarm3 swarm4 swarm5 fandango2
mingo <br>
distc++-hosts = snab mingo <br>
ccache = /usr/bin/ccache <br>
# make check should not generally be run in parallel <br>
no-parallel = check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Wesnoth doesn&rsquo;t compile
with g++ 4.0 <br>
[*wesnoth*] <br>
c++ = /usr/bin/g++-3.4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Stupid third-party modules
don&rsquo;t build in parallel. <br>
[/usr/src/modules/*] <br>
no-parallel = *</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Using distcc when testing
module-init-tools causes strange effects. <br>
[*module-init-tools*/tests/*] <br>
distcc disable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The ~/.ccontrol/config file must be writable: ccontrol(1)
needs to get an exclusive write lock on it, which means it
needs to open the file for writing. Use include to include
<br>
read-only files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccontrol will not immediately
notice a change in included files, only in the toplevel file
(ccontrol re-reads the config file if it changed while
ccontrol was trying to grab a <br>
lock).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Linux (&acirc;&uml; 2.6.15)
cpufreq ondemand governor (common on laptops) will not
increase CPU speed when using ccontrol(1), because ccontrol
re-nices compilations. This can make <br>
builds 2-3 times slower. Either use another governor, or
tell ondemand to ignore nice values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">echo 1 &gt;
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your code doesn&acirc;t
compile, ccontrol can only make it not compile faster.</p>
