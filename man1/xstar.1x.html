<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
XStar Version 2.2 - X11 animated n-body solver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xstar [-hrRMv] [-b stars] [-g geometry] [-d host:display]
[-t timeout] [-D delay] [-B buf_factor] [-c star_color] [-C
bg_color] [-a float] [-m [taylor3|rk4|gpemce8|ab7|am7]] [-l
<br>
float] [-T num_pts]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
XStar is an X11 client that
&lsquo;&lsquo;solves&rsquo;&rsquo; the n-body problem, and
displays the results on the screen. It starts by putting a
bunch of stars on the screen, and then it lets the <br>
inter-body gravitational forces move the stars around. The
result is a lot of neat wandering paths, as the stars
interact and collide. Try using the display mode options
(-c, <br>
-C, -R, or -M) to make things more colorful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
XStar has the following options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display the usage message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b stars <br>
Select the number of stars to initially have in the star
system. The default is 15 stars, the minimum is 2 and the
maximum is 249.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Use root window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g
[=][&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;][{+-}&lt;xoffset&gt;{+-}&lt;yoffset&gt;]
<br>
Selects the initial window size and location. If the -r
option is also selected, then the offset is used to move the
&quot;center of the star system&quot; around. That is, you
can <br>
use the -g option to move the interesting stuff to a free
spot of your screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d host:display <br>
As in -d spacsun:0.0 or -d unix:0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t timeout <br>
Use XStar as your screen saver with the given no-activity
timeout value (in seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D delay <br>
Periodically wait for &rsquo;delay&rsquo; milliseconds to
keep from using 100% of the CPU. The default is 0 ms. This
doesn&rsquo;t always work incredibly well to reduce the CPU
usage <br>
because most Unix schedulers notice that XStar is not using
as much CPU as it could and they increases XStar&rsquo;s
priority. On the other hand, it does make the display rate
<br>
vary less as collisions decrease the number of stars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c star_color <br>
Select the color of the stars. The default is White. Turns
of the implicit -R option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C bg_color <br>
Select the color of the background. The default is Black.
Turns of the implicit -R option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Rotate the star colors
through the Rainbow. This is the default unless the -c or -C
options are used. Very pretty, but uses up 48 color slots.
This causes each star <br>
track to change colors as time passes, but at any given
time, all stars have the same color. Also available with the
&rsquo;r&rsquo; runtime command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Assign multiple star colors.
Also uses up 48 color slots. At any given time, each star
has a unique color (unless there are too many stars to do
this). This makes it <br>
much easier to see where a star has been. Also available
with the &rsquo;m&rsquo; runtime command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a value <br>
Adjusts the accuracy of the position calculations by a
factor of &lsquo;&lsquo;value&rsquo;&rsquo;. The larger the
value, the more accurately XStar simulates the real world
but the slower it <br>
runs. The value can be any floating point number greater
than zero. The default value is 1.0. Any value greater than
zero is valid, with values below 1 decreasing the <br>
accuracy and values above one increasing it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m taylor3|rk4|gpemce8|ab7|am7
<br>
Selects the method to use for updating the star locations
and velocities. The default method is ab7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">taylor3 <br>
Use a taylor series expansion to get an order 2 method, but
then uses previous acceleration values to extend it to a 3rd
order method. This method is the fastest <br>
method and for accuracies below .8 (-a .8), it is also the
most accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rk4 Use the Runge-Kutta method
of 4th order. It is over 4 times as slow as taylor3, but it
is not 4 times as accurate. It is used internally to
initialize the tay&acirc; <br>
lor3, am7 and ab7 methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpemce8 <br>
Use an 8th order Gragg&rsquo;s polynomial extrapolation
method with modifications for conservation of energy to make
it a discrete mechanics method. This is by far the <br>
most accurate method, and when it&rsquo;s accuracy breaks
down, the resulting star system preserves the constants of
motion, that is, it conserves the energy of the sys&acirc;
<br>
tem, the center of gravity, the linear and angular momentum,
etc. It is also by far the slowest method and probably not
useful except on a very fast machine or <br>
when you are using it as a benchmark to compare other
methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ab7 Use a 7th order
Adam-Bashford method. This is the default and for accuracies
in the range of .8 to 4, it is the most efficient method. It
is slightly slower than <br>
the taylor3 method, especially when there are only a few
stars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">am7 Use a 7th order Adam-Moulton
predictor-corrector method. It is about twice as expensive
as ab7, and not a whole lot more accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l float <br>
The minimum distance between stars before they collide. The
default is one pixel. This value should be increased when
decreasing the accuracy. You can also decrease the <br>
collision distance to be less than one pixel if you greatly
increase the accuracy, but results can be confusing since
entire loops could be contained within a single <br>
pixel. If this value is set too small for the current
accuracy, then the star system will star displaying strange
behaviors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T num_pts <br>
The number of points to display as star trails. The default
is 16384 points, the minimum is 512 and the maximum is
24575. If you use a value less than the minimum, then <br>
no points will be remembered. Instead, the star trails will
not erase themselves and the screen will be periodically
cleared. Using the -T 0 option will greatly reduce <br>
the memory requirements of XStar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B buf_factor <br>
This changes the amount of buffering to be done with the X
server. The default is 1.0, but any number greater than zero
can be used to increase or decrease the buffering. <br>
If the stars appear to move in a jerky fashion, then you
should decrease the buffering to a value between 0 and 1. If
there is too much server/network load being gener&acirc;
<br>
ated by XStar, then increase the buffering factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display verbose internal
debugging information. Several -v options will make XStar
more verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RUN TIME COMMANDS <br>
When XStar is running, it will accept a few commands from
the keyboard. They are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Add an immobile
collapsar/gravity well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e Erase the star trails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n Reinitialize the star system
with a new set of stars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Add a star to the current star
system. All future star systems will also have an additional
star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- Delete a star from the current
star system. XStar will try to delete the &quot;least
interesting&quot; star. Often the deleted star will be off
the screen. All future star sys&acirc; <br>
tems will also have one less star.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">m Toggle to
&lsquo;&lsquo;multiple color mode&rsquo;&rsquo;, where each
star has its own color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">r Toggle to
&lsquo;&lsquo;Rainbow mode&rsquo;&rsquo;, where the stars
will change color with time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Pause the updating of the
screen. Actually, XStar will continue to update the screen,
but there will be a 3 second delay between updates. This is
useful if XStar is <br>
using up too much CPU and you want to stop it for a short
period of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press p again to return to full
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q Quit running XStar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HELPFUL HINTS <br>
If you find the system running too quickly, you can do any
of the following things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Use the -D option to add a
delay between updates. This also keeps XStar from using 100%
of the CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Use the -a option to increase
the accuracy of the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Use the -b option to add
additional stars. Doubling the number of stars will make
XStar run about 4 times as slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) If you have increased the
accuracy, you can then also slightly decrease the collision
distance with the -l option. Don&rsquo;t over do it though,
or you will start seeing <br>
strange things happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5) Use the -m option to select a
more accurate, but less efficient method such as rk4 or
gpemce8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find the system running
too slowly, you can do any of the following things:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Use the -b option to decrease
the number of stars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Use the -a option to decrease
the accuracy of the system. You probably will want to change
the collision distance a little bit also by using the -l
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Use the -m option to select a
less accurate, but faster method namely taylor3. If you
decrease the accuracy below .8, taylor3 will be more
accurate than ab7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4) Buy a faster computer, get a
better optimizer for your compiler, or implement a faster
method of calculating the star locations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you find the that XStar is
using too much memory, you can do any of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1) Use the -T 0 option to
eliminate the star trails. (Saves about 200k.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2) Do not use rainbow mode or
multi-color mode. (Saves a little bit)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3) Recompile XStar to use a
smaller value for HASH_TABLE_BITS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program started out as a
heavily modified version of XGrav, which was written by
David Flater (dave@case50.ncsl.nist.gov) and posted to
alt.sources on 1/21/95. I liked the <br>
program enough that I was really interested in it, but I
didn&rsquo;t like it enough to leave it alone. The idea was
Dave&rsquo;s, but I think that very little of his code is
left. There <br>
is probably more code left from XSwarm, which Dave used to
implement the X port of his n-body problem solving code.
Xswarm&rsquo;s author is Jeff Butterworth
(butterwo@cs.unc.edu).</p>

program that I have (which isn&rsquo;t much) is under the
