<i>XStar</i> is an X11 client that ``solves'' the n-body problem, and displays
  the results on the screen. It starts by putting a bunch of stars on the
  screen, and then it lets the inter-body gravitational forces move the stars
  around. The result is a lot of neat wandering paths, as the stars interact and
  collide. Try using the display mode options (-c, -C, -R, or -M) to make things
  more colorful.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<i>XStar</i> has the following options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display the usage message and exit.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b</b><i> stars</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the number of stars to initially have in the star
      system. The default is 15 stars, the minimum is 2 and the maximum is
    249.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-r</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use root window.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-g</b><i>
    [=][&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;][{+-}&lt;xoffset&gt;{+-}&lt;yoffset&gt;]</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Selects the initial window size and location. If the -r
      option is also selected, then the offset is used to move the &quot;center
      of the star system&quot; around. That is, you can use the -g option to
      move the interesting stuff to a free spot of your screen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d</b><i> host:display</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">As in -d spacsun:0.0 or -d unix:0.0.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-t</b><i> timeout</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use XStar as your screen saver with the given no-activity
      timeout value (in seconds).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-D</b><i> delay</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Periodically wait for 'delay' milliseconds to keep from
      using 100% of the CPU. The default is 0 ms. This doesn't always work
      incredibly well to reduce the CPU usage because most Unix schedulers
      notice that XStar is not using as much CPU as it could and they increases
      XStar's priority. On the other hand, it does make the display rate vary
      less as collisions decrease the number of stars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c</b><i> star_color</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the color of the stars. The default is White. Turns
      of the implicit -R option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-C</b><i> bg_color</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Select the color of the background. The default is Black.
      Turns of the implicit -R option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-R</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Rotate the star colors through the Rainbow. This is the
      default unless the -c or -C options are used. Very pretty, but uses up 48
      color slots. This causes each star track to change colors as time passes,
      but at any given time, all stars have the same color. Also available with
      the 'r' runtime command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-M</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Assign multiple star colors. Also uses up 48 color slots.
      At any given time, each star has a unique color (unless there are too many
      stars to do this). This makes it much easier to see where a star has been.
      Also available with the 'm' runtime command.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-a</b><i> value</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Adjusts the accuracy of the position calculations by a
      factor of ``value''. The larger the value, the more accurately XStar
      simulates the real world but the slower it runs. The value can be any
      floating point number greater than zero. The default value is 1.0. Any
      value greater than zero is valid, with values below 1 decreasing the
      accuracy and values above one increasing it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m</b><i> taylor3|rk4|gpemce8|ab7|am7</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Selects the method to use for updating the star locations
      and velocities. The default method is ab7.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>taylor3</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a taylor series expansion to get an order 2 method, but
      then uses previous acceleration values to extend it to a 3rd order method.
      This method is the fastest method and for accuracies below .8 (-a .8), it
      is also the most accurate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>rk4</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the Runge-Kutta method of 4th order. It is over 4 times
      as slow as taylor3, but it is not 4 times as accurate. It is used
      internally to initialize the taylor3, am7 and ab7 methods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>gpemce8</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use an 8th order Gragg's polynomial extrapolation method
      with modifications for conservation of energy to make it a discrete
      mechanics method. This is by far the most accurate method, and when it's
      accuracy breaks down, the resulting star system preserves the constants of
      motion, that is, it conserves the energy of the system, the center of
      gravity, the linear and angular momentum, etc. It is also by far the
      slowest method and probably not useful except on a very fast machine or
      when you are using it as a benchmark to compare other methods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>ab7</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a 7th order Adam-Bashford method. This is the default
      and for accuracies in the range of .8 to 4, it is the most efficient
      method. It is slightly slower than the taylor3 method, especially when
      there are only a few stars.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>am7</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a 7th order Adam-Moulton predictor-corrector method. It
      is about twice as expensive as ab7, and not a whole lot more
    accurate.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-l</b><i> float</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The minimum distance between stars before they collide. The
      default is one pixel. This value should be increased when decreasing the
      accuracy. You can also decrease the collision distance to be less than one
      pixel if you greatly increase the accuracy, but results can be confusing
      since entire loops could be contained within a single pixel. If this value
      is set too small for the current accuracy, then the star system will star
      displaying strange behaviors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-T</b><i> num_pts</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The number of points to display as star trails. The default
      is 16384 points, the minimum is 512 and the maximum is 24575. If you use a
      value less than the minimum, then no points will be remembered. Instead,
      the star trails will not erase themselves and the screen will be
      periodically cleared. Using the -T 0 option will greatly reduce the memory
      requirements of XStar.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-B</b><i> buf_factor</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This changes the amount of buffering to be done with the X
      server. The default is 1.0, but any number greater than zero can be used
      to increase or decrease the buffering. If the stars appear to move in a
      jerky fashion, then you should decrease the buffering to a value between 0
      and 1. If there is too much server/network load being generated by XStar,
      then increase the buffering factor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Display verbose internal debugging information. Several -v
      options	will make XStar more verbose.</dd>

When XStar is running, it will accept a few commands from the keyboard. They
  are:

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Delete a star from the current star system. XStar will try

If you find the system running too quickly, you can do any of the following
  things:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -D option to add a delay between updates. This also
      keeps XStar from using 100% of the CPU.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -a option to increase the accuracy of the
    system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -b option to add additional stars. Doubling the
      number of stars will make XStar run about 4 times as slow.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>4)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If you have increased the accuracy, you can then also
      slightly decrease the collision distance with the -l option. Don't over do
      it though, or you will start seeing strange things happen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>5)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -m option to select a more accurate, but less

If you find the system running too slowly, you can do any of the following
  things:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -b option to decrease the number of stars.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -a option to decrease the accuracy of the system.
      You probably will want to change the collision distance a little bit also
      by using the -l option.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -m option to select a less accurate, but faster

If you find the that XStar is using too much memory, you can do any of the
  following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use the -T 0 option to eliminate the star trails. (Saves

This program started out as a heavily modified version of XGrav, which was
  written by David Flater (dave@case50.ncsl.nist.gov) and posted to alt.sources
  on 1/21/95. I liked the program enough that I was really interested in it, but
  I didn't like it enough to leave it alone. The idea was Dave's, but I think
  that very little of his code is left. There is probably more code left from
  XSwarm, which Dave used to implement the X port of his n-body problem solving
  code. Xswarm's author is Jeff Butterworth (butterwo@cs.unc.edu).

  the GNU General Public License. Have fun with it.
