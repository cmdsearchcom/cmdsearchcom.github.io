<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mbrowse - SNMP MIB browser and query tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mbrowse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the mbrowse command. This
manual page was written for the Debian distribution because
the original program does not have a manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mbrowse is a SNMP MIB browser
tool. It relies on GTK+ and net-snmp. It is able to display
as a tree view the content of a MIB, and to query MIB
objects on any machine through <br>
get, set and walk methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It includes a search function,
bookmarking of MIB entries, ability to support additional
MIBs, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once mbrowse is open, it
displays the MIB tree. You can browse this tree like any
other one. Once you have selected a MIB object, you can get
details about it by going in the <br>
Details page. Its SNMP identifier is also update on the fly
in the Object Identifier field. You can also directly enter
the object identifier, and the tree will be browsed to the
<br>
right place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To query a SNMP object, select
it, enter the host name (IP address or DNS entry) of the
machine you want to query in the right field. Also enter the
read community to get or walk <br>
a value, and the write community to set it. Click on the
right button and the objects and their values will be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By clicking the Search page, you
can search MIb entries by MIB name or description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Options page, you can set
a few general options: whether to save the session on exit
of the program, set the style of the tree view, the version
of SNMP to use, and a few <br>
SNMP-related values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use bookmarks to
quickly find SNMP objects. Select the object you want to
save, and click on Add Bookmark in the Bookmark menu. You
will be prompted a name and the <br>
bookmark will be added to the menu. You can now click it to
be positioned on the object back. To delete a bookmark,
click on Delete Bookmark, and then, click on the bookmark to
<br>
delete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also import MIBs at
runtime, by clicking Open MIB in the File menu. Select the
MIB file in the dialog box and the values contained in the
file will be integrated in the <br>
tree view. For this MIB to be automatically opened at
startup, you must put the MIB file in net-nsmp MIB files
directory (usually /usr/share/snmp/mibs on Debian [and also
on <br>
Fedora]). Mbrowse will open the MIB at its next startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
