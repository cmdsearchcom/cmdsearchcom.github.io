<p>NICE(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
NICE(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nice &acirc; invoke a utility with an altered nice value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nice [&acirc;n increment] utility [argument...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The nice utility shall invoke a utility, requesting that it
be run with a different nice value (see the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 3.240, Nice Value).
With <br>
no options, the executed utility shall be run with a nice
value that is some implementation-defined quantity greater
than or equal to the nice value of the current process. If
<br>
the user lacks appropriate privileges to affect the nice
value in the requested manner, the nice utility shall not
affect the nice value; in this case, a warning message may
be <br>
written to standard error, but this shall not prevent the
invocation of utility or affect the exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The nice utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following option is
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;n increment <br>
A positive or negative decimal integer which shall have the
same effect on the execution of the utility as if the
utility had called the nice() function with the <br>
numeric value of the increment option-argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utility The name of a utility
that is to be invoked. If the utility operand names any of
the special built-in utilities in Section 2.14, Special
Built-In Utilities, the results <br>
are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">argument Any string to be
supplied as an argument when invoking the utility named by
the utility operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of nice:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH Determine the search path
used to locate the utility to be invoked. See the Base
Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 8,
Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If utility is invoked, the exit status of nice shall be the
exit status of utility; otherwise, the nice utility shall
exit with one of the following values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1&acirc;125 An error occurred in
the nice utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">126 The utility specified by
utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">127 The utility specified by
utility could not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The only guaranteed portable uses of this utility are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice utility <br>
Run utility with the default higher or equal nice value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nice &acirc;n &lt;positive
integer&gt; utility <br>
Run utility with a higher nice value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some implementations they
have no discernible effect on the invoked utility and on
some others they are exactly equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical systems have
frequently supported the &lt;positive integer&gt; up to 20.
Since there is no error penalty associated with guessing a
number that is too high, users without <br>
access to the system conformance document (to see what
limits are actually in place) could use the historical 1 to
20 range or attempt to use very large numbers if the job
should <br>
be truly low priority.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nice value of a process can
be displayed using the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps &acirc;o nice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command, env, nice, nohup,
time, and xargs utilities have been specified to use exit
code 127 if an error occurs so that applications can
distinguish &lsquo;&lsquo;failure to find a <br>
utility&rsquo;&rsquo; from &lsquo;&lsquo;invoked utility
exited with an error indication&rsquo;&rsquo;. The value 127
was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
meanings; most utilities use small values <br>
for &lsquo;&lsquo;normal error conditions&rsquo;&rsquo; and
the values above 128 can be confused with termination due to
receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar
manner to indicate <br>
that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some
scripts produce meaningful error messages differentiating
the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes
126 and <br>
127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all
attempts to exec the utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses
126 when any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other
<br>
reason.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The 4.3 BSD version of nice does not check whether increment
is a valid decimal integer. The command nice &acirc;x
utility, for example, would be treated the same as the
command nice <br>
&acirc;&acirc;1 utility. If the user does not have
appropriate privileges, this results in a
&lsquo;&lsquo;permission denied&rsquo;&rsquo; error. This is
considered a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a user without appropriate
privileges gives a negative increment, System V treats it
like the command nice &acirc;0 utility, while 4.3 BSD writes
a &lsquo;&lsquo;permission denied&rsquo;&rsquo; message <br>
and does not run the utility. The standard specifies the
System V behavior together with an optional BSD-style
&lsquo;&lsquo;permission denied&rsquo;&rsquo; message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The C shell has a built-in
version of nice that has a different interface from the one
described in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The term
&lsquo;&lsquo;utility&rsquo;&rsquo; is used, rather than
&lsquo;&lsquo;command&rsquo;&rsquo;, to highlight the fact
that shell compound commands, pipelines, and so on, cannot
be used. Special built-ins also cannot be <br>
used. However, &lsquo;&lsquo;utility&rsquo;&rsquo; includes
user application programs and shell scripts, not just
utilities defined in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations of
nice provide a nice value range of 40 or 41 discrete steps,
with the default nice value being the midpoint of that
range. By default, they raise the <br>
nice value of the executed utility by 10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some historical documentation
states that the increment value must be within a fixed
range. This is misleading; the valid increment values on any
invocation are determined by the <br>
current process nice value, which is not always the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The definition of nice value is
not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have
priorities that are comparable. Scheduling policy extensions
such as the realtime pri&acirc; <br>
orities in the System Interfaces volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 make the notion of a single underlying
priority for all scheduling policies problematic. Some
implementations may imple&acirc; <br>
ment the nice-related features to affect all processes on
the system, others to affect just the general time-sharing
activities implied by this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, and
others <br>
may have no effect at all. Because of the use of
&lsquo;&lsquo;implementation-defined&rsquo;&rsquo; in nice
and renice, a wide range of implementation strategies are
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of this
standard allowed a &acirc;increment option. This form is no
longer specified by POSIX.1&acirc;2008 but may be present in
some implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
