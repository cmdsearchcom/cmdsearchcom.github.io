<p>CHOWN(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
CHOWN(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
chown &acirc; change the file ownership</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
chown [&acirc;h] owner[:group] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chown &acirc;R
[&acirc;H|&acirc;L|&acirc;P] owner[:group] file...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The chown utility shall set the user ID of the file named by
each file operand to the user ID specified by the owner
operand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each file operand, or, if
the &acirc;R option is used, each file encountered while
walking the directory trees specified by the file operands,
the chown utility shall perform <br>
actions equivalent to the chown() function defined in the
System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, called with
the following arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The file operand shall be
used as the path argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The user ID indicated by the
owner portion of the first operand shall be used as the
owner argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the group portion of the
first operand is given, the group ID indicated by it shall
be used as the group argument; otherwise, the group
ownership shall not be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless chown is invoked by a
process with appropriate privileges, the set-user-ID and
set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be cleared upon
successful completion; the set- <br>
user-ID and set-group-ID bits of other file types may be
cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The chown utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported by the implementation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;h For each file operand
that names a file of type symbolic link, chown shall attempt
to set the user ID of the symbolic link. If a group ID was
specified, for each file <br>
operand that names a file of type symbolic link, chown shall
attempt to set the group ID of the symbolic link.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;H If the &acirc;R option
is specified and a symbolic link referencing a file of type
directory is specified on the command line, chown shall
change the user ID (and group ID, <br>
if specified) of the directory referenced by the symbolic
link and all files in the file hierarchy below it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;L If the &acirc;R option
is specified and a symbolic link referencing a file of type
directory is specified on the command line or encountered
during the traversal of a file <br>
hierarchy, chown shall change the user ID (and group ID, if
specified) of the directory referenced by the symbolic link
and all files in the file hierarchy below it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;P If the &acirc;R option
is specified and a symbolic link is specified on the command
line or encountered during the traversal of a file
hierarchy, chown shall change the owner <br>
ID (and group ID, if specified) of the symbolic link. The
chown utility shall not follow the symbolic link to any
other part of the file hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;R Recursively change file
user and group IDs. For each file operand that names a
directory, chown shall change the user ID (and group ID, if
specified) of the directory <br>
and all files in the file hierarchy below it. Unless a
&acirc;H, &acirc;L, or &acirc;P option is specified, it is
unspecified which of these options will be used as the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specifying more than one of the
mutually-exclusive options &acirc;H, &acirc;L, and &acirc;P
shall not be considered an error. The last option specified
shall determine the behavior of the utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following operands shall be supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">owner[:group] <br>
A user ID and optional group ID to be assigned to file. The
owner portion of this operand shall be a user name from the
user database or a numeric user ID. Either <br>
specifies a user ID which shall be given to each file named
by one of the file operands. If a numeric owner operand
exists in the user database as a user name, the user <br>
ID number associated with that user name shall be used as
the user ID. Similarly, if the group portion of this operand
is present, it shall be a group name from the <br>
group database or a numeric group ID. Either specifies a
group ID which shall be given to each file. If a numeric
group operand exists in the group database as a group <br>
name, the group ID number associated with that group name
shall be used as the group ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file A pathname of a file whose
user ID is to be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of chown:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in argu&acirc; <br>
ments).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
Not used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 The utility executed
successfully and all requested changes were made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
Only the owner of a file or the user with appropriate
privileges may change the owner or group of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some implementations restrict
the use of chown to a user with appropriate privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The System V and BSD versions use different exit status
codes. Some implementations used the exit status as a count
of the number of errors that occurred; this practice is <br>
unworkable since it can overflow the range of valid exit
status values. These are masked by specifying only 0 and
&gt;0 as exit values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The functionality of chown is
described substantially through references to functions in
the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008. In this
way, there is no duplication of <br>
effort required for describing the interactions of
permissions, multiple groups, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The 4.3 BSD method of specifying
both owner and group was included in this volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008 because:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* There are cases where the
desired end condition could not be achieved using the chgrp
and chown (that only changed the user ID) utilities. (If the
current owner is not a mem&acirc; <br>
ber of the desired group and the desired owner is not a
member of the current group, the chown() function could fail
unless both owner and group are changed at the same <br>
time.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Even if they could be changed
independently, in cases where both are being changed, there
is a 100% performance penalty caused by being forced to
invoke both utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The BSD syntax user[.group] was
changed to user[:group] in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008
because the &lt;period&gt; is a valid character in login
names (as specified by the Base Defini&acirc; <br>
tions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, login names consist of
characters in the portable filename character set). The
&lt;colon&gt; character was chosen as the replacement for
the &lt;period&gt; <br>
character because it would never be allowed as a character
in a user name or group name on historical
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &acirc;R option is
considered by some observers as an undesirable departure
from the historical UNIX system tools approach; since a
tool, find, already exists to recurse over <br>
directories, there seemed to be no good reason to require
other tools to have to duplicate that functionality.
However, the &acirc;R option was deemed an important user
convenience, <br>
is far more efficient than forking a separate process for
each element of the directory hierarchy, and is in
widespread historical use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
