<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
midicopy - Copy selected track, channel, time interval of a
MIDI file to another MIDI file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
midicopy is used to copy part of a MIDI file to another MIDI
file. You can select a particular time interval, particular
channels, and particular tracks or any combinations. If <br>
one or both of the run time parameters -from or -to are
included, the program returns the playing time in seconds of
the output file. Midicopy was developed by Seymour Shlien
<br>
from the midifilelib distribution available from
http://www.harmony-central.com/MIDI/midifilelib.tar.gz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-ver prints version number and then exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-trks n1,n2, etc <br>
Selects the tracks to be copied where the track numbers
start from 1. If more than one track is specified, they
should be separated by commas. You should always copy <br>
track 1 since by convention it contains information
pertinent to all the other tracks. By default all tracks are
copied unless you specify particular tracks using this <br>
run time parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xtrks n1,n2, etc <br>
Lists the tracks to exclude from copying. All other tracks
are copied. This option does not work in combination with
-trks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-chns n <br>
Like above, it specifies the MIDI channels to be copied. By
default all channels are copied. Channel numbers also start
from 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-from n <br>
The program will copy all MIDI commands starting from midi
pulse number n. By default it will start from time zero or
the beginning of the MIDI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-to n Stops copying all events
after midi pulse number n. By default the file is copied to
the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-frombeat n <br>
The program will copy all MIDI commands starting from
quarter beat number n. By default it will start from time
zero or the beginning of the MIDI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tobeat n <br>
Stops copying all events after quarter beat number n. By
default the file is copied to the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-fromsec n <br>
The program will copy all MIDI commands starting from time n
in seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tosec n <br>
Stops copying all events after time n in seconds. These two
options (-fromsec and -tosec) do not work accurately if the
MIDI file has more than one tempo command. Only the <br>
first one is used for converting seconds into MIDI pulse
units. It is therefore preferable to use the -from and -to
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-replace trk,loc,val <br>
This option should be used alone. Midicopy will copy the
entire file verbatim except it will replace a byte by val,
where the byte is located in the specified track (trk) <br>
and specified position (loc). Commonly this function is used
for changing a particular MIDI program number (instrument)
associated with a channel. You need to know the <br>
byte count in the track of that parameter in order to use
this function,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-tempo quarter notes/minute <br>
All tempo indications in the midi file will be replaced with
the above value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-speed factor <br>
All tempo indications in the midi file will be multiplied
with this factor. Values greater than 1.0 will speed up the
music while lower values slow the music. The factor <br>
is a floating point value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-drumfocus drum-code
excluded_drum_velocities <br>
The selected drum line (specified by the drum-code pitch
value) is highlighted by reducing the loudness of all other
drum lines to the excluded_drum_velocities value. The <br>
drum-code value must be in the range of 35 to 81
inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mutenodrum [level] <br>
All channels which are not 9 (drum channel) are attenuated
to the given level. If level is not specified, it is assumed
to be zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setdrumloudness n m <br>
where n is between 35 to 81 inclusive and m is the loudness
between 0 and 127. The loudness of all instances of drum n
are changed to m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
midicopy.exe -trks 1,5 -from 2669 -to 8634 uzicko.mid
fragment.mid Midicopy will copy tracks 1 and 5 starting from
midi pulse position 2669 and ending at MIDI pulse position
<br>
8634.</p>
