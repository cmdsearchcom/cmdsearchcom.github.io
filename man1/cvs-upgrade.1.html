<p>CVS-UPGRADE(1) Debian GNU/Linux manual
CVS-UPGRADE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cvs-upgrade - upgrade a debian source package kept in a CVS
repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cvs-upgrade [options] &lt;package name&gt; &lt;upstream
version&gt; [&lt;debian revision&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page explains the Debian cvs-upgrade utility,
which is used to upgrade Debian source packages in a CVS
repository. It expect a properly conditioned new upstream
<br>
sources in the cvs-buildpackage work directory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The upstream sources are
imported to the vendor branch and tagged
upstream_version_&lt;upstream version&gt; with all dots
translated to underscores. At this point the cvs-upgrade
util&acirc; <br>
ity pauses automatic actions, since manual intervention is
required to resolve any conflicts that may have occurred. It
reminds the user about checking out the sources,
resolv&acirc; <br>
ing conflicts, and tagging the debianized sources, using
debian_version_&lt;upstream version&gt;-&lt;debian
revision&gt; with all dots translated to underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please note that this command
does not actually change the working directory, or any
checked out copies. If you do not have a working directory,
you may simply do the following <br>
manually: <br>
cvs co -jupstream_version_&lt;OLD-VERS&gt;
-jupstream_version_&lt;NEW VERS&gt; &lt;PKG&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you already have a checked
out working directory, please do: <br>
cvs update -d -jupstream_version_&lt;OLD-VERS&gt;
-jupstream_version__&lt;NEW VERS&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs-upgrade expects the package
name, upstream version, and, if relevant, the Debian
revision on the command line. It also expects to find a
properly conditioned new upstream <br>
source archive, in .orig.tar.gz format, in the
cvs-buildpackage working directory. Please note that the
cvs-buildpackage work directory referred to here is the
scratch directory <br>
where this program works, not the directory that the human
uses to work in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvs-upgrade reads the same
config file /etc/cvsdeb.conf as the the other cvs-*
utilities do. People may use of the dry-run option to
inspect the steps this utility takes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Combined with the companion
utilities cvs-buildpackage and cvs-inject, this provides an
infrastructure to facilitate the use of CVS by Debian
maintainers. This allows one to keep <br>
separate CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and
possibly experimental distributions, along with the other
benefits of a version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Please note that the current behaviour of cvs-upgrade is to
ignore files that match the default list of file name
patterns to be ignored (this is built into cvs); and that
any <br>
.cvsignore files in the upstream sources shall be honoured.
This should be fine as long as upstream sources do not
include files that match CVS ignore patterns and yet should
be <br>
in the sources. The current list of ignored file name
patterns is: <br>
RCS SCCS CVS CVS.adm RCSLOG cvslog.* tags TAGS .make.state
.nse_depinfo *~ #* .#* ,* _$* *$ *.old *.bak *.BAK *.orig
*.rej .del-* *.a *.olb *.o *.obj *.so *.exe *.Z *.elc <br>
*.ln core</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to modify this
behaviour, there are ways to do this (you should see CVS
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o) The per-repository list in
&lsquo;$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore&rsquo; is appended to the
list, if that file exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o) The per-user list in
&lsquo;.cvsignore&rsquo; in your home directory is appended
to the list, if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o) Any entries in the
environment variable $CVSIGNORE is appended to the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any of the places listed
above, a single exclamation mark (&lsquo;!&rsquo;) clears
the ignore list. This can be used if you want to store any
file which normally is ignored by CVS. <br>
Also, any .cvsignore file found in the source directory is
also honoured.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Print out a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m If present, this option
directs this program to include the latest debian changelog,
if any, into the commit message. This overrides the
environment variable <br>
CVSDEB_USE_CHANGELOG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M&lt;module&gt; The name of the
CVS module. This argument overrides the settings in the
environment variable CVSDEB_MODULE. There is no
corresponding config file variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F There are two things CVS may
choke on symbolic links and CVS directories in the source
tree. Also, there are times when one may not want to honour
the <br>
upstream .cvsignore files. Without this option, the
cvs-upgrade program shall exit with an error message. This
option causes cvs-upgrade to ask whether you <br>
want to delete the offending files. If you answer y, it
removes them and continues; else it shall exit with an error
message. This argument overrides the <br>
settings in the environment variable CVSDEB_FORCECLEAN,
which in turn overrides the setting in the configuration
file, conf_forceclean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T&lt;tag&gt; The CVS tag to use
for exporting sources, rather than constructing one from the
version. This assumes you know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U&lt;tag&gt; The CVS tag to use
for the upstream tag, rather than constructing one from the
upstream version. This assumes you know what you are
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x&lt;prefix&gt; The name of the
default CVS prefix. This argument overrides the settings in
the environment variable CVSDEB_PREFIX, which in turn
overrides the setting in <br>
the configuration file, conf_prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R&lt;root directory&gt; Root of
the original sources archive. We expect to find the
&lt;package name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz file under
&lt;root directory&gt;/package name&gt;/ unless the cvs-
<br>
buildpackage work directory has been set, or we want to
export the original sources from the vendor branch of the
CVS tree. If the cvs-buildpackage work <br>
directory is set anywhere, (command line, configuration
file, environment variable), the root directory value is
ignored, since we only need the root direc&acirc; <br>
tory to set defaults for the work directory. This argument
overrides the settings in the environment variable
CVSDEB_ROOTDIR, and the configuration file vari&acirc; <br>
able conf_rootdir. Please note that the cvs-buildpackage
work directory referred to here is the scratch directory
where this program works, not the directory <br>
that the human uses to work in. This should probably not be
a sub dir of CVSROOT, since cvs shall refuse to export
packages there, and the script shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W&lt;work directory&gt; The
working directory, into which the sources will be exported
out of CVS and which should contain the original &lt;package
name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz Please <br>
note that it is not essential to have the original sources,
as this script will check out the vendor branch version
tagged as upstream_version_&lt;version&gt; <br>
(without the Debian revision). Setting this variable
overrides the settings for the root directory. This argument
also overrides the settings in the environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable CVSDEB_WORKDIR, and in the configuration file
variable conf_workdir. This should probably not be a sub dir
of CVSROOT, since cvs shall refuse <br>
to export packages there, and the script shall fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d&lt;number&gt; Turn on
debugging output. This lists the version numbers, the work
and root directories, as well as the CVS tag used to export
the sources. This overrides the <br>
DEBUG variable in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ctp Include package_ at the
start of the CVS tag. This overrides the CVSDEB_PACKAGEINTAG
environment variable and the conf_forcetag configuration
file option. <br>
The default is not to include the prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n The no exec (or dry-run)
option, causing cvs-upgrade to print out all actions that
would be taken without actually executing them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Make the utility more
verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE <br>
You are also allowed to specify an environment variable,
CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE, that overrides the default
substitution option of -ko -d. This is useful <br>
when you want to import a package that has a bunch of binary
files in the source tree (like emacs or rscheme).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Apart from the runtime options, cvs-upgrade also looks for
site-wide defaults in the file /etc/cvsdeb.conf. After that,
it looks for and reads ~/.cvsdeb.conf The default
config&acirc; <br>
uration allows there to be a site-wide override for the root
or the cvs-buildpackage working directories on the site, but
the cvsdeb.conf files are actually Bourne shell snip&acirc;
<br>
pets, and any legal shell directives may be included in
there. Note: Caution is urged with this file, since you can
totally change the way that the script behaves by suitable
<br>
editing this file.</p>
