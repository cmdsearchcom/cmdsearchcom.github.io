mailfoot - a full-online-ordered-training simulator for use with dbacl.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>mailfoot</b> automates the task of testing email filtering and classification
  programs such as <b>dbacl</b>(1). Given a set of categorized documents,
  mailfoot initiates test runs to estimate the classification errors and thereby
  permit fine tuning of the parameters of the classifier.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Full Online Ordered Training is a learning method for email classifiers where
  each incoming email is learned as soon as it arrives, thereby always keeping
  category descriptions up to date for the next classification. This directly
  models the way that some email classifiers are used in practice.
<div class="Pp"></div>
FOOT's error rates depend directly on the order in which emails are seen. A
  small change in ordering, as might happen due to networking delays, can have
  an impact on the number of misclassifications. Consequently, <b>mailfoot</b>
  does not give meaningful results, unless the sample emails are chosen
  carefully. However, as this method is commonly used by spam filters, it is
  still worth computing to foster comparisons. Other methods (see
  <b>mailcross</b>(1),<b>mailtoe</b>(1)) attempt to capture the behaviour of
  classification errors in other ways.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To improve and stabilize the error rate calculation, <b>mailfoot</b> performs
  the FOOT simulations several times on slightly reordered email streams, and
  averages the results. The reorderings occur by multiplexing the emails from
  each category mailbox in random order. Thus if there are three categories, the
  first email classified is chosen randomly from the front of the sample email
  streams of each type. The second email is also chosen randomly among the three
  types, from the front of the
<br/>
 streams after the first email was removed. Simulation stops when all sample
  streams are exhausted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>mailfoot</b> uses the environment variable MAILFOOT_FILTER when executing,
  which permits the simulation of arbitrary filters, provided these satisfy the
  compatibility conditions stated in the ENVIRONMENT section below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For convenience, <b>mailfoot</b> implements a <b>testsuite</b> framework with
  predefined wrappers for several open source classifiers. This permits the
  direct comparison of <b>dbacl</b>(1) with competing classifiers on the same
  set of email samples. See the USAGE section below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
During preparation, <b>mailfoot</b> builds a subdirectory named mailfoot.d in
  the current working directory. All needed calculations are performed inside
  this subdirectory.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
The normal usage pattern is the following: first, you should separate your email
  collection into several categories (manually or otherwise). Each category
  should be associated with one or more folders, but each folder should not
  contain more than one category. Next, you should decide how many runs to use,
  say 10. The more runs you use, the better the predicted error rates. However,
  more runs take more time. Now you can type
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 5.00ex; text-indent: -5.00ex;">% mailfoot
  prepare 10</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Next, for every category, you must add every folder associated with this
  category. Suppose you have three categories named <i>spam</i>, <i>work</i>,
  and <i>play</i>, which are associated with the mbox files <i>spam.mbox</i>,
  <i>work.mbox</i>, and <i>play.mbox</i> respectively. You would type
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailfoot add spam spam.mbox
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailfoot add work work.mbox
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailfoot add play play.mbox
<div class="Pp"></div>
You should aim for a similar number of emails in each category, as the random
  multiplexing will be unbalanced otherwise. The ordering of the email messages
  in each <i>*.mbox</i> file is important, and is preserved during each
  simulation. If you repeatedly add to the same category, the later mailboxes
  will be appended to the first, preserving the implied ordering.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can now perform as many FOOT simulations as desired. The multiplexed emails
  are classified and learned one at a time, by executing the command given in
  the environment variable MAILFOOT_FILTER. If not set, a default value is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailfoot run
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailfoot summarize
<div class="Pp"></div>
The testsuite commands are designed to simplify the above steps and allow
  comparison of a wide range of email classifiers, including but not limited to
  <b>dbacl</b>. Classifiers are supported through wrapper scripts, which are
  located in the <i>/usr/share/dbacl/testsuite</i> directory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first stage when using the testsuite is deciding which classifiers to
  compare. You can view a list of available wrappers by typing:
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailfoot testsuite list
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the wrapper scripts are NOT the actual email classifiers, which must
  be installed separately by your system administrator or otherwise. Once this
  is done, you can select one or more wrappers for the simulation by typing, for
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailfoot testsuite select dbaclA ifile
<div class="Pp"></div>
If some of the selected classifiers cannot be found on the system, they are not
  selected. Note also that some wrappers can have hard-coded category names,
  e.g. if the classifier only supports binary classification. Heed the warning
  messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It remains only to run the simulation. Beware, this can take a long time
  (several hours depending on the classifier).
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailfoot testsuite run
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
% mailfoot testsuite summarize
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once you are all done, you can delete the working files, log files etc. by
  typing
<div class="Pp"></div>
% mailfoot clean
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SCRIPT_INTERFACE"><a class="selflink" href="#SCRIPT_INTERFACE">SCRIPT
  INTERFACE</a></h1>
<b>mailfoot testsuite</b> takes care of learning and classifying your prepared
  email corpora for each selected classifier. Since classifiers have widely
  varying interfaces, this is only possible by wrapping those interfaces
  individually into a standard form which can be used by <b>mailfoot
  testsuite</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each wrapper script is a command line tool which accepts a single command
  followed by zero or more optional arguments, in the standard form:
<div class="Pp"></div>
wrapper command [argument]...
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each wrapper script also makes use of STDIN and STDOUT in a well defined way. If
  no behaviour is described, then no output or input should be used. The
  possible commands are described below:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">filter</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a single email is expected on STDIN, and a
      list of category filenames is expected in $2, $3, etc. The script writes
      the category name corresponding to the input email on STDOUT. No trailing
      newline is required or expected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">learn</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a standard mbox stream is expected on STDIN,
      while a suitable category file name is expected in $2. No output is
      written to STDOUT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">clean</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a directory is expected in $2, which is
      examined for old database information. If any old databases are found,
      they are purged or reset. No output is written to STDOUT.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">describe</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">IN this case, a single line of text is written to STDOUT,
      describing the filter's functionality. The line should be kept short to
      prevent line wrapping on a terminal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">bootstrap</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a directory is expected in $2. The wrapper
      script first checks for the existence of its associated classifier, and
      other prerequisites. If the check is successful, then the wrapper is
      cloned into the supplied directory. A courtesy notification should be
      given on STDOUT to express success or failure. It is also permissible to
      give longer descriptions caveats.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">toe</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Used by <b>mailtoe</b>(1).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">foot</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">In this case, a list of categories is expected in $3, $4,
      etc. Every possible category must be listed. Preceding this list, the true
      category is given in $2.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Right after loading, <b>mailfoot</b> reads the hidden file .mailfootrc in the
  $HOME directory, if it exists, so this would be a good place to define custom
  values for environment variables.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">MAILFOOT_FILTER</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This variable contains a shell command to be executed
      repeatedly during the running stage. The command should accept an email
      message on STDIN and output a resulting category name. On the command
      line, it should also accept first the true category name, then a list of
      all possible category file names. If the output category does not match
      the true category, then the relevant categories are assumed to have been
      silently updated/relearned. If MAILFOOT_FILTER is undefined,
      <b>mailfoot</b> uses a default value.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">TEMPDIR</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This directory is exported for the benefit of wrapper
      scripts. Scripts which need to create temporary files should place them a
      the location given in TEMPDIR.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
The subdirectory mailfoot.d can grow quite large. It contains a full copy of the
  training corpora, as well as learning files for <i>size</i> times all the
  added categories, and various log files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
FOOT simulations for <b>dbacl</b>(1) are very, very slow (order n squared) and
  will take all night to perform. This is not easy to improve.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="selflink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
Because the ordering of emails within the added mailboxes matters, the estimated
  error rates are not well defined or even meaningful in an objective sense.
  However, if the sample emails represent an actual snapshot of a user's
  incoming email, then the error rates are somewhat meaningful. The simulations
  can then be interpreted as alternate realities where a given classifier would
  have intercepted the incoming mail.
