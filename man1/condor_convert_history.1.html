As of Condor version 6.7.19, the Condor history file has a new format to allow
  fast searches backwards through the file. Not all queries can take advantage
  of the speed increase, but the ones that can are significantly faster.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Entries placed in the history file after upgrade to Condor 6.7.19 will
  automatically be saved in the new format. The new format adds information to
  the string which distinguishes and separates job entries. In order to search
  within this new format, no changes are necessary. However, to be able to
  search the entire history, the history file must be converted to the updated
  format. condor_convert_historydoes this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The condor_convert_historycommand can also be used to reconstruct the new format
  in a history file that has been corrupted or concantenated with another
  history file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Turn the condor_schedddaemon off while converting history files. Turn it back on
  after conversion is completed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Arguments to condor_convert_historyare the history files to convert. The history
  file is normally in the Condor spool directory; it is named history . Since
  the history file is rotated, there may be multiple history files, and all of
  them should be converted. On Unix platform variants, the easiest way to do
  this is:
<div class="Pp"></div>
cd `condor_config_val SPOOL`
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
condor_convert_history history*
<div class="Pp"></div>
condor_convert_historymakes a back up of each original history files in case of
  a problem. The names of these back up files are listed; names are formed by
  appending the suffix .oldver to the original file name. Move these back up
  files to a directory other than the spool directory. If kept in the spool
  directory, condor_historywill find the back ups, and will appear to have
  duplicate jobs.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Exit_Status"><a class="selflink" href="#Exit_Status">Exit

condor_convert_historywill exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success,
  and it will exit with the value 1 (one) upon failure.
