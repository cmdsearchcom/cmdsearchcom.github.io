<p>PHILOSOPHY(1) User Contributed Perl Documentation
PHILOSOPHY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PDL::Philosophy -- Why did we write PDL?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Some history from the creator of PDL, leading into the
philosophy and motivation behind this data language. This is
an attempt to summarize some of the common spirit between
pdl <br>
developers in order to answer the question &quot;Why
PDL&quot;?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Start of PDL <br>
&quot;Why is it that we entertain the belief that for every
purpose odd numbers are the most effectual?&quot; - Pliny
the Elder</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PDL project began in
February 1996, when I decided to experiment with writing my
own &lsquo;Data Language&rsquo;. I am an astronomer. My day
job involves a lot of analysis of digital <br>
data accumulated on many nights observing on telescopes
around the world. Such data might for example be images
containing millions of pixels and thousands of images of
distant <br>
stars and galaxies. Or more abstrusely, many hundreds of
digital spectra revealing the secrets of the composition and
properties of these distant objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously many astronomers have
dealt with these problems before, and a large amount of
software has been constructed to facilitate their analysis.
However, like many of my <br>
colleagues, I was constantly frustrated by the lack of
generality and flexibility of these programs and the
difficulty of doing anything out of the ordinary quickly and
easily. <br>
What I wanted had a name: &quot;Data Language&quot;, i.e. a
language which allowed the manipulation of large amounts of
data with simple arithmetic expressions. In fact some
commercial <br>
software worked like this, and I was impressed with the
capabilities but not with the price tag. And I thought I
could do better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a fairly computer literate
astronomer (read &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;geek&quot;
according to your local argot) I was very familiar with
&quot;Perl&quot;, a computer language which now seems to
fill the <br>
shelves of many bookstores around the world. I was impressed
by its power and flexibility, and especially its ease of
use. I had even explored the depths of its internals and
<br>
written an interface to allow graphics, the ease with which
I could then create charts and graphs, for my papers, was
refreshing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 5 of Perl had just been
released, and I was fascinated by the new features
available. Especially the support of arbitrary data
structures (or &quot;objects&quot; in modern <br>
parlance) and the ability to &quot;overload&quot; operators
- i.e. make mathematical symbols like &quot;+-*/&quot; do
whatever you felt like. It seemed to me it ought to be
possible to write an <br>
extension to Perl where I could play with my data in a
general way: for example using the maths operators
manipulate whole images at once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Well one slow night at an
observatory I just thought I would try a little experiment.
In a bored moment I fired up a text editor and started to
create a file called &lsquo;PDL.xs&rsquo; - a <br>
Perl extension module to manipulate data vectors. A few
hours later I actually had something half decent working,
where I could add two images in the Perl language, fast!
This <br>
was something I could not let rest, and it probably cost me
one or two scientific papers worth of productivity. A few
weeks later the Perl Data Language version 1.0 was born. It
<br>
was a pretty bare infant: very little was there apart from
the basic arithmetic operators. But encouraged I made it
available on the Internet to see what people thought.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Well people were fairly critical
- among the most vocal were Tuomas Lukka and Christian
Soeller. Unfortunately for them they were both Perl
enthusiasts too and soon found <br>
themselves improving my code to implement all the features
they thought PDL ought to have and I had heinously
neglected. PDL is a prime example of that modern phenomenon
of <br>
authoring large free software packages via the Internet.
Large numbers of people, most of whom have never met, have
made contributions ranging for core functionality to large
<br>
modules to the smallest of bug patches. PDL version 2.0 is
now here (though it should perhaps have been called version
10 to reflect the amount of growth in size and <br>
functionality) and the phenomenon continues. I firmly
believe that PDL is a great tool for tackling general
problems of data analysis. It is powerful, fast, easy to add
too and <br>
freely available to anyone. I wish I had had it when I was a
graduate student! I hope you too will find it of immense
value, I hope it will save you from heaps of time and <br>
frustration in solving complex problems. Of course it
can&rsquo;t do everything, but it provides the framework,
the hammers and the nails for building solutions without
having to <br>
reinvent wheels or levers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--- Karl Glazebook, the creator
of PDL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Major ideas <br>
The first tenet of our philosophy is the &quot;free
software&quot; idea: software being free has several
advantages (less bugs because more people see the code, you
can have the source and <br>
port it to your own working environment with you, ... and of
course, that you don&rsquo;t need to pay anything).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second idea is a pet peeve
of many: many languages like Matlab are pretty well suited
for their specific tasks but for a different application,
you need to change to an <br>
entirely different tool and regear yourself mentally. Not to
speak about doing an application that does two things at
once... Because we use Perl, we have the power and ease of
<br>
Perl syntax, regular expressions, hash tables, etc. at our
fingertips at all times. By extending an existing language,
we start from a much healthier base than languages like <br>
Matlab which have grown into existence from a very small
functionality at first and expanded little by little, making
things look badly planned. We stand by the Perl sayings:
<br>
&quot;simple things should be simple but complicated things
should be possible&quot; and &quot;There is more than one
way to do it&quot; (TIMTOWTDI).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The third idea is
interoperability: we want to be able to use PDL to drive as
many tools as possible, we can connect to OpenGL or Mesa for
graphics or whatever. There isn&rsquo;t <br>
anything out there that&rsquo;s really satisfactory as a
tool and can do everything we want easily. And be
portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The fourth idea is related to
&quot;PDL::PP&quot; and is Tuomas&rsquo;s personal favorite:
code should only specify as little as possible redundant
info. If you find yourself writing very <br>
similar-looking code much of the time, all that code could
probably be generated by a simple Perl script. The PDL C
preprocessor takes this to an extreme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minor goals and purposes <br>
We want speed. Optimally, it should ultimately (e.g. with
the Perl compiler) be possible to compile
&quot;PDL::PP&quot; subs to C and obtain the top vectorized
speeds on supercomputers. <br>
Also, we want to be able to calculate things at near top
speed from inside Perl, by using dataflow to avoid memory
allocation and deallocation (the overhead should ultimately
be <br>
only a little over one indirect function call plus couple of
ifs per function in the pipe).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go on, try it! <br>
Well, that&rsquo;s the philosophy behind PDL - speed,
conciseness, free, expandable, and integrated with the wide
base of modules and libraries that Perl provides. Feel free
to <br>
download it, install it, run through some of the tutorials
and introductions and have a play with it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enjoy!</p>
