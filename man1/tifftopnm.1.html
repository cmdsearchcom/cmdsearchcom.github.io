This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>tifftopnm</b> reads a TIFF file as input and produces a PNM image as output.
  The type of the output file depends on the input file - if it's black and
  white, <b>tifftopnm</b> generates a PBM image; if it's grayscale, it generates
  a PGM image; otherwise, the output is PPM. The program tells you which type it
  is writing.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the TIFF file contains multiple images (multiple 'directories'),
  <b>tifftopnm</b> generates a multi-image PNM output stream. Before Netpbm
  10.27 (March 2005), however, it would just ignore all but the first input
  image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>tiff-filename</i> argument names the regular file that contains the Tiff
  image. If you specify '-' or don't specify this argument, <b>tfftopnm</b> uses
  Standard Input. In either case, the file must be seekable. That means no pipe,
  but any regular file is fine.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="TIFF_Capability"><a class="selflink" href="#TIFF_Capability">TIFF
  Capability</a></h2>
<b>pamtotiff</b> uses the Libtiff.org TIFF library (or whatever equivalent you
  provide) to interpret the TIFF input. So the set of files it is able to
  interpret is determined mostly by that library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program cannot read every possible TIFF file -- there are myriad variations
  of the TIFF format. However, it does understand monochrome and gray scale,
  RGB, RGBA (red/green/blue with alpha channel), CMYK (Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black
  ink color separation), and color palette TIFF files. An RGB file can have
  either single plane (interleaved) color or multiple plane format. The program
  reads 1-8 and 16 bit-per-sample input, the latter in either bigendian or
  littlendian encoding. Tiff directory information may also be either bigendian
  or littlendian.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are many TIFF formats that <b>tifftopnm</b> can read only if the image is
  small enough to fit in memory. <b>tifftopnm</b> uses the TIFF library's
  TIFFRGBAImageGet() function to process the TIFF image if it can get enough
  memory for TIFFRGBAImageGet() to store the whole image in memory at once
  (that's what TIFFRGBAImageGet() does). If not, <b>tifftopnm</b> uses a more
  primitive row-by-row conversion strategy using the raw data returned by
  TIFFReadScanLine() and native intelligence. That native intelligence does not
  know as many formats as TIFFRGBAImageGet() does. And certain compressed
  formats simply cannot be read with TIFFReadScanLine().
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.11 (October 2002), <b>tifftopnm</b> never used
  TIFFRGBAImageGet(), so it could not interpret many of the formats it can
  interpret today.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is no fundamental reason that this program could not read other kinds of
  TIFF files even when they don't fit in memory all at once. The existing
  limitations are mainly because no one has asked for more.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Output_Image"><a class="selflink" href="#Output_Image">Output
  Image</a></h2>
The PNM output has the same maxval as the Tiff input, except that if the Tiff
  input is colormapped (which implies a maxval of 65535) the PNM output has a
  maxval of 255. Though this may result in lost information, such input images
  hardly ever actually have more color resolution than a maxval of 255 provides
  and people often cannot deal with PNM files that have maxval &gt; 255. By
  contrast, a non-colormapped Tiff image that doesn't need a maxval &gt; 255
  doesn't <i>have</i> a maxval &gt; 255, so when <b>tifftopnm</b> sees a
  non-colormapped maxval &gt; 255, it takes it seriously and produces a matching
  output maxval.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another exception is where the TIFF maxval is greater than 65535, which is the
  maximum allowed by the Netpbm formats. In that case, <b>tifftopnm</b> uses a
  maxval of 65535, and you lose some information in the conversion.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Whole Image is preferable because the Tiff library does more of the work,
      which means it understands more of the Tiff format possibilities now and
      in the future. Also, some compressed TIFF formats don't allow you to
      extract an individual row.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Row By Row uses far less memory, which means with large images, it can run
      in environments where Whole Image cannot and may also run faster. And
      because Netpbm code does more of the work, it's possible that it can be
      more flexible or at least give better diagnostic information if there's
      something wrong with the TIFF.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The Netpbm native code may do something correctly that the TIFF library does
      incorrectly, or vice versa.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In Netpbm, we stress function over performance, so by default we try Whole
      Image first, and if we can't get enough memory for the decoded image or
      <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b> fails, we fall back to Row By Row. But if you
      specify the <b>-byrow</b> option, <b>tifftopnm</b> will not attempt Whole
      Image. If Row By Row does not work, it simply fails.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    See</dd>
</dl>
<a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="#cmyk">Color Separation (CMYK) TIFFs</a> for a
  description of one way Row By Row makes a significant difference in your
  results.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Whole Image costs you precision when your TIFF image uses more than 8 bits per
  sample. <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b> converts the samples to 8 bits.
  <b>tifftopnm</b> then scales them back to maxval 65535, but the lower 8 bits
  of information is gone.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In many versions of the TIFF library, <b>TIFFRGBAImageGet()</b> does not
  correctly interpret TIFF files in which the raster orientation is column-major
  (i.e. a row of the raster is a column of the image). With such a TIFF library
  and file, you must use <b>-byrow</b> to get correct output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Before Netpbm 10.11 (October 2002), <b>tifftopnm</b> always did Row By Row.
  Netpbm 10.12 always tried Whole Image first. <b>-byrow</b> came in with Netpbm
  10.13 (January 2003).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-orientraw</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A TIFF stream contains raster data which can be arranged in
      the stream various ways. Most commonly, it is arranged by rows, with the
      top row first, and the pixels left to right within each row, but many
      other orientations are possible.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The common orientation is the same on the Netpbm formats use, so
      <b>tifftopnm</b> can do its jobs quite efficiently when the TIFF raster is
      oriented that way.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    But if the TIFF raster is oriented any other way, it can take a considerable
      amount of processing for <b>tifftopnm</b> to convert it to Netpbm format.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>-orientraw</b> says to produce an output image that represents the raw
      raster in the TIFF stream rather than the image the TIFF stream is
      supposed to represent. In the output, the top left corner corresponds to
      the start of the TIFF raster, the next pixel to the right is the next
      pixel in the TIFF raster, etc. <b>tifftopnm</b> can do this easily, but
      you don't get the right image out. You can use <b>pamflip</b> to turn the
      output into the image the TIFF stream represents (but if you do that, you
      pretty much lose the benefit of <b>-orientraw</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    With this option, <b>tifftopnm</b> always uses the Row By Row method (see
      <b>-byrow</b>).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This option was new in Netpbm 10.42 (March 2008). Before that,
      <b>tifftopnm</b> generally produces arbitrary results with TIFF images

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Fillorder"><a class="selflink" href="#Fillorder">Fillorder</a></h2>
There is a piece of information in the header of a TIFF image called
  'fillorder.' The TIFF specification quite clearly states that this value tells
  the order in which bits are arranged in a byte in the description of the
  image's pixels. There are two options, assuming that the image has a format
  where more than one pixel can be represented by a single byte: 1) the byte is
  filled from most significant bit to least significant bit going left to right
  in the image; and 2) the opposite.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, there is confusion in the world as to the meaning of fillorder.
  Evidence shows that some people believe it has to do with byte order when a
  single value is represented by two bytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
These people cause TIFF images to be created that, while they use a MSB-to-LSB
  fillorder, have a fillorder tag that says they used LSB-to-MSB. A program that
  properly interprets a TIFF image will not end up with the image that the
  author intended in this case.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For a long time, <b>tifftopnm</b> did not understand fillorder itself and
  assumed the fillorder was MSB-to-LSB regardless of the fillorder tag in the
  TIFF header. And as far as I know, there is no legitimate reason to use a
  fillorder other than MSB-to-LSB. So users of <b>tifftopnm</b> were happily
  using those TIFF images that had incorrect fillorder tags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So that those users can continue to be happy, <b>tifftopnm</b> today continues
  to ignore the fillorder tag unless you tell it not to. (It does, however, warn
  you when the fillorder tag does not say MSB-to-LSB that the tag is being
  ignored).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If for some reason you have a TIFF image that actually has LSB-to-MSB fillorder,
  and its fillorder tag correctly indicates that, you must use the
  <b>-respectfillorder</b> option on <b>tifftopnm</b> to get proper results.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Examples of incorrect TIFF images are at
  <a class="Lk" title="Lk" href="ftp://weather.noaa.gov.">ftp://weather.noaa.gov.</a>
  They are apparently created by a program called <b>faxtotiff</b>.

  Separation (CMYK) TIFFs</a></h2>
Some TIFF images contain color information in CMYK form, whereas PNM images use
  RGB. There are various formulas for converting between these two forms, and
  <b>tifftopnm</b> can use either of two.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The TIFF library (Version 3.5.4 from libtiff.org) uses Y=(1-K)*(1-B) (similar
  for R and G) in its TIFFRGBAImageGet() service. When <b>tifftopnm</b> works in
  Whole Image mode, it uses that service, so that's the conversion you get.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But when <b>tifftopnm</b> runs in Row By Row mode, it does not use
  TIFFRGBAImageGet(), and you get what appears to be more useful: Y=1-(B+K).
  This is the inverse of what <b>pnmtotiffcmyk</b> does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the <b>-byrow</b> option for more information on Whole Image versus Row By
  Row mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before Netpbm 10.21 (March 2004), <b>tifftopnm</b> used the Y=(1-K)*(1-B)
  formula always.
