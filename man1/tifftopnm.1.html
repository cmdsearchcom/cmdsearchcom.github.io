<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tifftopnm - convert a TIFF file into a PNM image</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tifftopnm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-alphaout={alpha-filename,-}]
[-headerdump] [-verbose] [-respectfillorder] [-byrow]
[-orientraw] [tiff-filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tifftopnm reads a TIFF file as
input and produces a PNM image as output. The type of the
output file depends on the input file - if it&rsquo;s black
and white, tifftopnm generates a <br>
PBM image; if it&rsquo;s grayscale, it generates a PGM
image; otherwise, the output is PPM. The program tells you
which type it is writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the TIFF file contains
multiple images (multiple &rsquo;directories&rsquo;),
tifftopnm generates a multi-image PNM output stream. Before
Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005), however, it would just <br>
ignore all but the first input image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tiff-filename argument names
the regular file that contains the Tiff image. If you
specify &rsquo;-&rsquo; or don&rsquo;t specify this
argument, tfftopnm uses Standard Input. In either case, <br>
the file must be seekable. That means no pipe, but any
regular file is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIFF Capability <br>
pamtotiff uses the Libtiff.org TIFF library (or whatever
equivalent you provide) to interpret the TIFF input. So the
set of files it is able to interpret is determined mostly by
<br>
that library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program cannot read every
possible TIFF file -- there are myriad variations of the
TIFF format. However, it does understand monochrome and gray
scale, RGB, RGBA <br>
(red/green/blue with alpha channel), CMYK
(Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black ink color separation), and color
palette TIFF files. An RGB file can have either single plane
(interleaved) <br>
color or multiple plane format. The program reads 1-8 and 16
bit-per-sample input, the latter in either bigendian or
littlendian encoding. Tiff directory information may also
<br>
be either bigendian or littlendian.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are many TIFF formats that
tifftopnm can read only if the image is small enough to fit
in memory. tifftopnm uses the TIFF library&rsquo;s
TIFFRGBAImageGet() function to process <br>
the TIFF image if it can get enough memory for
TIFFRGBAImageGet() to store the whole image in memory at
once (that&rsquo;s what TIFFRGBAImageGet() does). If not,
tifftopnm uses a more <br>
primitive row-by-row conversion strategy using the raw data
returned by TIFFReadScanLine() and native intelligence. That
native intelligence does not know as many formats as <br>
TIFFRGBAImageGet() does. And certain compressed formats
simply cannot be read with TIFFReadScanLine().</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.11 (October
2002), tifftopnm never used TIFFRGBAImageGet(), so it could
not interpret many of the formats it can interpret
today.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is no fundamental reason
that this program could not read other kinds of TIFF files
even when they don&rsquo;t fit in memory all at once. The
existing limitations are mainly <br>
because no one has asked for more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Image <br>
The PNM output has the same maxval as the Tiff input, except
that if the Tiff input is colormapped (which implies a
maxval of 65535) the PNM output has a maxval of 255. Though
<br>
this may result in lost information, such input images
hardly ever actually have more color resolution than a
maxval of 255 provides and people often cannot deal with PNM
files <br>
that have maxval &gt; 255. By contrast, a non-colormapped
Tiff image that doesn&rsquo;t need a maxval &gt; 255
doesn&rsquo;t have a maxval &gt; 255, so when tifftopnm sees
a non-colormapped maxval &gt; <br>
255, it takes it seriously and produces a matching output
maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another exception is where the
TIFF maxval is greater than 65535, which is the maximum
allowed by the Netpbm formats. In that case, tifftopnm uses
a maxval of 65535, and you <br>
lose some information in the conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
You may abbreviate any option to its shortest unique prefix.
You may use two hyphens instead of one in options. You may
separate an option and its value either by an equals <br>
sign or white space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-alphaout=alpha-filename <br>
tifftopnm creates a PGM file containing the alpha channel
values in the input image. If the input image doesn&rsquo;t
contain an alpha channel, the alpha-filename file contains
<br>
all zero (transparent) alpha values. If you don&rsquo;t
specify -alphaout,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tifftopnm does not generate an
alpha file, and if the input image has an alpha channel,
tifftopnm simply discards it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you specify - as the
filename, tifftopnm writes the alpha output to Standard
Output and discards the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See pamcomp(1) <br>
for one way to use the alpha output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-respectfillorder <br>
By default, tifftopnm ignores the &rsquo;fillorder&rsquo;
tag in the TIFF input, which means it may incorrectly
interpret the image. To make it follow the spec, use this
option. <br>
For a lengthy but engaging discussion of why tifftopnm works
this way and how to use the -respectfillorder option, see
the note on fillorder below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-byrow This option can make
tifftopnm run faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tifftopnm has two ways to do the
conversion from Tiff to PNM, using respectively two
facilities of the TIFF library:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whole Image <br>
Decode the entire image into memory at once, using
TIFFRGBAImageGet(), then convert to PNM and output row by
row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Row By Row <br>
Read, convert, and output one row at a time using
TIFFReadScanline()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whole Image is preferable
because the Tiff library does more of the work, which means
it understands more of the Tiff format possibilities now and
in the future. Also, <br>
some compressed TIFF formats don&rsquo;t allow you to
extract an individual row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Row By Row uses far less memory,
which means with large images, it can run in environments
where Whole Image cannot and may also run faster. And
because Netpbm code does <br>
more of the work, it&rsquo;s possible that it can be more
flexible or at least give better diagnostic information if
there&rsquo;s something wrong with the TIFF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Netpbm native code may do
something correctly that the TIFF library does incorrectly,
or vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Netpbm, we stress function
over performance, so by default we try Whole Image first,
and if we can&rsquo;t get enough memory for the decoded
image or TIFFRGBAImageGet() <br>
fails, we fall back to Row By Row. But if you specify the
-byrow option, tifftopnm will not attempt Whole Image. If
Row By Row does not work, it simply fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See Color Separation (CMYK)
TIFFs &acirc;&uml;#cmyk&acirc;&copy; for a description of
one way Row By Row makes a significant difference in your
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whole Image costs you precision
when your TIFF image uses more than 8 bits per sample.
TIFFRGBAImageGet() converts the samples to 8 bits. tifftopnm
then scales them back <br>
to maxval 65535, but the lower 8 bits of information is
gone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In many versions of the TIFF
library, TIFFRGBAImageGet() does not correctly interpret
TIFF files in which the raster orientation is column-major
(i.e. a row of the raster <br>
is a column of the image). With such a TIFF library and
file, you must use -byrow to get correct output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.11 (October
2002), tifftopnm always did Row By Row. Netpbm 10.12 always
tried Whole Image first. -byrow came in with Netpbm 10.13
(January 2003).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-orientraw <br>
A TIFF stream contains raster data which can be arranged in
the stream various ways. Most commonly, it is arranged by
rows, with the top row first, and the pixels left to <br>
right within each row, but many other orientations are
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The common orientation is the
same on the Netpbm formats use, so tifftopnm can do its jobs
quite efficiently when the TIFF raster is oriented that
way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But if the TIFF raster is
oriented any other way, it can take a considerable amount of
processing for tifftopnm to convert it to Netpbm format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-orientraw says to produce an
output image that represents the raw raster in the TIFF
stream rather than the image the TIFF stream is supposed to
represent. In the out&acirc; <br>
put, the top left corner corresponds to the start of the
TIFF raster, the next pixel to the right is the next pixel
in the TIFF raster, etc. tifftopnm can do this easily, <br>
but you don&rsquo;t get the right image out. You can use
pamflip to turn the output into the image the TIFF stream
represents (but if you do that, you pretty much lose the
ben&acirc; <br>
efit of -orientraw).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With this option, tifftopnm
always uses the Row By Row method (see -byrow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was new in Netpbm
10.42 (March 2008). Before that, tifftopnm generally
produces arbitrary results with TIFF images that have an
orientation other than the <br>
common one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
Print extra messages to Standard Error about the
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-headerdump <br>
Dump TIFF file information to stderr. This information may
be useful in debugging TIFF file conversion problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Fillorder <br>
There is a piece of information in the header of a TIFF
image called &rsquo;fillorder.&rsquo; The TIFF specification
quite clearly states that this value tells the order in
which bits are <br>
arranged in a byte in the description of the image&rsquo;s
pixels. There are two options, assuming that the image has a
format where more than one pixel can be represented by a
single <br>
byte: 1) the byte is filled from most significant bit to
least significant bit going left to right in the image; and
2) the opposite.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, there is confusion in
the world as to the meaning of fillorder. Evidence shows
that some people believe it has to do with byte order when a
single value is represented <br>
by two bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These people cause TIFF images
to be created that, while they use a MSB-to-LSB fillorder,
have a fillorder tag that says they used LSB-to-MSB. A
program that properly interprets <br>
a TIFF image will not end up with the image that the author
intended in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a long time, tifftopnm did
not understand fillorder itself and assumed the fillorder
was MSB-to-LSB regardless of the fillorder tag in the TIFF
header. And as far as I know, <br>
there is no legitimate reason to use a fillorder other than
MSB-to-LSB. So users of tifftopnm were happily using those
TIFF images that had incorrect fillorder tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So that those users can continue
to be happy, tifftopnm today continues to ignore the
fillorder tag unless you tell it not to. (It does, however,
warn you when the fillorder tag <br>
does not say MSB-to-LSB that the tag is being ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If for some reason you have a
TIFF image that actually has LSB-to-MSB fillorder, and its
fillorder tag correctly indicates that, you must use the
-respectfillorder option on <br>
tifftopnm to get proper results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples of incorrect TIFF
images are at ftp://weather.noaa.gov.
&acirc;&uml;ftp://weather.noaa.gov.&acirc;&copy; They are
apparently created by a program called faxtotiff.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This note was written on January

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color Separation (CMYK) TIFFs
<br>
Some TIFF images contain color information in CMYK form,
whereas PNM images use RGB. There are various formulas for
converting between these two forms, and tifftopnm can use
<br>
either of two.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TIFF library (Version 3.5.4
from libtiff.org) uses Y=(1-K)*(1-B) (similar for R and G)
in its TIFFRGBAImageGet() service. When tifftopnm works in
Whole Image mode, it uses <br>
that service, so that&rsquo;s the conversion you get.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But when tifftopnm runs in Row
By Row mode, it does not use TIFFRGBAImageGet(), and you get
what appears to be more useful: Y=1-(B+K). This is the
inverse of what pnmtotiffcmyk <br>
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the -byrow option for more
information on Whole Image versus Row By Row mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm 10.21 (March
2004), tifftopnm used the Y=(1-K)*(1-B) formula always.</p>
