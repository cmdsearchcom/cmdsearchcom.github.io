<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnuift &acirc; GNU Image Finding Tool - index and search
images by content</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This manual page documents briefly the gnuift and gift-*
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page was written for
the Debian distribution because the original program does
not have a manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GIFT (the GNU Image-Finding
Tool) is a Content Based Image Retrieval System (CBIRS). It
enables you to do Query By Example on images, giving you the
opportunity to improve <br>
query results by relevance feedback. For processing your
queries the program relies entirely on the content of the
images, freeing you from the need to annotate all images
before <br>
querying the collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GIFT comes with a tool which
lets you index whole directory trees containing images in
one go. You then can use the GIFT server and its client, to
browse your own image col&acirc; <br>
lections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GIFT is an open framework
for content-based image retrieval. We explicitly have taken
into account the possibility of adding new ways of querying
to the framework. Our commu&acirc; <br>
nication protocol for client-server communication, MRML, is
XML based and fully documented (http://www.mrml.net). This
aims at promoting code reuse among researchers and
applica&acirc; <br>
tion developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The current version of the GIFT
can be seen in action at http://viper.unige.ch/demo/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The GIFT (ex Viper) is the
result of a research effort at the Vision Group at the CUI
(computer science center) of the University of Geneva (see
http://vision.unige.ch/). This <br>
cutting-edge research has been the subject of several
publications and conference talks. Details can be found at
http://viper.unige.ch/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
The gnuift-doc package contains reference manuals,
configuration hints and further information.</p>
