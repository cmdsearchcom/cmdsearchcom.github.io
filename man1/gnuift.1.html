gnuift &#x2014; GNU Image Finding Tool - index and search images by content
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual page documents briefly the <b>gnuift</b> and <b>gift-*</b> commands.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This manual page was written for the <b>Debian</b> distribution because the
  original program does not have a manual page.

The GIFT (the GNU Image-Finding Tool) is a Content Based Image Retrieval System
  (CBIRS). It enables you to do Query By Example on images, giving you the
  opportunity to improve query results by relevance feedback. For processing
  your queries the program relies entirely on the content of the images, freeing
  you from the need to annotate all images before querying the collection.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GIFT comes with a tool which lets you index whole directory trees containing
  images in one go. You then can use the GIFT server and its client, to browse
  your own image collections.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GIFT is an open framework for content-based image retrieval. We explicitly
  have taken into account the possibility of adding new ways of querying to the
  framework. Our communication protocol for client-server communication, MRML,
  is XML based and fully documented (http://www.mrml.net). This aims at
  promoting code reuse among researchers and application developers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The current version of the GIFT can be seen in action at
  http://viper.unige.ch/demo/
<div class="Pp"></div>
The GIFT (ex Viper) is the result of a research effort at the Vision Group at
  the CUI (computer science center) of the University of Geneva (see
  http://vision.unige.ch/). This cutting-edge research has been the subject of
  several publications and conference talks. Details can be found at
  http://viper.unige.ch/.
