ABC is a growing software system for synthesis and verification of binary
  sequential logic circuits appearing in synchronous hardware designs. ABC
  combines scalable logic optimization based on And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs),
  optimal-delay DAG-based technology mapping for look-up tables and standard
  cells, and innovative algorithms for sequential synthesis and verification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
ABC provides an experimental implementation of these algorithms and a
  programming environment for building similar applications. Future development
  will focus on improving the algorithms and making most of the packages
  stand-alone. This will allow the user to customize ABC for their needs as if
  it were a toolbox rather than a complete tool.

Data structures and algorithms at the heart of a software system determine its
  capabilities in processing data and its efficiency as a programming
  environment for building new applications. Extensive experience of developing
  and using SIS, VIS, and MVSIS, makes it clear that these systems do not
  provide a flexible programming environment to implement recent innovations,
  such as integration of technology mapping and retiming. Specifically, the SIS
  environment is outdated and rather inefficient when handling large circuits.
  VIS, designed as a formal verification tool for multi-valued specifications,
  does not provide enough flexibility for binary synthesis. MVSIS was developed
  and extensively used by us in the recent years for implementing new synthesis
  algorithms for both multi-valued and binary networks. Finally, we became
  convinced that (a) the basic data structures and algorithms of MVSIS can be
  made considerably simpler and easier to use by assuming binary networks, and
  (b) a central place in the new system should be given to a new data structure,
  AIGs (multi-level logic networks composed of two-input ANDs and inverters),
  which promises improvements in quality and runtime of synthesis and
  verification.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This understanding motivates us to redevelop the core packages of MVSIS
  resulting in a new programming environment named ABC. As the name suggests,
  the primary goal is to keep data structures simple and flexible for a wide
  range of applications. The &#x201C;philosophy of ABC&#x201D; has several basic
  premises. One of them is allowing for a variety of functional representations,
  such as BDDs and SOPs, to solve specialized tasks, while defaulting to AIGs
  for the mainstream network manipulation. Representing logic using AIGs leads
  to a remarkable uniformity in computation and efficient interfacing with
  CNF-based SAT solvers for handing Boolean reasoning problems. Another
  fundamental premise of ABC is the synergy between synthesis and verification
  using efficient SAT-based Boolean reasoning on the AIG for combinational and
  sequential equivalence checking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The goal of the ABC project is to provide a public-domain implementation of the
  state-of-the-art combinational and sequential synthesis algorithms and, at the
  same time, create an open-source environment, in which such applications can
  be developed and compared. The current version of ABC can optimize/map/retime
  industrial gate-level designs with 100K gates and 10K sequential elements for
  optimal delay and heuristically minimized area in about one minute of CPU time
  on a modern computer. The runtime of the combinational synthesis, mapping, and
  verification is typically faster.</div>
