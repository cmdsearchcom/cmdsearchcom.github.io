<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
abc - sequential logic synthesis and formal verification</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
abc [OPTIONS] FILE</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ABC is a growing software system for synthesis and
verification of binary sequential logic circuits appearing
in synchronous hardware designs. ABC combines scalable logic
opti&acirc; <br>
mization based on And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), optimal-delay
DAG-based technology mapping for look-up tables and standard
cells, and innovative algorithms for sequential synthesis
<br>
and verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABC provides an experimental
implementation of these algorithms and a programming
environment for building similar applications. Future
development will focus on improving the <br>
algorithms and making most of the packages stand-alone. This
will allow the user to customize ABC for their needs as if
it were a toolbox rather than a complete tool.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
Data structures and algorithms at the heart of a software
system determine its capabilities in processing data and its
efficiency as a programming environment for building new
<br>
applications. Extensive experience of developing and using
SIS, VIS, and MVSIS, makes it clear that these systems do
not provide a flexible programming environment to implement
<br>
recent innovations, such as integration of technology
mapping and retiming. Specifically, the SIS environment is
outdated and rather inefficient when handling large
circuits. <br>
VIS, designed as a formal verification tool for multi-valued
specifications, does not provide enough flexibility for
binary synthesis. MVSIS was developed and extensively used
<br>
by us in the recent years for implementing new synthesis
algorithms for both multi-valued and binary networks.
Finally, we became convinced that (a) the basic data
structures <br>
and algorithms of MVSIS can be made considerably simpler and
easier to use by assuming binary networks, and (b) a central
place in the new system should be given to a new data <br>
structure, AIGs (multi-level logic networks composed of
two-input ANDs and inverters), which promises improvements
in quality and runtime of synthesis and verification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This understanding motivates us
to redevelop the core packages of MVSIS resulting in a new
programming environment named ABC. As the name suggests, the
primary goal is to keep <br>
data structures simple and flexible for a wide range of
applications. The &acirc;philosophy of ABC&acirc; has
several basic premises. One of them is allowing for a
variety of functional <br>
representations, such as BDDs and SOPs, to solve specialized
tasks, while defaulting to AIGs for the mainstream network
manipulation. Representing logic using AIGs leads to a <br>
remarkable uniformity in computation and efficient
interfacing with CNF-based SAT solvers for handing Boolean
reasoning problems. Another fundamental premise of ABC is
the syn&acirc; <br>
ergy between synthesis and verification using efficient
SAT-based Boolean reasoning on the AIG for combinational and
sequential equivalence checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The goal of the ABC project is
to provide a public-domain implementation of the
state-of-the-art combinational and sequential synthesis
algorithms and, at the same time, create <br>
an open-source environment, in which such applications can
be developed and compared. The current version of ABC can
optimize/map/retime industrial gate-level designs with 100K
<br>
gates and 10K sequential elements for optimal delay and
heuristically minimized area in about one minute of CPU time
on a modern computer. The runtime of the combinational
syn&acirc; <br>
thesis, mapping, and verification is typically faster.</p>
