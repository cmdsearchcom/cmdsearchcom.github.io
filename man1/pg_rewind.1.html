<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pg_rewind - synchronize a PostgreSQL data directory with
another data directory that was forked from it</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pg_rewind [option...] {-D | --target-pgdata} directory
{--source-pgdata=directory | --source-server=connstr}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pg_rewind is a tool for synchronizing a PostgreSQL cluster
with another copy of the same cluster, after the
clusters&rsquo; timelines have diverged. A typical scenario
is to bring an <br>
old master server back online after failover as a standby
that follows the new master.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The result is equivalent to
replacing the target data directory with the source one.
Only changed blocks from relation files are copied; all
other files are copied in full, <br>
including configuration files. The advantage of pg_rewind
over taking a new base backup, or tools like rsync, is that
pg_rewind does not require reading through unchanged blocks
<br>
in the cluster. This makes it a lot faster when the database
is large and only a small fraction of blocks differ between
the clusters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_rewind examines the timeline
histories of the source and target clusters to determine the
point where they diverged, and expects to find WAL in the
target cluster&rsquo;s pg_xlog <br>
directory reaching all the way back to the point of
divergence. The point of divergence can be found either on
the target timeline, the source timeline, or their common
ancestor. <br>
In the typical failover scenario where the target cluster
was shut down soon after the divergence, this is not a
problem, but if the target cluster ran for a long time after
the <br>
divergence, the old WAL files might no longer be present. In
that case, they can be manually copied from the WAL archive
to the pg_xlog directory, or fetched on startup by <br>
configuring recovery.conf. The use of pg_rewind is not
limited to failover, e.g. a standby server can be promoted,
run some write transactions, and then rewinded to become a
<br>
standby again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the target server is
started for the first time after running pg_rewind, it will
go into recovery mode and replay all WAL generated in the
source server after the point of <br>
divergence. If some of the WAL was no longer available in
the source server when pg_rewind was run, and therefore
could not be copied by the pg_rewind session, it must be
made <br>
available when the target server is started. This can be
done by creating a recovery.conf file in the target data
directory with a suitable restore_command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pg_rewind requires that the
target server either has the wal_log_hints option enabled in
postgresql.conf or data checksums enabled when the cluster
was initialized with initdb. <br>
Neither of these are currently on by default.
full_page_writes must also be set to on, but is enabled by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
pg_rewind accepts the following command-line arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D directory <br>
--target-pgdata=directory <br>
This option specifies the target data directory that is
synchronized with the source. The target server must be shut
down cleanly before running pg_rewind</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source-pgdata=directory <br>
Specifies the file system path to the data directory of the
source server to synchronize the target with. This option
requires the source server to be cleanly shut down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source-server=connstr <br>
Specifies a libpq connection string to connect to the source
PostgreSQL server to synchronize the target with. The
connection must be a normal (non-replication) connection
<br>
with superuser access. This option requires the source
server to be running and not in recovery mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
--dry-run <br>
Do everything except actually modifying the target
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P <br>
--progress <br>
Enables progress reporting. Turning this on will deliver an
approximate progress report while copying data from the
source cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
Print verbose debugging output that is mostly useful for
developers debugging pg_rewind.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V <br>
--version <br>
Display version information, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? <br>
--help <br>
Show help, then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
When --source-server option is used, pg_rewind also uses the
environment variables supported by libpq (see Section 32.14,
&acirc;Environment Variables&acirc;, in the
documentation).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
How it works <br>
The basic idea is to copy all file system-level changes from
the source cluster to the target cluster:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Scan the WAL log of the
target cluster, starting from the last checkpoint before the
point where the source cluster&rsquo;s timeline history
forked off from the target cluster. For <br>
each WAL record, record each data block that was touched.
This yields a list of all the data blocks that were changed
in the target cluster, after the source cluster forked <br>
off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Copy all those changed blocks
from the source cluster to the target cluster, either using
direct file system access (--source-pgdata) or SQL
(--source-server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Copy all other files such as
pg_clog and configuration files from the source cluster to
the target cluster (everything except the relation
files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Apply the WAL from the source
cluster, starting from the checkpoint created at failover.
(Strictly speaking, pg_rewind doesn&rsquo;t apply the WAL,
it just creates a backup label <br>
file that makes PostgreSQL start by replaying all WAL from
that checkpoint forward.)</p>
