pg_rewind - synchronize a PostgreSQL data directory with another data directory

pg_rewind is a tool for synchronizing a PostgreSQL cluster with another copy of
  the same cluster, after the clusters' timelines have diverged. A typical
  scenario is to bring an old master server back online after failover as a
  standby that follows the new master.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The result is equivalent to replacing the target data directory with the source
  one. Only changed blocks from relation files are copied; all other files are
  copied in full, including configuration files. The advantage of pg_rewind over
  taking a new base backup, or tools like rsync, is that pg_rewind does not
  require reading through unchanged blocks in the cluster. This makes it a lot
  faster when the database is large and only a small fraction of blocks differ
  between the clusters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
pg_rewind examines the timeline histories of the source and target clusters to
  determine the point where they diverged, and expects to find WAL in the target
  cluster's pg_xlog directory reaching all the way back to the point of
  divergence. The point of divergence can be found either on the target
  timeline, the source timeline, or their common ancestor. In the typical
  failover scenario where the target cluster was shut down soon after the
  divergence, this is not a problem, but if the target cluster ran for a long
  time after the divergence, the old WAL files might no longer be present. In
  that case, they can be manually copied from the WAL archive to the pg_xlog
  directory, or fetched on startup by configuring recovery.conf. The use of
  pg_rewind is not limited to failover, e.g. a standby server can be promoted,
  run some write transactions, and then rewinded to become a standby again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the target server is started for the first time after running pg_rewind, it
  will go into recovery mode and replay all WAL generated in the source server
  after the point of divergence. If some of the WAL was no longer available in
  the source server when pg_rewind was run, and therefore could not be copied by
  the pg_rewind session, it must be made available when the target server is
  started. This can be done by creating a recovery.conf file in the target data
  directory with a suitable <i>restore_command</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
pg_rewind requires that the target server either has the wal_log_hints option
  enabled in postgresql.conf or data checksums enabled when the cluster was
  initialized with initdb. Neither of these are currently on by default.
  full_page_writes must also be set to on, but is enabled by default.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
pg_rewind accepts the following command-line arguments:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-D </b><b></b><i>directory</i>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--target-pgdata=</b><b></b><i>directory</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option specifies the target data
  directory that is synchronized with the source. The target server must be shut
  down cleanly before running pg_rewind</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--source-pgdata=</b><b></b><i>directory</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies the file system path to the data
  directory of the source server to synchronize the target with. This option
  requires the source server to be cleanly shut down.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--source-server=</b><b></b><i>connstr</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Specifies a libpq connection string to connect
  to the source PostgreSQL server to synchronize the target with. The connection
  must be a normal (non-replication) connection with superuser access. This
  option requires the source server to be running and not in recovery
  mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-n</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--dry-run</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Do everything except actually modifying the
  target directory.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-P</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--progress</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enables progress reporting. Turning this on
  will deliver an approximate progress report while copying data from the source
  cluster.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--debug</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Print verbose debugging output that is mostly
  useful for developers debugging pg_rewind.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-V</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--version</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Display version information, then exit.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-?</b>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>--help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Show help, then exit.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
When <b>--source-server</b> option is used, pg_rewind also uses the environment
  variables supported by libpq (see Section 32.14, &#x201C;Environment
  Variables&#x201D;, in the documentation).

  it works</a></h2>
The basic idea is to copy all file system-level changes from the source cluster
  to the target cluster:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 1.Scan the WAL log of the target cluster,
  starting from the last checkpoint before the point where the source cluster's
  timeline history forked off from the target cluster. For each WAL record,
  record each data block that was touched. This yields a list of all the data
  blocks that were changed in the target cluster, after the source cluster
  forked off.</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 2.Copy all those changed blocks from the
  source cluster to the target cluster, either using direct file system access (
  <b>--source-pgdata</b>) or SQL (<b>--source-server</b>).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 3.Copy all other files such as pg_clog and
  configuration files from the source cluster to the target cluster (everything
  except the relation files).</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;"> 4.Apply the WAL from the source cluster,
  starting from the checkpoint created at failover. (Strictly speaking,
  pg_rewind doesn't apply the WAL, it just creates a backup label file that
  makes PostgreSQL start by replaying all WAL from that checkpoint
  forward.)</div>
