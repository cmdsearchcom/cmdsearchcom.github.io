<p>ANNOTATE-OUTPUT(1) General Commands Manual
ANNOTATE-OUTPUT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
annotate-output - annotate program output with time and
stream</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
annotate-output [options] program [args ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
annotate-output will execute the specified program, while
prepending every line with the current time and O for stdout
and E for stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
+FORMAT <br>
Controls the timestamp format, as per date(1). Defaults to
&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Display a help message and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
$ annotate-output make <br>
21:41:21 I: Started make <br>
21:41:21 O: gcc -Wall program.c <br>
21:43:18 E: program.c: Couldn&rsquo;t compile, and took me
ages to find out <br>
21:43:19 E: collect2: ld returned 1 exit status <br>
21:43:19 E: make: *** [all] Error 1 <br>
21:43:19 I: Finished with exitcode 2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Since stdout and stderr are processed in parallel, it can
happen that some lines received on stdout will show up
before later-printed stderr lines (and vice-versa).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is unfortunately very hard
to fix with the current annotation strategy. A fix would
involve switching to PTRACE&rsquo;ing the process. Giving
nice a (much) higher priority over <br>
the executed program could however cause this behaviour to
show up less frequently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program does not work as
well when the output is not linewise. In particular, when an
interactive program asks for input, the question might not
be shown until after you <br>
have answered it. This will give the impression that the
annotated program has hung, while it has not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUPPORT <br>
This program is community-supported (meaning: you&rsquo;ll
need to fix it yourself). Patches are however appreciated,
as is any feedback (positive or negative).</p>
