<p>OPENBSD-CWM(1) BSD General Commands Manual
OPENBSD-CWM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
openbsd-cwm &acirc; a lightweight and efficient window
manager for X11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
openbsd-cwm [-c file] [-d display]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
openbsd-cwm is a window manager for X11 which contains many
features that concentrate on the efficiency and transparency
of window management. openbsd-cwm also aims to maintain <br>
the simplest and most pleasant aesthetic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following notation is used
throughout this page:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C Control. <br>
M Meta. <br>
S Shift. <br>
M1 Left mouse button. <br>
M2 Middle mouse button. <br>
M3 Right mouse button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openbsd-cwm is very simple in
its use. Most of the actions are initiated via key bindings.
The default key bindings are described below; their
functionality is described in more <br>
detail later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CM-Return Spawn a new terminal.
<br>
CM-Delete Lock the screen. <br>
M-Return Hide current window. <br>
M-Down Lower current window. <br>
M-Up Raise current window. <br>
M-/ Search for windows. <br>
C-/ Search for applications. <br>
CM-n Label current window. <br>
M-Tab Cycle through currently visible windows. <br>
MS-Tab Reverse cycle through currently visible windows. <br>
CM-x Delete current window. <br>
CM-[n] Select group n, where n is 1-9. <br>
CM-0 Select all groups. <br>
CM-g Toggle group membership of current window. <br>
M-Right Cycle through active groups. <br>
M-Left Reverse cycle through active groups. <br>
CMS-f Toggle freezing geometry of current window. <br>
CM-s Toggle stickiness of current window. <br>
CM-f Toggle full-screen mode of current window. <br>
CM-m Toggle maximization of current window. <br>
CM-= Toggle vertical maximization of current window. <br>
CMS-= Toggle horizontal maximization of current window. <br>
M-? Spawn &acirc;exec program&acirc; dialog. <br>
M-. Spawn &acirc;ssh to&acirc; dialog. This parses
$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts to provide host auto-completion.
ssh(1) will be executed via the configured terminal
emulator. <br>
CM-w Spawn &acirc;exec WindowManager&acirc; dialog; allows
you to switch from openbsd-cwm to another window manager
without restarting the X server. <br>
CMS-r Restart the running cwm(1). <br>
CMS-q Quit openbsd-cwm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default mouse bindings
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M-M1 Move current window. <br>
CM-M1 Toggle group membership of current window. <br>
M-M2 Resize current window <br>
M-M3 Lower current window. <br>
CMS-M3 Hide current window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options for openbsd-cwm are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
Specify an alternative configuration file. By default,
openbsd-cwm loads ~/.cwmrc, if present. Any error messages
from lines in the configuration file will be sent to <br>
stderr; however, openbsd-cwm will continue to process the
rest of the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d display <br>
Specify the display to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POINTER MOVEMENT <br>
The pointer can be moved with the use of the keyboard
through bindings. C-[Up|Down|Left|Right] moves the pointer a
small amount, while CS-[Up|Down|Left|Right] moves the
pointer a <br>
larger amount. For example, to move the pointer to the left
by a small amount, press C-Left. To move the pointer down by
a larger amount, press CS-Down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOW MOVEMENT AND RESIZING
<br>
openbsd-cwm windows can be moved with the use of the
keyboard through vi-like bindings. M-[hjkl] moves the
current window a small amount, while MS-[hjkl] moves the
current window <br>
a larger amount. For example, to move the current window to
the left a small amount, press M-h. To move the current
window down by a larger amount, press MS-j.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Similarly, windows may be
resized with the same key bindings with the addition of the
Control key. CM-[hjkl] resizes the window a small amount and
CMS-[hjkl] resizes by a larger <br>
increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH <br>
openbsd-cwm features the ability to search for windows by
their current title, old titles, and by their label. The
priority for the search results are: label, current title,
old <br>
titles in reverse order, and finally window class name.
openbsd-cwm keeps a history of the 5 previous titles of a
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When searching, the leftmost
character of the result list may show a flag:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">! The window is the currently
focused window. <br>
&amp; The window is hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following key bindings may
be used to navigate the result list:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Down], C-s or M-j Select the
next window in the list. <br>
[Up], C-r or M-k Select the previous window in the list.
<br>
[Backspace] or C-h Backspace. <br>
C-u Clear the input. <br>
[Return] Focus the selected window. <br>
[Esc] Cancel. <br>
C-a Whenever there are no matching windows, list every
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GROUPS <br>
openbsd-cwm has the ability to group windows together, and
use the groups to perform operations on the entire group
instead of just one window. Currently, the only operation
that <br>
is supported is to hide and unhide the grouped windows.
Together with the sticky option, this can be used to emulate
virtual desktops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To edit groups, use the group
selection commands to toggle membership of a group. A blue
border will be shown briefly on windows added to the current
group, and a red border will <br>
be shown on those just removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENUS <br>
Menus are recalled by clicking the mouse on the root
window:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M1 Show list of currently hidden
windows. Clicking on an item will unhide that window. <br>
M2 Show list of currently defined groups. Clicking on an
item will hide/unhide that group. <br>
M3 Show list of applications as defined in ~/.cwmrc.
Clicking on an item will spawn that application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY openbsd-cwm starts on this display unless the -d
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.cwmrc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
cwmrc(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
openbsd-cwm was originally inspired by evilwm, but was
rewritten from scratch due to limitations in the evilwm
codebase. The from-scratch rewrite borrowed some code from
9wm, how&acirc; <br>
ever that code has since been removed or rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">openbsd-cwm first appeared in
OpenBSD 4.2.</p>
