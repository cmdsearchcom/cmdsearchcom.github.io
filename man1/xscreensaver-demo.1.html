<p>xscreensaver-demo(1) XScreenSaver manual
xscreensaver-demo(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xscreensaver-demo - interactively control the background
xscreensaver daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xscreensaver-demo [-display host:display.screen] [-prefs]
[--debug]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The xscreensaver-demo program is a graphical front-end for
setting the parameters used by the background
xscreensaver(1) daemon. It is essentially two things: a tool
for editing <br>
the ~/.xscreensaver file; and a tool for demoing the various
graphics hacks that the xscreensaver daemon will launch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main window consists of a
menu bar and two tabbed pages. The first page is for editing
the list of demos, and the second is for editing various
other parameters of the <br>
screensaver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MENU COMMANDS <br>
All of these commands are on either the File or Help
menus:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank Screen Now <br>
Activates the background xscreensaver daemon, which will
then run a demo at random. This is the same as running
xscreensaver-command(1) with the -activate option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lock Screen Now <br>
Just like Blank Screen Now, except the screen will be locked
as well (even if it is not configured to lock all the time.)
This is the same as running xscreensaver-command(1) <br>
with the -lock option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kill Daemon <br>
If the xscreensaver daemon is running on this screen, kill
it. This is the same as running xscreensaver-command(1) with
the -exit option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Restart Daemon <br>
If the xscreensaver daemon is running on this screen, kill
it. Then launch it again. This is the same as doing
&lsquo;&lsquo;xscreensaver-command -exit&rsquo;&rsquo;
followed by &lsquo;&lsquo;xscreensaver&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that it is not the same as
doing &lsquo;&lsquo;xscreensaver-command
-restart&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exit <br>
Exits the xscreensaver-demo program (this program) without
affecting the background xscreensaver daemon, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">About... <br>
Displays the version number of this program,
xscreensaver-demo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation... <br>
Opens up a web browser looking at the XScreenSaver web page,
where you can find online copies of the xscreensaver(1),
xscreensaver-demo(1), and xscreensaver-command(1)
manu&acirc; <br>
als.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISPLAY MODES TAB <br>
This page contains a list of the names of the various
display modes, a preview area, and some fields that let you
configure screen saver behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mode <br>
This option menu controls the activation behavior of the
screen saver. The options are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Disable Screen Saver <br>
Don&rsquo;t ever blank the screen, and don&rsquo;t ever
allow the monitor to power down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank Screen Only <br>
When blanking the screen, just go black: don&rsquo;t run any
graphics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only One Screen Saver <br>
When blanking the screen, only ever use one particular
display mode (the one selected in the list.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random Screen Saver <br>
When blanking the screen, select a random display mode from
among those that are enabled and applicable. If there are
multiple monitors connected, run a different dis&acirc; <br>
play mode on each one. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Random Same Saver <br>
This is just like Random Screen Saver, except that the same
randomly-chosen display mode will be run on all monitors,
instead of different ones on each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Demo List <br>
Double-clicking in the list on the left will let you try out
the indicated demo. The screen will go black, and the
program will run in full-screen mode, just as it would if
<br>
the xscreensaver daemon had launched it. Clicking the mouse
again will stop the demo and un-blank the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Single-clicking in the list will
run it in the small preview pane on the right. (But beware:
many of the display modes behave somewhat differently when
running in full- <br>
screen mode, so the scaled-down view might not give an
accurate impression.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Mode is set to Random
Screen Saver, each name in the list has a checkbox next to
it: this controls whether this display mode is enabled. If
it is unchecked, then that <br>
mode will not be chosen. (Though you can still run it
explicitly by double-clicking on its name.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Arrow Buttons <br>
Beneath the list are a pair of up and down arrows. Clicking
on the down arrow will select the next item in the list, and
then run it in full-screen mode, just as if you had <br>
double-clicked on it. The up arrow goes the other way. This
is just a shortcut for trying out all of the display modes
in turn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blank After <br>
After the user has been idle this long, the xscreensaver
daemon will blank the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cycle After <br>
After the screensaver has been running for this long, the
currently running graphics demo will be killed, and a new
one started. If this is 0, then the graphics demo will <br>
never be changed: only one demo will run until the
screensaver is deactivated by user activity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The running saver will be
restarted every this-many minutes even in Only One Screen
Saver mode, since some savers tend to converge on a steady
state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lock Screen <br>
When this is checked, the screen will be locked when it
activates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lock Screen After <br>
This controls the length of the &lsquo;&lsquo;grace
period&rsquo;&rsquo; between when the screensaver activates,
and when the screen becomes locked. For example, if this is
5 minutes, and Blank <br>
After is 10 minutes, then after 10 minutes, the screen would
blank. If there was user activity at 12 minutes, no password
would be required to un-blank the screen. But, if <br>
there was user activity at 15 minutes or later (that is,
Lock Screen After minutes after activation) then a password
would be required. The default is 0, meaning that if <br>
locking is enabled, then a password will be required as soon
as the screen blanks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preview <br>
This button, below the small preview window, runs the demo
in full-screen mode so that you can try it out. This is the
same thing that happens when you double-click an ele&acirc;
<br>
ment in the list. Click the mouse to dismiss the full-screen
preview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Settings <br>
This button will pop up a dialog where you can configure
settings specific to the display mode selected in the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTINGS DIALOG <br>
When you click on the Settings button on the Display Modes
tab, a configuration dialog will pop up that lets you
customize settings of the selected display mode. Each
display <br>
mode has its own custom configuration controls on the left
side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the right side is a paragraph
or two describing the display mode. Below that is a
Documentation button that will display the display
mode&rsquo;s manual page, if it has one, in a <br>
new window (since each of the display modes is actually a
separate program, they each have their own manual.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Advanced button reconfigures
the dialog box so that you can edit the display mode&rsquo;s
command line directly, instead of using the graphical
controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADVANCED TAB <br>
This tab lets you change various settings used by the
xscreensaver daemon itself, as well as some global options
shared by all of the display modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image Manipulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the graphics hacks
manipulate images. These settings control where those source
images come from. (All of these options work by invoking the
xscreensaver-getimage(1) <br>
program, which is what actually does the work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grab Desktop Images <br>
If this option is selected, then they are allowed to
manipulate the desktop image, that is, a display mode might
draw a picture of your desktop melting, or being dis&acirc;
<br>
torted in some way. The security-paranoid might want to
disable this option, because if it is set, it means that the
windows on your desktop will occasionally be visible <br>
while your screen is locked. Others will not be able to do
anything, but they may be able to see whatever you left on
your screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grab Video Frames <br>
If your system has a video capture card, selecting this
option will allow the image-manipulating modes to capture a
frame of video to operate on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Choose Random Image <br>
If this option is set, then the image-manipulating modes
will select a random image file to operate on, from the
specified source. That source may be a local directory, <br>
which will be recursively searched for images. Or, it may be
the URL of an RSS or Atom feed (e.g., a Flickr gallery), in
which case a random image from that feed will be <br>
selected instead. The contents of the feed will be cached
locally and refreshed periodically as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If more than one of the above
image-related options are selected, then one will be chosen
at random. If none of them are selected, then an image of
video colorbars will be <br>
used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text Manipulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some of the display modes
display and manipulate text. The following options control
how that text is generated. (These parameters control the
behavior of the xscreen&acirc; <br>
saver-text(1) program, which is what actually does the
work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Host Name and Time <br>
If this checkbox is selected, then the text used by the
screen savers will be the local host name, OS version, date,
time, and system load.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text <br>
If this checkbox is selected, then the literal text typed in
the field to its right will be used. If it contains % escape
sequences, they will be expanded as per strf&acirc; <br>
time(2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text File <br>
If this checkbox is selected, then the contents of the
corresponding file will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Program <br>
If this checkbox is selected, then the given program will be
run, repeatedly, and its output will be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL If this checkbox is
selected, then the given HTTP URL will be downloaded and
displayed repeatedly. If the document contains HTML, RSS, or
Atom, it will be converted to <br>
plain-text first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: this re-downloads the
document every time the screen saver runs out of text, so it
will probably be hitting that web server multiple times a
minute. Be careful <br>
that the owner of that server doesn&rsquo;t consider that to
be abusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Power Management Settings</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These settings control whether,
and when, your monitor powers down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Power Management Enabled <br>
Whether the monitor should be powered down after a period of
inactivity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is grayed out, it
means your X server does not support the XDPMS extension,
and so control over the monitor&rsquo;s power state is not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re using a laptop,
don&rsquo;t be surprised if this has no effect: many laptops
have monitor power-saving behavior built in at a very low
level that is invisible to Unix <br>
and X. On such systems, you can typically only adjust the
power-saving delays by changing settings in the BIOS in some
hardware-specific way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Standby After <br>
If Power Management Enabled is selected, the monitor will go
black after this much idle time. (Graphics demos will stop
running, also.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Suspend After <br>
If Power Management Enabled is selected, the monitor will go
into power-saving mode after this much idle time. This
duration should be greater than or equal to Standby.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Off After <br>
If Power Management Enabled is selected, the monitor will
fully power down after this much idle time. This duration
should be greater than or equal to Suspend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Quick Power-off in Blank Only
Mode <br>
If the display mode is set to Blank Screen Only and this is
checked, then the monitor will be powered off immediately
upon blanking, regardless of the other power-manage&acirc;
<br>
ment settings. In this way, the power management idle-timers
can be completely disabled, but the screen will be powered
off when black. (This might be preferable on <br>
laptops.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fading and Colormaps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These options control how the
screen fades to or from black when a screen saver begins or
ends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade To Black When Blanking <br>
If selected, then when the screensaver activates, the
current contents of the screen will fade to black instead of
simply winking out. (Note: this doesn&rsquo;t work with all
<br>
X servers.) A fade will also be done when switching graphics
hacks (when the Cycle After expires.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unfade From Black When
Unblanking <br>
The complement to Fade Colormap: if selected, then when the
screensaver deactivates, the original contents of the screen
will fade in from black instead of appearing <br>
immediately. This is only done if Fade Colormap is also
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fade Duration <br>
When fading or unfading are selected, this controls how long
the fade will take.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Install Colormap <br>
On 8-bit screens, whether to install a private colormap
while the screensaver is active, so that the graphics hacks
can get as many colors as possible. This does nothing <br>
if you are running in 16-bit or better.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are more settings than
these available, but these are the most commonly used ones;
see the manual for xscreensaver(1) for other parameters that
can be set by editing the <br>
~/.xscreensaver file, or the X resource database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS <br>
xscreensaver-demo accepts the following command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display host:display.screen
<br>
The X display to use. The xscreensaver-demo program will
open its window on that display, and also control the
xscreensaver daemon that is managing that same display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-prefs Start up with the
Advanced tab selected by default instead of the Display
Modes tab.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug Causes lots of
diagnostics to be printed on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that the
xscreensaver and xscreensaver-demo processes be running on
the same machine, or at least, on two machines that share a
file system. When xscreen&acirc; <br>
saver-demo writes a new version of the ~/.xscreensaver file,
it&rsquo;s important that the xscreensaver see that same
file. If the two processes are seeing different
~/.xscreensaver <br>
files, things will malfunction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH to find the sub-programs to
run. However, note that the sub-programs are actually
launched by the xscreensaver daemon, not by
xscreensaver-demo itself. So, what matters <br>
is what $PATH that the xscreensaver program sees.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOME for the directory in which
to read and write the .xscreensaver file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XENVIRONMENT <br>
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global
resources stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy <br>
to get the default HTTP proxy host and port.</p>
