<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
hfsutils is a collection of tools and programs for accessing
Macintosh HFS-formatted volumes. See the accompanying man
page for each program above for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
These utilities can manipulate HFS volumes on nearly any
medium. A UNIX path is initially specified to hmount or
hformat which gives the location of the volume. This path
can be <br>
a block device -- corresponding to, for example, a floppy
disk, CD-ROM, SCSI disk, or other device -- or it can be a
regular file containing an image of any of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The medium specified by the UNIX
path may or may not contain an Apple partition map. If
partitioned, it is possible for more than one HFS volume to
be present on the medium. In <br>
this case, a partition number must also be given which
selects the desired partition. This number refers to the nth
ordinal HFS partition on the volume. (Other, non-HFS
parti&acirc; <br>
tions are ignored.) Partition number 0 refers to the entire
medium, disregarding the partition map, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HFS pathnames consist of
colon-separated components. Unlike UNIX pathnames, an HFS
path which begins with a colon (e.g. :Foo:Bar) is a relative
path, and one which does not (e.g. <br>
Foo:Bar) is an absolute path. As sole exception to this
rule, a path not containing any colons is assumed to be
relative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Absolute pathnames always begin
with the name of the volume itself. Any occurrence of two or
more consecutive colons in a path causes resolution of the
path to ascend into parent <br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most of the command-line
programs support HFS filename globbing. The following forms
of globbing are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* matches zero or more
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? matches exactly one
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[...] matches any single
character enclosed within the brackets. A character range
may be specified by using a hypen (-). Note that matches are
not case sensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{...,...} <br>
expands into the Cartesian product of each specified
substring. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">causes the following character
to be matched literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since globbing is
performed by each HFS command rather than by the UNIX shell
(which knows nothing about HFS volumes), care should always
be taken to protect pathnames <br>
from the shell by using an appropriate quoting technique.
Typically it is best to surround HFS pathnames containing
glob characters with single quotes (&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time stamps on HFS volumes are
interpreted as being relative to the current time zone. This
means that modification dates on HFS volumes written in
another time zone may appear <br>
to be off by some number of hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hardware limitations prevent
some systems from reading or writing native Macintosh 800K
floppy disks; only high-density 1440K disks can be used on
these systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The obsolete MFS volume format
is not supported by this software.</p>
