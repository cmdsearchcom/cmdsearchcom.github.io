<p>AGGREGATE(1) General Commands Manual AGGREGATE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
aggregate - optimise a list of route prefixes to help make
nice short filters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
aggregate [-m max-length] [-o max-opt-length] [-p
default-length] [-q] [-t] [-v]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Takes a list of prefixes in conventional format on stdin,
and performs two optimisations to attempt to reduce the
length of the prefix list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first optimisation is to
remove any supplied prefixes which are superfluous because
they are already included in another supplied prefix. For
example, 203.97.2.0/24 would be <br>
removed if 203.97.0.0/17 was also supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second optimisation
identifies adjacent prefixes that can be combined under a
single, shorter-length prefix. For example, 203.97.2.0/24
and 203.97.3.0/24 can be combined into <br>
the single prefix 203.97.2.0/23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-m max-length <br>
Sets the maximum prefix length for entries read from stdin
max_length bits. The default is 32. Prefixes with longer
lengths will be discarded prior to processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o max-opt-length <br>
Sets the maximum prefix length for optimisation to
max-opt-length bits. The default is 32. Prefixes with longer
lengths will not be subject to optimisation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p default-length <br>
Sets the default prefix length. There is no default; without
this option a prefix without a mask length is treated as
invalid. Use -p 32 -m 32 -o 32 to aggregate a list <br>
of host routes specified as bare addresses, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Sets quiet mode -- instructs
aggregate never to generate warning messages or other output
on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Silently truncate prefixes
that seem to have an inconsistent prefix: e.g. an input
prefix 203.97.2.226/24 would be truncated to 203.97.2.0/24.
Without this option an input <br>
prefix 203.97.2.226/24 would not be accepted, and a warning
about the inconsistent mask would be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Sets verbose mode. This
changes the output format to display the source line number
that the prefix was obtained from, together with a preceding
&quot;-&quot; to indicate a route <br>
that can be suppressed, or a &quot;+&quot; to indicate a
shorter-prefix aggregate that was added by aggregate as an
adjacency optimisation. Note that verbose output continues
even <br>
if -q is selected. DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Aggregate exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following list of prefixes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">193.58.204.0/22 <br>
193.58.208.0/22 <br>
193.193.160.0/22 <br>
193.193.168.0/22 <br>
193.243.164.0/22 <br>
194.126.128.0/22 <br>
194.126.132.0/22 <br>
194.126.134.0/23 <br>
194.151.128.0/19 <br>
195.42.240.0/21 <br>
195.240.0.0/16 <br>
195.241.0.0/16</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is optimised as followed by
aggregate (output shown using the -v flag):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">aggregate: maximum prefix length
permitted will be 24 <br>
[ 0] + 193.58.204.0/21 <br>
[ 1] - 193.58.204.0/22 <br>
[ 2] - 193.58.208.0/22 <br>
[ 3] 193.193.160.0/22 <br>
[ 4] 193.193.168.0/22 <br>
[ 5] 193.243.164.0/22 <br>
[ 0] + 194.126.128.0/21 <br>
[ 6] - 194.126.128.0/22 <br>
[ 7] - 194.126.132.0/22 <br>
[ 8] - 194.126.134.0/23 <br>
[ 9] 194.151.128.0/19 <br>
[ 10] 195.42.240.0/21 <br>
[ 0] + 195.240.0.0/15 <br>
[ 11] - 195.240.0.0/16 <br>
[ 12] - 195.241.0.0/16</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that 193.58.204.0/22 and
193.58.208.0/22 were combined under the single prefix
193.58.204.0/21, and 194.126.134.0/23 was suppressed because
it was included in <br>
194.126.132.0/22. The number in square brackets at the
beginning of each line indicates the original line number,
or zero for new prefixes that were introduced by
aggregate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output without the -v flag
is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">193.58.204.0/21 <br>
193.193.160.0/22 <br>
193.193.168.0/22 <br>
193.243.164.0/22 <br>
194.126.128.0/21 <br>
194.151.128.0/19 <br>
195.42.240.0/21 <br>
195.240.0.0/15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Aggregate was written by Joe Abley &lt;jabley@mfnx.net&gt;,
and has been reasonably well tested. It is suitable for
reducing customer prefix filters for production use without
exten&acirc; <br>
sive hand-proving of results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Autoconf bits were donated by
Michael Shields &lt;michael.shields@mfn.com&gt;. The -t
option was suggested by Robin Johnson
&lt;robbat2@fermi.orbis-terrarum.net&gt;, and the treatment
of <br>
leading zeros on octet parsing was changed following
comments from Arnold Nipper &lt;arnold@nipper.de&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early version of aggregate
would attempt to combine adjacent prefixes regardless of
whether the first prefix lay on an appropriate bit boundary
or not (pointed out with great <br>
restraint by Robert Noland &lt;rnoland@2hip.net&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Common unix parsing of IPv4 addresses understands the
representation of individual octets in octal or hexadecimal,
following a &quot;0&quot; or &quot;0x&quot; prefix,
respectively. That convention <br>
has been deliberately disabled here, since resources such as
the IRR do not follow the convention, and confusion can
result.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For extremely sensitive
applications, judicious use of the -v option together with a
pencil and paper is probably advisable.</p>
