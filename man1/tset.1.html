<p>tset(1) General Commands Manual tset(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tset, reset - terminal initialization</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tset [-IQVcqrsw] [-] [-e ch] [-i ch] [-k ch] [-m mapping]
[terminal] <br>
reset [-IQVcqrsw] [-] [-e ch] [-i ch] [-k ch] [-m mapping]
[terminal]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Tset initializes terminals. Tset first determines the type
of terminal that you are using. This determination is done
as follows, using the first terminal type found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. The terminal argument
specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The value of the TERM
environmental variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. (BSD systems only.) The
terminal type associated with the standard error output
device in the /etc/ttys file. (On System-V-like UNIXes and
systems using that convention, <br>
getty does this job by setting TERM according to the type
passed to it by /etc/inittab.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The default terminal type,
&lsquo;&lsquo;unknown&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the terminal type was not
specified on the command-line, the -m option mappings are
then applied (see the section TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING for more
information). Then, if the <br>
terminal type begins with a question mark
(&lsquo;&lsquo;?&rsquo;&rsquo;), the user is prompted for
confirmation of the terminal type. An empty response
confirms the type, or, another type can be <br>
entered to specify a new type. Once the terminal type has
been determined, the terminfo entry for the terminal is
retrieved. If no terminfo entry is found for the type, the
<br>
user is prompted for another terminal type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the terminfo entry is
retrieved, the window size, backspace, interrupt and line
kill characters (among many other things) are set and the
terminal and tab initialization <br>
strings are sent to the standard error output. Finally, if
the erase, interrupt and line kill characters have changed,
or are not set to their default values, their values are
<br>
displayed to the standard error output. Use the -c or -w
option to select only the window sizing versus the other
initialization. If neither option is given, both are
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When invoked as reset, tset sets
cooked and echo modes, turns off cbreak and raw modes, turns
on newline translation and resets any unset special
characters to their default val&acirc; <br>
ues before doing the terminal initialization described
above. This is useful after a program dies leaving a
terminal in an abnormal state. Note, you may have to
type</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;LF&gt;reset&lt;LF&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(the line-feed character is
normally control-J) to get the terminal to work, as
carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal state.
Also, the terminal will often not echo <br>
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Set control characters and
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Set the erase character to
ch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Do not send the terminal or
tab initialization strings to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Set the interrupt character
to ch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Set the line kill character
to ch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Specify a mapping from a port
type to a terminal. See the section TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q Do not display any values for
the erase, interrupt and line kill characters. Normally tset
displays the values for control characters which differ from
the system&rsquo;s default <br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q The terminal type is
displayed to the standard output, and the terminal is not
initialized in any way. The option &lsquo;-&rsquo; by itself
is equivalent but archaic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Print the terminal type to
the standard error output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Print the sequence of shell
commands to initialize the environment variable TERM to the
standard output. See the section SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V reports the version of
ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Resize the window to match
the size deduced via setupterm. Normally this has no effect,
unless setupterm is not able to detect the window size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments for the -e, -i,
and -k options may either be entered as actual characters or
by using the &lsquo;hat&rsquo; notation, i.e., control-h may
be specified as &lsquo;&lsquo;^H&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;^h&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT <br>
It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and
information about the terminal&rsquo;s capabilities into the
shell&rsquo;s environment. This is done using the -s
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the -s option is specified,
the commands to enter the information into the shell&rsquo;s
environment are written to the standard output. If the SHELL
environmental variable ends <br>
in &lsquo;&lsquo;csh&rsquo;&rsquo;, the commands are for
csh, otherwise, they are for sh. Note, the csh commands set
and unset the shell variable noglob, leaving it unset. The
following line in the <br>
.login or .profile files will initialize the environment
correctly:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval &lsquo;tset -s options ...
&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING <br>
When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the
current system information is incorrect) the terminal type
derived from the /etc/ttys file or the TERM environmental
<br>
variable is often something generic like network, dialup, or
unknown. When tset is used in a startup script it is often
desirable to provide information about the type of
termi&acirc; <br>
nal used on such ports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The purpose of the -m option is
to map from some set of conditions to a terminal type, that
is, to tell tset &lsquo;&lsquo;If I&rsquo;m on this port at
a particular speed, guess that I&rsquo;m on that <br>
kind of terminal&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The argument to the -m option
consists of an optional port type, an optional operator, an
optional baud rate specification, an optional colon
(&lsquo;&lsquo;:&rsquo;&rsquo;) character and a terminal
<br>
type. The port type is a string (delimited by either the
operator or the colon character). The operator may be any
combination of &lsquo;&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;@&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;!&rsquo;&rsquo;;
&lsquo;&lsquo;&gt;&rsquo;&rsquo; means <br>
greater than, &lsquo;&lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;&rsquo; means less
than, &lsquo;&lsquo;@&rsquo;&rsquo; means equal to and
&lsquo;&lsquo;!&rsquo;&rsquo; inverts the sense of the test.
The baud rate is specified as a number and is compared with
the speed of the <br>
standard error output (which should be the control
terminal). The terminal type is a string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the terminal type is not
specified on the command line, the -m mappings are applied
to the terminal type. If the port type and baud rate match
the mapping, the terminal type <br>
specified in the mapping replaces the current type. If more
than one mapping is specified, the first applicable mapping
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, consider the
following mapping: dialup&gt;9600:vt100. The port type is
dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate specification
is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100. <br>
The result of this mapping is to specify that if the
terminal type is dialup, and the baud rate is greater than
9600 baud, a terminal type of vt100 will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no baud rate is specified,
the terminal type will match any baud rate. If no port type
is specified, the terminal type will match any port type.
For example, -m dialup:vt100 <br>
-m :?xterm will cause any dialup port, regardless of baud
rate, to match the terminal type vt100, and any non-dialup
port type to match the terminal type ?xterm. Note, because
<br>
of the leading question mark, the user will be queried on a
default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">No whitespace characters are
permitted in the -m option argument. Also, to avoid problems
with meta-characters, it is suggested that the entire -m
option argument be placed <br>
within single quote characters, and that csh users insert a
backslash character (&lsquo;&lsquo;&acute;&rsquo;) before
any exclamation marks (&lsquo;&lsquo;!&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
The tset command appeared in BSD 3.0. The ncurses
implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources
for a terminfo environment by Eric S. Raymond
&lt;esr@snark.thyr&acirc; <br>
sus.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY <br>
The tset utility has been provided for
backward-compatibility with BSD environments (under most
modern UNIXes, /etc/inittab and getty(1) can set TERM
appropriately for each dial- <br>
up line; this obviates what was tset&rsquo;s most important
use). This implementation behaves like 4.4BSD tset, with a
few exceptions specified here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S option of BSD tset no
longer works; it prints an error message to stderr and dies.
The -s option only sets TERM, not TERMCAP. Both these
changes are because the TERMCAP <br>
variable is no longer supported under terminfo-based
ncurses, which makes tset -S useless (we made it die noisily
rather than silently induce lossage).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There was an undocumented 4.4BSD
feature that invoking tset via a link named
&lsquo;TSET&lsquo; (or via any other name beginning with an
upper-case letter) set the terminal to use upper-case <br>
only. This feature has been omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -A, -E, -h, -u and -v
options were deleted from the tset utility in 4.4BSD. None
of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of limited
utility at best. The -a, -d, and <br>
-p options are similarly not documented or useful, but were
retained as they appear to be in widespread use. It is
strongly recommended that any usage of these three options
be <br>
changed to use the -m option instead. The -n option remains,
but has no effect. The -adnp options are therefore omitted
from the usage summary above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is still permissible to
specify the -e, -i, and -k options without arguments,
although it is strongly recommended that such usage be fixed
to explicitly specify the character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of 4.4BSD, executing tset as
reset no longer implies the -Q option. Also, the interaction
between the - option and the terminal argument in some
historic implementations of <br>
tset has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The tset command uses these environment variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHELL <br>
tells tset whether to initialize TERM using sh or csh
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERM Denotes your terminal type.
Each terminal type is distinct, though many are similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TERMCAP <br>
may denote the location of a termcap database. If it is not
an absolute pathname, e.g., begins with a &lsquo;/&rsquo;,
tset removes the variable from the environment before
looking for <br>
the terminal description.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/ttys <br>
system port name to terminal type mapping database (BSD
versions only).</p>
