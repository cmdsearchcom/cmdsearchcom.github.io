<p>DETOX(1) BSD General Commands Manual DETOX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
detox &acirc; clean up filenames</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
detox [-hnLrv] [-s -sequence] [-f -configfile] [--dry-run]
[--special] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The detox utility renames files to make them easier to work
with. It removes spaces and other such annoyances.
It&rsquo;ll also translate or cleanup Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1)
characters <br>
encoded in 8-bit ASCII, Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8,
and CGI escaped characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sequences <br>
detox is driven by a configurable series of filters, called
a sequence. Sequences are covered in more detail in
detoxrc(5) and are discoverable with the -L option. Some
examples <br>
of default sequences are iso8859_1 and utf_8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The main options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f configfile <br>
Use configfile instead of the default configuration files
for loading translation sequences. No other config file will
be parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h --help Display helpful
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List the currently available
sequences. When paired with -v this option shows what
filters are used in each sequence and any properties applied
to the filters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n --dry-run <br>
Doesn&rsquo;t actually change anything. This implies the -v
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Recurse into
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s sequence <br>
Use sequence instead of default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--special Works on special files
(including links). Normally detox ignores these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Be verbose about which files
are being renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Show the current version of
detox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated Options <br>
Deprecated Options are options that were available in
earlier versions of detox but have lost their meaning and
are being phased out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-trailing <br>
Removes _ and - after .&rsquo;s in filenames. This was first
provided in the 0.9 series of detox. After the introduction
of sequences, it lost its meaning, as you could now <br>
determine the properties of wipeup through a particular
sequence&rsquo;s configuration. It presently forces all
instances of the wipeup filter to use remove trailing, <br>
regardless of what&rsquo;s actually in the config files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
detoxrc The system-wide detoxrc file. <br>
~/.detoxrc A user&rsquo;s personal detoxrc. Normally it
extends the system-wide detoxrc, unless -f has been
specified, in which case, it is ignored. <br>
iso8859_1.tbl The default ISO 8859-1 translation table. <br>
unicode.tbl The default Unicode (UTF-8) translation
table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
detox -s iso8859_1 -r -v -n /tmp/new_files <br>
Will run the sequence iso8859_1 recursively, listing any
changes, without changing anything, on the files of
/tmp/new_files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">detox -c my_detoxrc -L -v <br>
Will list the sequences within my_detoxrc, showing their
filters and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
detoxrc(5), detox.tbl(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
detox was originally designed to clean up files that I had
received from friends which had been created using other
operating systems. It&rsquo;s trivial to create a filename
with spa&acirc; <br>
ces, parenthesis, brackets, and ampersands under some
operating systems. These have special meaning within FreeBSD
and Linux, and cause problems when you go to access them. I
<br>
created detox to clean up these files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
detox was written by Doug Harple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
If, after the translation of a filename is finished, a file
already exists with that same name, detox will not rename
the file. This could cause a problem with the max_length
fil&acirc; <br>
ter, if it was imperative that the files be cut down to a
certain length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Long options don&rsquo;t work
under Solaris or Darwin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An error in the config file will
cause a segfault as it&rsquo;s going to print the offending
word within the config file.</p>
