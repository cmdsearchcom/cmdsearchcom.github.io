<p>CO(1) General Commands Manual CO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
co - check out RCS revisions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
co [options] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
co retrieves a revision from each RCS file and stores it
into the corresponding working file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Filenames matching an RCS suffix
denote RCS files; all others denote working files. Names are
paired as explained in ci(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revisions of an RCS file can be
checked out locked or unlocked. Locking a revision prevents
overlapping updates. A revision checked out for reading or
processing (e.g., compil&acirc; <br>
ing) need not be locked. A revision checked out for editing
and later checkin must normally be locked. Checkout with
locking fails if the revision to be checked out is
cur&acirc; <br>
rently locked by another user. (A lock can be broken with
rcs(1).) Checkout with locking also requires the caller to
be on the access list of the RCS file, unless he is the <br>
owner of the file or the superuser, or the access list is
empty. Checkout without locking is not subject to accesslist
restrictions, and is not affected by the presence of <br>
locks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A revision is selected by
options for revision or branch number, checkin date/time,
author, or state. When the selection options are applied in
combination, co retrieves the <br>
latest revision that satisfies all of them. If none of the
selection options is specified, co retrieves the latest
revision on the default branch (normally the trunk, see the
-b <br>
option of rcs(1)). A revision or branch number can be
attached to any of the options -f, -I, -l, -M, -p, -q, -r,
or -u. The options -d (date), -s (state), and -w (author)
<br>
retrieve from a single branch, the selected branch, which is
either specified by one of -f, ..., -u, or the default
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A co command applied to an RCS
file with no revisions creates a zero-length working file.
co always performs keyword substitution (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-r[rev] <br>
retrieves the latest revision whose number is less than or
equal to rev. If rev indicates a branch rather than a
revision, the latest revision on that branch is <br>
retrieved. If rev is omitted, the latest revision on the
default branch (see the -b option of rcs(1)) is retrieved.
If rev is $, co determines the revision number from <br>
keyword values in the working file. Otherwise, a revision is
composed of one or more numeric or symbolic fields separated
by periods. If rev begins with a period, then <br>
the default branch (normally the trunk) is prepended to it.
If rev is a branch number followed by a period, then the
latest revision on that branch is used. The numeric <br>
equivalent of a symbolic field is specified with the -n
option of the commands ci(1) and rcs(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l[rev] <br>
same as -r, except that it also locks the retrieved revision
for the caller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u[rev] <br>
same as -r, except that it unlocks the retrieved revision if
it was locked by the caller. If rev is omitted, -u retrieves
the revision locked by the caller, if there is <br>
one; otherwise, it retrieves the latest revision on the
default branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f[rev] <br>
forces the overwriting of the working file; useful in
connection with -q. See also FILE MODES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kkv Generate keyword strings
using the default form, e.g. $Revision: 5.9.0 $ for the
Revision keyword. A locker&rsquo;s name is inserted in the
value of the Header, Id, and Locker <br>
keyword strings only as a file is being locked, i.e. by ci
-l and co -l. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kkvl Like -kkv, except that a
locker&rsquo;s name is always inserted if the given revision
is currently locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kk Generate only keyword names
in keyword strings; omit their values. See KEYWORD
SUBSTITUTION below. For example, for the Revision keyword,
generate the string $Revision$ <br>
instead of $Revision: 5.9.0 $. This option is useful to
ignore differences due to keyword substitution when
comparing different revisions of a file. Log messages are
<br>
inserted after $Log$ keywords even if -kk is specified,
since this tends to be more useful when merging changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ko Generate the old keyword
string, present in the working file just before it was
checked in. For example, for the Revision keyword, generate
the string $Revision: 1.1 $ <br>
instead of $Revision: 5.9.0 $ if that is how the string
appeared when the file was checked in. This can be useful
for file formats that cannot tolerate any changes to <br>
substrings that happen to take the form of keyword
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kb Generate a binary image of
the old keyword string. This acts like -ko, except it
performs all working file input and output in binary mode.
This makes little difference <br>
on Posix and Unix hosts, but on DOS-like hosts one should
use rcs -i -kb to initialize an RCS file intended to be used
for binary files. Also, on all hosts, rcsmerge(1) <br>
normally refuses to merge files when -kb is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kv Generate only keyword values
for keyword strings. For example, for the Revision keyword,
generate the string 5.9.0 instead of $Revision: 5.9.0 $.
This can help generate <br>
files in programming languages where it is hard to strip
keyword delimiters like $Revision: $ from a string. However,
further keyword substitution cannot be performed <br>
once the keyword names are removed, so this option should be
used with care. Because of this danger of losing keywords,
this option cannot be combined with -l, and the <br>
owner write permission of the working file is turned off; to
edit the file later, check it out again without -kv.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p[rev] <br>
prints the retrieved revision on the standard output rather
than storing it in the working file. This option is useful
when co is part of a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q[rev] <br>
quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I[rev] <br>
interactive mode; the user is prompted and questioned even
if the standard input is not a terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ddate retrieves the latest
revision on the selected branch whose checkin date/time is
less than or equal to date. The date and time can be given
in free format. The time zone <br>
LT stands for local time; other common time zone names are
understood. For example, the following dates are equivalent
if local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific <br>
Standard Time, eight hours west of Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8:00 pm lt <br>
4:00 AM, Jan. 12, 1990 default is UTC <br>
1990-01-12 04:00:00+00 ISO 8601 (UTC) <br>
1990-01-11 20:00:00-08 ISO 8601 (local time) <br>
1990/01/12 04:00:00 traditional RCS format <br>
Thu Jan 11 20:00:00 1990 LT output of ctime(3) + LT <br>
Thu Jan 11 20:00:00 PST 1990 output of date(1) <br>
Fri Jan 12 04:00:00 GMT 1990 <br>
Thu, 11 Jan 1990 20:00:00 -0800 Internet RFC 822 <br>
12-January-1990, 04:00 WET</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most fields in the date and time
can be defaulted. The default time zone is normally UTC, but
this can be overridden by the -z option. The other defaults
are determined <br>
in the order year, month, day, hour, minute, and second
(most to least significant). At least one of these fields
must be provided. For omitted fields that are of higher <br>
significance than the highest provided field, the time
zone&rsquo;s current values are assumed. For all other
omitted fields, the lowest possible values are assumed. For
exam&acirc; <br>
ple, without -z, the date 20, 10:30 defaults to 10:30:00 UTC
of the 20th of the UTC time zone&rsquo;s current month and
year. The date/time must be quoted if it contains spa&acirc;
<br>
ces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M[rev] <br>
Set the modification time on the new working file to be the
date of the retrieved revision. Use this option with care;
it can confuse make(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sstate <br>
retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch whose
state is set to state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Enable self-same mode. In
this mode, the owner of a lock is unimportant, just that it
exists. Effectively, this means the user cannot check out
the same revision twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Preserve the modification
time on the RCS file even if the RCS file changes because a
lock is added or removed. This option can suppress extensive
recompilation caused by <br>
a make(1) dependency of some other copy of the working file
on the RCS file. Use this option with care; it can suppress
recompilation even when it is needed, i.e. when <br>
the change of lock would mean a change to keyword strings in
the other working file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w[login] <br>
retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch which
was checked in by the user with login name login. If the
argument login is omitted, the caller&rsquo;s login is <br>
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-jjoinlist <br>
generates a new revision which is the join of the revisions
on joinlist. This option is largely obsoleted by rcsmerge(1)
but is retained for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The joinlist is a
comma-separated list of pairs of the form rev2:rev3, where
rev2 and rev3 are (symbolic or numeric) revision numbers.
For the initial such pair, rev1 <br>
denotes the revision selected by the above options -f, ...,
-w. For all other pairs, rev1 denotes the revision generated
by the previous pair. (Thus, the output of one <br>
join becomes the input to the next.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each pair, co joins
revisions rev1 and rev3 with respect to rev2. This means
that all changes that transform rev2 into rev1 are applied
to a copy of rev3. This is <br>
particularly useful if rev1 and rev3 are the ends of two
branches that have rev2 as a common ancestor. If
rev1&lt;rev2&lt;rev3 on the same branch, joining generates a
new revi&acirc; <br>
sion which is like rev3, but with all changes that lead from
rev1 to rev2 undone. If changes from rev2 to rev1 overlap
with changes from rev2 to rev3, co reports overlaps <br>
as described in merge(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the initial pair, rev2 can
be omitted. The default is the common ancestor. If any of
the arguments indicate branches, the latest revisions on
those branches are <br>
assumed. The options -l and -u lock or unlock rev1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print RCS&rsquo;s version
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Vn Emulate RCS version n, where
n can be 3, 4, or 5. This can be useful when interchanging
RCS files with others who are running older versions of RCS.
To see which version <br>
of RCS your correspondents are running, have them invoke rcs
-V; this works with newer versions of RCS. If it
doesn&rsquo;t work, have them invoke rlog on an RCS file; if
none <br>
of the first few lines of output contain the string branch:
it is version 3; if the dates&rsquo; years have just two
digits, it is version 4; otherwise, it is version 5. An RCS
<br>
file generated while emulating version 3 loses its default
branch. An RCS revision generated while emulating version 4
or earlier has a time stamp that is off by up to 13 <br>
hours. A revision extracted while emulating version 4 or
earlier contains abbreviated dates of the form yy/mm/dd and
can also contain different white space and line pre&acirc;
<br>
fixes in the substitution for $Log$.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsuffixes <br>
Use suffixes to characterize RCS files. See ci(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-zzone specifies the date output
format in keyword substitution, and specifies the default
time zone for date in the -ddate option. The zone should be
empty, a numeric UTC off&acirc; <br>
set, or the special string LT for local time. The default is
an empty zone, which uses the traditional RCS format of UTC
without any time zone indication and with slashes <br>
separating the parts of the date; otherwise, times are
output in ISO 8601 format with time zone indication. For
example, if local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific <br>
Standard Time, eight hours west of UTC, then the time is
output as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option time output <br>
-z 1990/01/12 04:00:00 (default) <br>
-zLT 1990-01-11 20:00:00-08 <br>
-z+05:30 1990-01-12 09:30:00+05:30</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -z option does not affect
dates stored in RCS files, which are always UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION <br>
Strings of the form $keyword$ and $keyword:...$ embedded in
the text are replaced with strings of the form
$keyword:value$ where keyword and value are pairs listed
below. Key&acirc; <br>
words can be embedded in literal strings or comments to
identify a revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initially, the user enters
strings of the form $keyword$. On checkout, co replaces
these strings with strings of the form $keyword:value$. If a
revision containing strings of <br>
the latter form is checked back in, the value fields will be
replaced during the next checkout. Thus, the keyword values
are automatically updated on checkout. This automatic <br>
substitution can be modified by the -k options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keywords and their corresponding
values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Author$ <br>
The login name of the user who checked in the revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Date$ The date and time the
revision was checked in. With -zzone a numeric time zone
offset is appended; otherwise, the date is UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Header$ <br>
A standard header containing the full RCS file name, the
revision number, the date and time, the author, the state,
and the locker (if locked). With -zzone a numeric time <br>
zone offset is appended to the date; otherwise, the date is
UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Id$ Same as $Header$, except
that the RCS file name is without the directory
components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Locker$ <br>
The login name of the user who locked the revision (empty if
not locked).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Log$ The log message supplied
during checkin, preceded by a header containing the RCS file
name, the revision number, the author, and the date and
time. With -zzone a numeric <br>
time zone offset is appended; otherwise, the date is UTC.
Existing log messages are not replaced. Instead, the new log
message is inserted after $Log:...$. This is use&acirc; <br>
ful for accumulating a complete change log in a source
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each inserted line is prefixed
by the string that prefixes the $Log$ line. For example, if
the $Log$ line is &acirc;// $Log: tan.cc $&acirc;, RCS
prefixes each line of the log with <br>
&acirc;// &acirc;. This is useful for languages with
comments that go to the end of the line. The convention for
other languages is to use a &acirc; &acirc; &acirc; prefix
inside a multiline comment. <br>
For example, the initial log comment of a C program
conventionally is of the following form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/&acirc; <br>
&acirc; $Log$ <br>
&acirc;/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backwards compatibility with
older versions of RCS, if the log prefix is /&acirc; or
(&acirc; surrounded by optional white space, inserted log
lines contain a space instead of / <br>
or (; however, this usage is obsolescent and should not be
relied on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Name$ The symbolic name used to
check out the revision, if any. For example, co -rJoe
generates $Name: Joe $. Plain co generates just $Name:
$.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$RCSfile$ <br>
The RCS file name without directory components.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Revision$ <br>
The revision number assigned to the revision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$Source$ <br>
The full RCS file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$State$ <br>
The state assigned to the revision with the -s option of
rcs(1) or ci(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following characters in
keyword values are represented by escape sequences to keep
keyword strings well-formed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">char escape sequence <br>
tab <br>
newline <br>
space 40 <br>
$ 44 &nbsp; <br>
\</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE MODES <br>
The working file inherits the read and execute permissions
from the RCS file. In addition, the owner write permission
is turned on, unless -kv is set or the file is checked out
<br>
unlocked and locking is set to strict (see rcs(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a file with the name of the
working file exists already and has write permission, co
aborts the checkout, asking beforehand if possible. If the
existing working file is not <br>
writable or -f is given, the working file is deleted without
asking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
co accesses files much as ci(1) does, except that it does
not need to read the working file unless a revision number
of $ is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
RCSINIT <br>
Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.
A backslash escapes spaces within an option. The RCSINIT
options are prepended to the argument lists of most <br>
RCS commands. Useful RCSINIT options include -q, -V, -x, and
-z.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RCS_MEM_LIMIT <br>
An integer lim, measured in kilobytes, specifying the
threshold under which commands will try to use memory-based
operations for processing the RCS file. (For RCS files <br>
of size lim kilobytes or greater, RCS will use the slower
standard input/output routines.) Default value is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TMPDIR Name of the temporary
directory. If not set, the environment variables TMP and
TEMP are inspected instead and the first value found is
taken; if none of them are set, a <br>
host-dependent default is used, typically /tmp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The RCS file name, the working file name, and the revision
number retrieved are written to the diagnostic output. The
exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
suc&acirc; <br>
cessful.</p>
