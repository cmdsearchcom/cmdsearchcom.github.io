<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
glbsp - GL Nodes builder for DOOM ports</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
glbsp [options] input.wad ... [-o output.wad]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glbsp @argfile.rsp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
glBSP is a nodes builder specially designed to be used with
OpenGL-based DOOM game engines. It adheres to the
&quot;GL-Friendly Nodes&quot; specification, which means it
adds some new <br>
special nodes to a WAD file that makes it very easy for an
OpenGL DOOM engine to compute the polygons needed for
drawing the levels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Options begin with a single dash (you can also use two
dashes like in many GNU programs). Running glBSP without any
options will show an informational screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h -help <br>
Show a summary of all the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q -quiet <br>
Quieter output. Information about each level (like the
number of linedefs, blockmap size, etc) is not displayed
when this option is given, and a few other messages are <br>
skipped. Important messages, like failure to build a certain
level, are still shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f -fast <br>
Allows glBSP to cheat a bit and re-use the original node
information to create the GL nodes, doing it much faster.
Use this option to enable this feature. The message <br>
&quot;Using original nodes to speed things up&quot; will be
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The downside to reusing the
original nodes is that they may not be as good as the ones
glBSP normally creates, e.g. the special checks to minimise
slime-trails don&rsquo;t kick <br>
in, and the -factor value doesn&rsquo;t have much
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w -warn <br>
Shows extra warning messages, which detail various
non-serious problems that glBSP has while analysing the
level structure. Often these warnings show a real problem in
<br>
the level (e.g. a non-closed sector or invalid sidedef), so
they are worth checking now and then.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n -normal <br>
glBSP usually detects if the normal node info (i.e. the
non-GL variety) is present: when yes, it is left untouched,
otherwise glBSP creates it. This option forces glBSP <br>
to replace the normal node data with newly constructed
nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c -factor &lt;num&gt; <br>
Sets the cost assigned to seg splits. Factor can be any
number from 1 to 32, and larger values make seg splits more
costly (and thus glBSP tries harder to avoid them), <br>
but smaller values produce better BSP trees. The default
value is known to be a good compromise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p -pack <br>
Pack sidedefs, by detecting which sidedefs are identical and
removing the duplicates, producing a smaller PWAD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: this may make your level a
lot harder to edit! Therefore this is most useful when
producing the final WAD for public release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xr -noreject <br>
Normally glBSP will create an simple REJECT map for each
level. This options prevents any existing REJECT map, such
as one time-consumingly built by a dedicated reject <br>
builder, from being clobbered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are rarely
needed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v1 .. -v5 <br>
Specify the version of the &quot;GL Nodes&quot; spec to use
(either 1, 2, 3 or 5). V1 is considered obsolete now. The
default is V2. Giving -v3 or -v5 will force certain lumps to
<br>
use the new formats, but is only useful for testing since
glBSP will automatically switch to V5 format whenever the
ordinary limits are exceeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m -mergevert <br>
Merge duplicate vertices at the same location into a single
vertex. This is usually safe, but is not done by default
because some engines (e.g. Risen3D) need the dupli&acirc;
<br>
cate vertices to stay separate for a special effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y -windowfx <br>
Lets glBSP detect and handle the &quot;One-Sided
Window&quot; mapping trick. This can cause problems in some
engines so it is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b -maxblock &lt;num&gt; <br>
Sets the limit of the number of blocks the BLOCKMAP may
contain before we truncate it. Default is 16000. When the
level is too large to fit, glBSP will truncate the <br>
blockmap, so it covers less area on the level. This means
that in the parts it doesn&rsquo;t cover (at the outer
edges) there is no collision detection: you can walk through
<br>
walls and other objects and bullets/missiles don&rsquo;t hit
anything. On very large but sparse levels, using a larger
value (e.g. 30000) may help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A more serious problem is when
the blockmap overflows. The blockmap created would be
invalid, and could crash the DOOM engine when used. glBSP
will create an empty <br>
blockmap instead, causing modern ports to build their own
blockmap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xp -noprog <br>
Turn off the progress indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xn -nonormal <br>
Forces glBSP to not create the normal node information when
it detects that it is absent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xu -prunesec <br>
Removes any unused sectors that are found in the level. This
has the potential to cause problems, since in certain
scripting languages (e.g. EDGE&rsquo;s RTS, or Doom
Legacy&rsquo;s <br>
Fragglescript) some commands use sector numbers directly,
and pruning unused sectors can cause those references to
become invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESPONSE FILES <br>
New in version 2.20 is support for response files. These are
files containing a list of options. You specify the response
file by prefixing it with &rsquo;@&rsquo;. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glbsp @argfile.rsp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;@argfile.rsp&quot; on
the command line will be replaced with the contents of that
file. New-line characters are treated like spaces. Recursion
(using &rsquo;@&rsquo; inside a response <br>
file) is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ZDBSP NODES <br>
When the normal nodes overflow, older versions of glBSP
would simply write out the invalid node data. glBSP 2.20 and
higher now write the node data in the ZDBSP format
(origi&acirc; <br>
nally created for the ZDoom engine).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS <br>
Andrew Apted created glBSP and glBSPX and continues to
maintain them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Andrew Baker, Janis Legzdinsh,
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Majoral and Darren Salt have contributed
code, and Marc Pullen helped with the documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">glBSP was originally based on
BSP 2.3 (C) Colin Reed and Lee Killough, which was created
from the basic theory stated in DEU5 (OBJECTS.C) by Raphael
Quinet.</p>
