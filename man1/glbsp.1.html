glbsp - GL Nodes builder for DOOM ports

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<i>glBSP</i> is a nodes builder specially designed to be used with OpenGL-based
  DOOM game engines. It adheres to the &quot;GL-Friendly Nodes&quot;
  specification, which means it adds some new special nodes to a WAD file that
  makes it very easy for an OpenGL DOOM engine to compute the polygons needed
  for drawing the levels.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Options begin with a single dash (you can also use two dashes like in many GNU
  programs). Running glBSP without any options will show an informational
  screen.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-h -help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Show a summary of all the options.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-q -quiet</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Quieter output. Information about each level (like the
      number of linedefs, blockmap size, etc) is not displayed when this option
      is given, and a few other messages are skipped. Important messages, like
      failure to build a certain level, are still shown.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-f -fast</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Allows glBSP to cheat a bit and re-use the original node
      information to create the GL nodes, doing it much faster. Use this option
      to enable this feature. The message &quot;Using original nodes to speed
      things up&quot; will be shown.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The downside to reusing the original nodes is that they may not be as good
      as the ones glBSP normally creates, e.g. the special checks to minimise
      slime-trails don't kick in, and the -factor value doesn't have much
      effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w -warn</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Shows extra warning messages, which detail various
      non-serious problems that glBSP has while analysing the level structure.
      Often these warnings show a real problem in the level (e.g. a non-closed
      sector or invalid sidedef), so they are worth checking now and then.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n -normal</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">glBSP usually detects if the normal node info (i.e. the
      non-GL variety) is present: when yes, it is left untouched, otherwise
      glBSP creates it. This option forces glBSP to replace the normal node data
      with newly constructed nodes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-c -factor</b><i> &lt;num&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the cost assigned to seg splits. Factor can be any
      number from 1 to 32, and larger values make seg splits more costly (and
      thus glBSP tries harder to avoid them), but smaller values produce better
      BSP trees. The default value is known to be a good compromise.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-p -pack</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Pack sidedefs, by detecting which sidedefs are identical
      and removing the duplicates, producing a smaller PWAD.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    NOTE: this may make your level a lot harder to edit! Therefore this is most
      useful when producing the final WAD for public release.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-xr -noreject</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Normally glBSP will create an simple REJECT map for each
      level. This options prevents any existing REJECT map, such as one
      time-consumingly built by a dedicated reject builder, from being
      clobbered.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options are rarely needed:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v1 .. -v5</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the version of the &quot;GL Nodes&quot; spec to use
      (either 1, 2, 3 or 5). V1 is considered obsolete now. The default is V2.
      Giving -v3 or -v5 will force certain lumps to use the new formats, but is
      only useful for testing since glBSP will automatically switch to V5 format
      whenever the ordinary limits are exceeded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-m -mergevert</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Merge duplicate vertices at the same location into a single
      vertex. This is usually safe, but is not done by default because some
      engines (e.g. Risen3D) need the duplicate vertices to stay separate for a
      special effect.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-y -windowfx</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Lets glBSP detect and handle the &quot;One-Sided
      Window&quot; mapping trick. This can cause problems in some engines so it
      is disabled by default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-b -maxblock</b><i> &lt;num&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Sets the limit of the number of blocks the BLOCKMAP may
      contain before we truncate it. Default is 16000. When the level is too
      large to fit, glBSP will truncate the blockmap, so it covers less area on
      the level. This means that in the parts it doesn't cover (at the outer
      edges) there is no collision detection: you can walk through walls and
      other objects and bullets/missiles don't hit anything. On very large but
      sparse levels, using a larger value (e.g. 30000) may help.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A more serious problem is when the blockmap overflows. The blockmap created
      would be invalid, and could crash the DOOM engine when used. glBSP will
      create an empty blockmap instead, causing modern ports to build their own
      blockmap.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-xp -noprog</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Turn off the progress indicator.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-xn -nonormal</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Forces glBSP to not create the normal node information when
      it detects that it is absent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-xu -prunesec</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Removes any unused sectors that are found in the level.
      This has the potential to cause problems, since in certain scripting
      languages (e.g. EDGE's RTS, or Doom Legacy's Fragglescript) some commands
      use sector numbers directly, and pruning unused sectors can cause those
      references to become invalid.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESPONSE_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#RESPONSE_FILES">RESPONSE
  FILES</a></h1>
New in version 2.20 is support for response files. These are files containing a
  list of options. You specify the response file by prefixing it with '@'. For
  example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>glbsp</b> <i>@argfile.rsp</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;@argfile.rsp&quot; on the command line will be replaced with the
  contents of that file. New-line characters are treated like spaces. Recursion
  (using '@' inside a response file) is not supported.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ZDBSP_NODES"><a class="selflink" href="#ZDBSP_NODES">ZDBSP
  NODES</a></h1>
When the normal nodes overflow, older versions of glBSP would simply write out
  the invalid node data. glBSP 2.20 and higher now write the node data in the
  ZDBSP format (originally created for the ZDoom engine).

glBSP was originally based on BSP 2.3 (C) Colin Reed and Lee Killough, which was
  created from the basic theory stated in DEU5 (OBJECTS.C) by Raphael Quinet.
