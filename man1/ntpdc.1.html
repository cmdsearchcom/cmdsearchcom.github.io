<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ntpdc - special NTP query program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ntpdc [-ilnps] [-c command] [host] [...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ntpdc is used to query the ntpd daemon about its current
state and to request changes in that state. The program may
be run either in interactive mode or controlled using
command <br>
line arguments. Extensive state and statistics information
is available through the ntpdc interface. In addition,
nearly all the configuration options which can be specified
at <br>
startup using ntpd&rsquo;s configuration file may also be
specified at run time using ntpdc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If one or more request options
are included on the command line when ntpdc is executed,
each of the requests will be sent to the NTP servers running
on each of the hosts given as <br>
command line arguments, or on localhost by default. If no
request options are given, ntpdc will attempt to read
commands from the standard input and execute these on the
NTP <br>
server running on the first host given on the command line,
again defaulting to localhost when no other host is
specified. ntpdc will prompt for commands if the standard
input is <br>
a terminal device.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ntpdc uses NTP mode 7 packets to
communicate with the NTP server, and hence can be used to
query any compatible server on the network which permits it.
Note that since NTP is a <br>
UDP protocol this communication will be somewhat unreliable,
especially over large distances in terms of network
topology. ntpdc makes no attempt to retransmit requests, and
will <br>
time requests out if the remote host is not heard from
within a suitable timeout time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operation of ntpdc are
specific to the particular implementation of the ntpd daemon
and can be expected to work only with this and maybe some
previous versions of the daemon. <br>
Requests from a remote ntpdc program which affect the state
of the local server must be authenticated, which requires
both the remote program and local server share a common key
<br>
and key identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in contexts where a
host name is expected, a -4 qualifier preceding the host
name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a -6
qualifier forces DNS resolu&acirc; <br>
tion to the IPv6 namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Specifying a command line option other than -i or -n will
cause the specified query (queries) to be sent to the
indicated host(s) immediately. Otherwise, ntpdc will attempt
to <br>
read interactive format commands from the standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-4 Force DNS resolution of
following host names on the command line to the IPv4
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-6 Force DNS resolution of
following host names on the command line to the IPv6
namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c command <br>
The following argument is interpreted as an interactive
format command and is added to the list of commands to be
executed on the specified host(s). Multiple -c options <br>
may be given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i Force ntpdc to operate in
interactive mode. Prompts will be written to the standard
output and commands read from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Obtain a list of peers which
are known to the server(s). This switch is equivalent to -c
listpeers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Output all host addresses in
dotted-quad numeric format rather than converting to the
canonical host names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Print a list of the peers
known to the server as well as a summary of their state.
This is equivalent to -c peers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Print a list of the peers
known to the server as well as a summary of their state, but
in a slightly different format than the -p switch. This is
equivalent to -c dmpeers.</p>
