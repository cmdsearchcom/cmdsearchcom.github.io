<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
zev - compute matrix eigenvalues</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
zev [OPTIONS] &lt;Matrix&gt; [&lt;Poly&gt;
[&lt;Group&gt;]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program reads a matrix from Matrix and a list of
polynomials from Poly (or from the standard input). For each
input polynomial, it evaluates that function of the input
<br>
matrix, calculates the nullity, and puts out this nullity,
divided by the degree, along with a text from the input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program was specifically
designed to assist in the calculation of the Brauer
characters of diagonalizable matrices, with the text giving
the complex number which is the <br>
Brauer character of the companion matrix for that
polynomial. Usually the polynomials have been prepared in a
separate data file and are fed into zev by giving the file
name or <br>
by redirecting its input. The preparation of the input
polynomials is generally a time-consuming task if it is done
by hand, but there are data files available for the most
com&acirc; <br>
monly used fields. These files should be located in the
library directory. They are distributed with this release of
the C MeatAxe. If the user is familiar with the computer
<br>
program system GAP, he will find it easy to create his own
data files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the nullity is not a multiple
of the degree, zev prints a warning message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polynomial File Format <br>
The data file contains the polynomials in text form. Several
polynomials can be comprised in a group, and the data file
can contain any number of groups of polynomials. This <br>
allows several sets of polynomials to be kept in one data
file (for example, all polynomials for a given field), the
appropriate polynomials being selected through the Group
<br>
argument on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is read and interpreted
line by line. There are three types of lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Comment lines,
beginning with a &quot;#&quot;. These lines are simply
ignored by zev, as are empty lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Group headers.
Each line beginning with a non-space character is
interpreted as the beginning of a new group of polynomials.
Such lines contain only one text field, the name <br>
of the group (up to 1023 characters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Lines beginning
with a space are interpreted as polynomials. The format
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[space]Name Coefficients</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where Name is any text (up to
1023 characters), and Coefficients are the coefficients of
the polynomial (in free format). Note that the first
character must be an ordinary <br>
space charcter, a TAB is not allowed! The coefficients must
use the names as specified by the arithmetic &acirc; usually
0, 1, ..., q-1. The one exception is -1, which the program
<br>
treats specially as &quot;0-1&quot; so that the cyclotomic
polynomials can be used over all fields. The coefficients
are in decreasing degree, starting with the coefficient of
the high&acirc; <br>
est power of x and continuing, ending up with the constant
term.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Sample input file for zev <br>
# Some polynomials over GF(5) <br>
# <br>
p11b11 <br>
1 1 4 <br>
b11 1 4 4 1 3 4 <br>
-1-b11 1 2 4 1 1 4 <br>
p13c13 <br>
1 1 4 <br>
c13 1 3 0 3 1 <br>
c13*3 1 1 4 1 1 <br>
c13*9 1 2 1 2 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file contains 7 polynomials
in two groups. The polynomial &quot;b11&quot; in group
&quot;p11b11&quot; is x^5+4x^4+4x^3+x^2+3x+4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Format <br>
There are two output formats. By default the nullities are
printed in tabular form giving group, name, degree and
multiplicity (i.e., nullity divided by degree) for each
polyno&acirc; <br>
mial. If the -G option is given, zev prints an algebraic
expression which can be read from GAP. Here is an example
with an 8 by 8 matrix over GF(3), polynomials being read
from <br>
&quot;poly3&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ zev mat poly3 p8i2 <br>
p8i2 1 1 1 <br>
p8i2 -1 1 4 <br>
p8i2 0 2 2 <br>
p8i2 i2 2 0 <br>
p8i2 -i2 2 1 <br>
$ zev -G mat poly3 p8i2 <br>
MeatAxe.BrauerChar := 1*(1) + 4*(-1) + 2*(0) + 1*(-i2);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;i2&quot; does
not appear in the expression because its coefficient is
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Q Quiet, no messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Verbose, more messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;MaxTime&gt; <br>
Set CPU time limit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G, --gap <br>
Produce output in GAP format. This option implies -Q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS <br>
There must be enough memory to hold the input matrix and two
more matrices of the same size. Lines in the polynomial
input file must not be longer than 1023 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not checked that the input
file is a matrix. TAB characters at the beginning of a line
are not interpreted as space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
Matrix A square matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Poly Polynomial definition file;
read from standard input by default.</p>
