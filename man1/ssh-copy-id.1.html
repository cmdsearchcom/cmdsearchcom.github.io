<p>SSH-COPY-ID(1) BSD General Commands Manual
SSH-COPY-ID(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ssh-copy-id &acirc; use locally available keys to authorise
logins on a remote machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ssh-copy-id [-n] [-i [identity_file]] [-p port] [-o
ssh_option] [user@]hostname <br>
ssh-copy-id -h | -?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh(1) to log into a
remote machine (presumably using a login password, so
password authentication should be enabled, unless
you&rsquo;ve done some <br>
clever use of multiple identities). It assembles a list of
one or more fingerprints (as described below) and tries to
log in with each key, to see if any of them are already <br>
installed (of course, if you are not using ssh-agent(1) this
may result in you being repeatedly prompted for
pass-phrases). It then assembles a list of those that failed
to log <br>
in, and using ssh, enables logins with those keys on the
remote server. By default it adds the keys by appending them
to the remote user&rsquo;s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (creating
the <br>
file, and directory, if necessary). It is also capable of
detecting if the remote system is a NetScreen, and using its
&acirc;set ssh pka-dsa key ...&acirc; command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i identity_file <br>
Use only the key(s) contained in identity_file (rather than
looking for identities via ssh-add(1) or in the
default_ID_file). If the filename does not end in .pub this
is <br>
added. If the filename is omitted, the default_ID_file is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this can be used to
ensure that the keys copied have the comment one prefers
and/or extra options applied, by ensuring that the key file
has these set as pre&acirc; <br>
ferred before the copy is attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n do a dry-run. Instead of
installing keys on the remote system simply prints the
key(s) that would have been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, -? Print Usage summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p port, -o ssh_option <br>
These two options are simply passed through untouched, along
with their argument, to allow one to set the port or other
ssh(1) options, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rather than specifying these as
command line options, it is often better to use (per-host)
settings in ssh(1)&rsquo;s configuration file:
ssh_config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default behaviour without -i, is
to check if &acirc;ssh-add -L&acirc; provides any output,
and if so those keys are used. Note that this results in the
comment on the key being the filename <br>
that was given to ssh-add(1) when the key was loaded into
your ssh-agent(1) rather than the comment contained in that
file, which is a bit of a shame. Otherwise, if ssh-add(1)
<br>
provides no keys contents of the default_ID_file will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default_ID_file is the most
recent file that matches: ~/.ssh/id*.pub, (excluding those
that match ~/.ssh/*-cert.pub) so if you create a key that is
not the one you want <br>
ssh-copy-id to use, just use touch(1) on your preferred
key&rsquo;s .pub file to reinstate it as the most
recent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
If you have already installed keys from one system on a lot
of remote hosts, and you then create a new key, on a new
client machine, say, it can be difficult to keep track of
which <br>
systems on which you&rsquo;ve installed the new key. One way
of dealing with this is to load both the new key and old
key(s) into your ssh-agent(1). Load the new key first,
without the <br>
-c option, then load one or more old keys into the agent,
possibly by ssh-ing to the client machine that has that old
key, using the -A option to allow agent forwarding:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user@newclient$ ssh-add <br>
user@newclient$ ssh -A old.client <br>
user@oldl$ ssh-add -c <br>
... prompt for pass-phrase ... <br>
user@old$ logoff <br>
user@newclient$ ssh someserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">now, if the new key is installed
on the server, you&rsquo;ll be allowed in unprompted,
whereas if you only have the old key(s) enabled,
you&rsquo;ll be asked for confirmation, which is your <br>
cue to log back out and run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user@newclient$ ssh-copy-id -i
someserver</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason you might want to
specify the -i option in this case is to ensure that the
comment on the installed key is the one from the .pub file,
rather than just the filename that <br>
was loaded into you agent. It also ensures that only the id
you intended is installed, rather than all the keys that you
have in your ssh-agent(1). Of course, you can specify <br>
another id, or use the contents of the ssh-agent(1) as you
prefer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Having mentioned
ssh-add(1)&rsquo;s -c option, you might consider using this
whenever using agent forwarding to avoid your key being
hijacked, but it is much better to instead use <br>
ssh(1)&rsquo;s ProxyCommand and -W option, to bounce through
remote servers while always doing direct end-to-end
authentication. This way the middle hop(s) don&rsquo;t get
access to your <br>
ssh-agent(1). A web search for &acirc;ssh proxycommand
nc&acirc; should prove enlightening (N.B. the modern
approach is to use the -W option, rather than nc(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
SSH_COPY_ID_LEGACY <br>
If the SSH_COPY_ID_LEGACY environment variable is set, the
ssh-copy-id is run in a legacy mode. In this mode, the
ssh-copy-id doesn&rsquo;t check an existence of a private
key <br>
and doesn&rsquo;t do remote checks of the remote server
versions or if public keys are already installed.</p>
