ppmforge - fractal forgeries of clouds, planets, and starry
skies</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ppmforge generates three kinds
of &lsquo;&lsquo;random fractal forgeries,&rsquo;&rsquo; the
term coined by Richard F. Voss of the IBM Thomas J. Watson
Research Center for seemingly realistic pictures of <br>
natural objects generated by simple algorithms embodying
randomness and fractal self-similarity. The techniques used
by ppmforge are essentially those given by Voss[1],
particu&acirc; <br>
larly the technique of spectral synthesis explained in more
detail by Dietmar Saupe[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program generates two
varieties of pictures: planets and clouds, which are just
different renderings of data generated in an identical
manner, illustrating the unity of the <br>
fractal structure of these very different objects. A third
type of picture, a starry sky, is synthesised directly from
pseudorandom numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generation of planets or
clouds begins with the preparation of an array of random
data in the frequency domain. The size of this array, the
&lsquo;&lsquo;mesh size,&rsquo;&rsquo; can be set with <br>
the -mesh option; the larger the mesh the more realistic the
pictures but the calculation time and memory requirement
increases as the square of the mesh size. The fractal <br>
dimension, which you can specify with the -dimension option,
determines the roughness of the terrain on the planet or the
scale of detail in the clouds. As the fractal dimension <br>
is increased, more high frequency components are added into
the random mesh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the mesh is generated, an
inverse two dimensional Fourier transform is performed upon
it. This converts the original random frequency domain data
into spatial amplitudes. <br>
We scale the real components that result from the Fourier
transform into numbers from 0 to 1 associated with each
point on the mesh. You can further modify this number by
apply&acirc; <br>
ing a &lsquo;&lsquo;power law scale&rsquo;&rsquo; to it with
the -power option. Unity scale leaves the numbers
unmodified; a power scale of 0.5 takes the square root of
the numbers in the mesh, while a <br>
power scale of 3 replaces the numbers in the mesh with their
cubes. Power law scaling is best envisioned by thinking of
the data as representing the elevation of terrain; powers
<br>
less than 1 yield landscapes with vertical scarps that look
like glacially-carved valleys; powers greater than one make
fairy-castle spires (which require large mesh sizes and <br>
high resolution for best results).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After these calculations, we
have a array of the specified size containing numbers that
range from 0 to 1. ppmforge generates as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The randomness in the image is
limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) -- if you run
the program twice in the same second, you may get identical
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Clouds A color map is created
that ranges from pure blue to white by increasing admixture
(desaturation) of blue with white. Numbers less than 0.5 are
colored blue, numbers <br>
between 0.5 and 1.0 are colored with corresponding levels of
white, with 1.0 being pure white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Planet The mesh is projected
onto a sphere. Values less than 0.5 are treated as water and
values between 0.5 and 1.0 as land. The water areas are
colored based upon the water <br>
depth, and land based on its elevation. The random depth
data are used to create clouds over the oceans. An
atmosphere approximately like the Earth&rsquo;s is
simulated; its <br>
light absorption is calculated to create a blue cast around
the limb of the planet. A function that rises from 0 to 1
based on latitude is modulated by the local eleva&acirc;
<br>
tion to generate polar ice caps--high altitude terrain
carries glaciers farther from the pole. Based on the
position of the star with respect to the observer, the
appar&acirc; <br>
ent color of each pixel of the planet is calculated by
ray-tracing from the star to the planet to the observer and
applying a lighting model that sums ambient light and <br>
diffuse reflection (for most planets ambient light is zero,
as their primary star is the only source of illumination).
Additional random data are used to generate stars <br>
around the planet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Night A sequence of pseudorandom
numbers is used to generate stars with a user specified
density.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cloud pictures always contain
256 or fewer colors and may be displayed on most color
mapped devices without further processing. Planet pictures
often contain tens of thousands <br>
of colors which must be compressed with pnmquant or
ppmdither before encoding in a color mapped format. If the
display resolution is high enough, ppmdither generally
produces <br>
better looking planets. pnmquant tends to create discrete
color bands, particularly in the oceans, which are
unrealistic and distracting. The number of colors in starry
sky <br>
pictures generated with the -night option depends on the
value specified for -saturation. Small values limit the
color temperature distribution of the stars and reduce the
num&acirc; <br>
ber of colors in the image. If the -saturation is set to 0,
none of the stars will be colored and the resulting image
will never contain more than 256 colors. Night sky
pic&acirc; <br>
tures with many different star colors often look best when
color compressed by pamdepth rather than pnmquant or
ppmdither. Try newmaxval settings of 63, 31, or 15 with
pamdepth <br>
to reduce the number of colors in the picture to 256 or
fewer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
You can abbreviate any options to its shortest unique
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-clouds <br>
Generate clouds. An image of fractal clouds is generated.
Selecting clouds sets the default for fractal dimension to
2.15 and power scale factor to 0.75.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dimension dimen <br>
Sets the fractal dimension to the specified dimen, which may
be any floating point value between 0 and 3. Higher fractal
dimensions create more &lsquo;&lsquo;chaotic&rsquo;&rsquo;
images, which <br>
require higher resolution output and a larger FFT mesh size
to look good. If no dimension is specified, 2.4 is used when
generating planets and 2.15 for clouds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-glaciers level <br>
The floating point level setting controls the extent to
which terrain elevation causes ice to appear at lower
latitudes. The default value of 0.75 makes the polar caps
<br>
extend toward the equator across high terrain and forms
glaciers in the highest mountains, as on Earth. Higher
values make ice sheets that cover more and more of the land
<br>
surface, simulating planets in the midst of an ice age.
Lower values tend to be boring, resulting in unrealistic
geometrically-precise ice cap boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-hour hour <br>
When generating a planet, ppmforge uses hour as the
&rsquo;hour angle at the central meridian.&rsquo; If you
specify -hour 12, for example, the planet will be fully
illuminated, cor&acirc; <br>
responding to high noon at the longitude at the center of
the screen. You can specify any floating point value between
0 and 24 for hour, but values which place most of <br>
the planet in darkness (0 to 4 and 20 to 24) result in
crescents which, while pretty, don&rsquo;t give you many
illuminated pixels for the amount of computing that&rsquo;s
required. <br>
If no -hour option is specified, a random hour angle is
chosen, biased so that only 25% of the images generated will
be crescents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ice level <br>
Sets the extent of the polar ice caps to the given floating
point level. The default level of 0.4 produces ice caps
similar to those of the Earth. Smaller values reduce <br>
the amount of ice, while larger -ice settings create more
prominent ice caps. Sufficiently large values, such as 100
or more, in conjunction with small settings for <br>
-glaciers (try 0.1) create &rsquo;ice balls&rsquo; like
Europa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-inclination|-tilt angle <br>
The inclination angle of the planet with regard to its
primary star is set to angle, which can be any floating
point value from -90 to 90. The inclination angle can be
<br>
thought of as specifying, in degrees, the
&lsquo;&lsquo;season&rsquo;&rsquo; the planet is presently
experiencing or, more precisely, the latitude at which the
star transits the zenith at local <br>
noon. If 0, the planet is at equinox; the star is directly
overhead at the equator. Positive values represent summer in
the northern hemisphere, negative values summer <br>
in the southern hemisphere. The Earth&rsquo;s inclination
angle, for example, is about 23.5 at the June solstice, 0 at
the equinoxes in March and September, and -23.5 at the <br>
December solstice. If no inclination angle is specified, a
random value between -21.6 and 21.6 degrees is chosen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mesh size <br>
A mesh of size by size will be used for the fast Fourier
transform (FFT). Note that memory requirements and
computation speed increase as the square of size; if you
dou&acirc; <br>
ble the mesh size, the program will use four times the
memory and run four times as long. The default mesh is
256x256, which produces reasonably good looking pictures
<br>
while using half a megabyte for the 256x256 array of single
precision complex numbers required by the FFT. On machines
with limited memory capacity, you may have to <br>
reduce the mesh size to avoid running out of RAM. Increasing
the mesh size produces better looking pictures; the
difference becomes particularly noticeable when
generat&acirc; <br>
ing high resolution images with relatively high fractal
dimensions (between 2.2 and 3).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-night A starry sky is
generated. The stars are created by the same algorithm used
for the stars that surround planet pictures, but the output
consists exclusively of stars.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-power factor <br>
Sets the &rsquo;power factor&rsquo; used to scale elevations
synthesised from the FFT to factor, which can be any
floating point number greater than zero. If no factor is
specified a <br>
default of 1.2 is used if a planet is being generated, or
0.75 if clouds are selected by the -clouds option. The
result of the FFT image synthesis is an array of
eleva&acirc; <br>
tion values between 0 and 1. A non-unity power factor
exponentiates each of these elevations to the specified
power. For example, a power factor of 2 squares each value,
<br>
while a power factor of 0.5 replaces each with its square
root. (Note that exponentiating values between 0 and 1
yields values that remain within that range.) Power
fac&acirc; <br>
tors less than 1 emphasise large-scale elevation changes at
the expense of small variations. Power factors greater than
1 increase the roughness of the terrain and, like <br>
high fractal dimensions, may require a larger FFT mesh size
and/or higher screen resolution to look good.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-saturation sat <br>
Controls the degree of color saturation of the stars that
surround planet pictures and fill starry skies created with
the -night option. The default value of 125 creates <br>
stars which resemble the sky as seen by the human eye from
Earth&rsquo;s surface. Stars are dim; only the brightest
activate the cones in the human retina, causing color to be
<br>
perceived. Higher values of sat approximate the appearance
of stars from Earth orbit, where better dark adaptation,
absence of skyglow, and the concentration of light <br>
from a given star onto a smaller area of the retina thanks
to the lack of atmospheric turbulence enhances the
perception of color. Values greater than 250 create
&lsquo;&lsquo;sci&acirc; <br>
ence fiction&rsquo;&rsquo; skies that, while pretty,
don&rsquo;t occur in this universe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thanks to the inverse square law
combined with Nature&rsquo;s love of mediocrity, there are
many, many dim stars for every bright one. This population
relationship is accu&acirc; <br>
rately reflected in the skies created by ppmforge. Dim, low
mass stars live much longer than bright massive stars,
consequently there are many reddish stars for every <br>
blue giant. This relationship is preserved by ppmforge. You
can reverse the proportion, simulating the sky as seen in a
starburst galaxy, by specifying a negative sat <br>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-seed num <br>
Sets the seed for the random number generator to the integer
num. The seed used to create each picture is displayed on
standard output (unless suppressed with the -quiet <br>
option). Pictures generated with the same seed will be
identical. If no -seed is specified, a random seed derived
from the date and time will be chosen. Specifying an <br>
explicit seed allows you to re-render a picture you
particularly like at a higher resolution or with different
viewing parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stars fraction <br>
Specifies the percentage of pixels, in tenths of a percent,
which will appear as stars, either surrounding a planet or
filling the entire frame if -night is specified. <br>
The default fraction is 100.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-xsize|-width width <br>
Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels. The
default width is 256 pixels. Images must be at least as wide
as they are high; if a width less than the height <br>
is specified, it will be increased to equal the height. If
you must have a long skinny image, make a square one with
ppmforge, then use pamcut to extract a portion of the <br>
shape and size you require.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ysize|-height height <br>
Sets the height of the generated image to height pixels. The
default height is 256 pixels. If the height specified
exceeds the width, the width will be increased to <br>
equal the height.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
The algorithms require the output image to be at least as
wide as it is high, and the width to be an even number of
pixels. These constraints are enforced by increasing the
size <br>
of the requested image if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may have to reduce the FFT
mesh size on machines with 16 bit integers and segmented
pointer architectures.</p>
