Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens
  instead of single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in place
  of the equals sign to separate an option name from its value.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This program is part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamfix</b> reads a stream that is mostly a Netpbm image but may have certain
  types of corruptions and produces a valid Netpbm image that preserves much of
  the information in the original.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In particular, Netpbm salvages streams that are truncated and that contain
  illegally large sample values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamfix</b> looks at only on the first image in a multi-image stream.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Truncated_stream"><a class="selflink" href="#Truncated_stream">Truncated
  stream</a></h2>
This is a stream that is missing the last part. Netpbm corrects this by creating
  an output image that simply has fewer rows.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You select this kind of repair with a <b>-truncate</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The header of a Netpbm image implies how large the image must be (how many bytes
  the file must contain). If the file is actually smaller than that, a Netpbm
  program that tries to read the image fails, with an error message telling you
  that it couldn't read the whole file. The data in the file is arranged in row
  order, from top to bottom, and the most common reason for the file being
  smaller than its header says it should be is because the bottommost rows are
  simply missing. So <b>pamfix</b> assumes that is the case and generates a new
  image with just the rows that are readable. (technically, that means the
  output's header indicates a smaller number of rows and omits any partial last
  row).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The most common way for a Netpbm file to be small is that something interrupted
  the program that generated it before it was finished writing the file. For
  example, the program ran out of its own input or encountered a bug or ran out
  of space in which to write the output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another problem <b>pamfix</b> deals with is where the file isn't actually too
  small, but because of a system error, a byte in the middle of it cannot be
  read (think of a disk storage failure). <b>pamfix</b> reads the input
  sequentially until it can't read any further, for any reason. So it treats
  such an image as a truncated one, ignoring all data after the unreadable byte.
<div class="Pp"></div>
But be aware that an image file is sometimes too small because of a bug in the
  program that generated it, and in that case it is not simply a matter of the
  bottom of the image missing, so <b>pamfix</b> simply creates a valid Netpbm
  image containing a garbage picture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to test an image file to see if it is corrupted by being too small,
  use <b>pamfile --allimages</b> . It fails with an error message if the file is
  too small.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to cut the bottom off a valid Netpbm image, use <b>pamcut</b>.

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Excessive_Sample_Value"><a class="selflink" href="#Excessive_Sample_Value">Excessive
  Sample Value</a></h2>
This is a stream that contains a purported sample value that is higher than the
  maxval of the image.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The header of a Netpbm image tells the maxval of the image, which is a value
  that gives meaning to all the sample values in the raster. The sample values
  represent a fraction of the maxval, so a sample value that is greater than the
  maxval makes no sense.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A regular Netpbm program fails if you give it input that contains a value larger
  than the maxval where a sample value belongs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pamfix</b> has three ways of salvaging such a stream:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clip to the maxval. Request this with <b>-clip</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Raise the maxval, thus lowering the fraction represented by
      every sample in the image. Request this with <b>-changemaxval</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Truncate the image at the first invalid sample value.
      Request this with <b>-truncate</b> and neither <b>-clip</b> nor
      <b>-changemaxval</b>.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You cannot specify both <b>-clip</b> and <b>-changemaxval</b>.

<b>pamfix</b> was new in Netpbm 10.66 (March 2014). But it grew out of
  <b>pamfixtrunc</b>, which was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007) and did only
  the truncated image repair (and for invalid sample values would simply pass
  them through to its output, generating an invalid Netpbm image).
