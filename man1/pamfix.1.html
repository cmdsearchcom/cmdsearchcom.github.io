<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pamfix - repair a Netpbm image with various corruptions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pamfix</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[-truncate] [-changemaxval]
[-clip] [-verbose]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[netpbmfile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Minimum unique abbreviation of
option is acceptable. You may use double hyphens instead of
single hyphen to denote options. You may use white space in
place of the equals sign <br>
to separate an option name from its value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamfix reads a stream that is
mostly a Netpbm image but may have certain types of
corruptions and produces a valid Netpbm image that preserves
much of the information in the <br>
original.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In particular, Netpbm salvages
streams that are truncated and that contain illegally large
sample values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamfix looks at only on the
first image in a multi-image stream.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Truncated stream <br>
This is a stream that is missing the last part. Netpbm
corrects this by creating an output image that simply has
fewer rows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You select this kind of repair
with a -truncate option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header of a Netpbm image
implies how large the image must be (how many bytes the file
must contain). If the file is actually smaller than that, a
Netpbm program that tries <br>
to read the image fails, with an error message telling you
that it couldn&rsquo;t read the whole file. The data in the
file is arranged in row order, from top to bottom, and the
most <br>
common reason for the file being smaller than its header
says it should be is because the bottommost rows are simply
missing. So pamfix assumes that is the case and generates a
<br>
new image with just the rows that are readable.
(technically, that means the output&rsquo;s header indicates
a smaller number of rows and omits any partial last
row).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most common way for a Netpbm
file to be small is that something interrupted the program
that generated it before it was finished writing the file.
For example, the program <br>
ran out of its own input or encountered a bug or ran out of
space in which to write the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another problem pamfix deals
with is where the file isn&rsquo;t actually too small, but
because of a system error, a byte in the middle of it cannot
be read (think of a disk storage <br>
failure). pamfix reads the input sequentially until it
can&rsquo;t read any further, for any reason. So it treats
such an image as a truncated one, ignoring all data after
the <br>
unreadable byte.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But be aware that an image file
is sometimes too small because of a bug in the program that
generated it, and in that case it is not simply a matter of
the bottom of the image <br>
missing, so pamfix simply creates a valid Netpbm image
containing a garbage picture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to test an image
file to see if it is corrupted by being too small, use
pamfile --allimages . It fails with an error message if the
file is too small.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to cut the bottom
off a valid Netpbm image, use pamcut.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Excessive Sample Value <br>
This is a stream that contains a purported sample value that
is higher than the maxval of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The header of a Netpbm image
tells the maxval of the image, which is a value that gives
meaning to all the sample values in the raster. The sample
values represent a fraction of <br>
the maxval, so a sample value that is greater than the
maxval makes no sense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A regular Netpbm program fails
if you give it input that contains a value larger than the
maxval where a sample value belongs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pamfix has three ways of
salvaging such a stream:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Clip to the
maxval. Request this with -clip.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Raise the
maxval, thus lowering the fraction represented by every
sample in the image. Request this with -changemaxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Truncate the
image at the first invalid sample value. Request this with
-truncate and neither -clip nor -changemaxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You cannot specify both -clip
and -changemaxval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
pamfix was new in Netpbm 10.66 (March 2014). But it grew out
of pamfixtrunc, which was new in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007)
and did only the truncated image repair (and for invalid
<br>
sample values would simply pass them through to its output,
generating an invalid Netpbm image).</p>
