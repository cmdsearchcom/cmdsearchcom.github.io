<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
lgagent - ION Load/Go remote agent program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
lgagent own_endpoint_ID</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ION Load/Go is a system for management of an ION-based
network, enabling the execution of ION administrative
programs at remote nodes. The system comprises two programs,
lgsend <br>
and lgagent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The lgagent task on a given node
opens the indicated ION endpoint for bundle reception,
receives the extracted payloads of Load/Go bundles sent to
it by lgsend as run on one or <br>
more remote nodes, and processes those payloads, which are
the text of Load/Go source files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Load/Go source file content is
limited to newline-terminated lines of ASCII characters.
More specifically, the text of any Load/Go source file is a
sequence of line sets of two <br>
types: file capsules and directives. Any Load/Go source file
may contain any number of file capsules and any number of
directives, freely intermingled in any order, but the <br>
typical structure of a Load/Go source file is simply a
single file capsule followed by a single directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When lgagent identifies a file
capsule, it copies all of the capsule&rsquo;s text lines to
a new file that it creates in the current working directory.
When lgagent identifies a <br>
directive, it executes the directive by passing the text of
the directive to the pseudoshell() function (see
platform(3)). lgagent processes the line sets of a Load/Go
source <br>
file in the order in which they appear in the file, so the
text of a directive may reference a file that was created as
the result of processing a prior file capsule in the same
<br>
source file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
&quot;0&quot; Load/Go remote agent processing has
terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
lgfile contains the Load/Go file capsules and directives
that are to be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
No environment variables apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The following diagnostics may be issued to the ion.log log
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: can&rsquo;t attach to
BP. <br>
Bundle Protocol is not running on this computer. Run
bpadmin(1) to start BP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: can&rsquo;t open own
endpoint. <br>
own_endpoint_ID is not a declared endpoint on the local ION
node. Run bpadmin(1) to add it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: bundle reception
failed. <br>
ION system problem. Investigate and correct before
restarting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent cannot continue. <br>
lgagent processing problem. See earlier diagnostic messages
for details. Investigate and correct before restarting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: no space for bundle
content. <br>
ION system problem: have exhausted available SDR data store
reserves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: can&rsquo;t receive
bundle content. <br>
ION system problem: have exhausted available SDR data store
reserves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: can&rsquo;t handle
bundle delivery. <br>
ION system problem. Investigate and correct before
restarting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lgagent: pseudoshell failed.
<br>
Error in directive line, usually an attempt to execute a
non-existent administration program (e.g., a misspelled
program name). Terminates processing of source file
content.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A variety of other diagnostics
noting source file parsing problems may also be reported.
These errors are non-fatal but they terminate the processing
of the source file content <br>
from the most recently received bundle.</p>
