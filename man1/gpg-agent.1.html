<p>GPG-AGENT(1) GNU Privacy Guard GPG-AGENT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpg-agent - Secret key management for GnuPG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpg-agent [--homedir dir] [--options file] [options] <br>
gpg-agent [--homedir dir] [--options file] [options]
--server <br>
gpg-agent [--homedir dir] [--options file] [options]
--daemon [command_line]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpg-agent is a daemon to manage secret (private) keys
independently from any protocol. It is used as a backend for
gpg and gpgsm as well as for a couple of other
utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The agent is usualy started on
demand by gpg, gpgsm, gpgconf or gpg-connect-agent. Thus
there is no reason to start it manually. In case you want to
use the included Secure <br>
Shell Agent you may start the agent using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg-connect-agent /bye</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The usual way to run the agent
is from the ~/.xsession file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you don&rsquo;t use an X
server, you can also put this into your regular startup file
~/.profile or .bash_profile. It is best not to run multiple
instance of the gpg-agent, so you <br>
should make sure that only one is running: gpg-agent uses an
environment variable to inform clients about the
communication parameters. You can write the content of this
environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable to a file so that you can test for a running
agent. Here is an example using Bourne shell syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg-agent --daemon
--enable-ssh-support --write-env-file
&quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This code should only be run
once per user session to initially fire up the agent. In the
example the optional support for the included Secure Shell
agent is enabled and the <br>
information about the agent is written to a file in the HOME
directory. Note that by running gpg-agent without arguments
you may test whether an agent is already running; how&acirc;
<br>
ever such a test may lead to a race condition, thus it is
not suggested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second script needs to be
run for each interactive session:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ -f
&quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; ]; then <br>
. &quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; <br>
export GPG_AGENT_INFO <br>
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It reads the data out of the
file and exports the variables. If you don&rsquo;t use
Secure Shell, you don&rsquo;t need the last two export
statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should always add the
following lines to your .bashrc or whatever initialization
file is used for all shell invocations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GPG_TTY=$(tty) <br>
export GPG_TTY</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is important that this
environment variable always reflects the output of the tty
command. For W32 systems this option is not required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please make sure that a proper
pinentry program has been installed under the default
filename (which is system dependant) or use the option
pinentry-program to specify the full <br>
name of that program. It is often useful to install a
symbolic link from the actual used pinentry (e.g.
&acirc;/usr/bin/pinentry-gtk&acirc;) to the expected one
(e.g. &acirc;/usr/bin/pinentry&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
Commands are not distinguished from options except for the
fact that only one command is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Print the program version and licensing information. Note
that you cannot abbreviate this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a usage message
summarizing the most useful command-line options. Note that
you cannot abbreviate this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--dump-options <br>
Print a list of all available options and commands. Note
that you cannot abbreviate this command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server <br>
Run in server mode and wait for commands on the stdin. The
default mode is to create a socket and listen for commands
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--daemon [command line] <br>
Start the gpg-agent as a daemon; that is, detach it from the
console and run it in the background. Because gpg-agent
prints out important information required for further <br>
use, a common way of invoking gpg-agent is: eval $(gpg-agent
--daemon) to setup the environment variables. The option
--write-env-file is another way commonly used to do <br>
this. Yet another way is creating a new process as a child
of gpg-agent: gpg-agent --daemon /bin/sh. This way you get a
new shell with the environment setup properly; if <br>
you exit from this shell, gpg-agent terminates as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--options file <br>
Reads configuration from file instead of from the default
per-user configuration file. The default configuration file
is named &acirc;gpg-agent.conf&acirc; and expected in the
<br>
&acirc;.gnupg&acirc; directory directly below the home
directory of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--homedir dir <br>
Set the name of the home directory to dir. If this option is
not used, the home directory defaults to
&acirc;~/.gnupg&acirc;. It is only recognized when given on
the command line. <br>
It also overrides any home directory stated through the
environment variable &acirc;GNUPGHOME&acirc; or (on W32
systems) by means of the Registry entry
HKCUtwareGNUGnuPG:Home&acirc; <br>
Dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose <br>
Outputs additional information while running. You can
increase the verbosity by giving several verbose commands to
gpgsm, such as &rsquo;-vv&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Try to be as quiet as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--batch <br>
Don&rsquo;t invoke a pinentry or do any other thing
requiring human interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--faked-system-time epoch <br>
This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system
time back or forth to epoch which is the number of seconds
elapsed since the year 1970.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-level level <br>
Select the debug level for investigating problems. level may
be a numeric value or a keyword:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none No debugging at all. A
value of less than 1 may be used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">basic Some basic debug messages.
A value between 1 and 2 may be used instead of the
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">advanced <br>
More verbose debug messages. A value between 3 and 5 may be
used instead of the keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expert Even more detailed
messages. A value between 6 and 8 may be used instead of the
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">guru All of the debug messages
you can get. A value greater than 8 may be used instead of
the keyword. The creation of hash tracing files is only
enabled if the keyword <br>
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">How these messages are mapped to
the actual debugging flags is not specified and may change
with newer releases of this program. They are however
carefully selected to best aid <br>
in debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug flags <br>
This option is only useful for debugging and the behaviour
may change at any time without notice. FLAGS are bit encoded
and may be given in usual C-Syntax. The currently <br>
defined bits are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 (1) X.509 or OpenPGP protocol
related data</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 (2) values of big number
integers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 (4) low level crypto
operations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 (32) memory allocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 (64) caching</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7 (128) <br>
show memory statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 (512) <br>
write hashed data to files named dbgmd-000*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">10 (1024) <br>
trace Assuan protocol</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">12 (4096) <br>
bypass all certificate validation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-all <br>
Same as --debug=0xffffffff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug-wait n <br>
When running in server mode, wait n seconds before entering
the actual processing loop and print the pid. This gives
time to attach a debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-detach <br>
Don&rsquo;t detach the process from the console. This is
mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--csh Format the info output in
daemon mode for use with the standard Bourne shell or the
C-shell respectively. The default is to guess it based on
the environment variable <br>
SHELL which is correct in almost all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--write-env-file file <br>
Often it is required to connect to the agent from a process
not being an inferior of gpg-agent and thus the environment
variable with the socket name is not available. To <br>
help setting up those variables in other sessions, this
option may be used to write the information into file. If
file is not specified the default name &acirc;${HOME}/.gpg-
<br>
agent-info&acirc; will be used. The format is suitable to be
evaluated by a Bourne shell like in this simple example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval $(cat file) <br>
eval $(cut -d= -f 1 &lt; file | xargs echo export)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-grab <br>
Tell the pinentry not to grab the keyboard and mouse. This
option should in general not be used to avoid X-sniffing
attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--log-file file <br>
Append all logging output to file. This is very helpful in
seeing what the agent actually does. If neither a log file
nor a log file descriptor has been set on a Windows <br>
platform, the Registry entry
HKCUtwareGNUGnuPG:DefaultLogFile, if set, is used to specify
the logging output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-mark-trusted <br>
Allow clients to mark keys as trusted, i.e. put them into
the &acirc;trustlist.txt&acirc; file. This is by default not
allowed to make it harder for users to inadvertently accept
<br>
Root-CA keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--allow-loopback-pinentry <br>
Allow clients to use the loopback pinentry features; see the
option pinentry-mode for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-cache-for-signing <br>
This option will let gpg-agent bypass the passphrase cache
for all signing operation. Note that there is also a
per-session option to control this behaviour but this
com&acirc; <br>
mand line option takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-cache-ttl n <br>
Set the time a cache entry is valid to n seconds. The
default is 600 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--default-cache-ttl-ssh n <br>
Set the time a cache entry used for SSH keys is valid to n
seconds. The default is 1800 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-cache-ttl n <br>
Set the maximum time a cache entry is valid to n seconds.
After this time a cache entry will be expired even if it has
been accessed recently. The default is 2 hours <br>
(7200 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-cache-ttl-ssh n <br>
Set the maximum time a cache entry used for SSH keys is
valid to n seconds. After this time a cache entry will be
expired even if it has been accessed recently. The <br>
default is 2 hours (7200 seconds).</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enforce-passphrase-constraints
<br>
Enforce the passphrase constraints by not allowing the user
to bypass them using the &lsquo;&lsquo;Take it
anyway&rsquo;&rsquo; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-passphrase-len n <br>
Set the minimal length of a passphrase. When entering a new
passphrase shorter than this value a warning will be
displayed. Defaults to 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-passphrase-nonalpha n <br>
Set the minimal number of digits or special characters
required in a passphrase. When entering a new passphrase
with less than this number of digits or special characters
<br>
a warning will be displayed. Defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-passphrase-pattern file
<br>
Check the passphrase against the pattern given in file. When
entering a new passphrase matching one of these pattern a
warning will be displayed. file should be an abso&acirc;
<br>
lute filename. The default is not to use any pattern
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security note: It is known that
checking a passphrase against a list of pattern or even
against a complete dictionary is not very effective to
enforce good passphrases. <br>
Users will soon figure up ways to bypass such a policy. A
better policy is to educate users on good security behavior
and optionally to run a passphrase cracker regularly <br>
on all users passphrases to catch the very simple ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-passphrase-days n <br>
Ask the user to change the passphrase if n days have passed
since the last change. With --enforce-passphrase-constraints
set the user may not bypass this check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-passphrase-history <br>
This option does nothing yet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pinentry-program filename <br>
Use program filename as the PIN entry. The default is
installation dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pinentry-touch-file filename
<br>
By default the filename of the socket gpg-agent is listening
for requests is passed to Pinentry, so that it can touch
that file before exiting (it does this only in curses <br>
mode). This option changes the file passed to Pinentry to
filename. The special name /dev/null may be used to
completely disable this feature. Note that Pinentry will
<br>
not create that file, it will only change the modification
and access time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--scdaemon-program filename <br>
Use program filename as the Smartcard daemon. The default is
installation dependent and can be shown with the gpgconf
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-scdaemon <br>
Do not make use of the scdaemon tool. This option has the
effect of disabling the ability to do smartcard operations.
Note, that enabling this option at runtime does not <br>
kill an already forked scdaemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--disable-check-own-socket <br>
gpg-agent employs a periodic self-test to detect a stolen
socket. This usually means a second instance of gpg-agent
has taken over the socket and gpg-agent will then ter&acirc;
<br>
minate itself. This option may be used to disable this
self-test for debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-standard-socket</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-use-standard-socket <br>
By enabling this option gpg-agent will listen on the socket
named &acirc;S.gpg-agent&acirc;, located in the home
directory, and not create a random socket below a temporary
directory. <br>
Tools connecting to gpg-agent should first try to connect to
the socket given in environment variable GPG_AGENT_INFO and
then fall back to this socket. This option may <br>
not be used if the home directory is mounted on a remote
file system which does not support special files like fifos
or sockets. Note, that --use-standard-socket is the <br>
default on all systems since GnuPG 2.1. Note, that
--use-standard-socket is the default on Windows systems. The
default may be changed at build time. It is possible to <br>
test at runtime whether the agent has been configured for
use with the standard socket by issuing the command
gpg-agent --use-standard-socket-p which returns success if
<br>
the standard socket option has been enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--display string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ttyname string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ttytype string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lc-ctype string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--lc-messages string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xauthority string <br>
These options are used with the server mode to pass
localization information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-tty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--keep-display <br>
Ignore requests to change the current tty or X window
system&rsquo;s DISPLAY variable respectively. This is useful
to lock the pinentry to pop up at the tty or display you
<br>
started the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--enable-ssh-support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enable the OpenSSH Agent
protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this mode of operation, the
agent does not only implement the gpg-agent protocol, but
also the agent protocol used by OpenSSH (through a separate
socket). Conse&acirc; <br>
quently, it should be possible to use the gpg-agent as a
drop-in replacement for the well known ssh-agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH Keys, which are to be used
through the agent, need to be added to the gpg-agent
initially through the ssh-add utility. When a key is added,
ssh-add will ask for the <br>
password of the provided key file and send the unprotected
key material to the agent; this causes the gpg-agent to ask
for a passphrase, which is to be used for encrypting <br>
the newly received key and storing it in a gpg-agent
specific directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a key has been added to the
gpg-agent this way, the gpg-agent will be ready to use the
key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: in case the gpg-agent
receives a signature request, the user might need to be
prompted for a passphrase, which is necessary for decrypting
the stored key. Since the <br>
ssh-agent protocol does not contain a mechanism for telling
the agent on which display/terminal it is running,
gpg-agent&rsquo;s ssh-support will use the TTY or X display
where <br>
gpg-agent has been started. To switch this display to the
current one, the following command may be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg-connect-agent
updatestartuptty /bye</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although all GnuPG components
try to start the gpg-agent as needed, this is not possible
for the ssh support because ssh does not know about it. Thus
if no GnuPG tool which <br>
accesses the agent has been run, there is no guarantee that
ssh is abale to use gpg-agent for authentication. To fix
this you may start gpg-agent if needed using this simple
<br>
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg-connect-agent /bye</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding the --verbose shows the
progress of starting the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the long options may also be
given in the configuration file after stripping off the two
leading dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The usual way to invoke gpg-agent is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative way is by
replacing ssh-agent with gpg-agent. If for example ssh-agent
is started as part of the Xsession initialization, you may
simply replace ssh-agent by a <br>
script like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exec /usr/local/bin/gpg-agent
--enable-ssh-support --daemon --write-env-file
${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and add something like (for
Bourne shells)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if [ -f
&quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; ]; then <br>
. &quot;${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info&quot; <br>
export GPG_AGENT_INFO <br>
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK <br>
fi</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to your shell initialization
file (e.g. &acirc;~/.bashrc&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
There are a few configuration files needed for the operation
of the agent. By default they may all be found in the
current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gpg-agent.conf <br>
This is the standard configuration file read by gpg-agent on
<br>
startup. It may contain any valid long option; the leading
<br>
two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be
abbreviated. <br>
This file is also read after a SIGHUP however only a few
<br>
options will actually have an effect. This default name may
be <br>
changed on the command line (see: [option --options]). <br>
You should backup this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trustlist.txt <br>
This is the list of trusted keys. You should backup this
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Comment lines, indicated by a
leading hash mark, as well as empty <br>
lines are ignored. To mark a key as trusted you need to
enter its <br>
fingerprint followed by a space and a capital letter S.
Colons <br>
may optionally be used to separate the bytes of a
fingerprint; this <br>
allows to cut and paste the fingerprint from a key listing
output. If <br>
the line is prefixed with a ! the key is explicitly marked
as <br>
not trusted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is an example where two
keys are marked as ultimately trusted <br>
and one as not trusted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before entering a key into this
file, you need to ensure its <br>
authenticity. How to do this depends on your organisation;
your <br>
administrator might have already entered those keys which
are deemed <br>
trustworthy enough into this file. Places where to look for
the <br>
fingerprint of a root certificate are letters received from
the CA or <br>
the website of the CA (after making 100% sure that this is
indeed the <br>
website of that CA). You may want to consider allowing
interactive <br>
updates of this file by using the see: [option
--allow-mark-trusted]. <br>
This is however not as secure as maintaining this file
manually. It is <br>
even advisable to change the permissions to read-only so
that this file <br>
can&rsquo;t be changed inadvertently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a special feature a line
include-default will include a global <br>
list of trusted certificates (e.g.

This global list is also used if the local list is not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to add further
flags after the S for use by the <br>
caller:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relax Relax checking of some
root certificate requirements. As of now this <br>
flag allows the use of root certificates with a missing
basicConstraints <br>
attribute (despite that it is a MUST for CA certificates)
and disables <br>
CRL checking for the root certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cm If validation of a

fails, try again using the chain validation model.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sshcontrol <br>

this file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ssh-add tool may be used to
add new entries to this file; <br>
you may also add them manually. Comment lines, indicated by
a leading <br>

starts with <br>
optional whitespace, followed by the keygrip of the key
given as 40 hex <br>
digits, optionally followed by the caching TTL in seconds
and another <br>
optional field for arbitrary flags. A non-zero TTL overrides
the global <br>
default as set by --default-cache-ttl-ssh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The only flag support is
confirm. If this flag is found for a <br>
key, each use of the key will pop up a pinentry to confirm
the use of <br>
that key. The flag is automatically set if a new key was
loaded into <br>
gpg-agent using the option -c of the ssh-add <br>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keygrip may be prefixed with
a ! to disable an entry entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following example lists
exactly one key. Note that keys available <br>
through a OpenPGP smartcard in the active smartcard reader
are <br>
implicitly added to this list; i.e. there is no need to list
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">private-keys-v1.d/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the directory where
gpg-agent stores the private keys. Each <br>
key is stored in a file with the name made up of the keygrip
and the <br>
suffix &acirc;key&acirc;. You should backup all files in
this directory <br>
and take great care to keep this backup closed away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that on larger
installations, it is useful to put predefined <br>
files into the directory &acirc;/etc/skel/.gnupg/&acirc; so
that newly created <br>
users start up with a working configuration. For existing
users the <br>
a small helper script is provided to create these files
(see: [addgnupghome]).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGNALS <br>
A running gpg-agent may be controlled by signals, i.e. using
the kill command to send a signal to the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a list of supported
signals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGHUP This signal flushes all
cached passphrases and if the program has been started with
a configuration file, the configuration file is read again.
Only certain options are <br>
honored: quiet, verbose, debug, debug-all, debug-level,
no-grab, pinentry-program, default-cache-ttl, max-cache-ttl,
ignore-cache-for-signing, allow-mark-trusted, disable- <br>
scdaemon, and disable-check-own-socket. scdaemon-program is
also supported but due to the current implementation, which
calls the scdaemon only once, it is not of much <br>
use unless you manually kill the scdaemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGTERM <br>
Shuts down the process but waits until all current requests
are fulfilled. If the process has received 3 of these
signals and requests are still pending, a shutdown is <br>
forced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGINT Shuts down the process
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR1 <br>
Dump internal information to the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIGUSR2 <br>
This signal is used for internal purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
gpg2(1), gpgsm(1), gpg-connect-agent(1), scdaemon(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full documentation for this
tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If GnuPG and the
info program are properly installed at your site, the
command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">info gnupg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">should give you access to the
complete manual including a menu structure and an index.</p>
