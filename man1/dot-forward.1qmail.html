<p>dot-forward(1) General Commands Manual
dot-forward(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dot-forward - read a .forward file under qmail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
in ~/.qmail: | dot-forward [ -nN ] file ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OVERVIEW <br>
dot-forward forwards incoming messages according to
sendmail-style instructions in file, if file exists.
Normally file is .forward.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: If you create a .qmail
file to enable dot-forward, make sure to add a second line
specifying delivery to your normal mailbox. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">|dot-forward .forward <br>
./Mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
dot-forward does not support :include: or mbox deliveries.
You can use the delivery mechanism described in dot-qmail(5)
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-N (Default.) Read and forward a message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Parse file and print the
forwarding instructions in it, one per line; do not follow
the instructions. You can use this option from the command
line to see how your .forward <br>
file will be interpreted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dot-forward -n .forward</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE HANDLING <br>
When a message arrives, dot-forward opens file and handles
it as discussed below. It exits 99, so qmail-local will
ignore further instructions in .qmail. Exception: If file
<br>
specifies delivery directly to you, dot-forward exits 0, so
qmail-local will read further instructions in .qmail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file does not exist,
dot-forward exits 0. You can list several files; then
dot-forward will try each one in turn, using the first one
that exists, or exiting 0 if none exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
dot-forward treats an empty file as if it did not exist.
Versions of sendmail before V8 would throw away the incoming
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: If
dot-forward encounters a temporary error opening file, it
exits 111, so that qmail-local will try again later.
sendmail assumes incorrectly that file <br>
does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: file must
be readable by dot-forward, which is normally running as the
user. sendmail places different constraints on its .forward
permissions, since it <br>
is normally running as root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FORWARDING <br>
Normally file contains an address. dot-forward forwards the
message to that address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The address is parsed as if it
were in an RFC 822 message header. Parenthesized comments
and bracketed addresses are permitted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bob (Bob, the postmaster)
@heaven.af.mil</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Addresses with special
characters must be quoted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;spaced out
mailbox&quot;@heaven.af.mil</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Address groups are not
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file can contain any number of
lines, each line containing any number of addresses.
dot-forward forwards the message to each address:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bob, fred, susan <br>
Joe Shmoe &lt;shmoe@heaven.af.mil&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An address without a fully
qualified domain name is handled as described in
qmail-header(5). Exception: Certain addresses without domain
names are handled specially, as <br>
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRECT DELIVERY <br>
If an address does not contain a domain name, and matches
the environment variable $USER (without regard to case), it
specifies delivery directly to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If an address matches
$USER@$HOST (without regard to case), it specifies delivery
directly to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
sendmail&rsquo;s handling of quotes and backslashes violates
RFC 821 and RFC 822, and is not supported by dot-forward.
dot-forward treats joe the same way as <br>
joe. The dot-qmail delivery mechanism lets each user manage
several addresses, so there is no need for a special syntax
to get around forwarding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
If an address does not contain a domain name, and begins
with a vertical bar, dot-forward takes the rest of the
address as a command to run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bob, &quot;|vacation
bob&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dot-forward feeds the message to
the command, preceded by the environment variables $UFLINE,
$RPLINE, and $DTLINE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Internet
addresses can legitimately start with a slash or vertical
bar. dot-forward treats anything with an unquoted @ as an
address. sendmail appears to <br>
have various problems coping with these addresses, and with
commands that contain @ signs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMENTS <br>
Any line in file that begins with # is ignored:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># this is a comment</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMPATIBILITY WARNING: Versions
of sendmail before V8 did not allow comments in .forward
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This is dot-forward 0.71. The dot-forward home page is
http://pobox.com/~djb/dot-forward.html.</p>
