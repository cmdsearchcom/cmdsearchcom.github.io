<p>SINCE(1) User Manuals SINCE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
since - display content of a file since the last time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
since [-aefhlmnqvxz] [-d seconds] [-s file] files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
since is a utility designed to monitor log files. since is
similar to tail(2) as it also displays information appended
to a file. However since only displays the data which has
<br>
been added since the last time since was run. If since is
run on a particular file for the first time, then the entire
file is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
since /var/log/apache/{access,error}_log &gt; /dev/null <br>
lynx --dump http://localhost/ &gt; /dev/null <br>
since /var/log/apache/{access,error}_log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a Make updates to the since state files atomic. This option
configures since to use a temporary file and a rename(2)
instead of updating the state file in situ.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d seconds <br>
Specify the number of integer seconds to wait between
polling files for changes. This option is only relevant in
conjunction with the -f option and if the inotify
mecha&acirc; <br>
nism is not being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Print the header lines to
standard error instead of standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Follow the specified files.
This option is analogous to tail -f as the files are also
polled for changes until the process is interrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a terse help
message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Relaxed mode. If some data
files are inaccessible since will not fail completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Disable mmap(2), use read(2)
instead to access state and data files. Note that for
certain smaller io operations read(2) may be used even if
this option has not been <br>
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Do not update the .since file
which keeps track of file growth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Make the utility operate more
quietly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s filename <br>
Specify the state file explicitly. Using this option will
also disable the use of fallback state files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Increase the verbosity. This
option can be given multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Ignore file arguments which
have compressed extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Discard output. Similar to
redirecting the output to /dev/null, but faster. If used in
conjunction with the -f option, only the initial output will
be discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
.since</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">State file recording the length
of the previously displayed files. The location of the file
can be set on the command line using the -s option. If this
option is not <br>
given, since will check the SINCE environment variable for
the location of the state file. If the SINCE environment
variable has not been set since will use the HOME
envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable and store the information in the file
$HOME/.since. If the HOME variable is not set, since will
use a getpwuid(3) lookup. If all these fail will use the
<br>
file /tmp/since.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
since uses the inode of a file as its key, if that inode is
recycled since will get confused. since is not particularly
efficient when storing or looking up the stat(2)
informa&acirc; <br>
tion. Functionality equivalent to since can probably be
achieved with a number of trivial shell scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYING <br>
since may only be used, distributed and modified in
accordance with the terms of the GPL (GNU General Public
License) version 3 or newer as published by the FSF (Free
Software <br>
Foundation).</p>
