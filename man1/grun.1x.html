<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gRun - X/GTK based application launcher.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gRun [filename] [-v] [--version] [-h] [--help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gRun launches applications in X Windows without the need for
an xterm session at all. gRun provides three methods of
launching applications, entering the command directly into
<br>
the text field, browsing the tree for the application and
running an application specified on the command line. In all
cases gRun exits completely after launching the application
<br>
and the application is left running as a full child of the X
process, as if it were launched from a WM menu. If gRun is
launched from an xterm or shell, the shell will be freed
<br>
for further use after gRun exits. No more wasting an xterm
for the duration of the application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gRun will attempt to complete a
command automatically from the history as it is typed in,
hopefully saving some time. Pressing the Tab key will try to
find an executable file in <br>
the path that starts with the characters already entered
into the entry box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gRun also includes a facility
for checking if the command is in a list of console mode
apps, eg telnet. If it finds the command in the file, gRun
launches a xterm with the com&acirc; <br>
mand as the -e parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gRun now has a facility for
associating file extensions with a command, ala Windows. If
an extension is found, the associated application is
launched with the command entry as <br>
the parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
filename <br>
Application name for command line launching from a xterm.
The filename must exist within either the default path or
have a fully qualified path. Any options passed after <br>
the filename are passed down to the application if not
removed by gtk_init()</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--persist <br>
gRun dialog does not close after launching application</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--notips <br>
Tooltips are not displayed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display the current version number of grun.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display a short usage
guide.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gRun also recognizes all
standard X Windows and GTK options, eg -display and
-geometry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs <br>
None currently known.</p>
