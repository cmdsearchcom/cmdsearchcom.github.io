<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cmcalibrate - fit exponential tails for covariance model
E-value determination</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cmcalibrate [options] cmfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
cmcalibrate determines exponential tail parameters for
E-value determination by generating random sequences,
searching them with the CM and collecting the scores of the
resulting <br>
hits. A histogram of the bit scores of the hits is fit to an
exponential tail, and the parameters of the fitted tail are
saved to the CM file. The exponential tail parameters are
<br>
then used to estimate the statistical significance of hits
found in cmsearch and cmscan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A CM file must be calibrated
with cmcalibrate before it can be used in cmsearch or
cmscan, with a single exception: it is not necessary to
calibrate CM files that include only <br>
models with zero basepairs before running cmsearch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cmcalibrate is very slow. It
takes a couple of hours to calibrate a single average sized
CM on a single CPU. cmcalibrate will run in parallel on all
available cores if Infernal <br>
was built on a system that supports POSIX threading (see the
Installation section of the user guide for more
information). Using &lt;n&gt; cores will result in roughly
&lt;n&gt; -fold accel&acirc; <br>
eration versus a single CPU. MPI (Message Passing Interface)
can be also be used for parallelization with the --mpi
option if Infernal was built with MPI enabled, but using
more <br>
than 161 processors is not recommended because increasing
past 161 won&rsquo;t accelerate the calibration. See the
Installation seciton of the user guide for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --forecast option can be
used to estimate how long the program will take to run for a
given cmfile on the current machine. To predict the running
time on &lt;n&gt; processors with <br>
MPI, additionally use the --nforecast &lt;n&gt; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The random sequences searched in
cmcalibrate are generated by an HMM that was trained on real
genomic sequences with various GC contents. The goal is to
have the GC distributions <br>
in the random sequences be similar to those in actual
genomic sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Four rounds of searches and
subsequent exponential tail fits are performed, one each for
the four different CM algorithms that can be used in
cmsearch and cmscan: glocal CYK, <br>
glocal Inside, local CYK and local Inside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The E-values parameters
determined by cmcalibrate are only used by the cmsearch and
cmscan programs. If you are not going to use these programs
then do not waste time calibrat&acirc; <br>
ing your models.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and
available options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L &lt;x&gt; Set the total
length of random sequences to search to &lt;x&gt; megabases
(Mb). By default, &lt;x&gt; is 1.6 Mb. Increasing &lt;x&gt;
will make the exponential tail fits more precise and E- <br>
values more accurate, but will take longer (doubling
&lt;x&gt; will roughly double the running time). Decreasing
&lt;x&gt; is not recommended as it will make the fits less
precise <br>
and the E-values less accurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS FOR PREDICTING REQUIRED
TIME AND MEMORY <br>
--forecast <br>
Predict the running time of the calibration of cmfile (with
provided options) on the current machine and exit. The
calibration is not performed. The predictions should be <br>
considered rough estimates. If multithreading is enabled
(see Installation section of user guide), the timing will
take into account the number of available cores.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nforecast &lt;n&gt; <br>
With --forecast, specify that &lt;n&gt; processors will be
used for the calibration. This might be useful for
predicting the running time of an MPI run with &lt;n&gt;
processors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--memreq <br>
Predict the amount of required memory for calibrating cmfile
(with provided options) on the current machine and exit. The
calibration is not performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS CONTROLLING EXPONENTIAL
TAIL FITS <br>
--gtailn &lt;x&gt; <br>
fit the exponential tail for glocal Inside and glocal CYK to
the &lt;n&gt; highest scores in the histogram tail, where
&lt;n&gt; is &lt;x&gt; times the number of Mb searched. The
default <br>
value of &lt;x&gt; is 250. The value 250 was chosen because
it works well empirically relative to other values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ltailn &lt;x&gt; <br>
fit the exponential tail for local Inside and local CYK to
the &lt;n&gt; highest scores in the histogram tail, where
&lt;n&gt; is &lt;x&gt; times the number of Mb searched. The
default <br>
value of &lt;x&gt; is 750. The value 750 was chosen because
it works well empirically relative to other values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tailp &lt;x&gt; <br>
Ignore the --gtailn and --ltailn prefixed options and fit
the &lt;x&gt; fraction tail of the histogram to an
exponential tail, for all search modes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONAL OUTPUT FILES <br>
--hfile &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save the histograms fit to file &lt;f&gt;. The format of
this file is two space delimited columns per line. The first
column is the x-axis values of bit scores of each bin. The
<br>
second column is the y-axis values of number of hits per
bin. Each series is delimited by a line with a single
character &quot;&amp;&quot;. The file will contain one
series for each of <br>
the four exponential tail fits in the following order:
glocal CYK, glocal Inside, local CYK, and local Inside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sfile &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save survival plot information to file &lt;f&gt;. The format
of this file is two space delimited columns per line. The
first column is the x-axis values of bit scores of each <br>
bin. The second column is the y-axis values of fraction of
hits that meet or exceed the score for each bin. Each series
is delimited by a line with a single character
&quot;&amp;&quot;. <br>
The file will contain three series of data for each of the
four CM search modes in the following order: glocal CYK,
glocal Inside, local CYK, and local Inside. The first <br>
series is the empirical survival plot from the histogram of
hits to the random sequence. The second series is the
exponential tail fit to the empirical distribution. The <br>
third series is the exponential tail fit if lambda were
fixed and set as the natural log of 2 (0.691314718).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--qqfile &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save quantile-quantile plot information to file &lt;f&gt;.
The format of this file is two space delimited columns per
line. The first column is the x-axis values, and the
sec&acirc; <br>
ond column is the y-axis values. The distance of the points
from the identity line (y=x) is a measure of how good the
exponential tail fit is, the closer the points are to <br>
the identity line, the better the fit is. Each series is
delimited by a line with a single character
&quot;&amp;&quot;. The file will contain one series of
empirical data for each of <br>
the four exponential tail fits in the following order:
glocal CYK, glocal Inside, local CYK and local Inside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ffile &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save space delimited statistics of different exponential
tail fits to file &lt;f&gt;. The file will contain the
lambda and mu values for exponential tails fit to histogram
<br>
tails of different sizes. The fields in the file are
labelled informatively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--xfile &lt;f&gt; <br>
Save a list of the scores in each fit histogram tail to file
&lt;f&gt;. Each line of this file will have a different
score indicating one hit existed in the tail with that <br>
score. Each series is delimited by a line with a single
character &quot;&amp;&quot;. The file will contain one
series for each of the four exponential tail fits in the
following order: <br>
glocal CYK, glocal Inside, local CYK, and local Inside.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
--seed &lt;n&gt; <br>
Seed the random number generator with &lt;n&gt;, an integer
&gt;= 0. If &lt;n&gt; is nonzero, stochastic simulations
will be reproducible; the same command will give the same
results. <br>
If &lt;n&gt; is 0, the random number generator is seeded
arbitrarily, and stochastic simulations will vary from run
to run of the same command. The default seed is 181.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--beta &lt;x&gt; <br>
By default query-dependent banding (QDB) is used to
accelerate the CM search algorithms with a beta tail loss
probability of 1E-15. This beta value can be changed to
&lt;x&gt; <br>
with --beta &lt;x&gt;. The beta parameter is the amount of
probability mass excluded during band calculation, higher
values of beta give greater speedups but sacrifice more <br>
accuracy than lower values. The default value used is 1E-15.
(For more information on QDB see Nawrocki and Eddy, PLoS
Computational Biology 3(3): e56.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nonbanded <br>
Turn off QDB during E-value calibration. This will slow down
calibration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nonull3 <br>
Turn off the null3 post hoc additional null model. This is
not recommended unless you plan on using the same option to
cmsearch and/or cmscan.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--random <br>
Use the background null model of the CM to generate the
random sequences, instead of the more realistic HMM. Unless
the CM was built using the --null option to cmbuild, <br>
the background null model will be 25% each A, C, G and
U.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gc &lt;f&gt; <br>
Generate the random sequences using the nucleotide
distribution from the sequence file &lt;f&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cpu &lt;n&gt; <br>
Specify that &lt;n&gt; parallel CPU workers be used. If
&lt;n&gt; is set as &quot;0&quot;, then the program will be
run in serial mode, without using threads. You can also
control this number <br>
by setting an environment variable, INFERNAL_NCPU. This
option will only be available if the machine on which
Infernal was built is capable of using POSIX threading (see
<br>
the Installation section of the user guide for more
information).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mpi Run as an MPI parallel
program. This option will only be available if Infernal has
been configured and built with the &quot;--enable-mpi&quot;
flag (see the Installation section of <br>
the user guide for more information).</p>
