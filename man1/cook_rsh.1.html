cook_rsh - load balancing rsh

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <i>cook_rsh</i> program is a wrapper around <i>rsh</i>(1) which does simple
  load balancing. It obtains its load information by running the <i>rup</i>(1)
  command, and selects the most suitable host hased on the architecture you
  specify, and the least load of all hosts of that architecture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first command line argument is the architecture name which is used to get
  the list of possible hosts. From that list the <i>rup</i>(1) command is run to
  determine the host with the lowest load, which is in turn used as the first
  argument of the eventual <i>rsh</i>(1) command.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COOKBOOKS"><a class="selflink" href="#COOKBOOKS">COOKBOOKS</a></h1>
In order to make use of this program, somewhere in your cookbook, you need to
  add a line which reads
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">parallel_rsh = &quot;cook_rsh&quot;;</div>
If the host chosen is the same as the caller (build host) then this program just
  exec the command skipping the rsh. So it costs nothing to use this in a one
  machine network!
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each recipe you want distributed to a remote host, you need to add a
  host-binding attribute to. Typical usage is where you have a muti-architecture
  build.
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">%1/%0%.o: %0%.c
<br/>
 host-binding %1 {
<br/>
 cc -o [target] -c [resolve %0%.c]; }</div>
In the recipe given here, each architecture has its object files placed into a
  separate architecture-specific directory tree. The architecture name (%1) is
  used in the host-binding, so that the compiles may be load-balanced to all
  machines of that architecture.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you need a command to run on a specific host (say, because that's where a
  specific application license resides), then simply use the host name in the
  host-binding attribute, rather than an architecture name.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEFINING_THE_CLASSES"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFINING_THE_CLASSES">DEFINING
  THE CLASSES</a></h1>
The <i>/host_lists.pl</i> file is expected to exist, and to contain variable
  definitions used to determine if hosts are members of particular
  architectures.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>/host_lists.pl</i> file defines a perl HOL &quot;hash of lists&quot; The
  hash is %ArchNames and it maps names of architectures as user want to see
  them, to list references as the actual lists are stored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The names of each architecture could be any form you wish but the convention is
  to use the GNUish names such as &quot;sparc-sun-solaris2.8&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each architecture, define one or more lists of machines according to what
  function each machine set may do. This can be as simple or as elaborate as
  required. The form of the list variable name can be any valid perl identifier
  but may as well be like the architecture name with dash changed to underbar
  and dot removed, and the type added. For example one might define solaris
  hosts as:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">@sparc_sun_solaris28_hosts = (
<br/>
 &quot;mickey&quot;, &quot;minny&quot;, &quot;scrooge&quot; );</div>
And linux hosts as:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">@i386_linux22_hosts = (
<br/>
 &quot;goofy&quot;, &quot;scrooge&quot; );</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is a need to define different sets of machines for different types of
  jobs then add a suffix to the names in the <i> host-binding</i> directive on
  each of the recipes, and lists here with the same suffix.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The hash to map argument names to lists is defined like:
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">%ArchNames = (
<br/>
 &quot;sparc-solaris2.8&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,
<br/>
 &quot;i586-unknown-linux22&quot;, =&gt; @i386_linux22_hosts, );</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course if users have differing opinions as to what the architecture names
  should look like, you can define &quot;alias&quot; mappings as well.
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 &quot;sun4-SunOS-5.8&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,</div>
Or maybe the level is of no importance, then define
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 &quot;sparc-solaris&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,
<br/>
 &quot;sparc-solaris2.7&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,</div>
Also, this list isn't allowed to be empty.
<div class="Pp"></div>
And finally, curtesy of Perl, the last line of the file must read
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">1; for obscure and magical reasons.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYSLOG_LOGGING"><a class="selflink" href="#SYSLOG_LOGGING">SYSLOG
  LOGGING</a></h1>
Typical commands seen during a build would look like
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">sh -c 'cd /aegis/dd/gumby2.2.C079 &amp;&amp; \
  sh -ce /aegis/dd/gumby2.2.C079/.6.1; \ echo $? &gt;
  /aegis/dd/gumby2.2.C079/.6.2'</div>
So we can extract the project/ change from the command quite easily and logging
  it via syslog would be a trivial addition.
