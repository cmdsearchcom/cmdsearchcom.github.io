<p>cook_rsh(1) General Commands Manual cook_rsh(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cook_rsh - load balancing rsh</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cook_rsh [ option... ] architecture command [ argument... ]
<br>
cook_rsh -Help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The cook_rsh program is a wrapper around rsh(1) which does
simple load balancing. It obtains its load information by
running the rup(1) command, and selects the most suitable
<br>
host hased on the architecture you specify, and the least
load of all hosts of that architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first command line argument
is the architecture name which is used to get the list of
possible hosts. From that list the rup(1) command is run to
determine the host with the <br>
lowest load, which is in turn used as the first argument of
the eventual rsh(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COOKBOOKS <br>
In order to make use of this program, somewhere in your
cookbook, you need to add a line which reads <br>
parallel_rsh = &quot;cook_rsh&quot;; <br>
If the host chosen is the same as the caller (build host)
then this program just exec the command skipping the rsh. So
it costs nothing to use this in a one machine network!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each recipe you want
distributed to a remote host, you need to add a host-binding
attribute to. Typical usage is where you have a
muti-architecture build. <br>
%1/%0%.o: %0%.c <br>
host-binding %1 { <br>
cc -o [target] -c [resolve %0%.c]; } <br>
In the recipe given here, each architecture has its object
files placed into a separate architecture-specific directory
tree. The architecture name (%1) is used in the host- <br>
binding, so that the compiles may be load-balanced to all
machines of that architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need a command to run on
a specific host (say, because that&rsquo;s where a specific
application license resides), then simply use the host name
in the host-binding attribute, <br>
rather than an architecture name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINING THE CLASSES <br>
The /host_lists.pl file is expected to exist, and to contain
variable definitions used to determine if hosts are members
of particular architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The /host_lists.pl file defines
a perl HOL &quot;hash of lists&quot; The hash is %ArchNames
and it maps names of architectures as user want to see them,
to list references as the actual <br>
lists are stored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The names of each architecture
could be any form you wish but the convention is to use the
GNUish names such as &quot;sparc-sun-solaris2.8&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each architecture, define
one or more lists of machines according to what function
each machine set may do. This can be as simple or as
elaborate as required. The form of <br>
the list variable name can be any valid perl identifier but
may as well be like the architecture name with dash changed
to underbar and dot removed, and the type added. For <br>
example one might define solaris hosts as: <br>
@sparc_sun_solaris28_hosts = ( <br>
&quot;mickey&quot;, &quot;minny&quot;, &quot;scrooge&quot;
); <br>
And linux hosts as: <br>
@i386_linux22_hosts = ( <br>
&quot;goofy&quot;, &quot;scrooge&quot; );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is a need to define
different sets of machines for different types of jobs then
add a suffix to the names in the host-binding directive on
each of the recipes, and <br>
lists here with the same suffix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hash to map argument names
to lists is defined like: <br>
%ArchNames = ( <br>
&quot;sparc-solaris2.8&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,
<br>
&quot;i586-unknown-linux22&quot;, =&gt; @i386_linux22_hosts,
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course if users have
differing opinions as to what the architecture names should
look like, you can define &quot;alias&quot; mappings as
well. <br>
&quot;sun4-SunOS-5.8&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,
<br>
Or maybe the level is of no importance, then define <br>
&quot;sparc-solaris&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,
<br>
&quot;sparc-solaris2.7&quot;, =&gt; @sparc_solaris28_hosts,
<br>
Also, this list isn&rsquo;t allowed to be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And finally, curtesy of Perl,
the last line of the file must read <br>
1; for obscure and magical reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYSLOG LOGGING <br>
Typical commands seen during a build would look like <br>
sh -c &rsquo;cd /aegis/dd/gumby2.2.C079 &amp;&amp; &nbsp;sh
-ce /aegis/dd/gumby2.2.C079/.6.1; &nbsp;echo $? &gt;
/aegis/dd/gumby2.2.C079/.6.2&rsquo; <br>
So we can extract the project/ change from the command quite
easily and logging it via syslog would be a trivial
addition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This command is not usually given any options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Help - show usage info</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vP Verbose - report choice</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tn Trace value for testing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/exclude.hosts <br>
This file is used to list those host which must not be used
by this script. Simply list excuded hosts, one hostname per
line. If the file is absent, all hosts reported <br>
by rup(1) may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/host_lists.pl <br>
This file defines the classes of hosts for each
architecture.</p>
