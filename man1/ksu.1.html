<p>KSU(1) MIT Kerberos KSU(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ksu - Kerberized super-user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ksu [ target_user ] [ -n target_principal_name ] [ -c
source_cache_name ] [ -k ] [ -r time ] [ -pf ] [ -l lifetime
] [ -z | Z ] [ -q ] [ -e command [ args ... ] ] [ -a [ args
<br>
... ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENTS <br>
Must have Kerberos version 5 installed to compile ksu. Must
have a Kerberos version 5 server running to use ksu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ksu is a Kerberized version of the su program that has two
missions: one is to securely change the real and effective
user ID to that of the target user, and the other is to
cre&acirc; <br>
ate a new security context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: <br>
For the sake of clarity, all references to and attributes of
the user invoking the program will start with
&quot;source&quot; (e.g., &quot;source user&quot;,
&quot;source cache&quot;, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, all references to and
attributes of the target account will start with
&quot;target&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHENTICATION <br>
To fulfill the first mission, ksu operates in two phases:
authentication and authorization. Resolving the target
principal name is the first step in authentication. The user
<br>
can either specify his principal name with the -n option
(e.g., -n jqpublic@USC.EDU) or a default principal name will
be assigned using a heuristic described in the OPTIONS
sec&acirc; <br>
tion (see -n option). The target user name must be the first
argument to ksu; if not specified root is the default. If .
is specified then the target user will be the source <br>
user (e.g., ksu .). If the source user is root or the target
user is the source user, no authentication or authorization
takes place. Otherwise, ksu looks for an appropriate <br>
Kerberos ticket in the source cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ticket can either be for the
end-server or a ticket granting ticket (TGT) for the target
principal&rsquo;s realm. If the ticket for the end-server is
already in the cache, it&rsquo;s <br>
decrypted and verified. If it&rsquo;s not in the cache but
the TGT is, the TGT is used to obtain the ticket for the
end-server. The end-server ticket is then verified. If
neither <br>
ticket is in the cache, but ksu is compiled with the
GET_TGT_VIA_PASSWD define, the user will be prompted for a
Kerberos password which will then be used to get a TGT. If
the <br>
user is logged in remotely and does not have a secure
channel, the password may be exposed. If neither ticket is
in the cache and GET_TGT_VIA_PASSWD is not defined,
authentica&acirc; <br>
tion fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORIZATION <br>
This section describes authorization of the source user when
ksu is invoked without the -e option. For a description of
the -e option, see the OPTIONS section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upon successful authentication,
ksu checks whether the target principal is authorized to
access the target account. In the target user&rsquo;s home
directory, ksu attempts to access <br>
two authorization files: .k5login(5) and .k5users. In the
.k5login file each line contains the name of a principal
that is authorized to access the account.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jqpublic@USC.EDU <br>
jqpublic/secure@USC.EDU <br>
jqpublic/admin@USC.EDU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of .k5users is the
same, except the principal name may be followed by a list of
commands that the principal is authorized to execute (see
the -e option in the OPTIONS <br>
section for details).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus if the target principal
name is found in the .k5login file the source user is
authorized to access the target account. Otherwise ksu looks
in the .k5users file. If the <br>
target principal name is found without any trailing commands
or followed only by * then the source user is authorized. If
either .k5login or .k5users exist but an appropriate <br>
entry for the target principal does not exist then access is
denied. If neither file exists then the principal will be
granted access to the account according to the <br>
aname-&gt;lname mapping rules. Otherwise, authorization
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXECUTION OF THE TARGET SHELL
<br>
Upon successful authentication and authorization, ksu
proceeds in a similar fashion to su. The environment is
unmodified with the exception of USER, HOME and SHELL
variables. <br>
If the target user is not root, USER gets set to the target
user name. Otherwise USER remains unchanged. Both HOME and
SHELL are set to the target login&rsquo;s default values. In
<br>
addition, the environment variable KRB5CCNAME gets set to
the name of the target cache. The real and effective user ID
are changed to that of the target user. The target
user&rsquo;s <br>
shell is then invoked (the shell name is specified in the
password file). Upon termination of the shell, ksu deletes
the target cache (unless ksu is invoked with the -k option).
<br>
This is implemented by first doing a fork and then an exec,
instead of just exec, as done by su.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREATING A NEW SECURITY CONTEXT
<br>
ksu can be used to create a new security context for the
target program (either the target shell, or command
specified via the -e option). The target program inherits a
set of <br>
credentials from the source user. By default, this set
includes all of the credentials in the source cache plus any
additional credentials obtained during authentication. The
<br>
source user is able to limit the credentials in this set by
using -z or -Z option. -z restricts the copy of tickets from
the source cache to the target cache to only the tickets
<br>
where client == the target principal name. The -Z option
provides the target user with a fresh target cache (no creds
in the cache). Note that for security reasons, when the <br>
source user is root and target user is non-root, -z option
is the default mode of operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While no authentication takes
place if the source user is root or is the same as the
target user, additional tickets can still be obtained for
the target cache. If -n is speci&acirc; <br>
fied and no credentials can be copied to the target cache,
the source user is prompted for a Kerberos password (unless
-Z specified or GET_TGT_VIA_PASSWD is undefined). If
suc&acirc; <br>
cessful, a TGT is obtained from the Kerberos server and
stored in the target cache. Otherwise, if a password is not
provided (user hit return) ksu continues in a normal mode of
<br>
operation (the target cache will not contain the desired
TGT). If the wrong password is typed in, ksu fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: <br>
During authentication, only the tickets that could be
obtained without providing a password are cached in in the
source cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-n target_principal_name <br>
Specify a Kerberos target principal name. Used in
authentication and authorization phases of ksu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If ksu is invoked without -n, a
default principal name is assigned via the following
heuristic:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Case 1: source
user is non-root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the target user is the source
user the default principal name is set to the default
principal of the source cache. If the cache does not exist
then the default prin&acirc; <br>
cipal name is set to target_user@local_realm. If the source
and target users are different and neither
~target_user/.k5users nor ~target_user/.k5login exist then
the <br>
default principal name is
target_user_login_name@local_realm. Otherwise, starting with
the first principal listed below, ksu checks if the
principal is authorized to <br>
access the target account and whether there is a legitimate
ticket for that principal in the source cache. If both
conditions are met that principal becomes the default <br>
target principal, otherwise go to the next principal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a. default principal of the
source cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b. target_user@local_realm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c. source_user@local_realm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a-c fails try any principal
for which there is a ticket in the source cache and that is
authorized to access the target account. If that fails
select the first prin&acirc; <br>
cipal that is authorized to access the target account from
the above list. If none are authorized and ksu is configured
with PRINC_LOOK_AHEAD turned on, select the <br>
default principal as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each candidate in the above
list, select an authorized principal that has the same realm
name and first part of the principal name equal to the
prefix of the candi&acirc; <br>
date. For example if candidate a) is jqpublic@ISI.EDU and
jqpublic/secure@ISI.EDU is authorized to access the target
account then the default principal is set to jqpub&acirc;
<br>
lic/secure@ISI.EDU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Case 2: source
user is root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the target user is non-root
then the default principal name is target_user@local_realm.
Else, if the source cache exists the default principal name
is set to the <br>
default principal of the source cache. If the source cache
does not exist, default principal name is set to
root@local_realm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c source_cache_name <br>
Specify source cache name (e.g., -c FILE:/tmp/my_cache). If
-c option is not used then the name is obtained from
KRB5CCNAME environment variable. If KRB5CCNAME is not <br>
defined the source cache name is set to krb5cc_&lt;source
uid&gt;. The target cache name is automatically set to
krb5cc_&lt;target uid&gt;.(gen_sym()), where gen_sym
generates a new num&acirc; <br>
ber such that the resulting cache does not already exist.
For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">krb5cc_1984.2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Do not delete the target
cache upon termination of the target shell or a command (-e
command). Without -k, ksu deletes the target cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Restrict the copy of tickets
from the source cache to the target cache to only the
tickets where client == the target principal name. Use the
-n option if you want the <br>
tickets for other then the default principal. Note that the
-z option is mutually exclusive with the -Z option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Don&rsquo;t copy any tickets
from the source cache to the target cache. Just create a
fresh target cache, where the default principal name of the
cache is initialized to the <br>
target principal name. Note that the -Z option is mutually
exclusive with the -z option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Suppress the printing of
status messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ticket granting ticket
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lifetime -r time -pf <br>
The ticket granting ticket options only apply to the case
where there are no appropriate tickets in the cache to
authenticate the source user. In this case if ksu is
con&acirc; <br>
figured to prompt users for a Kerberos password
(GET_TGT_VIA_PASSWD is defined), the ticket granting ticket
options that are specified will be used when getting a
ticket <br>
granting ticket from the Kerberos server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lifetime <br>
(duration string.) Specifies the lifetime to be requested
for the ticket; if this option is not specified, the default
ticket lifetime (12 hours) is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r time <br>
(duration string.) Specifies that the renewable option
should be requested for the ticket, and specifies the
desired total lifetime of the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p specifies that the proxiable
option should be requested for the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f option specifies that the
forwardable option should be requested for the ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e command [args ...] <br>
ksu proceeds exactly the same as if it was invoked without
the -e option, except instead of executing the target shell,
ksu executes the specified command. Example of <br>
usage:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ksu bob -e ls -lag</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The authorization algorithm for
-e is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source user is root or
source user == target user, no authorization takes place and
the command is executed. If source user id != 0, and
~target_user/.k5users file <br>
does not exist, authorization fails. Otherwise,
~target_user/.k5users file must have an appropriate entry
for target principal to get authorized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .k5users file format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A single principal entry on each
line that may be followed by a list of commands that the
principal is authorized to execute. A principal name
followed by a * means that <br>
the user is authorized to execute any command. Thus, in the
following example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jqpublic@USC.EDU ls mail
/local/kerberos/klist <br>
jqpublic/secure@USC.EDU * <br>
jqpublic/admin@USC.EDU</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">jqpublic@USC.EDU is only
authorized to execute ls, mail and klist commands.
jqpublic/secure@USC.EDU is authorized to execute any
command. jqpublic/admin@USC.EDU is not <br>
authorized to execute any command. Note, that
jqpublic/admin@USC.EDU is authorized to execute the target
shell (regular ksu, without the -e option) but
jqpublic@USC.EDU <br>
is not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The commands listed after the
principal name must be either a full path names or just the
program name. In the second case, CMD_PATH specifying the
location of authorized <br>
programs must be defined at the compilation time of ksu.
Which command gets executed?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the source user is root or
the target user is the source user or the user is authorized
to execute any command (* entry) then command can be either
a full or a relative <br>
path leading to the target program. Otherwise, the user must
specify either a full path or just the program name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a args <br>
Specify arguments to be passed to the target shell. Note
that all flags and parameters following -a will be passed to
the shell, thus all options intended for ksu must <br>
precede -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -a option can be used to
simulate the -e option if used as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a -c [command [arguments]].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c is interpreted by the c-shell
to execute the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS <br>
ksu can be compiled with the following four flags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GET_TGT_VIA_PASSWD <br>
In case no appropriate tickets are found in the source
cache, the user will be prompted for a Kerberos password.
The password is then used to get a ticket granting ticket
<br>
from the Kerberos server. The danger of configuring ksu with
this macro is if the source user is logged in remotely and
does not have a secure channel, the password may <br>
get exposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PRINC_LOOK_AHEAD <br>
During the resolution of the default principal name,
PRINC_LOOK_AHEAD enables ksu to find principal names in the
.k5users file as described in the OPTIONS section (see -n
<br>
option).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CMD_PATH <br>
Specifies a list of directories containing programs that
users are authorized to execute (via .k5users file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HAVE_GETUSERSHELL <br>
If the source user is non-root, ksu insists that the target
user&rsquo;s shell to be invoked is a &quot;legal
shell&quot;. getusershell(3) is called to obtain the names
of &quot;legal <br>
shells&quot;. Note that the target user&rsquo;s shell is
obtained from the passwd file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sample configuration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KSU_OPTS = -DGET_TGT_VIA_PASSWD
-DPRINC_LOOK_AHEAD -DCMD_PATH=&rsquo;&quot;/bin /usr/ucb
/local/bin&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ksu should be owned by root and
have the set user id bit turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ksu attempts to get a ticket for
the end server just as Kerberized telnet and rlogin. Thus,
there must be an entry for the server in the Kerberos
database (e.g., <br>
host/nii.isi.edu@ISI.EDU). The keytab file must be in an
appropriate location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SIDE EFFECTS <br>
ksu deletes all expired tickets from the source cache.</p>
