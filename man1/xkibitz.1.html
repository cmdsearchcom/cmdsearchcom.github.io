<p>XKIBITZ(1) General Commands Manual XKIBITZ(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
xkibitz - allow multiple people to interact in an xterm</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
xkibitz [ xkibitz-args ] [ program program-args... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
xkibitz allows users in separate xterms to share one shell
(or any program that runs in an xterm). Uses include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A novice user
can ask an expert user for help. Using xkibitz, the expert
can see what the user is doing, and offer advice or show how
to do it right.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; By running
xkibitz and then starting a full-screen editor, people may
carry out a conversation, retaining the ability to scroll
backwards, save the entire conversa&acirc; <br>
tion, or even edit it while in progress.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; People can team
up on games, document editing, or other cooperative tasks
where each person has strengths and weaknesses that
complement one another.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If you want to
have a large number of people do an on-line code
walk-through, you can sit two in front of each workstation,
and then connect them all together while <br>
you everyone looks at code together in the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
To start xkibitz, one user (the master) runs xkibitz with no
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xkibitz starts a new shell (or
another program, if given on the command line). The user can
interact normally with the shell, or upon entering an escape
(described when xkibitz <br>
starts) can add users to the interaction.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add users, enter &quot;+
display&quot; where display is the X display name. If there
is no &quot;:X.Y&quot; in the display name, &quot;:0.0&quot;
is assumed. The master user must have permission to <br>
access each display. Each display is assigned a tag - a
small integer which can be used to reference the
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To show the current tags and
displays, enter &quot;=&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To drop a display, enter &quot;-
tag&quot; where tag is the display&rsquo;s tag according to
the &quot;=&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To return to the shared shell,
enter &quot;return&quot;. Then the keystrokes of all users
become the input of the shell. Similarly, all users receive
the output from the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To terminate xkibitz it suffices
to terminate the shell itself. For example, if any user
types ^D (and the shell accepts this to be EOF), the shell
terminates followed by xkib&acirc; <br>
itz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally, all characters are
passed uninterpreted. However, in the escape dialogue the
user talks directly to the xkibitz interpreter. Any
Expect(1) or Tcl(3) commands may also <br>
be given. Also, job control may be used while in the
interpreter, to, for example, suspend or restart
xkibitz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various processes can produce
various effects. For example, you can emulate a multi-way
write(1) session with the command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xkibitz sleep 1000000</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ARGUMENTS <br>
xkibitz understands a few special arguments which should
appear before the program name (if given). Each argument
should be separated by whitespace. If the arguments
themselves <br>
takes arguments, these should also be separated by
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-escape sets the escape
character. The default escape character is ^].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display adds a display much
like the &quot;+&quot; command. Multiple -display flags can
be given. For example, to start up xkibitz with three
additional displays:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">xkibitz -display mercury
-display fox -display dragon:1.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
Due to limitations in both X and UNIX, resize propagation is
weak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the master user resizes the
xterm, all the other xterms are logically resized.
Unfortunately, xkibitz cannot force the physical xterm size
to correspond with the logical <br>
xterm sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other users are free to
resize their xterm but their sizes are not propagated. The
master can check the logical sizes with the &quot;=&quot;
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deducing the window size is a
non-portable operation. The code is known to work for recent
versions of SunOS, AIX, Unicos, and HPUX. Send back mods if
you add support for any&acirc; <br>
thing else.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
The environment variable SHELL is used to determine and
start a shell, if no other program is given on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
DISPLAY is defined, its value is used for the display name
of the xkibitz master (the display with tag number 0).
Otherwise this name remains empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional arguments may be
passed to new xterms through the environment variable
XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS. For example, to create xterms with a
scrollbar and a green pointer cursor:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS=&quot;-sb -ms
green&quot; <br>
export XKIBITZ_XTERM_ARGS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(this is for the Bourne shell -
use whatever syntax is appropriate for your favorite shell).
Any option can be given that is valid for the xterm command,
with the exception of <br>
-display, -geometry and -S as those are set by xkibitz.</p>
