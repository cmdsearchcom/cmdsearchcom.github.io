<p>CTHUMB(1) General Commands Manual CTHUMB(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cthumb - a themable web picture album generator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
cthumb -c [options] imagefile ... &gt; file.album</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cthumb [options] file.album</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Cthumb creates themable web picture albums with thumbnails
of all the pictures, comments for each picture, etc. Cthumb
allows you to create web picture albums, i.e. collections
<br>
of digital pictures, with small thumbnails of your pictures
and with captions. In addition, it allows you to have
several views of the collection of pictures. An album is
com&acirc; <br>
posed of a series of pages, each composed of a collection of
pictures. For each album page may optionally have two or
more versions, like for instance in English, Spanish,
Ger&acirc; <br>
man, French, etc. So your visitors would go into the English
version of the web album, into the Spanish version, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically (this is what I use it
for and why I wrote the program), you accumulate lots and
lots of digital pictures and you need to label them and sort
them out. Perhaps also you <br>
have friends and family that speak different languages. This
program lets you very easily make picture albums and have
the same pictures labeled in one or more languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can customize almost
everything in the way the albums look on the screen, from
the size of the thumbnails to the background and foreground
colors, the border colors, whether <br>
you want film-strips and their picture, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERATION <br>
Cthumb has two modes of operation. The first one, which is
active when option -c is specified, prints an album file,
via stdout, comprising all the images given as arguments to
<br>
the command line. This is the first thing you need to do if
you have never tried this program before, just to get you
started. Once you have an album file, you edit it and put
<br>
comments to the pictures, titles to the album pages, etc. In
this mode, all the provided options in the command line will
be passed through to the album file. See the format of <br>
the album file in section ALBUM FILES below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second mode is the regular
mode, the one that actually creates web pages, given the
album file, so it is the one that does the real work of the
script. Given an album file, <br>
cthumb generates web pages containing picture albums and an
index with links to all the albums generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cthumb creates several HTML
files, one per &quot;Page&quot; in the album.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check the README file (probably
in /usr/share/doc/cthumb/README) for more detailed info.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c &lt;files&gt; Create an album file with the files listed
and spit it out in standard out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l &lt;n&gt; Do pages in
&lt;n&gt; languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;n&gt; Go into film mode
(&lt;n&gt; thumbnails per row).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Force re-generation of all
thumbnails (slow).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x &lt;n&gt; Make thumbnail
width &lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y &lt;n&gt; Make thumbnail
height &lt;n&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n In film mode, don&rsquo;t
generate the strips.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Don&rsquo;t generate a main
index file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Generate text captions under
the thumbnails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Check the thumbnail
width/height from the thumbnail image itself. This is
slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Put the bytes of the main
picture in the caption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
By default cthumb creates the following files (foo being the
name of the album file):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo-index.html The table of
contents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALBUM FILES <br>
Album files have a simple, textual format. First, comments
in the file are started by the # character and last to the
end of the line. The best way to find out the format is to
<br>
use the -c &lt;files&gt; option for album creation mode,
which outputs an album file in stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PER-USER VARIABLES <br>
cthumb allows users to have their own variable settings in
$HOME/.cthumbrc which is read and interpreted by perl. If
perl cannot parse the file, cthumb will complain rather
dryly <br>
that there is a parse error in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERSION <br>
This is cthumb version 4.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The latest version of cthumb can
be found at this URL:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Option -r regenerates all thumbnails as the program sees
them, i.e. one per language. If a picture is listed twice in
the album, it will be generated double the amount of times.
<br>
If you have a lot of thumbnails, this can get lengthy. A
workaround is to delete the thumbnails you want re-generated
and run cthumb without the -r option.</p>
