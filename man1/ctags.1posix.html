<p>CTAGS(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
CTAGS(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ctags &acirc; create a tags file (DEVELOPMENT, FORTRAN)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ctags [&acirc;a] [&acirc;f tagsfile] pathname...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctags &acirc;x pathname...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The ctags utility shall be provided on systems that support
the the Software Development Utilities option, and either or
both of the C-Language Development Utilities option and <br>
FORTRAN Development Utilities option. On other systems, it
is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ctags utility shall write a
tagsfile or an index of objects from C-language or FORTRAN
source files specified by the pathname operands. The
tagsfile shall list the locators <br>
of language-specific objects within the source files. A
locator consists of a name, pathname, and either a search
pattern or a line number that can be used in searching for
the <br>
object definition. The objects that shall be recognized are
specified in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The ctags utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options shall be
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;a Append to tagsfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;f tagsfile <br>
Write the object locator lists into tagsfile instead of the
default file named tags in the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;x Produce a list of
object names, the line number, and filename in which each is
defined, as well as the text of that line, and write this to
the standard output. A tags&acirc; <br>
file shall not be created when &acirc;x is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
The following pathname operands are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.c Files with basenames
ending with the .c suffix shall be treated as C-language
source code. Such files that are not valid input to c99
produce unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.h Files with basenames
ending with the .h suffix shall be treated as C-language
source code. Such files that are not valid input to c99
produce unspecified results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.f Files with basenames
ending with the .f suffix shall be treated as
FORTRAN-language source code. Such files that are not valid
input to fort77 produce unspecified <br>
results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The handling of other files is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDIN <br>
See the INPUT FILES section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INPUT FILES <br>
The input files shall be text files containing source code
in the language indicated by the operand filename
suffixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables shall affect the
execution of ctags:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LANG Provide a default value for
the internationalization variables that are unset or null.
(See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008,
Section 8.2, Internationaliza&acirc; <br>
tion Variables for the precedence of internationalization
variables used to determine the values of locale
categories.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL If set to a non-empty
string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_COLLATE <br>
Determine the order in which output is sorted for the
&acirc;x option. The POSIX locale determines the order in
which the tagsfile is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_CTYPE Determine the locale
for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments <br>
and input files). When processing C-language source code, if
the locale is not compatible with the C locale described by
the ISO C standard, the results are unspeci&acirc; <br>
fied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_MESSAGES <br>
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NLSPATH Determine the location
of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDOUT <br>
The list of object name information produced by the &acirc;x
option shall be written to standard output in the following
format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s %d %s %s&quot;,
&lt;object-name&gt;, &lt;line-number&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;,
&lt;text&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;text&gt; is the text
of line &lt;line-number&gt; of file &lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STDERR <br>
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FILES <br>
When the &acirc;x option is not specified, the format of the
output file shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s/%s/0,
&lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;pattern&gt; is a
search pattern that could be used by an editor to find the
defining instance of &lt;identifier&gt; in &lt;filename&gt;
(where defining instance is indicated by the dec&acirc; <br>
larations listed in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An optional &lt;circumflex&gt;
(&rsquo;^&rsquo;) can be added as a prefix to
&lt;pattern&gt;, and an optional &lt;dollar-sign&gt; can be
appended to &lt;pattern&gt; to indicate that the pattern is
anchored to the <br>
beginning (end) of a line of text. Any &lt;slash&gt; or
&lt;backslash&gt; characters in &lt;pattern&gt; shall be
preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt; character. The anchoring
&lt;circumflex&gt;, &lt;dollar-sign&gt;, and <br>
escaping &lt;backslash&gt; characters shall not be
considered part of the search pattern. All other characters
in the search pattern shall be considered literal
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An alternative format is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s?%s?0,
&lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is identical to the first
format except that &lt;slash&gt; characters in
&lt;pattern&gt; shall not be preceded by escaping
&lt;backslash&gt; characters, and &lt;question-mark&gt;
characters in <br>
&lt;pattern&gt; shall be preceded by &lt;backslash&gt;
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A second alternative format
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s%s%d0,
&lt;identifier&gt;, &lt;filename&gt;, &lt;lineno&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;lineno&gt; is a
decimal line number that could be used by an editor to find
&lt;identifier&gt; in &lt;filename&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Neither alternative format shall
be produced by ctags when it is used as described by
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, but the standard utilities that process
tags files shall be able to process <br>
those formats as well as the first format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In any of these formats, the
file shall be sorted by identifier, based on the collation
sequence in the POSIX locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
If the operand identifies C-language source, the ctags
utility shall attempt to produce an output line for each of
the following objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Function definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Type definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Macros with arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It may also produce output for
any of the following objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Function prototypes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Structures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Unions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Global variable
definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Enumeration types</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Macros without arguments</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* #define statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* #line statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any #if and #ifdef statements
shall produce no output. The tag main is treated specially
in C programs. The tag formed shall be created by prefixing
M to the name of the file, <br>
with the trailing .c, and leading pathname components (if
any) removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that do not support
the C-Language Development Utilities option, ctags produces
unspecified results for C-language source code files. It
should write to standard error <br>
a message identifying this condition and cause a non-zero
exit status to be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the operand identifies
FORTRAN source, the ctags utility shall produce an output
line for each function definition. It may also produce
output for any of the following <br>
objects:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Subroutine definitions</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* COMMON statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* PARAMETER statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* DATA and BLOCK DATA
statements</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Statement numbers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On systems that do not support
the FORTRAN Development Utilities option, ctags produces
unspecified results for FORTRAN source code files. It should
write to standard error a <br>
message identifying this condition and cause a non-zero exit
status to be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is implementation-defined
what other objects (including duplicate identifiers) produce
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The following exit values shall be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 Successful completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&gt;0 An error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
The output with &acirc;x is meant to be a simple index that
can be written out as an off-line readable function index.
If the input files to ctags (such as .c files) were not
created <br>
using the same locale as that in effect when ctags &acirc;x
is run, results might not be as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description of C-language
processing says &lsquo;&lsquo;attempts to&rsquo;&rsquo;
because the C language can be greatly confused, especially
through the use of #defines, and this utility would be of
<br>
no use if the real C preprocessor were run to identify them.
The output from ctags may be fooled and incorrect for
various constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
The option list was significantly reduced from that provided
by historical implementations. The &acirc;F option was
omitted as redundant, since it is the default. The &acirc;B
option was <br>
omitted as being of very limited usefulness. The &acirc;t
option was omitted since the recognition of typedefs is now
required for C source files. The &acirc;u option was omitted
because the <br>
update function was judged to be not only inefficient, but
also rarely needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An early proposal included a
&acirc;w option to suppress warning diagnostics. Since the
types of such diagnostics could not be described, the option
was omitted as being not useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text for LC_CTYPE about
compatibility with the C locale acknowledges that the ISO C
standard imposes requirements on the locale used to process
C source. This could easily be <br>
a superset of that known as &lsquo;&lsquo;the C
locale&rsquo;&rsquo; by way of implementation extensions, or
one of a few alternative locales for systems supporting
different codesets. No statement is <br>
made for FORTRAN because the ANSI X3.9&acirc;1978 standard
(FORTRAN 77) does not (yet) define a similar locale concept.
However, a general rule in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008
is that <br>
any time that locales do not match (preparing a file for one
locale and processing it in another), the results are
suspect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The collation sequence of the
tags file is not affected by LC_COLLATE because it is
typically not used by human readers, but only by programs
such as vi to locate the tag within <br>
the source files. Using the POSIX locale eliminates some of
the problems of coordinating locales between the ctags file
creator and the vi file reader.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically, the tags file has
been used only by ex and vi. However, the format of the tags
file has been published to encourage other programs to use
the tags in new ways. The <br>
format allows either patterns or line numbers to find the
identifiers because the historical vi recognizes either. The
ctags utility does not produce the format using line
num&acirc; <br>
bers because it is not useful following any source file
changes that add or delete lines. The documented search
patterns match historical practice. It should be noted that
lit&acirc; <br>
eral leading &lt;circumflex&gt; or trailing
&lt;dollar-sign&gt; characters in the search pattern will
only behave correctly if anchored to the beginning of the
line or end of the line by an <br>
additional &lt;circumflex&gt; or &lt;dollar-sign&gt;
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historical implementations also
understand the objects used by the languages Pascal and
sometimes LISP, and they understand the C source output by
lex and yacc. The ctags util&acirc; <br>
ity is not required to accommodate these languages, although
implementors are encouraged to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following historical option
was not specified, as vgrind is not included in this volume
of POSIX.1&acirc;2008:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;v If the &acirc;v flag is
given, an index of the form expected by vgrind is produced
on the standard output. This listing contains the function
name, filename, and page number <br>
(assuming 64-line pages). Since the output is sorted into
lexicographic order, it may be desired to run the output
through sort &acirc;f. Sample use:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ctags &acirc;v files | sort
&acirc;f &gt; index vgrind &acirc;x index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special treatment of the tag
main makes the use of ctags practical in directories with
more than one program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
