<p>RASPLIT(1) General Commands Manual RASPLIT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
rasplit - split argus(8) data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
rasplit [[-M splitmode] [splitmode options]] [raoptions] [--
filter-expression]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Rasplit reads argus data from an argus-data source, and
splits the resulting output into consecutive sections of
records based on size, count time, or flow event, writing
the <br>
output into a set of output-files. By default, rasplit puts
10,000 records of input into each argus output file, or
standard out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output files&rsquo; name
consists of a prefix, which is specified using the -w ra
option, and a suffix, which is created for each resulting
file. If no prefix is provided, then <br>
rasplit will use &rsquo;x&rsquo; as the default prefix. The
suffix that is used is determined by the mode of operation.
When rasplit is using the default count mode or the size
mode, the <br>
suffix is a group of letters &rsquo;aa&rsquo;,
&Acirc;&acute;ab&Acirc;&acute;, and so on, such that
concatenating the output files in sorted order by file name
produces the original input file. If rasplit will need <br>
to create more output files than are allowed by the default
suffix strategy, more letters will be added, in order to
accomodate the needed files. When the mode is time mode, the
<br>
default output filename suffix is
&rsquo;%Y.%m.%d.%h.%m.%s&rsquo;, which is used by strftime()
to create an output filename that is time oriented. This
default is overrided by adding a &rsquo;%&rsquo; <br>
extension to the name provided on the commandline using the
-w option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When standard out is specified,
using -w -, rasplit will output a single argus-stream with
START and STOP argus management records inserted
appropriately to indicate where the <br>
output is split. See argus(8) for more information on output
stream formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rasplit is spliting on
output record count (the default), the number of records is
specified as an ordinal counter, the default is 10,000
records. When rasplit is spliting <br>
based on the maximum output file size, the size is specified
as bytes. The scale of the bytes can be specified by
appending &rsquo;b&rsquo;, &rsquo;k&rsquo; and
&rsquo;m&rsquo; to the number provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rasplit is spliting based
on time, the time period is specified with the option, and
can be any period based in seconds (s), minutes (m), hours
(h), days (d), weeks (w), <br>
months (M) or years (y). Rasplit will create and modify
records as required to split on prescribed time boundaries.
If any record spans a time boundary, the record is split and
<br>
the metrics are adjusted using a uniform distribution model
to distribute the statistics between the two records. Care
is taken to avoid records with zero packet and byte <br>
counts, that could result from roundoff error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When rasplit is spliting based
on flow event, the flow that acts as the event marker is
specified using a standard ra filter expression, that is
bounded by quotes (&quot;). Records <br>
that preceed the first flow event in the data stream are
written to the specified output file, and then new files are
generated with the flow event record being the first record
<br>
of the new file. This method will allow you to use wire
events as triggers for spliting data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RASPLIT SPECIFIC OPTIONS <br>
Rasplit, like all ra based clients, supports a number of ra
options including remote data access, reading from multiple
files and filtering of input argus records through a
ter&acirc; <br>
minating filter expression. rasplit(1) specific options
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a suffix length <br>
default is 2 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Toggle running as a
deamon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M splitmode <br>
Supported spliting modes are: <br>
count &lt;num&gt; <br>
size &lt;size&gt; <br>
time &lt;period&gt; <br>
flow &quot;filter-expression&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w filename <br>
Rasplit supports an extended -w option that allows for
output record contents to be inserted into the output
filename. Specified using &rsquo;$&rsquo; (dollar) notation,
any printable <br>
field can be used. Care should be taken to honor any shell
escape requirements when specifying on the command line. See
ra(1) for the list of printable fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Another extended feature, when
using time mode, rasplit will process the supplied filename
using strftime(3), so that time fields can be inserted into
the resulting output <br>
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
This invocation reads argus(8) data from inputfile and
splits the argus(8) data stream based on output file size of
no greater than 1 Megabyte. The resulting output files have
a <br>
prefix of argus. and suffix that starts with
&rsquo;aa&rsquo;. The single trailing &rsquo;.&rsquo; is
significant.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rasplit -r inputfile -M size 1m
-w argus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This invocation splits inputfile
based on hard 10 minute time boundaries. The resulting
output files are created with a prefix of
/archive/%Y/%m/%d/argus. and the suffix is <br>
%H.%M.%S. The values will be supplied based on the time in
the record being written out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rasplit -r * -M time 10m -w
&quot;/archive/%Y/%m/%d/argus.%H.%M.%S&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This invocation splits inputfile
based on the argus source identifier. The resulting output
files are created with a prefix of /archive/Source
Identifier/argus. and the default <br>
suffix starting with &quot;aa&quot;. The source identifier
will be supplied based on the contents of the record being
exported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rasplit -r * -M time 10m -w
&quot;/archive/$srcid/argus.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This invocation splits inputfile
based on a flow event marker. The resulting output files are
created with a prefix of &rsquo;outfile.&rsquo; and the
default suffix starting with &quot;aa&quot;. <br>
Whenever a ping to a specific host is seen in the stream, a
new output file is generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rasplit -r * -M flow &quot;echo
and host 1.2.3.4&quot; -w outfile.</p>
