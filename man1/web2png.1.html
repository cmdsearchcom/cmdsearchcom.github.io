Web2png is a front end for gif2png(1) that automatically converts entire web
  page hierarchies from using GIFs to using PNGs. It does image conversion and
  patches IMG SRC references in web pages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The arguments to <b>web2png</b> must be directories; if none are given, the
  current directory is assumed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In each directory, <b>web2png</b> tries to convert every GIF to a PNG. It leaves
  alone GIFs that have multiple images, because these will not display properly
  in all current browsers. It also does not reconvert GIFs that already have
  corresponding PNGs (e.g. the same name except for the .gif file extension).
  The original GIFs are left in place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Web2png tracks successful conversions. It then looks at each HTML, secure HTML,
  HTML inclusion, PHP page, JavaScript program or Cascading Style Sheet under
  the argument directories (extensions html, shtml, .inc, .php, .js, .css). In
  these pages, it fixes each reference to each successful converted GIF to point
  at the PNG. References in relative HREF and BACKGROUND tags are recognized by
  filename and fixed (any base directory declared by a BASE tag will be be
  prepended to the relative URL). References that are HTTP URLs are matched
  against the list of convertible GIFs by basename; if there is such a match,
  the contents of the URL is retrieved and compared to the convertible GIF. If
  both basename and data match, the HTTP reference is fixed. If the pages are
  under RCS version control, they're checked out for modification before being
  altered; otherwise, a copy of the original of each modified web page is left
  in the same directory, with the additional extension .bak.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following options change the behavior of the program:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-a</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Convert all GIF files, including those with
  multiple images.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-d</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Delete originals. Removes all GIFs with
  corresponding PNGs, and all .bak files.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-n</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Make no changes. With this option,
  <b>web2png</b> reports on what needs to be done (and on GIFs that have
  multiple images), but neither converts GIFs nor touches web pages.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-r</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Reverse. Restore all HTML/SHTML/PHP pages from
  the .bak files created by a previous run (or, if the files were under version
  control, revert them). Remove PNGs with corresponding GIFs.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Verbose. Utter more trace information about
  the conversion process. Web2png can be run on a directory that has already
  been partly converted by previous runs; it will do the minimum necessary
  amount of work. The changes it makes will be fully reversible with <b>-r</b>
  until you run it in <b>-d</b> mode. Web2png is written in Python. Python 1.5.2
  or better must be installed and accessible on your system in order for
  <b>web2png</b> to run.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NOTE"><a class="selflink" href="#NOTE">NOTE</a></h1>
Sometimes it's possible to convert transparent GIFs without altering the
  appearance of the page, by knowing from context that they will always place
  within an area of fixed and solid color. Web2png can't deduce when this will
  be, so it doesn't try; but it may be useful to apply gif2png with the -b
  option by hand.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="KNOWN_PROBLEMS"><a class="selflink" href="#KNOWN_PROBLEMS">KNOWN
  PROBLEMS</a></h1>
The algorithm for fixing HTTP URLs is not foolproof. It could be confused into
  incorrectly patching an HTTP URL reference to a GIF into an invalid reference
  to a PNG if the GIF matches a local target GIF by both basename and binary
  content, but actually lives on another host.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This program does not automatically convert CGIs; you'll have to do that by
  hand. Other dynamic-content methods (such as server-side inclusions) may also
  require hand-hacking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program cannot tell converted from preexisting PNGs; if you have PNGs with
  the same stem name as corresponding GIFs but carrying different information,
  the <b>-r</b> mode will clobber them.
