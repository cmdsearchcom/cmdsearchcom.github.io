<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
web2png - convert a web tree from using GIFs to using
PNGs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
web2png [-adnrtv] [directory...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Web2png is a front end for gif2png(1) that automatically
converts entire web page hierarchies from using GIFs to
using PNGs. It does image conversion and patches IMG SRC
<br>
references in web pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The arguments to web2png must be
directories; if none are given, the current directory is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In each directory, web2png tries
to convert every GIF to a PNG. It leaves alone GIFs that
have multiple images, because these will not display
properly in all current browsers. <br>
It also does not reconvert GIFs that already have
corresponding PNGs (e.g. the same name except for the .gif
file extension). The original GIFs are left in place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Web2png tracks successful
conversions. It then looks at each HTML, secure HTML, HTML
inclusion, PHP page, JavaScript program or Cascading Style
Sheet under the argument <br>
directories (extensions html, shtml, .inc, .php, .js, .css).
In these pages, it fixes each reference to each successful
converted GIF to point at the PNG. References in relative
<br>
HREF and BACKGROUND tags are recognized by filename and
fixed (any base directory declared by a BASE tag will be be
prepended to the relative URL). References that are HTTP
URLs <br>
are matched against the list of convertible GIFs by
basename; if there is such a match, the contents of the URL
is retrieved and compared to the convertible GIF. If both
basename <br>
and data match, the HTTP reference is fixed. If the pages
are under RCS version control, they&rsquo;re checked out for
modification before being altered; otherwise, a copy of the
<br>
original of each modified web page is left in the same
directory, with the additional extension .bak.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options change the
behavior of the program:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a <br>
Convert all GIF files, including those with multiple
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d <br>
Delete originals. Removes all GIFs with corresponding PNGs,
and all .bak files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n <br>
Make no changes. With this option, web2png reports on what
needs to be done (and on GIFs that have multiple images),
but neither converts GIFs nor touches web pages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
Reverse. Restore all HTML/SHTML/PHP pages from the .bak
files created by a previous run (or, if the files were under
version control, revert them). Remove PNGs with <br>
corresponding GIFs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v <br>
Verbose. Utter more trace information about the conversion
process. Web2png can be run on a directory that has already
been partly converted by previous runs; it will do the <br>
minimum necessary amount of work. The changes it makes will
be fully reversible with -r until you run it in -d mode.
Web2png is written in Python. Python 1.5.2 or better must
<br>
be installed and accessible on your system in order for
web2png to run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE <br>
Sometimes it&rsquo;s possible to convert transparent GIFs
without altering the appearance of the page, by knowing from
context that they will always place within an area of fixed
and <br>
solid color. Web2png can&rsquo;t deduce when this will be,
so it doesn&rsquo;t try; but it may be useful to apply
gif2png with the -b option by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KNOWN PROBLEMS <br>
The algorithm for fixing HTTP URLs is not foolproof. It
could be confused into incorrectly patching an HTTP URL
reference to a GIF into an invalid reference to a PNG if the
GIF <br>
matches a local target GIF by both basename and binary
content, but actually lives on another host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program does not
automatically convert CGIs; you&rsquo;ll have to do that by
hand. Other dynamic-content methods (such as server-side
inclusions) may also require hand-hacking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program cannot tell
converted from preexisting PNGs; if you have PNGs with the
same stem name as corresponding GIFs but carrying different
information, the -r mode will <br>
clobber them.</p>
