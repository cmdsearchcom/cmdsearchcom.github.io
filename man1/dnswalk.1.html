<b>dnswalk</b> [ <b>-</b>adilrfFm ] <i>domain.</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>dnswalk</b> is a DNS debugger. It performs zone transfers of specified
  domains, and checks the database in numerous ways for internal consistency, as
  well as for correctness according to accepted practices with the Domain Name
  System.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>domain</i> name specified on the command line MUST end with a '.'. You
  can specify a forward domain, such as <b>dnswalk podunk.edu.</b> or a reverse
  domain, such as <b>dnswalk 3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.</b>

The following the list of error messages that <b>dnswalk</b> will return if it
  sees a potential problem with the database. Duplicate messages will be
  suppressed automatically for each zone. Error messages are prefixed by a
  keyword indiciating the message type: &quot;WARN&quot; (possible data
  problem), &quot;FAIL&quot; (failure to access data), or &quot;BAD&quot;
  (invalid data). <b>dnswalk</b> exits with a return code equal to the number of
  &quot;BAD&quot; errors.

      since they occur more than one time in the file (and in multiple files).
      You may get spurious errors, mostly because of a quirk in BIND releases

      significant increases in DNS traffic. NS records for the parent and child

When invoked with the <b>-d</b> option, <b>dnswalk</b> will print status
  information to stderr. It consists of information about what zone is being
  checked, and a single letter corresponding to the resource record checked, and
  any errors.

dnswalk will make the directory tree before it has a chance to find out that you
  gave it a bogus domain name.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When checking lots of hosts and lots of options, it is very slow. Running
  dnswalk on a machine with a local nameserver helps considerably.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl's gethostby{name,addr}() routine doesn't seem to consistently return an
  error whenever it is unable to resolve an address. Argh. This will mean lots
  of &quot;no PTR record&quot; and &quot;host unknown&quot; errors if a server
  is unavailable, or for some reason the lookup fails. You may get strange error
  messages if your perl was compiled without support for herror().
