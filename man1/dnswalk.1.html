<p>DNSWALK(1) General Commands Manual DNSWALK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dnswalk - A DNS database debugger</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dnswalk [ -adilrfFm ] domain.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dnswalk is a DNS debugger. It performs zone transfers of
specified domains, and checks the database in numerous ways
for internal consistency, as well as for correctness
accord&acirc; <br>
ing to accepted practices with the Domain Name System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The domain name specified on the
command line MUST end with a &rsquo;.&rsquo;. You can
specify a forward domain, such as dnswalk podunk.edu. or a
reverse domain, such as dnswalk 3.2.1.in- <br>
addr.arpa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-r Recursively descend sub-domains of the specified domain.
Use with care. <br>
-a Turn on warning of duplicate A records. (see below) <br>
-d Print debugging and &rsquo;status&rsquo; information to
stderr. (Use only if redirecting stdout) See DIAGNOSTICS
section. <br>
-m Perform checks only if the zone has been modified since
the previous run. <br>
-F perform &quot;fascist&quot; checking. When checking an A
record, compare the PTR name for each IP address with the
forward name and report mismatches. (see below) I recommend
you <br>
try this option at least once to see what sorts of errors
pop up - you might be surprised!. <br>
-i Suppress check for invalid characters in a domain name.
(see below) <br>
-l Perform &quot;lame delegation&quot; checking. For every
NS record, check to see that the listed host is indeed
returning authoritative answers for this domain. <br>
ERRORS <br>
The following the list of error messages that dnswalk will
return if it sees a potential problem with the database.
Duplicate messages will be suppressed automatically <br>
for each zone. Error messages are prefixed by a keyword
indiciating the message type: &quot;WARN&quot; (possible
data problem), &quot;FAIL&quot; (failure to access data), or
&quot;BAD&quot; (invalid <br>
data). dnswalk exits with a return code equal to the number
of &quot;BAD&quot; errors. <br>
X PTR Y: unknown host <br>
X is a PTR record to Y, but Y is not a valid host (no A
record). These are often left over from when someone deleted
a host from the DNS and forgot to delete the PTR <br>
record. <br>
X PTR Y: A record not found <br>
X is a PTR record to Y, but the IP address associated with
the PTR record is not listed as an address for Y. There
should be an A record for every valid IP address for a <br>
host. Many Internet services will not talk to you if you
have mismatched PTR records. <br>
X PTR Y: CNAME (to Z) <br>
X is a PTR record to Y, but Y is a CNAME to Z. PTR records
MUST point to the canonical name of a host, not an alias.
<br>
X CNAME Y: unknown host <br>
X is aliased to Y, but Y is not a valid host (no A record).
<br>
X CNAME Y: CNAME (to Z) <br>
X is aliased to Y, but Y is aliased to Z. CNAMEs should not
be chained. <br>
X MX Y: unknown host <br>
X is an MX to Y, but Y is not a valid host (no A record).
<br>
X MX Y: CNAME (to Z) <br>
X is an MX to Y, but Y is an alias for Z. MX records must
point to the canonical name, not an alias. <br>
X A Y: no PTR record <br>
X has an IP address Y, but there is no PTR record to map the
IP address Y back to a hostname (usually X). Many Internet
servers (such as anonymous FTP servers) will not <br>
talk to addresses that don&rsquo;t have PTR records. <br>
warning: X has only one authoritative nameserver <br>
Zones must have at least one authoritative nameserver, in
case one is down or unreachable. Make sure the parent and
child domains list all authoritative nameservers for a <br>
zone. <br>
Cannot check X: no available nameservers! <br>
The X zone was delegated with NS records but all the
nameservers for the zone are either unavailable or say that
they have no data for the zone (are lame). Verify that <br>
the X zone isn&rsquo;t a typo, and if so make sure that all
the listed nameservers are configured to answer with data
for the zone. <br>
X: invalid character(s) in name <br>
Allowable characters in a domain name are the ASCII letters
a through Z the digits 0 through 9, and the &quot;-&quot;
character. A &quot;.&quot; may be used only as a domain
separator. <br>
(checking can be suppressed with -i ) <br>
X: domain occurred twice, forgot trailing &rsquo;.&rsquo;?
<br>
A sanity check which looks for &quot;dom.ain.dom.ain.&quot;
in a name. This is often caused by forgetting to put a
trailing &rsquo;.&rsquo; on the end of a name. <br>
(with -a switch) <br>
X: possible duplicate A record (glue of Z?) <br>
A duplicate A records is listed for X. NOTE: this is most
often caused by the practice of always putting A records for
all secondaries after NS glue records. While this <br>
is not an error, it is usually redundant and makes changing
IP addresses later more difficult, since they occur more
than one time in the file (and in multiple files). <br>
You may get spurious errors, mostly because of a quirk in
BIND releases before 4.9.x that reports cached glue A
records in a zone transfer even though they don&rsquo;t
exist in <br>
the original zone file. <br>
(with -F switch) <br>
X A Y: points to Z <br>
X has Y for an IP address, but the PTR record associated
with Y returns &quot;Z&quot; as the name associated with
that host. This is not necessarily an error (for example if
you <br>
have an A record for your domain name), but can be useful to
check for A records which point to the wrong host, or PTR
records that point to the wrong host. <br>
Cannot find address for nameserver X <br>
This error is generated if the address for a delegated
nameserver X cannot be resolved. This could be a lame
delegation (due to a typo in delegation), or a temporary DNS
<br>
error. <br>
(with -l switch) <br>
X NS Y: lame NS delegation <br>
Y is a listed nameserver for zone X, but Y is not returning
authoritative data for zone X. This is usually the result of
a lack of communication on the part of the <br>
respective hostmasters. Lame delegations are not fatal
problems except in severe cases, they just tend to create
significant increases in DNS traffic. NS records for the
<br>
parent and child domains should be consistent, and each
server listed in the NS record MUST be able to answer with
authoritative data, either by being a primary or sec&acirc;
<br>
ondary for the zone. <br>
Cannot get SOA record for X from Y (lame?) <br>
This error is generated if dnswalk cannot get the SOA record
for zone X from the nameserver Y. This could mean a lame
delegation, or simply that the host is temporarily <br>
unreachable. SEE ALSO <br>
RFC 1034 - &quot;DOMAIN NAMES - CONCEPTS AND
FACILITIES&quot; <br>

Application and Support&quot; <br>
Paul Albitz, Cricket Liu: &quot;DNS and BIND&quot;
O&rsquo;Reilly &amp; Associates. DIAGNOSTICS <br>
When invoked with the -d option, dnswalk will print status
information to stderr. It consists of information about what
zone is being checked, and a single letter corresponding
<br>
to the resource record checked, and any errors. <br>
a A record <br>
c CNAME record <br>
p PTR record <br>
m MX record <br>
s SOA record <br>
! An error occurred <br>
. A previous error in the zone was repeated, but suppressed.
BUGS <br>
dnswalk will make the directory tree before it has a chance
to find out that you gave it a bogus domain name. <br>
When checking lots of hosts and lots of options, it is very
slow. Running dnswalk on a machine with a local nameserver
helps considerably. <br>
Perl&rsquo;s gethostby{name,addr}() routine doesn&rsquo;t
seem to consistently return an error whenever it is unable
to resolve an address. Argh. This will mean lots of &quot;no
PTR record&quot; and <br>
&quot;host unknown&quot; errors if a server is unavailable,
or for some reason the lookup fails. You may get strange
error messages if your perl was compiled without support for
herror(). AUTHOR <br>
