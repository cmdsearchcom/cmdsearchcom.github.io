<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
PDL::Internals - description of some aspects of the current
internals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Intro <br>
This document explains various aspects of the current
implementation of PDL. If you just want to use PDL for
something, you definitely do not need to read this. Even if
you want <br>
to interface your C routines to PDL or create new PDL::PP
functions, you do not need to read this man page (though it
may be informative). This document is primarily intended for
<br>
people interested in debugging or changing the internals of
PDL. To read this, a good understanding of the C language
and programming and data structures in general is required,
<br>
as well as some Perl understanding. If you read through this
document and understand all of it and are able to point what
any part of this document refers to in the PDL core <br>
sources and additionally struggle to understand PDL::PP, you
will be awarded the title &quot;PDL Guru&quot; (of course,
the current version of this document is so incomplete that
this is <br>
next to impossible from just these notes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warning: If it seems that this
document has gotten out of date, please inform the PDL
porters email list (pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). This
may well happen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Piddles <br>
The pdl data object is generally an opaque scalar reference
into a pdl structure in memory. Alternatively, it may be a
hash reference with the &quot;PDL&quot; field containing the
scalar <br>
reference (this makes overloading piddles easy, see
PDL::Objects). You can easily find out at the Perl level
which type of piddle you are dealing with. The example code
below <br>
demonstrates how to do it:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># check if this a piddle <br>
die &quot;not a piddle&quot; unless UNIVERSAL::isa($pdl,
&rsquo;PDL&rsquo;); <br>
# is it a scalar ref or a hash ref? <br>
if (UNIVERSAL::isa($pdl, &quot;HASH&quot;)) { <br>
die &quot;not a valid PDL&quot; unless exists $pdl-&gt;{PDL}
&amp;&amp; <br>
UNIVERSAL::isa($pdl-&gt;{PDL},&rsquo;PDL&rsquo;); <br>
print &quot;This is a hash reference,&quot;, <br>
&quot; the PDL field contains the scalar ref0; <br>
} else { <br>
print &quot;This is a scalar ref that points to address
$$pdl in memory0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The scalar reference points to
the numeric address of a C structure of type &quot;pdl&quot;
which is defined in pdl.h. The mapping between the object at
the Perl level and the C structure <br>
containing the actual data and structural that makes up a
piddle is done by the PDL typemap. The functions used in the
PDL typemap are defined pretty much at the top of the file
<br>
pdlcore.h. So what does the structure look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct pdl { <br>
unsigned long magicno; /* Always stores PDL_MAGICNO as a
sanity check */ <br>
/* This is first so most pointer accesses to wrong type are
caught */ <br>
int state; /* What&rsquo;s in this pdl */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl_trans *trans; /* Opaque
pointer to internals of transformation from <br>
parent */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl_vaffine *vafftrans;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void* sv; /* (optional) pointer
back to original sv. <br>
ALWAYS check for non-null before use. <br>
We cannot inc refcnt on this one or we&rsquo;d <br>
never get destroyed */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void *datasv; /* Pointer to SV
containing data. Refcnt inced */ <br>
void *data; /* Null: no data alloced for this one */ <br>
PDL_Indx nvals; /* How many values allocated */ <br>
int datatype; <br>
PDL_Indx *dims; /* Array of data dimensions */ <br>
PDL_Indx *dimincs; /* Array of data default increments */
<br>
short ndims; /* Number of data dimensions */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned char *threadids; /*
Starting index of the thread index set n */ <br>
unsigned char nthreadids;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl_children children;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL_Indx def_dims[PDL_NDIMS]; /*
Preallocated space for efficiency */ <br>
PDL_Indx def_dimincs[PDL_NDIMS]; /* Preallocated space for
efficiency */ <br>
unsigned char def_threadids[PDL_NTHREADIDS];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct pdl_magic *magic;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void *hdrsv; /*
&quot;header&quot;, settable from outside */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is quite a structure for
just storing some data in - what is going on?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Data storage <br>
We are going to start with some of the simpler members:
first of all, there is the member</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void *datasv;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is really a pointer to a
Perl SV structure (&quot;SV *&quot;). The SV is expected to
be representing a string, in which the data of the piddle is
stored in a tightly packed <br>
form. This pointer counts as a reference to the SV so the
reference count has been incremented when the &quot;SV
*&quot; was placed here (this reference count business has
to do with <br>
Perl&rsquo;s garbage collection mechanism -- don&rsquo;t
worry if this doesn&rsquo;t mean much to you). This pointer
is allowed to have the value &quot;NULL&quot; which means
that there is no actual <br>
Perl SV for this data - for instance, the data might be
allocated by a &quot;mmap&quot; operation. Note the use of
an SV* was purely for convenience, it allows easy
transformation of <br>
packed data from files into piddles. Other implementations
are not excluded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual pointer to data is
stored in the member</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void *data;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which contains a pointer to a
memory area with space for</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL_Indx nvals;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data items of the data type of
this piddle. PDL_Indx is either &rsquo;long&rsquo; or
&rsquo;long long&rsquo; depending on whether your perl is
64bit or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The data type of the data is
stored in the variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int datatype;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the values for this member are
given in the enum &quot;pdl_datatypes&quot; (see pdl.h).
Currently we have byte, short, unsigned short, long, float
and double types, see also <br>
PDL::Types.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dimensions <br>
The number of dimensions in the piddle is given by the
member</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int ndims;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which shows how many entries
there are in the arrays</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL_Indx *dims; <br>
PDL_Indx *dimincs;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These arrays are intimately
related: &quot;dims&quot; gives the sizes of the dimensions
and &quot;dimincs&quot; is always calculated by the code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL_Indx inc = 1; <br>
for(i=0; i&lt;it-&gt;ndims; i++) { <br>
it-&gt;dimincs[i] = inc; inc *= it-&gt;dims[i]; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in the routine
&quot;pdl_resize_defaultincs&quot; in &quot;pdlapi.c&quot;.
What this means is that the dimincs can be used to calculate
the offset by code like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL_Indx offs = 0; <br>
for(i=0; i&lt;it-&gt;ndims; i++) { <br>
offs += it-&gt;dimincs[i] * index[i]; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">but this is not always the right
thing to do, at least without checking for certain things
first.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Default storage <br>
Since the vast majority of piddles don&rsquo;t have more
than 6 dimensions, it is more efficient to have default
storage for the dimensions and dimincs inside the PDL
struct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDL_Indx def_dims[PDL_NDIMS];
<br>
PDL_Indx def_dimincs[PDL_NDIMS];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;dims&quot; and
&quot;dimincs&quot; may be set to point to the beginning of
these arrays if &quot;ndims&quot; is smaller than or equal
to the compile-time constant &quot;PDL_NDIMS&quot;. This is
important <br>
to note when freeing a piddle struct. The same applies for
the threadids:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsigned char
def_threadids[PDL_NTHREADIDS];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Magic <br>
It is possible to attach magic to piddles, much like
Perl&rsquo;s own magic mechanism. If the member pointer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct pdl_magic *magic;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is nonzero, the PDL has some
magic attached to it. The implementation of magic can be
gleaned from the file pdlmagic.c in the distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">State <br>
One of the first members of the structure is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int state;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The possible flags and their
meanings are given in &quot;pdl.h&quot;. These are mainly
used to implement the lazy evaluation mechanism and keep
track of piddles in these operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Transformations and virtual
affine transformations <br>
As you should already know, piddles often carry information
about where they come from. For example, the code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$b =
$a-&gt;slice(&quot;2:5&quot;); <br>
$b .= 1;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will alter $a. So $b and $a know
that they are connected via a
&quot;slice&quot;-transformation. This information is stored
in the members</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl_trans *trans; <br>
pdl_vaffine *vafftrans;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Both $a (the parent) and $b (the
child) store this information about the transformation in
appropriate slots of the &quot;pdl&quot; structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;pdl_trans&quot; and
&quot;pdl_vaffine&quot; are structures that we will look at
in more detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Perl SVs <br>
When piddles are referred to through Perl SVs, we store an
additional reference to it in the member</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void* sv;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in order to be able to return a
reference to the user when he wants to inspect the
transformation structure on the Perl side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, we store an opaque</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void *hdrsv;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which is just for use by the
user to hook up arbitrary data with this sv. This one is
generally manipulated through sethdr and gethdr calls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart references and
transformations: slicing and dicing <br>
Smart references and most other fundamental functions
operating on piddles are implemented via transformations (as
mentioned above) which are represented by the type
&quot;pdl_trans&quot; <br>
in PDL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A transformation links input and
output piddles and contains all the infrastructure that
defines how:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; output piddles
are obtained from input piddles;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; changes in
smartly linked output piddles (e.g. the child of a sliced
parent piddle) are flown back to the input piddle in
transformations where this is supported (the most <br>
often used example being &quot;slice&quot; here);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; datatype and
size of output piddles that need to be created are
obtained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general, executing a PDL
function on a group of piddles results in creation of a
transformation of the requested type that links all input
and output arguments (at least those <br>
that are piddles). In PDL functions that support data flow
between input and output args (e.g. &quot;slice&quot;,
&quot;index&quot;) this transformation links parent (input)
and child (output) <br>
piddles permanently until either the link is explicitly
broken by user request (&quot;sever&quot; at the Perl level)
or all parents and children have been destroyed. In those
cases the <br>
transformation is lazy-evaluated, e.g. only executed when
piddle values are actually accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In non-flowing functions, for
example addition (&quot;+&quot;) and inner products
(&quot;inner&quot;), the transformation is installed just as
in flowing functions but then the transformation is <br>
immediately executed and destroyed (breaking the link
between input and output args) before the function
returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It should be noted that the
close link between input and output args of a flowing
function (like slice) requires that piddle objects that are
linked in such a way be kept alive <br>
beyond the point where they have gone out of scope from the
point of view of Perl:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$a = zeroes(20); <br>
$b = $a-&gt;slice(&rsquo;2:4&rsquo;); <br>
undef $a; # last reference to $a is now destroyed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although $a should now be
destroyed according to Perl&rsquo;s rules the underlying
&quot;pdl&quot; structure must actually only be freed when
$b also goes out of scope (since it still references <br>
internally some of $a&rsquo;s data). This example
demonstrates that such a dataflow paradigm between PDL
objects necessitates a special destruction algorithm that
takes the links <br>
between piddles into account and couples the lifespan of
those objects. The non-trivial algorithm is implemented in
the function &quot;pdl_destroy&quot; in pdlapi.c. In fact,
most of the <br>
code in pdlapi.c and pdlfamily.c is concerned with making
sure that piddles (&quot;pdl *&quot;s) are created, updated
and freed at the right times depending on interactions with
other <br>
piddles via PDL transformations (remember,
&quot;pdl_trans&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Accessing children and parents
of a piddle <br>
When piddles are dynamically linked via transformations as
suggested above input and output piddles are referred to as
parents and children, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example of processing the
children of a piddle is provided by the &quot;baddata&quot;
method of PDL::Bad (only available if you have compiled PDL
with the &quot;WITH_BADVAL&quot; option set to 1, <br>
but still useful as an example!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consider the following
situation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl&gt; $a =
rvals(7,7,{Centre=&gt;[3,4]}); <br>
pdl&gt; $b = $a-&gt;slice(&rsquo;2:4,3:5&rsquo;); <br>
pdl&gt; ? vars <br>
PDL variables in package main::</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Type Dimension Flow State
Mem <br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
$a Double D [7,7] P 0.38Kb <br>
$b Double D [3,3] -C 0.00Kb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now, if I suddenly decide that
$a should be flagged as possibly containing bad values,
using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl&gt; $a-&gt;badflag(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then I want the state of $b -
it&rsquo;s child - to be changed as well (since it will
either share or inherit some of $a&rsquo;s data and so be
also bad), so that I get a &rsquo;B&rsquo; in the State <br>
field:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl&gt; ? vars <br>
PDL variables in package main::</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name Type Dimension Flow State
Mem <br>

----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
$a Double D [7,7] PB 0.38Kb <br>
$b Double D [3,3] -CB 0.00Kb</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bit of magic is performed
by the &quot;propagate_badflag&quot; function, which is
listed below:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* newval = 1 means set flag, 0
means clear it */ <br>
/* thanks to Christian Soeller for this */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void propagate_badflag( pdl *it,
int newval ) { <br>
PDL_DECL_CHILDLOOP(it) <br>
PDL_START_CHILDLOOP(it) <br>
{ <br>
pdl_trans *trans = PDL_CHILDLOOP_THISCHILD(it); <br>
int i; <br>
for( i = trans-&gt;vtable-&gt;nparents; <br>
i &lt; trans-&gt;vtable-&gt;npdls; <br>
i++ ) { <br>
pdl *child = trans-&gt;pdls[i];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if ( newval ) child-&gt;state |=
PDL_BADVAL; <br>
else child-&gt;state &amp;= ~PDL_BADVAL;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* make sure we propagate to
grandchildren, etc */ <br>
propagate_badflag( child, newval );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">} /* for: i */ <br>
} <br>
PDL_END_CHILDLOOP(it) <br>
} /* propagate_badflag */</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Given a piddle (&quot;pdl
*it&quot;), the routine loops through each
&quot;pdl_trans&quot; structure, where access to this
structure is provided by the
&quot;PDL_CHILDLOOP_THISCHILD&quot; macro. The children <br>
of the piddle are stored in the &quot;pdls&quot; array,
after the parents, hence the loop from &quot;i =
...nparents&quot; to &quot;i = ...npdls - 1&quot;. Once we
have the pointer to the child piddle, we <br>
can do what we want to it; here we change the value of the
&quot;state&quot; variable, but the details are
unimportant). What is important is that we call
&quot;propagate_badflag&quot; on this <br>
piddle, to ensure we loop through its children. This
recursion ensures we get to all the offspring of a
particular piddle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access to parents is similar,
with the &quot;for&quot; loop replaced by:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for( i = 0; <br>
i &lt; trans-&gt;vtable-&gt;nparents; <br>
i++ ) { <br>
/* do stuff with parent #i: trans-&gt;pdls[i] */ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What&rsquo;s in a transformation
(&quot;pdl_trans&quot;) <br>
All transformations are implemented as structures</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">struct XXX_trans { <br>
int magicno; /* to detect memory overwrites */ <br>
short flags; /* state of the trans */ <br>
pdl_transvtable *vtable; /* the all important vtable */ <br>
void (*freeproc)(struct pdl_trans *); /* Call to free this
trans <br>
(in case we had to malloc some stuff for this trans) */ <br>
pdl *pdls[NP]; /* The pdls involved in the transformation */
<br>
int __datatype; /* the type of the transformation */ <br>
/* in general more members <br>
/* depending on the actual transformation (slice, add, etc)
<br>
*/ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transformation identifies
all &quot;pdl&quot;s involved in the trans</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl *pdls[NP];</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with &quot;NP&quot; depending on
the number of piddle args of the particular trans. It
records a state</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">short flags;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and the datatype</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">int __datatype;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">of the trans (to which all
piddles must be converted unless they are explicitly typed,
PDL functions created with PDL::PP make sure that these
conversions are done as necessary). <br>
Most important is the pointer to the vtable (virtual table)
that contains the actual functionality</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pdl_transvtable *vtable;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vtable structure in turn
looks something like (slightly simplified from pdl.h for
clarity)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typedef struct pdl_transvtable {
<br>
pdl_transtype transtype; <br>
int flags; <br>
int nparents; /* number of parent pdls (input) */ <br>
int npdls; /* number of child pdls (output) */ <br>
char *per_pdl_flags; /* optimization flags */ <br>
void (*redodims)(pdl_trans *tr); /* figure out dims of
children */ <br>
void (*readdata)(pdl_trans *tr); /* flow parents to children
*/ <br>
void (*writebackdata)(pdl_trans *tr); /* flow backwards */
<br>
void (*freetrans)(pdl_trans *tr); /* Free both the contents
and it of <br>
the trans member */ <br>
pdl_trans *(*copy)(pdl_trans *tr); /* Full copy */ <br>
int structsize; <br>
char *name; /* For debuggers, mostly */ <br>
} pdl_transvtable;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We focus on the callback
functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void (*redodims)(pdl_trans
*tr);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;redodims&quot; will work
out the dimensions of piddles that need to be created and is
called from within the API function that should be called to
ensure that the dimensions of a <br>
piddle are accessible (pdlapi.c):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void pdl_make_physdims(pdl
*it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;readdata&quot; and
&quot;writebackdata&quot; are responsible for the actual
computations of the child data from the parents or parent
data from those of the children, respectively (the <br>
dataflow aspect). The PDL core makes sure that these are
called as needed when piddle data is accessed
(lazy-evaluation). The general API function to ensure that a
piddle is up- <br>
to-date is</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">void pdl_make_physvaffine(pdl
*it)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">which should be called before
accessing piddle data from XS/C (see Core.xs for some
examples).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;freetrans&quot; frees
dynamically allocated memory associated with the trans as
needed and &quot;copy&quot; can copy the transformation.
Again, functions built with PDL::PP make sure that <br>
copying and freeing via these callbacks happens at the right
times. (If they fail to do that we have got a memory leak --
this has happened in the past ;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The transformation and vtable
code is hardly ever written by hand but rather generated by
PDL::PP from concise descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain types of transformations
can be optimized very efficiently obviating the need for
explicit &quot;readdata&quot; and &quot;writebackdata&quot;
methods. Those transformations are called <br>
pdl_vaffine. Most dimension manipulating functions (e.g.,
&quot;slice&quot;, &quot;xchg&quot;) belong to this
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic trick is that parent
and child of such a transformation work on the same (shared)
block of data which they just choose to interpret
differently (by using different <br>
&quot;dims&quot;, &quot;dimincs&quot; and &quot;offs&quot;
on the same data, compare the &quot;pdl&quot; structure
above). Each operation on a piddle sharing data with another
one in this way is therefore <br>
automatically flown from child to parent and back -- after
all they are reading and writing the same block of memory.
This is currently not Perl thread safe -- no big loss since
<br>
the whole PDL core is not reentrant (Perl threading
&quot;!=&quot; PDL threading!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signatures: threading over
elementary operations <br>
Most of that functionality of PDL threading (automatic
iteration of elementary operations over multi-dim piddles)
is implemented in the file pdlthread.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PDL::PP generated functions
(in particular the &quot;readdata&quot; and
&quot;writebackdata&quot; callbacks) use this infrastructure
to make sure that the fundamental operation implemented by
<br>
the trans is performed in agreement with PDL&rsquo;s
threading semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defining new PDL functions --
Glue code generation <br>
Please, see PDL::PP and examples in the PDL distribution.
Implementation and syntax are currently far from perfect but
it does a good job!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Core struct <br>
As discussed in PDL::API, PDL uses a pointer to a structure
to allow PDL modules access to its core routines. The
definition of this structure (the &quot;Core&quot; struct)
is in pdlcore.h <br>
(created by pdlcore.h.PL in Basic/Core) and looks something
like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/* Structure to hold pointers
core PDL routines so as to be used by <br>
* many modules <br>
*/ <br>
struct Core { <br>
I32 Version; <br>
pdl* (*SvPDLV) ( SV* ); <br>
void (*SetSV_PDL) ( SV *sv, pdl *it ); <br>
#if defined(PDL_clean_namespace) || defined(PDL_OLD_API)
<br>
pdl* (*new) ( ); /* make it work with gimp-perl */ <br>
#else <br>
pdl* (*pdlnew) ( ); /* renamed because of C++ clash */ <br>
#endif <br>
pdl* (*tmp) ( ); <br>
pdl* (*create) (int type); <br>
void (*destroy) (pdl *it); <br>
... <br>
} <br>
typedef struct Core Core;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first field of the structure
(&quot;Version&quot;) is used to ensure consistency between
modules at run time; the following code is placed in the
BOOT section of the generated xs code:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if (PDL-&gt;Version !=
PDL_CORE_VERSION) <br>
Perl_croak(aTHX_ &quot;Foo needs to be recompiled against
the newly installed PDL&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you add a new field to the
Core struct you should:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; discuss it on
the pdl porters email list (pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net)
[with the possibility of making your changes to a separate
branch of the CVS tree if it&rsquo;s a change <br>
that will take time to complete]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; increase by 1
the value of the $pdl_core_version variable in pdlcore.h.PL.
This sets the value of the &quot;PDL_CORE_VERSION&quot; C
macro used to populate the Version field</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; add
documentation (e.g. to PDL::API) if it&rsquo;s a
&quot;useful&quot; function for external module writers (as
well as ensuring the code is as well documented as the rest
of PDL ;)</p>
