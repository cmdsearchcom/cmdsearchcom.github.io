This document explains various aspects of the current implementation of PDL. If
  you just want to use PDL for something, you definitely do not need to read
  this. Even if you want to interface your C routines to PDL or create new
  PDL::PP functions, you do not need to read this man page (though it may be
  informative). This document is primarily intended for people interested in
  debugging or changing the internals of PDL. To read this, a good understanding
  of the C language and programming and data structures in general is required,
  as well as some Perl understanding. If you read through this document and
  understand all of it and are able to point what any part of this document
  refers to in the PDL core sources and additionally struggle to understand
  PDL::PP, you will be awarded the title &quot;PDL Guru&quot; (of course, the
  current version of this document is so incomplete that this is next to
  impossible from just these notes).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>Warning:</b> If it seems that this document has gotten out of date, please
  inform the PDL porters email list (pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). This may
  well happen.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Piddles"><a class="selflink" href="#Piddles">Piddles</a></h2>
The pdl data object is generally an opaque scalar reference into a pdl structure
  in memory. Alternatively, it may be a hash reference with the &quot;PDL&quot;
  field containing the scalar reference (this makes overloading piddles easy,
  see PDL::Objects). You can easily find out at the Perl level which type of
  piddle you are dealing with. The example code below demonstrates how to do it:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   # check if this a piddle
   die &quot;not a piddle&quot; unless UNIVERSAL::isa($pdl, 'PDL');
   # is it a scalar ref or a hash ref?
   if (UNIVERSAL::isa($pdl, &quot;HASH&quot;)) {
     die &quot;not a valid PDL&quot; unless exists $pdl-&gt;{PDL} &amp;&amp;
        UNIVERSAL::isa($pdl-&gt;{PDL},'PDL');
     print &quot;This is a hash reference,&quot;,
        &quot; the PDL field contains the scalar ref\n&quot;;
   } else {
        print &quot;This is a scalar ref that points to address $$pdl in memory\n&quot;;
   }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The scalar reference points to the numeric address of a C structure of type
  &quot;pdl&quot; which is defined in <i>pdl.h</i>. The mapping between the
  object at the Perl level and the C structure containing the actual data and
  structural that makes up a piddle is done by the PDL typemap. The functions
  used in the PDL typemap are defined pretty much at the top of the file
  <i>pdlcore.h</i>. So what does the structure look like:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        struct pdl {
           unsigned long magicno; /* Always stores PDL_MAGICNO as a sanity check */
             /* This is first so most pointer accesses to wrong type are caught */
           int state;        /* What's in this pdl */
           pdl_trans *trans; /* Opaque pointer to internals of transformation from
                                parent */
           pdl_vaffine *vafftrans;
           void*    sv;      /* (optional) pointer back to original sv.
                                  ALWAYS check for non-null before use.
                                  We cannot inc refcnt on this one or we'd
                                  never get destroyed */
           void *datasv;        /* Pointer to SV containing data. Refcnt inced */
           void *data;            /* Null: no data alloced for this one */
           PDL_Indx nvals;           /* How many values allocated */
           int datatype;
           PDL_Indx   *dims;      /* Array of data dimensions */
           PDL_Indx   *dimincs;   /* Array of data default increments */
           short    ndims;     /* Number of data dimensions */
           unsigned char *threadids;  /* Starting index of the thread index set n */
           unsigned char nthreadids;
           pdl_children children;
           PDL_Indx   def_dims[PDL_NDIMS];   /* Preallocated space for efficiency */
           PDL_Indx   def_dimincs[PDL_NDIMS];   /* Preallocated space for efficiency */
           unsigned char def_threadids[PDL_NTHREADIDS];
           struct pdl_magic *magic;
           void *hdrsv; /* &quot;header&quot;, settable from outside */
        };
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is quite a structure for just storing some data in - what is going on?
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Data storage</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">We are going to start with some of the simpler members:
      first of all, there is the member
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        void *datasv;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which is really a pointer to a Perl SV structure (&quot;SV *&quot;). The SV
      is expected to be representing a string, in which the data of the piddle
      is stored in a tightly packed form. This pointer counts as a reference to
      the SV so the reference count has been incremented when the &quot;SV
      *&quot; was placed here (this reference count business has to do with
      Perl's garbage collection mechanism -- don't worry if this doesn't mean
      much to you). This pointer is allowed to have the value &quot;NULL&quot;
      which means that there is no actual Perl SV for this data - for instance,
      the data might be allocated by a &quot;mmap&quot; operation. Note the use
      of an SV* was purely for convenience, it allows easy transformation of
      packed data from files into piddles. Other implementations are not
      excluded.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The actual pointer to data is stored in the member
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        void *data;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    which contains a pointer to a memory area with space for
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

    </pre>

      'long long' depending on whether your perl is 64bit or not.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The data type of the data is stored in the variable
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        int datatype;
    </pre>
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    the values for this member are given in the enum &quot;pdl_datatypes&quot;
      (see <i>pdl.h</i>). Currently we have byte, short, unsigned short, long,
      float and double types, see also PDL::Types.</dd>

    in the routine &quot;pdl_resize_defaultincs&quot; in &quot;pdlapi.c&quot;.
      What this means is that the dimincs can be used to calculate the offset by
      code like
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <pre>
        PDL_Indx offs = 0;

        }
    </pre>

      when freeing a piddle struct. The same applies for the threadids:

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Smart_references_and_transformations:_slicing_and_dicing"><a class="selflink" href="#Smart_references_and_transformations:_slicing_and_dicing">Smart
  references and transformations: slicing and dicing</a></h2>
Smart references and most other fundamental functions operating on piddles are
  implemented via <i>transformations</i> (as mentioned above) which are
  represented by the type &quot;pdl_trans&quot; in PDL.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A transformation links input and output piddles and contains all the
  infrastructure that defines how:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">output piddles are obtained from input piddles;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">changes in smartly linked output piddles (e.g. the
      <i>child</i> of a sliced <i>parent</i> piddle) are flown back to the input
      piddle in transformations where this is supported (the most often used
      example being &quot;slice&quot; here);</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">datatype and size of output piddles that need to be created
      are obtained.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In general, executing a PDL function on a group of piddles results in creation
  of a transformation of the requested type that links all input and output
  arguments (at least those that are piddles). In PDL functions that support
  data flow between input and output args (e.g. &quot;slice&quot;,
  &quot;index&quot;) this transformation links <i>parent</i> (input) and
  <i>child</i> (output) piddles permanently until either the link is explicitly
  broken by user request (&quot;sever&quot; at the Perl level) or all parents
  and children have been destroyed. In those cases the transformation is
  lazy-evaluated, e.g. only executed when piddle values are actually accessed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In <i>non-flowing</i> functions, for example addition (&quot;+&quot;) and inner
  products (&quot;inner&quot;), the transformation is installed just as in
  flowing functions but then the transformation is immediately executed and
  destroyed (breaking the link between input and output args) before the
  function returns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It should be noted that the close link between input and output args of a
  flowing function (like slice) requires that piddle objects that are linked in
  such a way be kept alive beyond the point where they have gone out of scope
  from the point of view of Perl:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $a = zeroes(20);
  $b = $a-&gt;slice('2:4');
  undef $a;    # last reference to $a is now destroyed
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although $a should now be destroyed according to Perl's rules the underlying
  &quot;pdl&quot; structure must actually only be freed when $b also goes out of
  scope (since it still references internally some of $a's data). This example
  demonstrates that such a dataflow paradigm between PDL objects necessitates a
  special destruction algorithm that takes the links between piddles into
  account and couples the lifespan of those objects. The non-trivial algorithm
  is implemented in the function &quot;pdl_destroy&quot; in <i>pdlapi.c</i>. In
  fact, most of the code in <i>pdlapi.c</i> and <i>pdlfamily.c</i> is concerned
  with making sure that piddles (&quot;pdl *&quot;s) are created, updated and
  freed at the right times depending on interactions with other piddles via PDL
  transformations (remember, &quot;pdl_trans&quot;).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Accessing_children_and_parents_of_a_piddle"><a class="selflink" href="#Accessing_children_and_parents_of_a_piddle">Accessing
  children and parents of a piddle</a></h2>
When piddles are dynamically linked via transformations as suggested above input
  and output piddles are referred to as parents and children, respectively.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An example of processing the children of a piddle is provided by the
  &quot;baddata&quot; method of PDL::Bad (only available if you have compiled
  PDL with the &quot;WITH_BADVAL&quot; option set to 1, but still useful as an
  example!).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Consider the following situation:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; $a = rvals(7,7,{Centre=&gt;[3,4]});
 pdl&gt; $b = $a-&gt;slice('2:4,3:5');
 pdl&gt; ? vars
 PDL variables in package main::
 Name         Type   Dimension       Flow  State          Mem
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 $a           Double D [7,7]                P            0.38Kb 
 $b           Double D [3,3]                -C           0.00Kb
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Now, if I suddenly decide that $a should be flagged as possibly containing bad
  values, using
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; $a-&gt;badflag(1)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
then I want the state of $b - it's <i>child</i> - to be changed as well (since
  it will either share or inherit some of $a's data and so be also <i>bad</i>),
  so that I get a 'B' in the <i>State</i> field:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl&gt; ? vars                    
 PDL variables in package main::
 Name         Type   Dimension       Flow  State          Mem
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 $a           Double D [7,7]                PB           0.38Kb 
 $b           Double D [3,3]                -CB          0.00Kb
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This bit of magic is performed by the &quot;propagate_badflag&quot; function,
  which is listed below:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /* newval = 1 means set flag, 0 means clear it */
 /* thanks to Christian Soeller for this */
 void propagate_badflag( pdl *it, int newval ) {
    PDL_DECL_CHILDLOOP(it)
    PDL_START_CHILDLOOP(it)
    {
        pdl_trans *trans = PDL_CHILDLOOP_THISCHILD(it);
        int i;
        for( i = trans-&gt;vtable-&gt;nparents;
             i &lt; trans-&gt;vtable-&gt;npdls;
             i++ ) {
            pdl *child = trans-&gt;pdls[i];
            if ( newval ) child-&gt;state |=  PDL_BADVAL;
            else          child-&gt;state &amp;= ~PDL_BADVAL;
            /* make sure we propagate to grandchildren, etc */
            propagate_badflag( child, newval );
        } /* for: i */
    }
    PDL_END_CHILDLOOP(it)
 } /* propagate_badflag */
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Given a piddle (&quot;pdl *it&quot;), the routine loops through each
  &quot;pdl_trans&quot; structure, where access to this structure is provided by
  the &quot;PDL_CHILDLOOP_THISCHILD&quot; macro. The <i>children</i> of the
  piddle are stored in the &quot;pdls&quot; array, after the <i>parents</i>,
  hence the loop from &quot;i = ...nparents&quot; to &quot;i = ...npdls -
  1&quot;. Once we have the pointer to the child piddle, we can do what we want
  to it; here we change the value of the &quot;state&quot; variable, but the
  details are unimportant). What <b>is</b> important is that we call
  &quot;propagate_badflag&quot; on this piddle, to ensure we loop through its
  children. This recursion ensures we get to all the <i>offspring</i> of a
  particular piddle.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Access to <i>parents</i> is similar, with the &quot;for&quot; loop replaced by:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        for( i = 0;
             i &lt; trans-&gt;vtable-&gt;nparents;
             i++ ) {
           /* do stuff with parent #i: trans-&gt;pdls[i] */
        }
</pre>

        void (*freeproc)(struct pdl_trans *);  /* Call to free this trans
                (in case we had to malloc some stuff for this trans) */
        pdl *pdls[NP]; /* The pdls involved in the transformation */
        int __datatype; /* the type of the transformation */
        /* in general more members

  };
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The transformation identifies all &quot;pdl&quot;s involved in the trans
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  pdl *pdls[NP];
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
with &quot;NP&quot; depending on the number of piddle args of the particular
  trans. It records a state
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  short flags;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
and the datatype
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  int __datatype;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
of the trans (to which all piddles must be converted unless they are explicitly
  typed, PDL functions created with PDL::PP make sure that these conversions are
  done as necessary). Most important is the pointer to the vtable (virtual
  table) that contains the actual functionality
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 pdl_transvtable *vtable;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The vtable structure in turn looks something like (slightly simplified from
  <i>pdl.h</i> for clarity)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  typedef struct pdl_transvtable {
        pdl_transtype transtype;
        int flags;
        int nparents;   /* number of parent pdls (input) */
        int npdls;      /* number of child pdls (output) */
        char *per_pdl_flags;  /* optimization flags */
        void (*redodims)(pdl_trans *tr);  /* figure out dims of children */
        void (*readdata)(pdl_trans *tr);  /* flow parents to children  */
        void (*writebackdata)(pdl_trans *tr); /* flow backwards */
        void (*freetrans)(pdl_trans *tr); /* Free both the contents and it of
                                        the trans member */
        pdl_trans *(*copy)(pdl_trans *tr); /* Full copy */
        int structsize;
        char *name; /* For debuggers, mostly */
  } pdl_transvtable;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We focus on the callback functions:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
        void (*redodims)(pdl_trans *tr);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;redodims&quot; will work out the dimensions of piddles that need to be
  created and is called from within the API function that should be called to
  ensure that the dimensions of a piddle are accessible ( <i>pdlapi.c</i>):
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   void pdl_make_physdims(pdl *it)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;readdata&quot; and &quot;writebackdata&quot; are responsible for the
  actual computations of the child data from the parents or parent data from
  those of the children, respectively (the dataflow aspect). The PDL core makes
  sure that these are called as needed when piddle data is accessed
  (lazy-evaluation). The general API function to ensure that a piddle is
  up-to-date is
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  void pdl_make_physvaffine(pdl *it)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
which should be called before accessing piddle data from XS/C (see
  <i>Core.xs</i> for some examples).
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;freetrans&quot; frees dynamically allocated memory associated with the
  trans as needed and &quot;copy&quot; can copy the transformation. Again,
  functions built with PDL::PP make sure that copying and freeing via these
  callbacks happens at the right times. (If they fail to do that we have got a
  memory leak -- this has happened in the past ;).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The transformation and vtable code is hardly ever written by hand but rather
  generated by PDL::PP from concise descriptions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Certain types of transformations can be optimized very efficiently obviating the
  need for explicit &quot;readdata&quot; and &quot;writebackdata&quot; methods.
  Those transformations are called <i>pdl_vaffine</i>. Most dimension
  manipulating functions (e.g., &quot;slice&quot;, &quot;xchg&quot;) belong to
  this class.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The basic trick is that parent and child of such a transformation work on the
  same (shared) block of data which they just choose to interpret differently
  (by using different &quot;dims&quot;, &quot;dimincs&quot; and &quot;offs&quot;
  on the same data, compare the &quot;pdl&quot; structure above). Each operation
  on a piddle sharing data with another one in this way is therefore
  automatically flown from child to parent and back -- after all they are
  reading and writing the same block of memory. This is currently not Perl
  thread safe -- no big loss since the whole PDL core is not reentrant (Perl
  threading &quot;!=&quot; PDL threading!).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Signatures:_threading_over_elementary_operations"><a class="selflink" href="#Signatures:_threading_over_elementary_operations">Signatures:
  threading over elementary operations</a></h2>
Most of that functionality of PDL threading (automatic iteration of elementary
  operations over multi-dim piddles) is implemented in the file
  <i>pdlthread.c</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The PDL::PP generated functions (in particular the &quot;readdata&quot; and
  &quot;writebackdata&quot; callbacks) use this infrastructure to make sure that
  the fundamental operation implemented by the trans is performed in agreement
  with PDL's threading semantics.

  new PDL functions -- Glue code generation</a></h2>
Please, see PDL::PP and examples in the PDL distribution. Implementation and
  syntax are currently far from perfect but it does a good job!
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="The_Core_struct"><a class="selflink" href="#The_Core_struct">The
  Core struct</a></h2>
As discussed in PDL::API, PDL uses a pointer to a structure to allow PDL modules
  access to its core routines. The definition of this structure (the
  &quot;Core&quot; struct) is in <i>pdlcore.h</i> (created by
  <i>pdlcore.h.PL</i> in <i>Basic/Core</i>) and looks something like
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 /* Structure to hold pointers core PDL routines so as to be used by 
  * many modules
  */
 struct Core {
    I32    Version;
    pdl*   (*SvPDLV)      ( SV*  );
    void   (*SetSV_PDL)   ( SV *sv, pdl *it );
 #if defined(PDL_clean_namespace) || defined(PDL_OLD_API)
    pdl*   (*new)      ( );     /* make it work with gimp-perl */
 #else
    pdl*   (*pdlnew)      ( );  /* renamed because of C++ clash */
 #endif
    pdl*   (*tmp)         ( );
    pdl*   (*create)      (int type);
    void   (*destroy)     (pdl *it);
    ...
 }
 typedef struct Core Core;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The first field of the structure (&quot;Version&quot;) is used to ensure
  consistency between modules at run time; the following code is placed in the
  BOOT section of the generated xs code:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
 if (PDL-&gt;Version != PDL_CORE_VERSION)
   Perl_croak(aTHX_ &quot;Foo needs to be recompiled against the newly installed PDL&quot;);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you add a new field to the <i>Core</i> struct you should:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">discuss it on the pdl porters email list
      (pdl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net) [with the possibility of making your
      changes to a separate branch of the CVS tree if it's a change that will
      take time to complete]</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">increase by 1 the value of the $pdl_core_version variable
      in <i>pdlcore.h.PL</i>. This sets the value of the
      &quot;PDL_CORE_VERSION&quot; C macro used to populate the Version
    field</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">add documentation (e.g. to PDL::API) if it's a
      &quot;useful&quot; function for external module writers (as well as
      ensuring the code is as well documented as the rest of PDL ;)</dd>
