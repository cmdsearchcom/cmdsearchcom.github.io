<p>dotlock(1) Mail Avenger 0.8.4 dotlock(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
dotlock - execute a command with a lock on a mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
dotlock [-LPW] mbox-file command [arg ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
dotlock acquires a lock on the mailbox file mbox-file using
both flock and a lock file, then executes command with any
arguments specified. When command exits, dotlock releases
<br>
the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dotlock attempts to clean up
stale lockfiles. If it succeeds in locking an mbox-file with
flock, and roughly 30 seconds elapse without there being any
changes to mbox-file or <br>
the lockfile, then dotlock will delete the lockfile and try
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While it holds a lock, lockfile
will keep updating the modification time of the lockfile
every 15 seconds, to prevent the lock from getting cleaned
up in the event that command <br>
is slow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTION <br>
--noflock (-L) <br>
Ordinarily, dotlock uses both flock and dotfile locking. (It
uses flock first, but releases that lock in the even that
dotfile locking fails, so as to avoid deadlocking with <br>
applications that proceed in the reverse order.) The -L
option disables flock locking, so that dotlock only uses
dotfile locking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is primarily useful as a
wrapper around an application that already does flock
locking, but to which you want to add dotfile locking. (Even
if your mail delivery system <br>
doesn&rsquo;t use flock, flock actually improves the
efficiency of dotlock, so there is no reason to disable
it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fcntl (-P) <br>
This option enables fcntl (a.k.a. POSIX) file locking of
mail spools, in addition to flock and dotfile locking. The
advantage of fcntl locking is that it may do the right <br>
thing over NFS. However, if either the NFS client or server
does not properly support fcntl locking, or if the file
system is not mounted with the appropriate options, fcntl
<br>
locking can fail in one of several ways. It can allow
different processes to lock the same file concurrently--even
on the same machine. It can simply hang when trying to <br>
acquire a lock, even if no other process holds a lock on the
file. Also, on some OSes it can interact badly with flock
locking, because those OSes actually implement flock <br>
in terms of fcntl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nowait (-W) <br>
With this option, dotlock simply exits non-zero and does not
run command if it cannot immediately acquire the lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Mail Avenger home page:
&lt;http://www.mailavenger.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
dotlock does not perform fcntl/lockf-style locking by
default. Thus, if your mail reader exclusively uses fcntl
for locking, there will be race conditions unless you
specify the <br>
--fcntl option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flock does not work over network
file systems. Thus, because of dotlock&rsquo;s mechanism for
cleaning stale lock files, there is a possibility that a
network outage could lead to a <br>
race condition where the lockfile is cleared before command
finishes executing. If lockfile detects that the lock has
been stolen, it prints a message to standard error, but <br>
does not do anything else (like try to kill command).</p>
