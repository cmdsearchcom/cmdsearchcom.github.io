dotlock - execute a command with a lock on a mailbox
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
dotlock [-LPW] <i>mbox-file</i> <i>command</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
dotlock acquires a lock on the mailbox file <i>mbox-file</i> using both
  <i>flock</i> and a lock file, then executes <i>command</i> with any arguments
  specified. When <i>command</i> exits, dotlock releases the lock.
<div class="Pp"></div>
dotlock attempts to clean up stale lockfiles. If it succeeds in locking an
  <i>mbox-file</i> with <i>flock</i>, and roughly 30 seconds elapse without
  there being any changes to <i>mbox-file</i> or the lockfile, then dotlock will
  delete the lockfile and try again.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While it holds a lock, lockfile will keep updating the modification time of the
  lockfile every 15 seconds, to prevent the lock from getting cleaned up in the
  event that <i>command</i> is slow.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--noflock</b> (<b>-L</b>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Ordinarily, dotlock uses both flock and dotfile locking.
      (It uses flock first, but releases that lock in the even that dotfile
      locking fails, so as to avoid deadlocking with applications that proceed
      in the reverse order.) The <b>-L</b> option disables flock locking, so
      that dotlock only uses dotfile locking.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This is primarily useful as a wrapper around an application that already
      does flock locking, but to which you want to add dotfile locking. (Even if
      your mail delivery system doesn't use flock, flock actually improves the
      efficiency of dotlock, so there is no reason to disable it.)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--fcntl</b> (<b>-P</b>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This option enables fcntl (a.k.a. POSIX) file locking of
      mail spools, in addition to flock and dotfile locking. The advantage of
      fcntl locking is that it may do the right thing over NFS. However, if
      either the NFS client or server does not properly support fcntl locking,
      or if the file system is not mounted with the appropriate options, fcntl
      locking can fail in one of several ways. It can allow different processes
      to lock the same file concurrently--even on the same machine. It can
      simply hang when trying to acquire a lock, even if no other process holds
      a lock on the file. Also, on some OSes it can interact badly with flock
      locking, because those OSes actually implement flock in terms of
    fcntl.</dd>

  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--nowait</b> (<b>-W</b>)</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">With this option, dotlock simply exits non-zero and does
      not run <i>command</i> if it cannot immediately acquire the lock.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
dotlock does not perform <i>fcntl</i>/<i>lockf</i>-style locking by default.
  Thus, if your mail reader exclusively uses <i>fcntl</i> for locking, there
  will be race conditions unless you specify the <b>--fcntl</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>flock</i> does not work over network file systems. Thus, because of dotlock's
  mechanism for cleaning stale lock files, there is a possibility that a network
  outage could lead to a race condition where the lockfile is cleared before
  <i>command</i> finishes executing. If lockfile detects that the lock has been
  stolen, it prints a message to standard error, but does not do anything else
  (like try to kill <i>command</i>).
