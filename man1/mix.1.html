<p>MIX(1) BSD General Commands Manual MIX(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mix &acirc; The software project management tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mix [TASK] [project_name] <br>
elixir [OPTIONS] -S mix [TASK] [project_name]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mix is intended for both organizing code into projects and
their maintenance. For the latter the tool offers some
advanced features like dependency management, packaging,
preparing <br>
documentation, testing and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Have a look at the SYNOPSIS
section and the second way of running mix it offers. The
point is that the tool is none other than the Elixir script,
therefore it can be invoked via <br>
elixir(1) in the same way as any other script. It&rsquo;s
useful when you want to run mix with particular options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFINITIONS <br>
All the mix functionality is represented by a set of tasks.
A task is a piece of code written in Elixir and intended for
solving a particular problem. Like programs, many tasks <br>
accept input parameters and/or support options which
slightly modify their behaviour, but others do not. There
are two types of tasks: those that are available after
installation <br>
this or that archive (local tasks) and those that are
offered by mix (built-in tasks). The run task will be
executed by default if none other has been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In spite of the fact that the
greater part of mix is tasks, the man page doesn&rsquo;t
contain the help information related to each of them because
mix is self-descriptive. Thus, using <br>
the help task, you can get both the full list of
local/built-in tasks and the information related to a
particular task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An archive, in terms of Erlang,
is the ZIP file with the .ez extension which contains a
precompiled Erlang application with all its
dependencies[1].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An application is an entity that
helps to combine sets of components into a single unit to
simplify their reusing in other systems[2].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
MIX_ARCHIVES <br>
Allows specifying the directory into which the archives
should be installed (see mix help archive.install). The
~/.mix/archives directory is used for this purpose by <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIX_DEBUG <br>
When set, outputs debug information about each task before
running it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIX_ENV <br>
Allows specifying which environment should be used. The dev
environment is used by default if none other has been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you have to use a
particular set of configuration parameter values or perform
particular steps when you compile or run a project (or in
some other cases). The <br>
mix environments allow grouping values of configuration
parameters and steps to switch between them by specifying
the necessary environment via MIX_ENV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIX_EXS <br>
Allows changing the full path to the mix.exs file (see FILES
section). The most obvious use case is to have more than one
copy of mix.exs in a project, but it&rsquo;s worth
not&acirc; <br>
ing that MIX_EXS should be used only if the mix environments
(see above) are not enough to solve the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIX_HOME <br>
Stores configuration files and scripts shared by multiple
mix implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the Mix.Utils.mix_home/0
function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIX_PATH <br>
Allows expanding the code path. If the MIX_PATH environment
variable has a value which consists of multiple paths, they
must be colon-separated (for Unix-like operating <br>
systems) or semicolon-separated (for Windows).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As has already been mentioned
above, there are two types of tasks: local and built-in.
These tasks are always visible for mix because the
directories, in which they are <br>
located, are a part of code path. If a task belongs to
neither the one type nor the other, MIX_PATH helps you say
to mix where it should search the task.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the :code.get_path/0
function to get the list of paths which are a part of the
code path by default and the Mix.Utils.mix_paths/0 function
to get the list of paths <br>
specified in the MIX_PATH value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MIX_QUIET <br>
When set, does not print information messages to the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
mix.exs <br>
Contains the most significant information related to the
project, such as its name, version, list of dependencies and
so on. As a rule, the file is named mix.exs and <br>
located at the top of the project&rsquo;s source tree, but
you can change the full path to it using the MIX_EXS
environment variable (see the ENVIRONMENT section).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mix.lock <br>
Allows locking down the project dependencies with a proper
version range before performing any updates. It is useful
when you know that your project is incompatible with <br>
newer versions of certain dependencies. The file is located
at the top of the project&rsquo;s source tree as well as
mix.exs (see above).</p>
