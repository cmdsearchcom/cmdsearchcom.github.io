<p>FREEZE(1) General Commands Manual FREEZE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
freeze, unfreeze, melt, fcat - compress and uncompress
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
freeze [ -cdfvVgx ] [ filename | type ... ] <br>
unfreeze [ -cfvV ] [ filename ... ] <br>
melt [ -cfvV ] [ filename ... ] <br>
fcat [ filename ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Compresses the specified files or standard input. Each file
is replaced by a file with the extension .F, but only if the
file got smaller. If no files are specified, the com&acirc;
<br>
pression is applied to the standard input and is written to
standard output regardless of the results. Compressed files
can be restored to their original form by specifying the
<br>
-d option, or by running melt or unfreeze (both linked to
freeze), on the .F files or the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the output file exists, it
will not be overwritten unless the -f flag is given. If -f
is not specified and freeze is run in the foreground, the
user is prompted as to whether <br>
the file should be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -g flag is given, a
slightly less powerful (compression rate is 1.5% less), but
somewhat faster heuristic is used. This flag can be used
more than once (this mode is quite <br>
useful when freezing bitmaps) for additional speedup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to improve
compression rate at the cost of speed, use -x flag. It means
&quot;maximum compression&quot; (the speed may degrade
substantially when freezing bitmaps).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -f flag is given, all
files specified are replaced with .F files - even if the
file didn&rsquo;t get smaller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When file names are given, the
ownership (if run by root), modes, accessed and modified
times are maintained between the file and its .F version. In
this respect, freeze can be <br>
used for archival purposes, yet can still be used with
make(1) after melting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -c option causes the results
of the freeze/melt operation to be written to stdout; no
files are changed. The fcat program is the same as
specifying -c to melt (all files are <br>
unpacked and written to stdout).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -v (verbose) option causes
the diagnostics (at the end of each file processing) to be
printed to stderr, and the -vv option causes the progress
indicator to be drawn to the <br>
same place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type is a token preceded by a
&rsquo;+&rsquo; or a &rsquo;--&rsquo;, which defines the
type of following files in the command string. An explicite
definition of the file&rsquo;s type can give up to 2% of
<br>
additional compression. The list of types is stored in file
/usr/lib/freeze.cnf. Types may be abbreviated while not
ambigious. You can also determine values for the static <br>
Huffman table by using a list of 8 numbers separated by
commas instead of type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Freeze uses the Lempel-Ziv
algorithm on the first pass and the dynamic Huffman
algorithm on the second one. The size of sliding window is
8K, and the maximum length of matched <br>
string is 256. The positions on the window are coded using a
static Huffman table.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A two byte magic number is
prepended to the file to ensure that neither melting of
random text nor refreezing of already frozen text are
attempted. In addition, the characteris&acirc; <br>
tics of the static Huffman table being used during freeze is
written to the file so that these characteristics may be
adapted to concrete conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The amount of compression
obtained depends on the size of the input file and the
distribution of character substrings and their
probabilities. Typically, text files, such as C <br>
programs, are reduced by 60-75%, executable files are
reduced by 50%. Compression is generally much better than
that achieved by LZW coding (as used in compress), or
Huffman <br>
coding (pack), though takes more time to compute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -V (version) flag is
given, the program&rsquo;s version number and compilation
options are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status is normally 0;
if the last file gets bigger after freezing, the exit status
is 2; if an error occurs, the exit status is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Unknown flag: &Acirc;&acute;x&Acirc;&acute;; Usage: freeze
[-cdfvVg] [file|+type ...] <br>
Invalid options were specified on the command line. <br>
file: not in frozen format <br>
The specified file has not been frozen. <br>
file: already has .F suffix -- no change <br>
Cannot compress a file that has a &quot;.F&quot; suffix.
mv(1) the file to a different name and try again. <br>
file: filename too long to tack on .F <br>
The specified file cannot be compressed because its filename
is longer than 12 characters. mv(1) the file to a different
name and try again. This message does not occur <br>
on 4.XBSD systems. <br>
file already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)? <br>
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be
replaced; &quot;n&quot; if you want it to be left alone.
<br>
file: xx% <br>
or <br>
xxxK <br>
These message fragments are written during the processing of
a file, if -vv option was given in the command line (in
percents, if the length of file being processed is <br>
known; in Kbytes otherwise). <br>
Freezing: xx.xx% (y.yy bits) <br>
This message fragment gives the percentage of the input file
that has been saved by freezing and the number of remaining
bits per byte of original file. <br>
-- not a regular file: unchanged <br>
This message fragment is written when the input file is not
a regular file. The input file is left unchanged. <br>
-- has xx other links: unchanged <br>
This message fragment is written when the input file has
links. The input file is left unchanged. See ln(1) for more
information. <br>
-- file unchanged <br>
This message fragment is written when no savings are
achieved by freezing. The input file is left unchanged. <br>
-- replaced with file <br>
This message fragment is written when a file has been
sucessfully frozen/melt. <br>
Using &quot; type &quot; type <br>
This message indicates a successful switching to position
table for mentioned file type. <br>
&quot; xxx &quot; - no such file type <br>
or <br>
xxx - a list of 8 numbers expected <br>
This message means the given file type does not exist or the
given string contains a comma, but is not a valid list of
values for static Huffman table. <br>
melt: corrupt input <br>
This message fragment is written when an error in header or
unexpected end of frozen file is detected. Partial (or
empty, is there was an error in the header) file is <br>
created. <br>
already frozen -- file unchanged <br>
This message fragment is written when an input file already
has Freeze&rsquo;s magic header. <br>
Invalid position table <br>
or <br>
&quot; type &quot; - invalid entry <br>
These messages appear only if Freeze has been made with
incorrect data for static Huffman table. It does never
appear when freeze is called from a public access
direc&acirc; <br>
tory. <br>
Unknown header format <br>
Unknown values of flag bits were discovered in the header of
frozen file.</p>
