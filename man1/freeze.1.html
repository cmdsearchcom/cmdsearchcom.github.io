freeze, unfreeze, melt, fcat - compress and uncompress files
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>freeze</b> [ <b>-cdfvVgx</b> ] [ <i>filename | type ...</i> ]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<b>unfreeze</b> [ <b>-cfvV</b> ] [ <i>filename ...</i> ]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>

<b>fcat</b> [ <i>filename ...</i> ]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Compresses the specified files or standard input. Each file is replaced by a
  file with the extension <b>.F,</b> but only if the file got smaller. If no
  files are specified, the compression is applied to the standard input and is
  written to standard output regardless of the results. Compressed files can be
  restored to their original form by specifying the <b>-d</b> option, or by
  running <i>melt</i> or <i>unfreeze</i> (both linked to <i>freeze</i>), on the
  <b>.F</b> files or the standard input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the output file exists, it will not be overwritten unless the <b>-f</b> flag
  is given. If <b>-f</b> is not specified and <i>freeze</i> is run in the
  foreground, the user is prompted as to whether the file should be overwritten.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-g</b> flag is given, a slightly less powerful (compression rate is
  1.5% less), but somewhat faster heuristic is used. This flag can be used more
  than once (this mode is quite useful when freezing bitmaps) for additional
  speedup.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to improve compression rate at the cost of speed, use <b>-x</b>
  flag. It means &quot;maximum compression&quot; (the speed may degrade
  substantially when freezing bitmaps).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-f</b> flag is given, all files specified are replaced with <b>.F</b>
  files - even if the file didn't get smaller.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When file names are given, the ownership (if run by root), modes, accessed and
  modified times are maintained between the file and its <b>.F</b> version. In
  this respect, <i>freeze</i> can be used for archival purposes, yet can still
  be used with <i>make</i>(1) after melting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-c</b> option causes the results of the freeze/melt operation to be
  written to stdout; no files are changed. The <i>fcat</i> program is the same
  as specifying <b>-c</b> to <i>melt</i> (all files are unpacked and written to
  stdout).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-v</b> (verbose) option causes the diagnostics (at the end of each file
  processing) to be printed to stderr, and the <b>-vv</b> option causes the
  progress indicator to be drawn to the same place.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Type</i> is a token preceded by a '+' or a '--', which defines the type of
  following files in the command string. An explicite definition of the file's
  type can give up to 2% of additional compression. The list of types is stored
  in file <i>/usr/lib/freeze.cnf</i>. Types may be abbreviated while not
  ambigious. You can also determine values for the static Huffman table by using
  a list of 8 numbers separated by commas instead of <i>type.</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Freeze</i> uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm on the first pass and the dynamic
  Huffman algorithm on the second one. The size of sliding window is 8K, and the
  maximum length of matched string is 256. The positions on the window are coded
  using a static Huffman table.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A two byte magic number is prepended to the file to ensure that neither melting
  of random text nor refreezing of already frozen text are attempted. In
  addition, the characteristics of the static Huffman table being used during
  <i>freeze</i> is written to the file so that these characteristics may be
  adapted to concrete conditions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input file and the
  distribution of character substrings and their probabilities. Typically, text
  files, such as C programs, are reduced by 60-75%, executable files are reduced
  by 50%. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by LZW coding
  (as used in <i>compress</i>), or Huffman coding (<i>pack</i>), though takes
  more time to compute.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-V</b> (version) flag is given, the program's version number and
  compilation options are printed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The exit status is normally 0; if the last file gets bigger after freezing, the
  exit status is 2; if an error occurs, the exit status is 1.

Unknown flag: <i>&#x00B4;x&#x00B4;;</i> Usage: freeze [-cdfvVg] [file|+type ...]
<br/>
Invalid options were specified on the command line.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: not in frozen format
<br/>
The specified file has not been frozen.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: already has .F suffix -- no change
<br/>
Cannot compress a file that has a &quot;.F&quot; suffix. <i>mv</i>(1) the file
  to a different name and try again.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: filename too long to tack on .F
<br/>
The specified file cannot be compressed because its filename is longer than 12
  characters. <i>mv</i>(1) the file to a different name and try again. This
  message does not occur on 4.XBSD systems.
<br/>
<i>file</i> already exists; do you wish to overwrite (y or n)?
<br/>
Respond &quot;y&quot; if you want the output file to be replaced; &quot;n&quot;
  if you want it to be left alone.
<br/>
<i>file</i>: <i>xx</i>%
<br/>
or
<br/>
<i>xxx</i>K
<br/>
These message fragments are written during the processing of a file, if
  <b>-vv</b> option was given in the command line (in percents, if the length of
  file being processed is known; in Kbytes otherwise).
<br/>
Freezing: <i>xx.xx% (y.yy</i> bits)
<br/>
This message fragment gives the percentage of the input file that has been saved
  by freezing and the number of remaining bits per byte of original file.
<br/>
-- not a regular file: unchanged
<br/>
This message fragment is written when the input file is not a regular file. The
  input file is left unchanged.
<br/>
-- has <i>xx</i> other links: unchanged
<br/>
This message fragment is written when the input file has links. The input file
  is left unchanged. See <i>ln</i>(1) for more information.
<br/>
-- file unchanged
<br/>
This message fragment is written when no savings are achieved by freezing. The
  input file is left unchanged.
<br/>
-- replaced with <i>file</i>
<br/>
This message fragment is written when a file has been sucessfully frozen/melt.
<br/>
Using &quot; <i>type</i> &quot; type
<br/>
This message indicates a successful switching to position table for mentioned
  file type.
<br/>
&quot; <i>xxx</i> &quot; - no such file type
<br/>
or
<br/>
<i>xxx</i> - a list of 8 numbers expected
<br/>
This message means the given file type does not exist or the given string
  contains a comma, but is not a valid list of values for static Huffman table.
<br/>
melt: corrupt input
<br/>
This message fragment is written when an error in header or unexpected end of
  frozen file is detected. Partial (or empty, is there was an error in the
  header) file is created.
<br/>
already frozen -- file unchanged
<br/>
This message fragment is written when an input file already has Freeze's magic
  header.
<br/>
Invalid position table
<br/>
or
<br/>
&quot; <i>type</i> &quot; - invalid entry
<br/>
These messages appear only if Freeze has been made with incorrect data for
  static Huffman table. It does never appear when freeze is called from a public
  access directory.
<br/>
Unknown header format
<br/>
Unknown values of flag bits were discovered in the header of frozen file.
