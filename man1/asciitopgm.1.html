<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
asciitopgm - convert ASCII graphics into a PGM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
asciitopgm [-d divisor] height width [asciifile]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program is part of Netpbm(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asciitopgm reads ASCII data as
input and produces a PGM image with pixel values which are
an approximation of the &rsquo;brightness&rsquo; of the
ASCII characters, assuming black-on-white <br>
printing. In other words, a capital M is very dark, a period
is very light, and a space is white.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Obviously, asciitopgm assumes a
certain font in assigning a brightness value to a
character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">asciitopgm considers ASCII
control characters to be all white. For a lower case
character, It assigns a special brightnesses which has
nothing to do with what it looks like <br>
printed. asciitopgm takes the ASCII character code from the
lower 7 bits of each input byte. But it warns you if the
most significant bit of any input byte is not zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output image is height
pixels high by width pixels wide, truncating and padding
with white on the right and bottom as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The divisor value is an integer
(decimal) by which the blackness of an input character is
divided; the default value is 1. You can use this to adjust
the brightness of the out&acirc; <br>
put: for example, if the image is too bright, increase the
divisor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a sort of reminiscence of
Fortran line printer carriage control, where a line starts
with + (plus), asciitopgm combines it with the previous row
of output instead of generat&acirc; <br>
ing a new row. This allows a larger range of gray values.
(In Fortran carriage control, the first character of every
line sent to the printer tells how much to advance the <br>
paper, with + meaning not at all, so that the rest of the
characters on the line overstrike the ones already on the
paper. What asciitopgm does is rather different in that
asci&acirc; <br>
itopgm does not reserve the first character of every line
that way. If the first character is anything but +,
asciitopgm considers it just to be first character of the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re looking for
something that creates an image of text, with that text
specified in ASCII, that is something quite different. Use
pbmtext for that.</p>
