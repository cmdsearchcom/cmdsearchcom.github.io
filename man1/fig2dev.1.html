<p>FIG2DEV(1) General Commands Manual FIG2DEV(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fig2dev - translates Fig code to various graphics
languages</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fig2dev -L language [ -m mag ] [ -f font ] [ -s fsize ] [
other options ] [ fig-file [ out-file ] ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fig2dev translates fig code in the named fig-file into the
specified graphics language and puts them in out-file. The
default fig-file and out-file are standard input and
stan&acirc; <br>
dard output, respectively</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xfig (Facility for Interactive
Generation of figures) is a screen-oriented tool which runs
under the X Window System, and allows the user to draw and
manipulate objects interac&acirc; <br>
tively. This version of fig2dev is compatible with xfig
versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Xfig version 3.2.3 and later
saves and allows the user to edit comments for each Fig
object. These comments are output with several of the output
languages, such as PostScript, <br>
CGM, EMF, LaTeX, MetaFont, PicTeX, (as % comments), tk (as #
comments), and pic (as .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GENERAL OPTIONS (all drivers)
<br>
-L language <br>
Set the output graphics language. Valid languages are box,
cgm, epic, eepic, eepicemu, emf, eps, gbx (Gerber beta
driver), gif, ibmgl, jpeg, latex, map (HTML image map), <br>
mf (MetaFont), mp (MetaPost), mmp (Multi-MetaPost), pcx,
pdf, pdftex, pdftex_t, pic, pictex, png, ppm, ps, pstex,
pstex_t, pstricks, ptk (Perl/tk), shape (LaTeX shaped <br>
paragraphs), sld (AutoCad slide format), svg (beta driver),
textyl, tiff, tk (tcl/tk), tpic, xbm and xpm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes: <br>
dvips and xdvi must be compiled with the tpic support
(-DTPIC) for epic, eepic and tpic to work. <br>
You must have ghostscript and ps2pdf, which comes with the
ghostscript distribution to get the pdf output and the
bitmap formats (png, jpeg, etc.), and the netpbm (pbm&acirc;
<br>
plus) package to get gif, xbm, xpm, and sld output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print help message with all
options for all output languages then exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the program version
number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D +/-rangelist <br>
With +rangelist, keep only those depths in the list. With
-rangelist, keep all depths except those in the list. The
rangelist may be a list of comma-separated numbers or <br>
ranges separated by colon (:). For example, -D
+10,40,55:70,80 means keep only layers 10, 40, 55 through
70, and 80.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K The selection of the depths
with the &rsquo;-D +/-rangelist&rsquo; option does normally
not affect the calcualtion of the bounding box. Thus the
generated document might have a much <br>
larger bounding box than necessary. If -K is given then the
bounding box is adjusted to include only those objects in
the selected depths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f font <br>
Set the default font used for text objects to font. The
default is Roman; the format of this option depends on the
graphics language in use. In TeX-based languages, the <br>
font is the base of the name given in lfonts.tex, for
instance &quot;cmr&quot; for Roman, or &quot;tt&quot; for
teletype. In PostScript, it is any font name known to the
printer or inter&acirc; <br>
preter. For Gerber it has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G minor[:major][:unit] <br>
Draws a grid on the page. Specify thin, or thin and thick
line spacing in one of several units. For example, &quot;-G
.25:1cm&quot; draws a thin, gray line every .25 cm and a
<br>
thicker gray line every 1 cm. Specifying &quot;-G 1in&quot;
draws a thin line every 1 inch. Fractions may be used, e.g.
&quot;-G 1/16:1/2in&quot; will draw a thin line every 1/16
inch <br>
(0.0625 inch) and a thick line every 1/2 inch. <br>
Allowable units are: i, in, inch, f, ft, feet, c, cm, mm,
and m. <br>
Only allowed for PostScript, EPS, PDF, and bitmap (GIF,
JPEG, etc) drivers for now.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Enable the I18N
internationalization facility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mag Set the magnification at
which the figure is rendered to mag. The default is 1.0.
This may not be used with the maxdimension option (-Z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s size <br>
Set the default font size (in points) for text objects to
fsize. The default is 11*mag, and thus is scaled by the -m
option. If there is no scaling, the default font is <br>
eleven point Roman.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z maxdimension <br>
Scale the figure so that the maximum dimension (width or
height) is maxdimension inches or cm, depending on whether
the figure was saved with imperial or metric units. <br>
This may not be used with the magnification option (-m).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other options <br>
The other options are specific to the choice of graphics
language, as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CGM OPTIONS <br>
CGM is Computer Graphics Metafile, developed by ISO and ANSI
and is a vector-based plus bitmap language. Microsoft WORD,
PowerPoint and probably other products can import this <br>
format and display it on the screen, something that they
won&rsquo;t do with EPS files that have an ASCII
preview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b dummyarg <br>
Generate binary output (dummy argument required after the
&quot;-b&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Position arrowheads for CGM
viewers that display rounded arrowheads. Normally,
arrowheads are pointed, so fig2dev compensates for this by
moving the endpoint of the line <br>
back so the tip of the arrowhead ends where the original
endpoint of the line was. If the -r option is used, the
position of arrows will NOT be corrected for compensating
<br>
line width effects, because the rounded arrowhead
doesn&rsquo;t extend beyond the endpoint of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EMF OPTIONS <br>
EMF is Enhanced Metafile, developed by Microsoft and is a
vector-based plus bitmap language. Microsoft WORD,
PowerPoint and probably other products can import this
format and <br>
display it on the screen, something that they won&rsquo;t do
with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EPIC OPTIONS <br>
EPIC is an enhancement to LaTeX picture drawing environment.
It was developed by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer
Science in S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EEPIC is an extension to EPIC
and LaTeX picture drawing environment which uses tpic
specials as a graphics mechanism. It was written by Conrad
Kwok of Division of Computer Sci&acirc; <br>
ence at University of California, Davis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation
package which does not use tpic specials.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A factor <br>
Scale arrowheads by factor. The width and height of
arrowheads is divided by this factor. This is because EPIC
arrowheads are normally about double the size of TeX <br>
arrowheads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E num Set encoding for text
translation (0 = none, 1 = ISO-8859-1, 2 = ISO-8859-2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t set the font
face, series, and style; only set it&rsquo;s size and the
baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters
when it puts some text. The disadvan&acirc; <br>
tage is that you can&rsquo;t set the font from your LaTeX
document. With this option on, you can set the font from
your LaTeX document (like &quot;hape input
picture.eepic&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any of the pictures included
in your LaTeX document has been generated with -F, then all
pictures must be generated with this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be used only
when fig2dev was compiled with NFSS defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l width <br>
Use &quot;hicklines&quot; when width of the line is wider
than lwidth. The default is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Generate a complete LaTeX
file. In other words, the output file can be formatted
without requiring any changes. The additional text inserted
in the beginning and at the <br>
end of the file is controlled by the configuration parameter
&quot;Preamble&quot; and &quot;Postamble&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Allow rotated text. Rotated
text will be set usingotatebox command. So, you will need to
include the &quot;sepackage{graphics}&quot; in the preamble
of your LaTeX document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not set, then
rotated text will be set horizontally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S scale <br>
Set the scale to which the figure is rendered. This option
automatically sets the magnification and size to scale / 12
and scale respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t stretch <br>
Set the stretch factor of dashed lines to sretch. The
default is 30.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Include comments in the
output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Enable variable line width.
By default, only two line widths are available: The normal
line width (hinlines), and thick lines (hicklines), if a
line width of more than <br>
one is selected in xfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Disable variable line width.
Only &quot;hicklines&quot; and/or &quot;hinlines&quot;
commands will be generated in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When variable line width option
is enabled, &quot;hinlines&quot; command is still used when
line width is less than LineThick. One potential problem is
that the width of &quot;hin&acirc; <br>
lines&quot; is 0.4pt but the resolution of Fig is 1/80 inch
(approx. 1pt). If LineThick is set to 2, normal lines will
be drawn in 0.4pt wide lines but the next line width is <br>
already 2pt. One possible solution is to set LineThick to 1
and set the width of the those lines you want to be drawn in
&quot;hinlines&quot; to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to this problem, Variable
line width VarWidth is defaulted to be false.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IBM-GL (HP/GL) OPTIONS <br>
IBM-GL (IBM Graphics Language) is compatible with HP-GL
(Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Select ISO A4 (ANSI A) paper
size if the default is ANSI A (ISO A4) paper size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Generate instructions for an
IBM 6180 Color Plotter with (without) an IBM Graphics
Enhancement Cartridge (IBM-GEC).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d xll,yll,xur,yur <br>
Restrict plotting to a rectangular area of the plotter paper
which has a lower left hand corner at (xll,yll) and a upper
right hand corner at (xur,yur). All four numbers <br>
are in inches and follow -d in a comma-sparated list -
xll,yll,xur,yur - with no spaces between them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f file <br>
Load text character specifications from the table in the
fonts file. The table must have 36 entries - one for each
font plus a default. Each entry consists of 5 numbers <br>
which specify the 1.) standard character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9,
30 - 39), 2.) alternate character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 -
39), 3.) character slant angle (degrees), 4.) charac&acirc;
<br>
ter width scale factor and 5.) character height scale
factor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Precede output with PCL
command to use HP/GL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l pattfile <br>
Load area fill line patterns from the table in the pattfile
file. The table must have 21 entries - one for each of the
area fill patterns. Each entry consists of 5 num&acirc; <br>
bers which specify the 1.) pattern number (-1 - 6), 2.)
pattern length (inches), 3.) fill type (1 - 5), 4.) fill
spacing (inches) and 5.) fill angle (degrees).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m mag,x0,y0 <br>
The magnification may appear as the first element in a comma
separated list - mag,x0,y0 - where the second and third
parameters specify an offset in inches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Rotate the figure to portrait
mode. The default is landscape mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p penfile <br>
Load plotter pen specifications from the table in the
penfile file. The table must have 9 entries - one for each
color plus a default. Each entry consists of 2 numbers <br>
which specify the 1.) pen number (1 - 8) and 2.) pen
thickness (millimeters).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S speed <br>
Set the pen speed to speed (centimeters/second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Plot the figure upside-down
in portrait mode or backwards in landscape mode. This allows
you to write on the top surface of overhead transparencies
without disturbing the <br>
plotter ink on the bottom surface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fig2dev may be installed with
either ANSI A or ISO A4 default paper size. The -a option
selects the alternate paper size. Fig2dev does not fill
closed splines. The IBM-GEC is <br>
required to fill other polygons. Fig2dev may be installed
for plotters with or without the IBM-GEC. The -c option
selects the alternate instruction set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS COMMON TO ALL BITMAP
FORMATS <br>
-b borderwidth <br>
Make blank border around figure of width borderwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Use correct font sizes
(points, 1/72 inch) instead of the traditional size that
xfig/fig2dev uses, which is (1/80 inch). The corresponding
xfig command-line option is <br>
-correct_font_size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g color <br>
Use color for the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Convert all colors to
grayscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S smoothfactor <br>
This will smooth the output by passing smoothfactor to
ghostscript in the -dTextAlphaBits and -dGraphicsAlphaBits
options to improve font rendering and graphic smoothing.
<br>
A value of 2 for smoothfactor provides some smoothing and 4
provides more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GIF OPTIONS <br>
-t color <br>
Use color for the transparent color in the GIF file. This
must be specified in the same format that ppmmake(1) allows.
It may allow an X11 color name, but at least you <br>
may use a six-digit hexadecimal RGBvalue using the # sign,
e.g. #ff0000 (Red).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">JPEG OPTIONS <br>
-q image_quality <br>
use the integer value image_quality for the JPEG
&quot;Quality&quot; factor. Valid values are 0-100, with the
default being 75.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LATEX OPTIONS <br>
-d dmag <br>
Set a separate magnification for the length of line dashes
to dmag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E num Set encoding for latex
text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2
ISO-8859-2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l lwidth <br>
Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick lines to
lwidth pixels. LaTeX supports only two different line width:
hinlines and hicklines. Lines of width greater <br>
than lwidth pixels are drawn as hicklines. Also affects the
size of dots in dotted line style. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LaTeX cannot accurately
represent all the graphics objects which can be described by
Fig. For example, the possible slopes which lines may have
are limited. Some objects, such <br>
as spline curves, cannot be drawn at all. Fig2latex chooses
the closest possible line slope, and prints error messages
when objects cannot be drawn accurately</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MAP (HTML image map) OPTIONS
<br>
Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to
edit comments for each Fig object. The fig2dev map output
language will produce an HTML image map using Fig objects
<br>
that have href=&quot;some_html_reference&quot; in their
comments. Any Fig object except compound objects may used
for this. Usually, besides generating the map file, you
would also gen&acirc; <br>
erate a PNG file, which is the image to which the map
refers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, you may have an
xfig drawing with an imported image that has the comment
href=&quot;go_here.html&quot; and a box object with a
comment href=&quot;go_away.html&quot;. This will produce
<br>
an image map file such the user may click on the image and
the browser will load the &quot;go_here.html&quot; page, or
click on the box and the browser will load the
&quot;go_away.html&quot; page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After the map file is generated
by fig2dev you will need to edit it to fill out any
additional information it may need.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b borderwidth <br>
Make blank border around figure of width borderwidth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METAFONT OPTIONS <br>
fig2dev scales the figure by 1/8 before generating METAFONT
code. The magnification can be further changed with the -m
option or by giving magnification options to mf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to process the
generated METAFONT code, the mfpic macros must be installed
where mf can find them. The mfpic macro package is available
at any CTAN cite under the subdi&acirc; <br>
rectory: graphics/mfpic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C code <br>
specifies the starting METAFONT font code. The default is
32.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name <br>
specifies the name to use in the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p pen_magnification <br>
specifies how much the line width should be magnified
compared to the original figure. The default is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t top specifies the top of the
whole coordinate system. The default is ypos.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x xmin <br>
specifies the minimum x coordinate value of the figure
(inches). The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y ymin <br>
specifies the minumum y coordinate value of the figure
(inches). The default is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X xmax <br>
specifies the maximum x coordinate value of the figure
(inches). The default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Y ymax <br>
specifies the maximum y coordinate value of the figure
(inches). The default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">METAPOST OPTIONS <br>
-i file <br>
Include file content via input-command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I file <br>
Include file content as additional header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o Old mode (no latex).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p number <br>
Adds the line &quot;prologues:=number&quot; to the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIC OPTIONS <br>
-p ext Enables the use of certain PIC extensions which are
known to work with the groff package; compatibility with DWB
PIC is unknown. The extensions enabled by each option <br>
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arc Allow ARC_BOX i.e. use
rounded corners <br>
line Use the &rsquo;line_thickness&rsquo; value <br>
fill Allow ellipses to be filled <br>
all Use all of the above <br>
psfont Don&rsquo;t convert Postscript fonts generic type
<br>
(useful for files going to be Ditroff&rsquo;ed for <br>
and printed on PS printer). DWB-compatible. <br>
allps Use all of the above (i.e. &quot;all&quot; +
&quot;psfont&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PICTEX OPTIONS <br>
In order to include PiCTeX pictures into a document, it is
necessary to load the PiCTeX macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PiCTeX uses TeX integer register
arithmetic to generate curves, and so it is very slow.
PiCTeX draws curves by ut-ing the psymbol repeatedly, and so
requires a large amount of <br>
TeX&rsquo;s internal memory, and generates large DVI files.
The size of TeX&rsquo;s memory limits the number of plot
symbols in a picture. As a result, it is best to use PiCTeX
to generate <br>
small pictures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E num Set encoding for latex
text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2
ISO-8859-2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GBX OPTIONS (Gerber, RS-247-X)
<br>
Typically you will wish to set the y scale to -1. See -g for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d [mm|in] <br>
Output dimensions should be assumed to be millimeters (mm)
or inches (in). The default is millimeters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p [pos|neg] <br>
Select the image polarity. For positive images lines drawn
in the fig file will generate lines of material. For
negative images lines drawn in the fig file will result <br>
in removed material. Consider etching a chrome on glass
transmission mask. Drawing lines in the fig file and
choosing &rsquo;neg&rsquo; will result in these lines being
etched <br>
through the chrome, leaving transparent lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g &lt;x scale&gt;x&lt;y
scale&gt;+&lt;x offset&gt;+&lt;y offset&gt; <br>
This controls the geometry of the output, scaling the
dimensions as shown and applying the given offset. Typically
you will wish to set the y scale to -1, mirroring about <br>
the x axis. This is because Gerber assumes the origin to be
bottom left, while xfig selects top left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;n digits&gt;.&lt;n
digits&gt; <br>
This controls the number of digits of precision before and
after the implied decimal point. With -f 5.3 the following
number 12345678 corresponds to 12345.678. Whereas <br>
with -f 3.5 it corresponds to 123.45678. The default is for
3 places before the decimal point and 5 after. This
corresponds, to a range of 0 to 1m in 10 micron incre&acirc;
<br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i [on|off] <br>
Controls the output of comments describing the type of
objects being output. The text appears as comments starting
with ## on each line in the output file. By default <br>
this is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">POSTSCRIPT, ENCAPSULATED
POSTSCRIPT (EPS), and PDF OPTIONS <br>
With PostScript, xfig can be used to create multiple page
figures Specify the -M option to produce a multi-page
output. For posters, add -O to overlap the pages slightly to
get <br>
around the problem of the unprintable area in most printers,
then cut and paste the pages together. Due to memory
limitations of most laser printers, the figure should not
have <br>
large imported images (bitmaps). Great for text with very
big letters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EPS driver has the following
differences from PostScript: <br>
o No showpage is generated because the output is meant to be
imported into another program or document and not printed
<br>
o The landscape/portrait options are ignored <br>
o The centering option is ignored <br>
o The multiple-page option is ignored <br>
o The paper size option is ignored <br>
o The x/y offset options are ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The EPS driver has the following
two special options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B &rsquo;Wx [Wy X0 Y0]&rsquo;
<br>
This specifies that the bounding box of the EPS file should
have the width Wx and the height Wy. Note that it
doesn&rsquo;t scale the figure to this size, it merely sets
the <br>
bounding box. If a value less than or equal to 0 is
specified for Wx or Wy, these are set to the width/height
respectively of the figure. Origin is relative to screen
<br>
(0,0) (upper-left). Wx, Wy, X0 and Y0 are interpreted in
centimeters or inches depending on the measure given in the
fig-file. Remember to put either quotes (&quot;) or
apos&acirc; <br>
trophes (&rsquo;) to group the arguments to -B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R &rsquo;Wx [Wy X0 Y0]&rsquo;
<br>
Same as the -B option except that X0 and Y0 is relative to
the lower left corner of the figure. Remember to put either
quotes (&quot;) or apostrophes (&rsquo;) to group the
argu&acirc; <br>
ments to -R.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PDF driver uses all the
PostScript options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Text can now include various
ISO-character codes above 0x7f, which is useful for language
specific characters to be printed directly. Not all
ISO-characters are implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Color support: Colored objects
created by Fig can be printed on a color postscript printer.
There are 32 standard colors: black, yellow, white, gold,
five shades of blue, four <br>
shades of green, four shades of cyan, four shades of red,
five shades of magenta, four shades of brown, and four
shades of pink. In addition there may be user-defined colors
in <br>
the file. See the xfig FORMAT3.2 file for the definition of
these colors. On a monochrome printer, colored objects will
be mapped into different grayscales by the printer. <br>
Filled objects are printed using the given area fill and
color. There are 21 &quot;shades&quot; going from black to
full saturation of the fill color, and 21 more
&quot;tints&quot; from full satu&acirc; <br>
ration + 1 to white. In addition, there are 16 patterns such
as bricks, diagonal lines, crosshatch, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A Add an ASCII (EPSI)
preview.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b borderwidth <br>
Make blank border around figure of width borderwidth. <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C dummy_arg <br>
Add a color *binary* TIFF preview for Microsoft products
that need a binary preview. See also -T (monochrome
preview). A dummy argument must be supplied for historical
<br>
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c option centers the figure on
the page. The centering may not be accurate if there are
texts in the fig_file that extends too far to the right of
other objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e option puts the figure
against the edge (not centered) of the page. Not availble in
EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Use correct font sizes
(points) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev
uses, which is 1/80 inch. The corresponding xfig
command-line option is -cor&acirc; <br>
rect_font_size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g color <br>
Use color for the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l dummy_arg <br>
Generate figure in landscape mode. The dummy argument is
ignored, but must appear on the command line for reasons of
compatibility. This option will override the orien&acirc;
<br>
tation specification in the file (for file versions 3.0 and
higher). <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Generate multiple pages if
figure exceeds paper size. <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Convert all colors to
grayscale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name <br>
Set the Title part of the PostScript output to name. This is
useful when the input to fig2dev comes from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O When used with -M, overlaps
the pages slightly to get around the problem of the
unprintable area in most printers. <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p dummy_arg <br>
Generate figure in portrait mode. The dummy argument is
ignored, but must appear on the command line for reasons of
compatibility. This option will override the orienta&acirc;
<br>
tion specification in the file (for file versions 3.0 and
higher). This is the default for Fig files of version 2.1 or
lower. <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T Add a monochrome *binary*
TIFF preview for Microsoft products that need a binary
preview. See also -C (color preview).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x offset <br>
shift the figure in the X direction by offset units (1/72
inch). A negative value shifts the figure to the left and a
positive value to the right. <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y offset <br>
shift the figure in the Y direction by offset units (1/72
inch). A negative value shifts the figure up and a positive
value down. <br>
Not availble in EPS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z papersize <br>
Sets the papersize. Not availble in EPS. <br>
Available paper sizes are: <br>
&quot;Letter&quot; (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; also
&quot;A&quot;), <br>
&quot;Legal&quot; (11&quot; x 14&quot;) <br>
&quot;Ledger&quot; (11&quot; x 17&quot;), <br>
&quot;Tabloid&quot; (17&quot; x 11&quot;, really Ledger in
Landscape mode), <br>
&quot;A&quot; (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; also
&quot;Letter&quot;), <br>
&quot;B&quot; (11&quot; x 17&quot; also &quot;Ledger&quot;),
<br>
&quot;C&quot; (17&quot; x 22&quot;), <br>
&quot;D&quot; (22&quot; x 34&quot;), <br>
&quot;E&quot; (34&quot; x 44&quot;), <br>
&quot;A4&quot; (21 cm x 29.7cm), <br>
&quot;A3&quot; (29.7cm x 42 cm), <br>
&quot;A2&quot; (42 cm x 59.4cm), <br>
&quot;A1&quot; (59.4cm x 84.1cm), <br>
&quot;A0&quot; (84.1cm x 118.9cm), <br>
and &quot;B5&quot; (18.2cm x 25.7cm).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSTEX OPTIONS <br>
The pstex language is a variant of ps which suppresses
formatted (special) text. The pstex_t language has the
complementary behavior: it generates only the LaTeX special
text <br>
and the commands necessary to position special text, and to
overlay the PostScript file generated using pstex. These two
drivers can be used to generate a figure which combines <br>
the flexibility of PostScript graphics with LaTeX text
formatting of special text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Use correct font sizes
(points) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev
uses, which is 1/80 inch. The corresponding xfig
command-line option is -cor&acirc; <br>
rect_font_size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g color <br>
Use color for the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n name <br>
sets the Title part of the PostScript output to name. This
is useful when the input to fig2dev comes from standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSTEX_T OPTIONS <br>
The pstex_t language produces only the LaTeX special text
and the commands necessary to position special text, and to
overlay the PostScript file generated using pstex. (see <br>
above)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E num Set encoding for latex
text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2
ISO-8859-2)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F Don&rsquo;t set the font
face, series, and style; only set it&rsquo;s size and the
baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters
when it puts some text. The disadvan&acirc; <br>
tage is that you can&rsquo;t set the font from your LaTeX
document. With this option on, you can set the font from
your LaTeX document (like &quot;hape input
picture.eepic&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file <br>
specifies the name of the PostScript file to be overlaid. If
not set or its value is null then no PS file will be
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PSTricks OPTIONS <br>
The PSTricks driver provides full LaTeX text and math
formatting for XFig drawings without overlaying separate
outputs as in the PSTEX methods. The output matches the
quality of <br>
output of the PostScript driver except for text, where the
Latex font selection mechanism is used as for other fig2dev
LaTeX drivers. In addition, text is rendered black, <br>
although font color-changing LaTex code can be embedded in
the drawing. The generated PSTricks code is meant to be
readable. Each command stands alone, not relying on global
<br>
option state variables. Thus the user can easily use XFig to
rough out a PSTricks drawing, then finish by hand
editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the driver&rsquo;s
output, give the command &quot;sepackage{pstricks}&quot; in
your document preamble. The graphicx and pstricks-add
packages may also be required. The former is used <br>
for bitmap graphics and the second for complex line styles
and/or hollow PSTricks arrows (with the -R 1 option). The
driver will tell you which packages are needed. In the
doc&acirc; <br>
ument body, include the figure with
&quot;input{pstfile}&quot; where pstfile.tex is the output
file. Use the XFig special flag to have text passed as-is to
LaTeX. For non-special text, <br>
the same mechanism as the LaTeX and epic driver mechanism is
used to match font specs, but this is imprecise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known bugs and limitations. <br>
PSTricks support for join styles is version dependent. Raw
postscript is inserted with &quot;stVerb&quot; for old
versions when other than angle joins are needed. The -t
option <br>
controls this behavior. PSTricks does not support rotated
ellipses directly, so a rput command is emitted that rotates
and locates a horizontal ellipse. This makes a <br>
problem with hatch patterns, which are moved and rotated
along with the ellipse. Hatch rotation is fixed by a
counter-rotation, but the origin is not adjusted, so
regis&acirc; <br>
tration with adjacent hatch patterns will be incorrect.
Flipped bitmap graphics use an undocumented feature of the
graphicx package: a negative height flips the image <br>
vertically. This appears to work reliably. However, you may
want to flip graphics with another program before including
them in Xfig drawings just to be sure. With the <br>
-p option, the driver attempts to convert non-EPS pictures
to EPS with the TeX distribution&rsquo;s bmeps program, but
bmeps does not know about very many file formats including
<br>
gif.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G dummy_arg <br>
Draws a standard PSTricks grid in light gray, ignoring the
size parameters, numbered in PSTricks units.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l weight <br>
Sets a line weight factor that is multiplied by the actual
Fig line width. The default value 0.5 roughly matches the
output of the PS driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n 0|1|2|3 <br>
Sets environment type. Default 0 creates a icture
environment with bounding box exactly enclosing the picture
(but see -x and -y ). A 1 emits bare PSTricks commands <br>
with no environment at all, which can be used with
input{commands} inside an existing spicture. A 2 emits a
complete LaTeX document. A 3 also emits a complete LaTeX
<br>
document but attempts to set the PSTricks unit to fit a 7.5
by 10 inch (portrait aspect) box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Shorthand for -n 3 <br>
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p dir Attempts to run the bmeps
program to translate picture files to EPS, which is required
by PSTricks. The translated files go in dir , which must
already exist (the driver <br>
will not create it). Moreover, (BIG CAVEAT HERE) the driver
overwrites files with impunity in this directory!
Don&rsquo;t put your stuff here. The includegraphics
commands in <br>
the output file refer to this directory. Even if the -p
option is not used, includegrpahics commands follow this
convention with the default directory ./eps . In this <br>
case, the user must do the conversions independently. The
bmeps program is part of the standard TeX distribution. It
converts the following formats to EPS: png jpg pnm <br>
tif. You can see the bmeps command with the -v option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R 0|1|2 <br>
Sets arrow style. With the default style 0, Fig arrows are
converted to lines and polygons. With style 1, the Fig
arrowhead dimensions are converted to PSTricks arrow&acirc;
<br>
head dimensions and PSTricks arrowhead options are emitted.
Hollow arrows will require the additional package
pstricks-add <br>
. With style 2, PSTricks arrowhead options are emitted with
no dimensions at all, and arrowhead size may be controlled
globally with psset <br>
.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S scale <br>
Scales the image according to the same convention as the
EPIC driver, i.e., to size scale <br>
/12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t version <br>
Provides the driver with PSTricks version number so output
can match expected LaTeX input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print verbose warnings and
extra comments in the output file. Information provided
includes font substitution details, the bmeps commands used
for picture conversion, if <br>
any, and one comment per Fig object in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x marginsize <br>
Adds marginsize on the left and right of the PStricks
bounding box. By default, the box exactly encloses the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y marginsize <br>
Adds marginsize on the top and bottom of the PStricks
bounding box. By default, the box exactly encloses the
image.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z 0|1|2 <br>
Sets font handling option. Default option 0 attempts to
honor Fig font names and sizes, finding the best match with
a standard LaTeX font. Option 1 sets LaTeX font size <br>
only. Option 2 issues no font commands at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TK and PTK OPTIONS (tcl/tk and
Perl/tk) <br>
-l dummy_arg <br>
Generate figure in landscape mode. The dummy argument is
ignored, but must appear on the command line for reasons of
compatibility. This option will override the orien&acirc;
<br>
tation specification in the file (for file versions 3.0 and
higher).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p dummy_arg <br>
Generate figure in portrait mode. The dummy argument is
ignored, but must appear on the command line for reasons of
compatibility. This option will override the orienta&acirc;
<br>
tion specification in the file (for file versions 3.0 and
higher). This is the default for Fig files of version 2.1 or
lower.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Generate canvas of full page
size instead of using the bounding box of the figure&rsquo;s
objects. The default is to use only the bounding box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z papersize <br>
Sets the papersize. See the POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS for available
paper sizes. This is only used when the -P option (use full
page) is used.</p>

supported because of the canvas limitation in tk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Picture objects are not scaled
with the magnification factor for tk output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because tk scales canvas items
according to the X display resolution, polygons, lines, etc.
may be scaled differently than imported pictures (bitmaps)
which aren&rsquo;t scaled at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotated text is only supported
in the IBM-GL (HP/GL) and PostScript (including eps)
languages.</p>
