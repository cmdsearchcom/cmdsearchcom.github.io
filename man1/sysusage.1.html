<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
SysUsage v5.5 - System Monitoring Tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
SysUsage is a tool used to continuously monitor a system and
generate daily/weekly/monthly/yearly graphical report using
rrdtool and sar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
SysUsage generate graphical reports on all system activity
information. His periodical reports allow you to keep track
of the machine activity during his life and will be a <br>
great help for performance analysis and resources
management.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SysUsage can be run periodically
from 10 seconds cycle in daemon mode to 1 minute or more
using crond.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SysUsage can be run from a
central server to call a ssh remote execution of the
sysusage perl script so that collected data will be stored
in this central place. You also will <br>
have just one place where rrdtool and related Perl modules
need to be installed as well as just one place where
sysusagegraph or sysusagejqgraph need to be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CPUs <br>
- CPUs distribution usage (user, nice, system). <br>
- CPUs global usage (total cpu used, iowait). <br>
- CPUs virtualized usage (steal, guest).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Memory <br>
- Memory usage (with and without cache). <br>
- Swap usage (with and without cache). <br>
- Amount of memory need for current workload. <br>
- Posix share memory. <br>
- Hugepages utilisation <br>
- Active versus inactive memory <br>
- Dirty memeory that need to be written to disk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I/O <br>
- Context switches per second. <br>
- Interrupts per second. <br>
- Page swapping. <br>
- Page I/O stats. <br>
- I/O request stats. <br>
- I/O block stats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network <br>
- TCP connections per second. <br>
- TCP segments per second. <br>
- Number of socket in use (Total, TCP and UDP). <br>
- Number of socket in TIME_WAIT state. <br>
- Active network interface usage. <br>
- Active network interface bad packet, dropping,
collision.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Devices <br>
- CPU time for I/O on device. <br>
- Read/Write sectors on device. <br>
- Disk throughput on device. <br>
- I/O workload on device. <br>
- Times for I/O requests issued to device. <br>
- Hard drive temperature if your hardward support it (with
hddtemp). <br>
- MotherBoard/CPU/Remote temperature reported by sensors or
sar. <br>
- Fan RPM reported by sensors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
- Number of open file. <br>
- Number of file in a queue directory. <br>
- Disk space used on mounted partition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Process <br>
- Load average. <br>
- Process created per second. <br>
- Number of running process (ex: sendmail, httpd, oracle,
etc.). <br>
- Number of running thread (ex: mysqld, amarok, etc.). <br>
- Number of task blocked waiting for I/O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notification <br>
You can have mail or Nagios notification when some monitored
values are outside max/min threshold values for all type of
monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Plugins <br>
With SysUsage you can create your own monitoring plugins.
Any script or program can be embeded in SysUsage provided
that it return up to 3 numeric values. The graphic title and
<br>
labels are defined in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remote call <br>
SysUsage can be installed and run onto a central server that
will be used to store statistics data by periodically
calling sysusage on remote host using SSH. This central
place <br>
will also be in charge to renderer HTML plages and graphics
for all hosts. This will allow to simplify the SysUsage
installation on remote host that will only require sysstat
and <br>
rsysusage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REQUIREMENT <br>
rrdtool <br>
You need to install rrdtool. You can find it at:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use the RRDs perl module you
must use the following command to compile the distrib:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">make site-perl-install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This installation is optional if
sysusage is installed on a remote host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysstat <br>
You also need sar to collect statistics. Sar is part of the
sysstat package. You can find it here :</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://freshmeat.net/projects/sysstat/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you plan to use threshold
notification you must have Net::SMTP installed. It can be
found on CPAN (http://search.cpan.org)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl modules <br>
Sysusage can be run in a central place to collect remote
sysusage statistics using ssh. The remote calls are proceed
simultaneously using fork with the Proc::Queue Perl
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re plan tu use
sysusagegraph instead of sysusagejqgrpah you will also need
the GD and GD::Graph3D Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All these modules are always
available from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/) and may at
least be installed on the central server. On remote host
this is optional and depend if you <br>
want to run it on each server or by ssh from a central
place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Nagios nsca client (optional)
<br>
If you want to send message to Nagios you need to install
nsca-2.7.2.tar.gz or a more recent version. You can get it
here:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios/files/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hddtemp and sensors (optional)
<br>
If you want to monitor your hard drive temperature you must
install a small utility called hddtemp. You can download it
from http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/hddtemp/.
<br>
Run it to see if your hard drive have a temperature
sensor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also use sensors to
monitor your cpu temperature and fan speed. If you harware
support it run sensors-detect and load the required kernel
modules at boot time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
Quick install <br>
Simply run the following commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL <br>
make &amp;&amp; make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default it will copy the perl
programs into /usr/local/sysusage/bin and the HTML output
will be done to /var/www/htdocs/sysusage/. The configuration
file is <br>
/usr/local/sysusage/etc/sysusage.cfg and all RRD Bekerley DB
databases from rrdtool will be saved under
/usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you plan to run sysusage on
different servers from a central place you may just want to
install the rsysusage Perl script on remote hosts. So
proceed as follow:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL REMOTE=1 <br>
make &amp;&amp; make install</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It will copy the only the
rsysusage into /usr/local/sysusage/bin and the configuration
file under /usr/local/sysusage/etc/sysusage.cfg. The RRD
data directory will be created <br>
under /usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles but just to hold the
*.cnt files relatives to the count of alert attempt on
threshold exceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom install <br>
You can overwrite all install path with the following
Makefile.PL arguments. Here are the default values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BINDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/bin
<br>
CONFDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/etc <br>
PIDDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/etc <br>
BASEDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles <br>
PLUGINDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/plugins <br>
HTMLDIR=/var/www/htdocs/sysusage <br>
MANDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/doc <br>
DOCDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/doc <br>
REMOTE=</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example on a RedHat System
you may prefer install SysUsage as this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL BINDIR=/usr/bin
CONFDIR=/etc PIDDIR=/var/run BASEDIR=/var/lib/sysusage
HTMLDIR=/var/www/html/sysusage MANDIR=/usr/man/man1
DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/sysusage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are installing sysusage
on a host that will be call by ssh from a central place, you
may want to install just what is necessary and not more:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perl Makefile.PL BINDIR=/usr/bin
CONFDIR=/etc PIDDIR=/var/run MANDIR=/usr/man/man1
DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/sysusage REMOTE=1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will just install the
rsysusage Perl script, the configuration file and
documentation. So that you don&rsquo;t need to install extra
Perl modules and other graphics related <br>
things.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Package/binary install <br>
In directory packaging/ you will find all scripts to build
RPM, slackBuild and debian package. See README in this
directory to know how to build these packages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Previous version <br>
Previous version used to ask a lot of questions during
install, this was removed since version 3.0 to the benefice
of simplicity and a default configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USAGE <br>
SysUsage consist in two main Perl scripts, sysusage and
sysusagegraph. Once you have correctly installed and
configured SysUsage the best way to execute them is by
setting a cron <br>
job. If you prefer javascript graphics instead of GD::Graph
images use sysusagejqgraph that is based on jqplot
javascript library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysusage <br>
The script sysusage is responsible of collecting system
informations at a given interval and store them into rrdtool
database files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As it is very fast you can set
running interval time to 1 minute. This is the default
pooling interval used in configuration and graph reports. If
you change this interval you <br>
must also change it in the configuration file otherwise your
graph will be false. See the INTERVAL configuration
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is how I use it with a
default installation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/1 * * * *
/usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusage &gt; /dev/null
2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rsysusage <br>
This script do the same things as the sysusage Perl script
but instead of storing collected datas on file it will dump
them to the standard output. This script is used instead
<br>
of the sysusage Perl script by a ssh call from a central
server where the local sysusage will store the statistics
retrieved from multiple servers.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/sysusage/bin/rsysusage
-r remote_hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Where
&rsquo;remote_hostname&rsquo; is the hostname given in the
[REMOTE ...] configuration section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysusagegraph / sysusagejqgraph
<br>
The perl script sysusagegraph is used to draw PNG graphs and
write HTML file. As he knows the pooling interval given in
the configuration file it can be run at any time. I used
<br>
to run it each five minutes but you can run it each hours or
more this is the same.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * *
/usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusagegraph &gt; /dev/null
2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since release v4.0 of SysUsage
there&rsquo;s a JQuery plotting replacement of rrdGraph that
only write HTML files with all javascript code to allow the
client browser to draw the <br>
graphs. To enable this feature you just have to use
sysusagejqgrpah instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*/5 * * * *
/usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusagejqgraph &gt; /dev/null
2&gt;&amp;1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s some more
resources javascript libraries and CSS files to install. The
SysUsage installer will do the job for you. This remove the
requirement of the GD, GD::Graph and <br>
GD::Graph3D Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sysusage.cfg <br>
If you have change the default installation path
(/usr/local/sysusage) you may need to give these scripts the
path to the configuration file as command line argument
using -c <br>
option. To know what arguments can be passed use option -h
or --help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that since version 3.0 the
default configuration path in these scripts is set during
installation. So you may not need anymore to edit these
scripts or give the path of the <br>
configuration file as command line argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See CONFIGURATION chapter for
more information on howto configure your system
monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Daemon mode <br>
Crond is good for scheduling but not under the minute. If
you want to monitor your system within an interval under the
minute you may want to run sysusage in daemon mode. To do
<br>
that, just change the INTERVAL to the desired timer in the
configuration file and the DAEMON directive to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debug mode <br>
Some time things don&rsquo;t appear as you wanted. The best
way to see what&rsquo;s going wrong is to run sysusage in
debug mode. This mode allow you to see all values extracted
from sar and <br>
other tools. Use the --debug option for that, this mode
prevent sysusage to store data in the rrdfiles. Command:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusage
--debug</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please, run this command and
check the result before sending bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output <br>
Once sysusage and sysusagegraph are running since some
cycles, run your favorite browser and take a look at the
output directory. By default:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://my.server.dom/sysusage/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have special URI and/or
port remember to modify the URL configuration directive
without that the web interface will not works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
During installation a default configuration file
sysusage.cfg is generated. The default settings are good
enougth to report essential information of your system, but
if you want <br>
to monitor some processes, queue directories or some devices
you must edit this file by hand.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is the format of the
configuration file and all directives. There is three
section, the first one set the general parameters of the
application, the second set the <br>
parameters related to SMTP or Nagios notification at
threshold exceed and the last configure all type of system
information you may want to monitor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section GENERAL <br>
DEBUG = 0|1 <br>
This option is used to set debug mode. If set to 1 then
sysusage and sysusagegraph just show what they do but
don&rsquo;t create or send anything.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATA_DIR = /path/to/rrdfiles
<br>
This option is used to set te ouput directory for all
RRDTOOL database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PID_DIR = /path/to/piddir <br>
sysusage and sysusagegraph use a file to store the pid of
the running process to prevent simultaneous run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEST_DIR = /path/to/html_output
<br>
Set the path to the directory where all HTML and graph files
should be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SAR_BIN = /path/to/sar_binary
<br>
sysusage use sar, part of the sysstat distribution to grab
system information so we need to know where it is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPTIME = /path/to/uptime_binary
<br>
sysusagegraph report the current uptime of the system using
the uptime command. Used to set path to uptime binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOSTNAME =
/path/to/hostname_binary <br>
All scripts of Sysusage distribution need to know the name
of the host. They use hostname command for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERVAL =
pull_interval_in_second <br>
All RRDTOOL input use the given interval in second to store
monitored values. Graph construction also use this interval
to render things properly. By default Sysusage use an <br>
interval of 60 seconds to have a better statistic report.
You can change this but it&rsquo;s not recommanded. If you
change this adjust your crontab to the same value. This
value <br>
must between 10 and 300 seconds. If you want to be under the
minute you must use the daemon mode to run sysusage. See
DAEMON bellow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SKIP = HH:MM/HH:MM HH:MM/HH:MM
... <br>
You can define here some time range where monitoring will
not be done. Value is a list of begin_time/end_time
separated by space or tabulation. Let&rsquo;s say you
don&rsquo;t want to <br>
monitor the host during the night for some good reason, you
can write it like that: 20:00/06:00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HDDTEMP_BIN =
/path/to/hddtemp_binary <br>
You can monitor your hard drive temperature if you have
installed hddtemp utility. We need to know the path to
hddtemp binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENSORS_BIN =
/path/to/sensors_binary <br>
You can monitor your device temperature if you have
installed lm_sensor utility. We need to know the path to
sensors binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DAEMON = 0 | 1 <br>
You can monitor your system under the crond limitation of 1
minute by running sysusage in daemon mode with an INTERVAL
between 10 end 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GRAPH_WIDTH and GRAPH_HEIGHT
<br>
These are usefull if you want to resize graph dimension.
Default is a width of 550 pixels and a height of 200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FLAMING <br>
This is for fun, if you want to have random flaming effect
on graphs with only dataset set this directive to 1. Disable
by default. Not used with JQuery graph renderer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HIRES <br>
Allow addition of hourly graph to have fine granularity of
the data. This is disable by default. Set it to any integer
between 1 to 23 hours included to show data from past N <br>
hours to now. Not used with JQuery graph renderer as the
Javascript library allow you to zoom into the resolution you
want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LINE_SIZE <br>
By default the graph line size is 1 if you want graph with a
more thick line set it to 2. This is rrd graph limitation (1
or 2). Not used with JQuery graph renderer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROC_QSIZE <br>
Number of simultaneous remote sysusage call process that
should be run. Default is 4 but it can be up to 15 or more
depending of the hardware configuration. One per core is
<br>
the lower value you may think about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESRC_URL <br>
Images, javascripts and css ressources by default are search
into the DEST_DIR directory so that in the HTML view they
all stayed on the current main directory. You may want <br>
to place thoses resources on an other directory or an
another place. Using this directive you can set any FQDN,
absolute or relative URL for these resources.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_IDENTITY <br>
Used to set the default identity file to connect to all
remote hosts without password. If undefined, sysusage will
use the ssh system default value. You may want to use the
<br>
default value unless you know exactly what&rsquo;s you are
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_OPTION <br>
Use set the default ssh options, that correspond to a
passwordless authent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o ConnectTimeout=5 -o
PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with a five seconds connection
timeout. You may want to increase this timeout on very slow
network links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not change this value unless
you know exactly what&rsquo;s you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_BIN <br>
Path to the ssh command is set here at install time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_USER <br>
Used to defined the default ssh user that will be used to
connect to all remote hosts.</p>

exceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALARM_PROG =
/path/to/sysusagewarn <br>
Used to set path to the external program responsible of
sending alarm message. You can change it to your own, just
take a look at the sysusagewarn usage to see what command
<br>
line options are used by sysusage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SMTP = smtp.server.net <br>
Name or Ip address of the SMTP server to contact. Default is
none =&gt; No smtp message is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FROM = sender@localhost <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO = destination@localhost <br>
Destination email address where the alarm message will be
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAGIOS =
/usr/local/nagios/bin/submit_check_result <br>
Path to the external nsca program used to send check message
to Nagios. Setting this will activate nagios check report.
See at end of this file to see how to configure <br>
Nagios</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPPER_LEVEL = 1 <br>
Nagios check level to send when a high threshold limit is

don&rsquo;t want <br>
to received notice during the night for some good reason,
you can write it like that: 20:00/06:00</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section MONITOR <br>
This section has two different format the first one is used
to specify most of the monitoring target:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type:threshold_max</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type:threshold_max(attempt)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type <br>
Type of system information you may want to monitor. It can
takes around 30 differents values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load =&gt; monitor load average
<br>
blocked=&gt; monitor task blocked waiting for I/O <br>
cpu =&gt; monitor each cpu(s) user/nice/system usage <br>
=&gt; monitor each cpu(s) total/iowait usage <br>

sensors command <br>
hddtemp=&gt; monitor disk drive temperature <br>
temp =&gt; monitor device temperature using sar <br>
fan =&gt; monitor fan rotation using sar <br>
huge =&gt; monitor size of hugepages utilisation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the &rsquo;cpu&rsquo;
target monitoring type will report all statictics per cpu.
This can represent a lot of informations if you several cpu.
To limit statistics to total cpu only, <br>
you must replace default the &rsquo;cpu&rsquo; target to
&rsquo;cpuall&rsquo; in your configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threshold_max <br>
This is the maximum threshold value. Any value equal or
upper <br>
than this one will generate SMTP and/or Nagios alert if you
<br>
have enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attempt <br>
You can delay the call to the alarm program at threshold
exceed by specifying the number of consecutive exceed
attempt before the command will be called. Just specify the
<br>
number of attempt between bracket just after the min and/or
max threshold value. This setting is optional for both
threshold value and the default is to send alarm <br>
immediatly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Specials cases <br>
There&rsquo;s a special case for &rsquo;disk&rsquo; usage
monitoring that allow exclusion of some mount point. This is
usefull if you have hard link or some special device you
don&rsquo;t need to <br>
monitor. Where exclusion is a semi- colon (;) separated list
of mount point to exclude from monitoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">disk:ThresholdMax:exclusion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ex:
disk:90:/home/mondo_image;/home/smb_mountpoint</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use regexp in your
excluded path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The other directive with special
syntax is &rsquo;dev&rsquo;. It is construct as follow:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev:device(alias):rpm_speed:raid_type:nb_disk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where device is sda, sdb or any
device name (without the /dev/), the alias between
parenthesis is the name that must be displayed in the user
interface instead of the device <br>
name. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev:sdc(ASM disk1): <br>
dev:sdb(/data):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I you plan to use I/O workload
report, SysUsage need to know the speed of the disk (RPM),
the raid type (0,1,5,10) and the number of disk in the raid
array to calculate the <br>
IOPS. For example if we have a 7200 RPM disk with 2 disk in
raid 1, we will write thing like that:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev:sdc(ASM disk1):7200:1:2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I/O workload is the relation
between TPS (transfers per second) and IOPS (I/O operations
measured in seconds) of a device. If the tps returned by
sysstat reach the maximum <br>
theoretical IOPS, your storage subsystem is saturated. Here
is the equation to calculate the maximum theoretical
IOPS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d = number of disks <br>
dIOPS = IOPS per disk <br>
%r = % of read workload <br>
%w = % of write workload <br>
F = raid factor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IOPS = (d *dIOPS) / (%r + (F *
%w))</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the theoretical maximum IOPS for
a RAID set (excluding caching of course). To do this you
take the product of the number of disks and IOPS per disk
divided by the sum of the <br>
%read workload and the product of the raid factor and %write
workload. Where %read and %write are calculated from the
following equation:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%r = rd_sec / (rd_sec + wr_sec);
<br>
%w = wr_sec / (rd_sec + wr_sec);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This IOPS monitoring is build
following the excellent article of Nick Anderson readable
from Analyzing I/O performance in Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second format is used to
monitor running process, hard drive temperature or queue
directory. It has the following format:</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">type:target:threshold_max_value:threshold_min_value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">type:target:threshold_max_value(attempt):threshold_min_value(attempt)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type <br>
Type of system information you may want to monitor. It can
takes these differents values:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load, cpu, cswch, intr, mem,
swap, work, share, sock, socktw, io, file, <br>
page, pcrea, pswap, net, tcp, err, disk, proc, tproc, queue,
hddtemp, <br>
dev, work, sensors, temp, fan, huge, blocked, dirty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">target <br>
If type is &rsquo;proc&rsquo; or &rsquo;tproc&rsquo; target
represent the name of the process to monitor. You can put a
regexp as target to match exactly the required process. The
number of running <br>
process are obtain by the system command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps -e -o command | grep -E
&quot;target&quot; | grep -v grep | wc -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">so you can replace the word
target by the regexp to match and see if it returns the
right number of process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The number of running thread are
obtain by the system command line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ps -eL -o command | grep -E
&quot;target&quot; | grep -v grep | wc -l</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If type is &rsquo;queue&rsquo;
this represent the full path of the directory to monitor.
Sysusage will try to find and count any regular file in the
target directory and will not follow <br>
sub directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If type is &rsquo;hddtemp&rsquo;
the target represent the hard drive device to monitor, ex:
/dev/sda. You can try it with the following command
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">hddtemp -n /dev/sda</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This may return the actual
temperature detected on the hard drive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this is &rsquo;dev&rsquo;
this represent the device name to monitor. Ex: sda. Do not
add the /dev/ before this will not work. You may want to
change the device name in the graphic <br>
menu, this is possible by adding the device alias enclosed
with parenthesis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example lets say
you&rsquo;re monitoring some EMCpower SAN device. Using sar
the reported devices are dev120-48 and dev120-64. Once you
have find what partition are mapped to <br>
these devices (reading /proc/partitions). In this example
these devices are mounted as /cache1 and /cache2 so we want
to see these mount points instead of device number in <br>
the graphical menu:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dev:dev120-48(/cache1):90 <br>
dev:dev120-64(/cache2):97</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in you sysusage.conf file will
do the job. The threshold_max value is the max percentage of
CPU used for this device before sending an alarm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If type is &rsquo;sensors&rsquo;
this represent the pattern to match to obtain temperature or
fan speed information in the sensors program output. See
chapter SENSORS to have more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If type is &rsquo;temp&rsquo; or
&rsquo;fan&rsquo; this represent the device number reported
by sar to obtain temperature or fan speed information. To
know what device number must be used, see <br>
result of command: sar -m ALL 1 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threshold_max <br>
This is the maximum threshold value. Any value equal or
upper will generate an SMTP and/or Nagios alert if you have
enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">threshold_min <br>
This is the minimum threshold value. Any value equal or
lower of this one will generate SMTP and/or Nagios alert if
you have enable it. Min threshold should certainly only be
<br>
used with &rsquo;proc&rsquo; and &rsquo;tproc&rsquo;
monitoring type. If you set it to 0 then you will be warn if
any of the monitored process are down.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attempt <br>
You can delay the call to the alarm program at threshold
exceed by specifying the number of consecutive exceed
attempt before the command will be called. Just specify the
<br>
number of attempt between bracket just after the min and/or
max threshold value. This setting is optional for both
threshold value and the default is to send alarm <br>
immediatly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example a load average
monitoring defined like this</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">load:12(3)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will send an alarm when the
system load average will exceed 12 after three consecutives
attempts at the define interval. If the interval is 60
seconds, the alarm will be sent <br>
up to 180 second after the first exceed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section PLUGIN <br>
This part enable the use of custom plugins. You can call any
program or script provide that it return up to 3 numbers
separated by a space character. See plugins/ directory for
<br>
sample scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section must include a name
composed of any alphanumeric character that will be used to
create the target file, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[PLUGIN testplug1] or [PLUGIN
testplug2]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The section allow the following
configuration directives. They are composed of named
directives followed by &rsquo;:&rsquo; or &rsquo;=&rsquo;
and a value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable <br>
Is used to disable temporary the plugin monitoring. Default
is &rsquo;yes&rsquo; enable. To disable write it
enable:no</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">program <br>
Is used to set the path to the program or script to execute
as plugin. This program must print to STDOUT 1 to 3 numbers
separated by a space character as result following the <br>
number of reports you want. So each plugin can have 1, 2 or
3 graphed data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">title <br>
Is used to set the title of the report page and the index
link. Default is set to &quot;Sysusage plugin&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">menu <br>
Is used to store the plugin under a submenu of the plugins
menu. Default is to store plugin under the
&quot;Others&quot; submenu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">maxthreshold <br>
This is the maximum threshold value. Any value equal or
upper than this one will generate SMTP and/or Nagios alert
if you have enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">minthreshold <br>
This is the minimum threshold value. Any value equal or
lower of this one will generate SMTP and/or Nagios alert if
you have enable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">verticallabel <br>
This is used to set the vertical label of the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">label1, label2, label3 <br>
Are used to show a legend for each graphed data, label1 is
for the first returned value, label2 for the second and
label3 for the last. If you just have one value returned
<br>
just omit the other labels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">legend1, legend2, legend3 <br>
These are use to set the units for Current, Avg and Max
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote <br>
This directive must be set to &rsquo;no&rsquo; to prevent
execution of the plugin program by a issh call to sysusage
in a remote context. This directive is activated by default
(&rsquo;yes&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section REMOTE <br>
This part allow to run sysusage on remote hosts from a
central server. It use ssh to execute sysusage on the
destination host with the -r option that force sysusage to
not write <br>
anything to local data files but to print all result to
stdout. As sysusage is run by cron job or daemon mode it can
not authenticate interactively to remote host so you must
<br>
give a ssh user and an identity file with the corresponding
configuration option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This section must include the
name or the ip address of the remote host that will be used
to create the target data directory, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[REMOTE hostname] or [REMOTE
host.domain.dom] or [REMOTE 192.168.1.14]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The section allow the following
configuration directives. They are composed of named
directives followed by &rsquo;:&rsquo; or &rsquo;=&rsquo;
and a value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you have installed sysusage
on all remote host and exchange the SSH key certificat
between the central host and all remote hosts, most of the
time you just have to set the <br>
ssh_user directive to have it working. Use remote_sysusage
directive if sysusage perl script is not installed on the
same place than the central server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Section GROUP <br>
This section allow you to groups remote host report under a
common groupname in the index page. Remote hosts will be
ordered following their parent groups. The name of the group
<br>
can be any string and the values in the section must be a
list of remote servers defined in the REMOTE sections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example if you are
monitoring a cluster of web and database servers you can use
the following declaration:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[GROUP Web Servers] <br>
webhost1 <br>
webhost2 <br>
webhost3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[GROUP Database Servers] <br>
dbhost1 <br>
dbhost2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course webhostN and dbhostN
hosts must be declared in the remote section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enable <br>
Is used to enable/disable the remote host monitoring.
Default is &rsquo;yes&rsquo; enable. Set it as
&rsquo;enable=no&rsquo; to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh_user <br>
Used to defined the ssh user allowed to connect to remote
host. By default the value set to SSH_USER configuration
option in the GENERAL section will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh_identity <br>
Used to set the identity file to connect to remote host
without password. By default the value set to SSH_IDENTITY
configuration option in the GENERAL section will be used.
<br>
Usually this is the private key that you&rsquo;ve generated
using ssh-keygen and most of the time file
$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa. You may want to use the default value
unless you know <br>
exactly what&rsquo;s you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh_options <br>
Use to overwrite the default ssh options, that are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o ConnectTimeout=5 -o
PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default options are set into
the SSH_OPTIONS configuration option in the GENERAL section.
You may want to use the default value unless you know
exactly what&rsquo;s you are <br>
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssh_command <br>
You can overwrite the complete ssh command using this
directive, this will replace the ssh command, the ssh
option, the ssh user and the host part. The sysusage remote
<br>
command will not be replaced. You may want to use the
default value unless you know exactly what&rsquo;s you are
doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">remote_sysusage <br>
Use it to set the path to the rsysusage command that must be
used on the remote host, SysUsage will automatically add the
-r option to cause the remote execution mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THRESHOLD NOTIFICATION <br>
SMTP alert <br>
Sysusage use an external perl script to send SMTP alert
and/or Nagios checks when a max or min threshold is reached.
This program is named sysusagewarn. All options of the <br>
configuration file in section [ALARM] are use by sysusage to
call this program. If they are correctly set you don&rsquo;t
have to take care of the parameters given to this program.
If <br>
you want to use this program outside sysusage, here are the
command line options it understand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usage: sysusagewarn -t subject
-c current_value -v threshold_value <br>
[-s smtp_srv] [-f from] [-d to] [-b hostname_prog]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t subject : Subject of the
alarm <br>
-c value : Current value monitored by sysusage <br>
-v value : Threshold value used. <br>
-s host : SMTP server name or ip where to send email. <br>
-f from : Sender email address of the alarm message. <br>
-d to : Destination address of the alarm message. <br>
-b path : Path to program hostname. Default is /bin/hostname
<br>
-n path : Path to Nagios program submit_check_result.
Default none. <br>
-l value : Alarm level (0=OK,1=WARNING,2=CRITICAL). Default:
1. <br>
-r service : Nagios service name to used. Must be any
sysusage type of <br>
monitoring defined in the configuration file. <br>
-u url : Url to HTML sysusage output to include in email.
<br>
Default: http://hostname.domain/sysusage/ <br>
-h : Output this message and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAGIOS alert <br>
SysUsage send check message to Nagios through an external
command (submit_check_result). So you need to create the
host and associate all sysusage service that you want to
<br>
monitor with Nagios. The services name correspond to the
type of monitoring. For example, if you have enable alarm on
memory usage the service sent is &rsquo;mem&rsquo;.
There&rsquo;s also <br>
specials case with type of monitoring with multiple instance
like network monitoring. You need to create a service per
instance. For example type &rsquo;net&rsquo; will have
&rsquo;net_eth0&rsquo; and <br>
&rsquo;net_lo&rsquo; and more if you have more network
interface. To see if your sysusage alarm messages are well
understood by Nagios take a look at the nagios.log file
(default to <br>
/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To desactivate automatically an
alarm reported to Nagios, SysUsage will send each time it
run an OK request if every thing is correct for the
monitored type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENSORS <br>
Monitoring of sensors output is based on regexp. To be clear
enought here an example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sensors output on my server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Following the sensors kernel
module load you could have more or less output than that. To
monitor all sensors CPUs temperature on my server I need to
add the following lines into <br>
sysusage.cfg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensors:CPU Temp:75 <br>
sensors:Board Temp:45 <br>
sensors:Remote Temp:45</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will create 3 graphs based
on lines matching &rsquo;CPU Temp&rsquo;, an other with
lines matching &rsquo;Board Temp&rsquo; and the last with
lines matching &rsquo;Remote Temp&rsquo;. As I have 2 CPUs
for each <br>
graph there will be 2 values. You can not report more than 3
values per graph, this is hard coded into sysusage. So if
you have more CPUs you will not see more than 3 values. <br>
Here it will sent alarm when temperature exceed the given
values (75,45,45).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To monitor fan speed, I just add
lines like this in the configuration file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensors:fan2:11000:8095 <br>
sensors:fan3:11000:8095</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This whil create 2 graphs for

<p style="margin-top: 1em">coretemp-isa-0000 <br>
Adapter: ISA adapter <br>
Core 0: +53.0 C (high = +78.0 C, crit = +100.0 C)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">coretemp-isa-0001 <br>
Adapter: ISA adapter <br>
Core 1: +50.0 C (high = +78.0 C, crit = +100.0 C)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To monitor CPU temprature, I
just add this line in my sysusage.cfg:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sensors:Core:70</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will generate a graph with
2 graphed data for Core 0 and Core 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Now that sysstat sar natively
reports deviceis temperature and fan speed you don&rsquo;t
need sensors anymore. Type &rsquo;temp&rsquo; can be used
instead and type &rsquo;fan&rsquo; for the fan speed. The
<br>
target of these types is the device number, See sar -m TEMP
or sar -m FAN to see which device number to monitor.</p>
