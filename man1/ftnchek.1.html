<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is designed to detect
certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually
does not. ftnchek is not primarily intended to detect
syn&acirc; <br>
tax errors. Its purpose is to assist the user in finding
semantic errors. Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.
<br>
For example, variables which are never used may indicate
some omission in the program; uninitialized variables
contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be
calculated; <br>
and variables which are not declared may not have the
intended type. ftnchek is intended to assist users in the
debugging of their Fortran program. It is not intended to
catch <br>
all syntax errors. This is the function of the compiler.
Prior to using ftnchek, the user should verify that the
program compiles correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document first summarizes
how to invoke ftnchek. That section should be read before
beginning to use ftnchek. Later sections describe
ftnchek&rsquo;s options in more detail, <br>
give an example of its use, and explain how to interpret the
output. The final sections mention the limitations and known
bugs in ftnchek.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOKING FTNCHEK <br>
ftnchek is invoked through a command of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ ftnchek [-option -option ...]
filename [filename ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The brackets indicate something
which is optional. The brackets themselves are not actually
typed. Here options are command-line switches or settings,
which control the opera&acirc; <br>
tion of the program and the amount of information that will
be printed out. If no option is specified, the default
action is to print error messages, warnings, and
informational <br>
messages, but not the program listing or symbol tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each option begins with the
&rsquo;-&rsquo; character. (On VAX/VMS or MS-DOS systems you
may use either &rsquo;/&rsquo; or &rsquo;-&rsquo;.) For the
sake of conformity with an increasingly common convention,
<br>
options can also begin with &rsquo;--&rsquo;. The options
are described at greater length in the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ftnchek options fall into two
categories: switches, which are either true or false, and
settings, which have a numeric or string value. The name of
a switch is prefixed by &rsquo;no&rsquo; <br>
or &rsquo;no-&rsquo; to turn it off: e.g. -nopure would turn
off the warnings about impure functions. The
&rsquo;no&rsquo; prefix can also be used with numeric
settings, having the effect of turning off <br>
the corresponding warnings. Settings that control lists of
warnings have a special syntax discussed below. Only the
first 3 characters of an option name (not counting the
&rsquo;-&rsquo;) <br>
need be provided. A colon may be used in place of an equals
sign for numeric or string setting assignments; however, we
show only the equals sign form below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The switches and settings which
ftnchek currently recognizes are listed below. For each
option, the default is the value used if the option is not
explicitly specified, while <br>
the turn-on is the value used if the option is given without
assigning it a value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arguments=list <br>
Control warnings about subprogram type and argument
mismatches. Default = turn-on = all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-array=list <br>
Control warnings in checking array arguments of subprograms.
Default = turn-on = all.</p>

call-tree, who-calls-who and VCG. Default = none, turn-on =
tree,prune,sort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -mkhtml option is invoked
and tree is the applied calltree option, a file named
CallTree.html, will be produced depicting the tree in HTML
format.</p>

Control specific warnings about standard Fortran 77 features
that were deleted from the Fortran 95 Standard. Default =
none, turn-on = all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print command summary.
Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-identifier-chars=list <br>

identifiers. Default = turn-on = dollar sign and
underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include=path <br>

for the format of this file. Default = none, turn-on =
declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mkhtml=list <br>
Create individual HTML document files from ftnchek analysis
and code comments. Usually you will also want to specify
-call=tree to create the root HTML file Call&acirc; <br>

Print amount of resources used in analyzing the program.
Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sixchar <br>
List any variable names which clash at 6 characters length.
Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-sort Print list of subprograms
sorted in prerequisite order. Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-source=list <br>
Select source formatting options: fixed or free form, DEC

UNIX-style backslash escape sequences, and implicit <br>
typing of parameters. Default = none, turn-on = all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-style=list <br>
Produce extra-picky warnings about obsolescent or
old-fashioned programming constructions. Default = none,
turn-on = all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-symtab <br>
Print symbol table and label table for each subprogram.
Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-truncation=list <br>
Check for possible loss of accuracy by truncation. Default =
turn-on = all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-usage=list <br>
Control warnings about unused or uninitialized variables,
common blocks, etc. Default = turn-on = all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vcg Produce VCG format of call

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print version number. Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-volatile <br>
Assume COMMON blocks lose definition between activations.
Default = no. (Obsolete. Use -common=volatile instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wordsize=num <br>
Set the default word size for numeric quantities to num
bytes. Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-wrap=num <br>
Set output column at which to wrap long error messages and
warnings to the next line. If set to 0, turn off wrapping.
Default = turn-on = 79.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When more than one option is
used, they should be separated by a blank space, except on
systems such as VMS where options begin with slash ( / ). No
blank spaces may be placed <br>
around the equals sign ( = ) in a setting. ftnchek
&quot;?&quot; will produce a command summary listing all
options and settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For settings that take a list of
keywords, namely -arguments, -array, -calltree, -common,
-crossref, -f77, -f90, -f95, -intrinsic, -makedcls, -mkhtml,
-portability, -pretty, <br>
-project, -source, -style, -truncation, and -usage, the list
consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. If the
list of keywords is omitted, the effect is to set the <br>
option to its turn-on value (same as
&lsquo;&lsquo;all&rsquo;&rsquo; in most cases). Also, if the
list is omitted, the setting name can be prefixed with no or
no- to turn off all the options it con&acirc; <br>
trols. For example, -f77 turns on all warnings about
nonstandard constructions, while -nof77 turns them all off.
Three special keywords are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">help Print out all the option
keywords controlled by the setting, with a brief explanation
of their meanings. This keyword cannot be given in a list
with other keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">all Set all options. This turns
on all options controlled by the setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">none Clear all options. This
turns off all options controlled by the setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These three special keywords
must be given in full. For all other keywords, only as many
letters of the keyword as are necessary to identify it
unambiguously need be given, or a <br>
wildcard pattern may be used. Including a keyword in the
list turns the corresponding option on. For example,
-f77=intrinsic would turn on only the warnings about use of
non&acirc; <br>
standard intrinsic functions. Prefixing a keyword by no-
turns its option off. For example, -pretty=no-long-line
turns off warnings about lines exceeding 72 columns in
length <br>
while leaving all other warnings about misleading appearance
in effect. If a setting has default none, you can turn on
all options except one or two by using all first. For <br>
example, -f77=all,no-include enables warnings about all
nonstandard extensions except INCLUDE statements. If a
setting has default all, you can turn off all warnings
except one <br>
or two by using none first. For example,
-truncation=none,demotion would turn off all precision
related warnings except about demotions. Wildcard patterns
contain an asterisk <br>
to stand for any string of characters. If a wildcard pattern
is used, all the warnings that match it are affected. If no-
is prefixed to the pattern, all the matching warnings <br>
are turned off, otherwise they are all turned on. The
minimum unambiguous length rule does not apply to wildcard
matching. For example, use -usage=no-*var* to turn off all
<br>
warnings relating to variable usage (both local and common).
(Unix users may need to quote any options containing
wildcards in order to prevent the shell from attempting to
<br>
expand them.) Wildcards are recognized only in lists of
warning keywords, not in the top-level options
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When ftnchek starts up, it looks
for environment variables and also for a preferences file.
Any options defined in the environment or in the preferences
file are used as <br>
defaults in place of the built-in defaults. They are
over-ridden by any command line options. See the section on
changing the defaults for details about the environment
options <br>
and the preferences file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When giving a name of an input
file, the extension is optional. If no extension is given,
ftnchek will first look for a project file with extension
.prj, and will use that if it <br>
exists. If not, then ftnchek will look for a Fortran source
file with the extension .for for VMS systems, .f for UNIX
systems. More than one file name can be given to ftnchek,
<br>
and it will process the modules in all files as if they were
in a single file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wildcards are allowed in the
specification of filenames on the command line for the VMS
and MS-DOS versions, as also of course under UNIX and any
other system that performs wild&acirc; <br>
card expansion in the command processor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no filename is given, ftnchek
will read input from the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
This section provides a more detailed discussion of ftnchek
command-line options. Options and filenames may be
interspersed on a command line. Most options are positional:
each <br>
option remains in effect from the point it is encountered
until it is overridden by a later change. Thus for example,
the listing may be suppressed for some files and not for
<br>
others. Exceptions are: the -intrinsic, -pointersize, and
-wordsize settings, which cannot be changed once processing
of input files has started; the -arguments, -array,
-call&acirc; <br>
tree, -common, -crossref, -extern, -reference, -resources,
-sort, -vcg, and -volatile options, where the action depends
only on the value of the option after the processing of <br>
input files is finished; and the -include setting, which is
cumulative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The option names in the
following list are in alphabetical order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-arguments=list <br>
Controls warnings about mismatches between actual and dummy
subprogram arguments, and also about mismatches between
expected and actual subprogram type. (An actual argu&acirc;
<br>
ment is an argument passed to the subprogram by the caller;
a dummy argument is an argument received by the subprogram.)
By default, all warnings are turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. Since all these warnings are
on by default, include a keyword prefixed by no- to turn off
a particular warn&acirc; <br>
ing. There are three special keywords: all to turn on all
the warnings about arguments, none to turn them all off, and
help to print the list of all the keywords with a <br>
brief explanation of each. If list is omitted, -arguments is
equivalent to -arguments=all, and -noarguments is equivalent
to -arguments=none. The warning keywords with <br>
their meanings are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arrayness: <br>
warn about inconsistent use of arguments that are arrays.
These warnings can be further controlled by the -array
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type: <br>
warn about dummy arguments of a different data type from the
actual arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function-type: <br>
warn if the invocation assumes the function&rsquo;s return
value is a different type than it actually is. Also warns if
a function is called as a subroutine, or vice-versa.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">number: <br>
warn about invoking a subprogram with a different number of
arguments than the subprogram expects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with previous
versions of ftnchek, a numeric form of this setting is also
accepted: the list is replaced by a number from 0 to 3. A
value of 0 turns <br>
all the warnings off, 1 turns on only number, 2 turns on all
except number, and 3 turns all the warnings on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting does not apply to
checking invocations of intrinsic functions or statement
functions, which can only be turned off by the -nocheck
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -array, -library,
-usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-array=list <br>
Controls the degree of strictness in checking agreement
between actual and dummy subprogram arguments that are
arrays. The warnings controlled by this setting are for <br>
constructions that might legitimately be used by a
knowledgeable programmer, but that often indicate
programming errors. By default, all warnings are turned
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. Since all these warnings are
on by default, include a keyword prefixed by no- to turn off
a particular warn&acirc; <br>
ing. There are three special keywords: all to turn on all
the warnings about array arguments, none to turn them all
off, and help to print the list of all the keywords <br>
with a brief explanation of each. If list is omitted, -array
is equivalent to -array=all, and -noarray is equivalent to
-array=none. The warning keywords with their <br>
meanings are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dimensions: <br>
warn if the arguments differ in their number of dimensions,
or if the actual argument is an array element while the
dummy argument is a whole array.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">size: <br>
warn if both arguments are arrays, but they differ in number
of elements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with previous
versions of ftnchek, a numeric form of this setting is also
accepted: the list is replaced by a number from 0 to 3. A
value of 0 turns <br>
all the warnings off, 1 turns on only dimensions, 2 turns on
only size, and 3 turns all the warnings on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: A warning is always given
regardless of this setting if the actual argument is an
array while the dummy argument is a scalar variable, or if
the actual argument is a <br>
scalar variable or expression while the dummy argument is an
array. These cases are seldom intentional. (To turn off even
these warnings, use -arguments=no-arrayness.) <br>
No warning is ever given if the actual argument is an array
element while the dummy argument is a scalar variable.
Variable-dimensioned arrays and arrays dimensioned with <br>
1 or asterisk match any number of array elements. There is
no check of whether multi-dimensional arrays agree in the
size of each dimension separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -arguments, -library,
-usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-brief <br>
Selects a shorter format for some warning messages. At
present, the only warnings controlled by this flag are those
that are printed at the end of processing each subpro&acirc;
<br>
gram. These include warnings about variables that are set
but not used or used before set, variable names that do not
conform to the Fortran 77 standard, etc. (These <br>
warnings may be suppressed entirely depending on other
flags, such as the -usage or -f77 flags.) In the default
format each variable is listed on a separate line, along
<br>
with the line number where the variable is declared, set or
used, according to the nature of the warning. The briefer
format simply lists all variables to which the warn&acirc;
<br>
ing applies, with up to 4 variables per line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -quiet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-calltree=list <br>
Causes ftnchek to print out the call structure of the
complete program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. There are two special
keywords: none to turn off all the options, and help to
print the list of all the key&acirc; <br>
words with a brief explanation of each. (The keyword all
turns on all the options, but should not normally be used
since only one format should be specified.) If list is <br>
omitted, -calltree is equivalent to -calltree=tree, and
-nocalltree is equivalent to -calltree=none. By default no
call graph is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -mkhtml option is invoked
and tree is the applied calltree option, a file named
CallTree.html, will also be produced depicting the tree in
HTML format. This file <br>
is useful as a starting point for browsing the HTML files
describing each component of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keywords which control which
format is used are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tree: <br>
produce the call graph in tree format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">reference: <br>
produce the call graph in who-calls-who format (same as
-reference switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vcg: <br>
produce the call graph in VCG format (same as -vcg
switch).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Only one of the formats tree,
reference, or vcg may be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following keywords control
options affecting the output:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prune: <br>
prune repeated subtrees (applicable only with tree). This
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sort: <br>
sort children of each routine into alphabetical order. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the discussion of the
-reference and -vcg flags for details about these
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For tree format, The call graph
is printed out starting from the main program, which is
listed on the first line at the left margin. Then on the
following lines, each <br>
routine called by the main program is listed, indented a few
spaces, followed by the subtree starting at that
routine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the default mode, if a
routine is called by more than one other routine, its call
subtree is printed only the first time it is encountered
Later calls give only the <br>
routine name and the notice &lsquo;&lsquo;(see
above)&rsquo;&rsquo;. To have the subtree printed for each
occurrence of the routine, use option no-prune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the call tree will be
incomplete if any of the input files are project files
containing more than one module that were created in
-library mode. See the discus&acirc; <br>
sion of project files below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Technical points: Each list of
routines called by a given routine is printed in
alphabetical order unless the no-sort option is given. If
multiple main programs are <br>
found, the call tree of each is printed separately. If no
main program is found, a report to that effect is printed
out, and the call trees of any top-level non-library <br>
routines are printed. This flag only controls the printing
of the call tree: ftnchek constructs the call tree in any
case because it is used to determine which library <br>
modules will be cross-checked. See the discussion of the
-library flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with previous
versions of ftnchek, a numeric form of this setting is also
accepted: the list is replaced by a number from 0 to 15.
This number is <br>
formed from 1 for tree format, 2 for reference format, or 3
for vcg format, plus 4 for no-prune, and 8 for no-sort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -crossref, -library,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-check <br>
This switch is provided so that errors and warning messages
can be turned off when ftnchek is used for purposes other
than finding bugs, such as making declarations or <br>
printing the call tree. It is positional, so after turning
all checks off, selected checks can be turned back on. The
effect of -nocheck is to put all switches, numeric <br>
settings, and settings controlling lists of warnings to
their turn-off values, as if they had all been specified
with the -no prefix. Switches and settings that specify <br>
options and modes of operation, rather than controlling
warnings, are unaffected. These are -columns, -crossref,
-include, -intrinsic, -library, -list, -makedcls, <br>
-novice, -output, -pointersize, -project, -quiet,
-reference, -resources, -sort, -source, -symtab, -vcg,
-version, -wordsize, and -wrap. Default = yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parse errors (syntax errors due
to unrecognized or malformed statements) are not suppressed
by this switch, since the results may be incorrect if
ftnchek has not parsed <br>
the program correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some miscellaneous
errors and warning messages that are not controlled by any
other switch, and so can be turned off only by this switch.
Note that using -check <br>
following -nocheck only has the effect of turning these
special warnings back on, and does not restore all the
checks it turned off. These warnings are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Module contains no executable
statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o In free source form, missing
space where space is required (e.g. between a keyword and an
identifier) or space present where none is allowed (e.g.
within an identi&acirc; <br>
fier).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Zero or negative length
specification in a data type declaration of the form
type*len.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Invalid operand(s) in an
expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Array assigned to scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Type mismatch between DO index
and bounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Undefined common block
declared in SAVE statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Intrinsic function explicitly
declared with an incompatible type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Unknown intrinsic function
explicitly declared in an INTRINSIC statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Intrinsic function passed as a
subprogram argument is not declared in an INTRINSIC
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Intrinsic function or
statement function invoked incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Function does not set return
value prior to RETURN statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Parameter constant value not
evaluated (this is ftnchek&rsquo;s fault, and it is just
informing you of the fact).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Entry point of a subprogram is
later used as a different subprogram&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Unknown keyword used in an I/O
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Illegal label reference (e.g.
GOTO refers to a non-executable statement; I/O statement
refers to a non-format statement).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-columns=num <br>
Set maximum statement length to num columns. (Beyond this is
ignored.) This setting is provided to allow checking of
programs which may violate the Fortran standard <br>
limit of 72 columns for the length of a statement. According
to the standard, all characters past column 72 are ignored.
If this setting is used when the -f77=long-line <br>
option is in effect, a warning will be given for any lines
in which characters past column 72 are processed. Turn-on =
max = 132. Default = 72.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting does not suppress
warnings about the presence of characters beyond column 72.
To process code with meaningful program text beyond column
72, use this setting <br>
and be sure the -f77 long-line option is off. To process
code with sequence numbers in columns 73 to 80, leave the
the columns setting at the default value and use the <br>
-pretty=no-long-line flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -f77, -pretty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-common=list <br>
This setting controls the strictness of checking of COMMON
blocks. By default, all warnings except volatile are turned
on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. Since most of these warnings
are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by no- to turn
off a particular <br>
warning. There are three special keywords: all to turn on
all the warnings, none to turn them all off, and help to
print the list of all the keywords with a brief expla&acirc;
<br>
nation of each. If list is omitted, -common is equivalent to
-common=dimensions,exact,length,type, and -nocommon is
equivalent to -common=none. The warning keywords with <br>
their meanings are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dimensions: <br>
corresponding arrays in each declaration of a block must
agree in size and number of dimensions. This option only has
an effect when used together with exact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">exact: <br>
the comparison of two blocks is done variable-by-variable
rather than simply requiring agreement between corresponding
storage locations. Use this if all declarations <br>
of a given COMMON block are supposed to be identical, which
is a good programming practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">length: <br>
warn if different declarations of the same block are not
equal in total length. The Fortran 77 Standard requires each
named common block, but not blank common, to be <br>
the same length in all modules of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type: <br>
in each declaration of a given COMMON block, corresponding
memory locations (words or bytes) must agree in data type.
If used together with exact, this will require <br>
that corresponding variables agree in data type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">volatile: <br>
Assume that COMMON blocks are volatile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many Fortran programmers assume
that variables, whether local or in COMMON, are static, i.e.
that once assigned a value, they retain that value
permanently until assigned <br>
a different value by the program. However, in fact the
Fortran 77 Standard does not require this to be the case.
Local variables may become undefined between activations
<br>
of a module in which they are declared. Similarly, COMMON
blocks may become undefined if no module in which they are
declared is active. (The technical term for entities <br>
with this behavior is &lsquo;&lsquo;automatic&rsquo;&rsquo;,
but ftnchek uses the word
&lsquo;&lsquo;volatile&rsquo;&rsquo; since it is clearer to
the nonspecialist.) Only COMMON blocks declared in a SAVE
statement, or <br>
declared in the main program or in a block data subprogram
remain defined as long as the program is running. Variables
and COMMON blocks that can become undefined at some <br>
point are called volatile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -common=volatile flag is
turned on, ftnchek will warn you if it finds a volatile
COMMON block. If, at the same time, the
-usage=com-block-volatile option is <br>
turned on (which is the default), ftnchek will try to check
whether such a block can lose its defined status between
activations of the modules where it is declared. <br>
ftnchek does not do a very good job of this: the rule used
is to see whether the block is declared in two separated
subtrees of the call tree. For instance, this would be <br>
the case if two modules, both called from the main program,
shared a volatile COMMON block. A block can also become
undefined between two successive calls of the same <br>
subprogram, but ftnchek is not smart enough to tell whether
a subprogram can be called more than once, so this case is
not checked for.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -common=volatile flag does
not affect the way ftnchek checks the usage of local
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with previous
versions of ftnchek, a numeric form of this setting is also
accepted: the list is replaced by a number from 0 to 3. A
value of 0 turns <br>
all the warnings off, 1 or greater turns on type, 2 or
greater turns on length, and 3 turns on dimensions and exact
also. The numeric form cannot turn on the volatile <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -library, -usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-crossref=list <br>
Prints cross-reference tables. Default = none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. The keywords with their
meanings are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">calls: <br>
table lists each subprogram followed by a list of routines
that call it. This listing omits library modules that are
not in the call tree of the main program. The <br>
list is alphabetized.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common: <br>
table lists each COMMON block followed by a list of the
routines that access it. These listed routines are those in
which some variables in the COMMON block are <br>
accessed, not simply those routines that declare the block.
(To find out what routines declare a COMMON block but do not
use it, see the -usage flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">labels: <br>
table lists each label followed by a list of all references
to it. A label reference is denoted by the line number and
statement type of the referring statement. <br>
The label list is in sequential order. The references are
listed in the order they are encountered in the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -calltree, -reference,
-sort, -symtab, -vcg.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-declare <br>
If this flag is set, all identifiers whose datatype is not
declared in each module will be listed. This flag is useful
for helping to find misspelled variable names, etc. <br>
The same listing will be given if the module contains an
IMPLICIT NONE statement. Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -sixchar, -usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-division <br>
This switch is provided to help users spot potential
division by zero problems. If this switch is selected, every
division except by a constant will be flagged. (It is <br>
assumed that the user is intelligent enough not to divide by
a constant which is equal to zero!) Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -portability,
-truncation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-errors=num <br>
Set the maximum number of error messages in a
&lsquo;&lsquo;cascade&rsquo;&rsquo;. During checking of
agreement of subprogram arguments, common block
declarations, and so forth, sometimes a sin&acirc; <br>
gle case will generate a long string of warnings. Often this
simply indicates some other cause than a genuine
item-by-item mismatch, such as for example a varible missing
<br>
from one list. So in such cases ftnchek stops printing the
warnings after the cascade limit is reached, and the trailer
&lsquo;&lsquo;etc...&rsquo;&rsquo; is printed to indicate
that there were <br>
more errors not printed. If you think that these warnings
are likely to be genuine, use this setting to see more of
them. Turn-on = default = 3, max = 999. A value of 0 <br>
means no limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting does not set an
overall limit on the number of error messages printed, only
the number printed in any one cascade. Most types of
warnings and error messages <br>
are not subject to the cascade effect and so are not
affected by this setting. To turn off warnings generally,
use the individual warning control options or the -nocheck
<br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-extern <br>
Causes ftnchek to report whether any subprograms invoked by
the program are never defined. Ordinarily, if ftnchek is
being run on a complete program, each subprogram <br>
other than the intrinsic functions should be defined
somewhere. Turn off this switch if you just want to check a
subset of files which form part of a larger complete
pro&acirc; <br>
gram. Subprogram arguments will still be checked for
correctness. Default = yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -extern flag is now
superseded by the -usage=ext-undefined option. For the sake
of convenience, the -extern flag is retained, so that
-noextern is equivalent to <br>
-usage=no-ext-undefined option. The -extern switch may be
retired eventually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f77=list <br>
Use this setting to catch language extensions which violate
the Fortran 77 Standard. Such extensions may cause your
program not to be portable. Examples include the use <br>
of underscores in variable names; variable names longer than
six characters; statement lines longer than 72 characters;
and nonstandard statements such as the DO ... ENDDO <br>
structure. ftnchek does not report on the use of lowercase
letters. By default, all warnings are turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This setting provides detailed
control over the warnings about supported extensions to the
Fortran 77 Standard. (Further details about the extensions
themselves are given <br>
below in the section on Extensions.) The list consists of
keywords separated by commas or colons. There are three
special keywords: all to turn on all the warnings about <br>
nonstandard extensions, none to turn them all off, and help
to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
explanation of each. If list is omitted, -f77 is equivalent
<br>
to -f77=all, and -nof77 is equivalent to -f77=none. The
warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accept-type: <br>
ACCEPT and TYPE I/O statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">array-bounds: <br>
Expressions defining array bounds that contain array
elements or function references.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assignment-stmt: <br>
Assignment statements involving arrays. In Fortran 90, an
array can be assigned to another array of compatible shape,
or a scalar can be assigned to an array. Nei&acirc; <br>
ther of these assignments is permitted in Fortran 77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A related warning occurs when an
array is assigned to a scalar. Since this is illegal also in
Fortran 90, it is always warned about regardless of the -f77
setting <br>
(unless all checking is turned off with the -nocheck
flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attribute-based-decl: <br>
Type declarations in the new Fortran 90 attribute-based
style. This style of declaration is distinguished by the use
of a double colon (::) between the list of <br>
attributes and the list of declared variables. This option
also controls warnings for use of Fortran 90 length or kind
specifiers in type declarations. (Although <br>
these specifiers can be used in non-attribute-based
declarations, they are controlled by this option to avoid
proliferation of -f77 options.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">automatic-array: <br>
Local (not dummy) arrays which have variable size. These
would correspond to arrays whose storage would have to be
dynamically allocated at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">backslash: <br>
Unix backslash escape in strings. This warning will be given
only if the -source=unix-backslash setting is specified to
cause the escape interpretation of back&acirc; <br>
slash..</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">byte: BYTE data type
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case-construct: <br>
The SELECT CASE construct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">character: <br>
Extensions to the Fortran 77 standard regarding character
data. At present, this only controls warnings about
character variables declared with zero or negative <br>
length. In Fortran 77, all character variables must be of
positive length. In Fortran 90, they can be zero length, and
declarations that specify negative lengths <br>
are permitted, turning into zero for the declared length.
Note: because negative length specifiers may indicate a
programming error, the warning about them is given <br>
even if this option is turned off, and is suppressed only by
the -nocheck flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">common-subprog-name: <br>
Common block and subprogram having the same name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">construct-name: <br>
Use of a construct-name to label a control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continuation: <br>
More than 19 successive continuation lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cpp: Unix C preprocessor
directives in the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cray-pointer: <br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;Cray pointer&rsquo;&rsquo; syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cycle-exit: <br>
The CYCLE and EXIT statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d-comment: <br>
Debugging comments starting with D in the source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dec-tab: <br>
DEC Fortran style tab-formatted source code. This warning
will be given only if the -source=dec-tab setting is
specified to cause interpretation of tabs in this <br>
style.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">do-enddo: <br>
DO loop extensions: terminal statement label omitted, END
DO, and WHILE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">double-complex: <br>
Double precision complex datatype.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format-dollarsign: <br>
Dollar sign control code in FORMAT statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">format-edit-descr: <br>
Nonstandard edit descriptors in FORMAT statements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">function-noparen: <br>
Function definition without parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">implicit-none: <br>
IMPLICIT NONE statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">include: <br>
INCLUDE statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inline-comment: <br>
Inline comments starting with an exclamation point.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">internal-list-io: <br>
List-directed I/O to or from an internal file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intrinsic: <br>
Nonstandard intrinsic functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io-keywords <br>
Nonstandard keywords used in I/O statements. These fall into
three groups. The first group includes keywords that are
accepted in Fortran 90:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACTION PAD READWRITE <br>
ADVANCE POSITION SIZE <br>
DELIM READ WRITE <br>
EOR <br>
The second group comprises the following VMS Fortran
keywords:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLOCKSIZE EXTENDSIZE READONLY
<br>
BUFFERCOUNT INITIALSIZE RECORDSIZE <br>
CARRIAGECONTROL MAXREC RECORDTYPE <br>
DEFAULTFILE NAME (in OPEN) SHARED <br>
DISP NOSPANBLOCK TYPE <br>
DISPOSE ORGANIZATION <br>
(The keyword NAME is standard only in the INQUIRE
statement.) The third group consists of the following
IBM/MVS keyword:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NUM <br>
This flag also controls a warning about use of
ACCESS=&rsquo;APPEND&rsquo;, which is accepted by some
compilers. The value of &rsquo;APPEND&rsquo; is not valid
for any I/O specifier in <br>
standard Fortran 77, and in Fortran 90 &rsquo;APPEND&rsquo;
should be used as a value of the POSITION specifier, not
ACCESS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long-line: <br>
Statements with meaningful code past 72 columns. This
warning is given only if the -columns setting has been used
to increase the statement field width.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long-name: <br>
Identifiers over 6 characters long.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed-common: <br>
Mixed character and noncharacter data in COMMON block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed-expr: <br>
Nonstandard type combinations in expressions, for example
DOUBLE PRECISION with COMPLEX, assigning hollerith to
integer, logical operations on integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name-dollarsign: <br>
Dollar sign used as a character in identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name-underscore: <br>
Underscore used as a character in identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">namelist: <br>
NAMELIST statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param-implicit-type: <br>
Implicit typing of a parameter by the data type of the value
assigned. This warning can only occur if implicit parameter
typing has been turned on by the <br>
-source=param-implicit-type option, or if the PARAMETER
statement is of the nonstandard form without parentheses. If
this option is turned on, then any instances <br>
where implicit parameter typing occurs will be warned about.
If you want to be warned only in those instances where the
implicit data type differs from the default <br>
type, use -portability=param-implicit-type instead.
According to the Fortran 77 standard, the data type of a
parameter is given by the same rules as for a variable, <br>
and if necessary a type conversion is done when the value is
assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param-intrinsic: <br>
Intrinsic function or exponentiation by a real used to
define the value of a PARAMETER definition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">param-noparen: <br>
PARAMETER statement without parentheses. The user should be
aware that the semantics of this form of the statement
differs from that of the standard form: in this <br>
form, the parameter takes its data type from the value
assigned, rather than having its default data type based on
the first letter of the parameter name. (This <br>
form of the PARAMETER statement was introduced by DEC before
the Fortran 77 standard was defined, and should be
avoided.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pointer: <br>
Fortran 90 standard pointer-related syntax, including
POINTER, TARGET and ALLOCATABLE type declarations, ALLOCATE,
DEALLOCATE, and NULLIFY statements, and pointer <br>
assignment using =&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quad-constant: <br>
Quad precision real constants, e.g. of the form 1.23Q4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">quotemark: <br>
Strings delimited by quote marks rather than
apostrophes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">relops: <br>
Relational (comparison) operators composed of punctuation,
namely: &lt; &lt;= == /= &gt; &gt;=.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">semicolon: <br>
Semicolon used as statement separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statement-order: <br>
Statements out of the sequence mandated by the Standard. The
allowed sequence is illustrated in Table 1 in the section on
Interpreting the Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeless-constant: <br>
Typeless constants, for example Z&rsquo;19AF&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">type-size: <br>
Type declarations specifying a size, for example REAL*8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">variable-format: <br>
Variable repeat specification or field size in FORMAT. These
are of the form &lt; expr &gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vms-io: <br>
Obsolete. Now has the same meaning as the io-keywords
keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f90=list <br>
This setting provides detailed control over the warnings
about supported extensions to the Fortran 77 Standard that
were not adopted as part of the Fortran 90 Standard. <br>
Note that ftnchek does not support the full Fortran 90
language. However, it does support some common extensions to
Fortran 77 that were prevalent before Fortran 90 was <br>
defined. Some of these extensions became part of the Fortran
90 Standard, but others did not. The -f90 setting warns only
about the latter. That is, this flag covers <br>
things that are neither legal Fortran 77 nor legal Fortran
90. Therefore, the warnings controlled by this flag are
basically a subset of the warnings controlled by -f77. <br>
There are a few cases, described below, where the
circumstances in which the warning is given are slightly
different for the two flags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. There are three special
keywords: all to turn on all the warnings about nonstandard
extensions, none to turn <br>
them all off, and help to print the list of all the keywords
with a brief explanation of each. If list is omitted, -f90
is equivalent to -f90=all, and -nof90 is equiva&acirc; <br>
lent to -f90=none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following keywords have
identical meanings for -f90 as for -f77. The reader is
referred to the explanations under -f77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accept-type double-complex
param-noparen <br>
backslash format-dollarsign cray-pointer <br>
byte format-edit-descr quad-constant <br>
cpp function-noparen type-size <br>
d-comment name-dollarsign variable-format <br>
dec-tab param-implicit-type vms-io</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The keywords which differ
somewhat from the corresponding -f77 keywords are as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continuation: <br>
The limit on the number of continuation lines for a
statement in fixed source form is the same, namely 19, in
Fortran 90 as in Fortran 77. For free source form the <br>
limit is 39 continuation lines, and a line containing a
continuation mark cannot be otherwise empty or contain only
a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">intrinsic: <br>
This is the same as for -f77 except for the intrinsic
functions defined in MIL-STD 1753, which are all included in
Fortran 90, and so are not warned about. (See <br>
-intrinsic for a list.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">io-keywords: <br>
This is the same as for -f77 except that no warnings are
given for the I/O keywords that are standard in Fortran
90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">long-line: <br>
Although the Fortran 90 Standard allows lines longer than 72
characters in free source form, this restriction still
applies to fixed source form. In free source <br>
form the line length limit is 132 characters, and unlike
fixed form, ftnchek does not allow this limit to be
increased.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mixed-expr: <br>
This is the same as for -f77 except for expressions mixing
extended precision real with complex data types, which are
permitted in Fortran 90.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">statement-order: <br>
This is similar to the corresponding -f77 warning, but
applies the somewhat looser restrictions on statement order
of the Fortran 90 Standard. In particular, For&acirc; <br>
tran 90 allows DATA statements and statement-function
definitions to be intermixed with specification

<p style="margin-top: 1em">typeless-constant: <br>
In Fortran 90, binary, octal, and hexadecimal constants of
the form B&rsquo;ddd&rsquo;, O&rsquo;ddd&rsquo;, and
Z&rsquo;ddd&rsquo;, respectively, are permitted. Here
&rsquo;ddd&rsquo; represents a string of dig&acirc; <br>
its. ftnchek recognizes these forms, as well as a variant of
the form X&rsquo;ddd&rsquo; for a hexadecimal constant, and
other variants in which the base indicator B, O, Z, or <br>
X follows the digit string. These variants were not adopted
in Fortran 90, so only they are warned about when this flag
is turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f95=list <br>
This setting provides detailed control over warnings about
standard Fortran 77 features that were deleted from the
Fortran 95 Standard. Unlike the -f77 and -f90 settings, <br>
these warnings apply to syntax which is legal Fortran 77.
However, since these features have been deleted from the
Standard, it is possible that programs containing them <br>
will be unacceptable to some newer compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list consists of keywords
separated by commas or colons. There are three special
keywords: all to turn on all the warnings about nonstandard
extensions, none to turn <br>
them all off, and help to print the list of all the keywords
with a brief explanation of each. If list is omitted, -f95
is equivalent to -f95=all, and -nof95 is equiva&acirc; <br>
lent to -f95=none. The warning keywords with their meanings
are as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">real-do: <br>
A DO variable of any real numeric type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pause: <br>
The PAUSE statement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">assign: <br>
The ASSIGN statement, assigned GOTO, or assigned format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h-edit: <br>
The H edit descriptor in a format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is one other Fortran 77
syntax feature that was deleted in Fortran 95, namely
branching to an ENDIF from outside the IF block. However,
ftnchek is unable to ana&acirc; <br>
lyze program flow, and so it does not provide a warning for
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -f77, -f90,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help <br>
Prints a list of all the command-line options with a short
description of each along with its default value. This
command is identical in function to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;?&rsquo;&rsquo; argument, <br>
and is provided as a convenience for those systems in which
the question mark has special meaning to the command
interpreter. Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The help listing also prints the
version number and patch level of ftnchek and a copyright
notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the
&lsquo;&lsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo; values printed in square
brackets in the help listing are, strictly speaking, not the
built-in defaults but the current values after any
environment <br>
options and any command-line options preceding the -help
option have been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -novice, -version, and
help option of all settings that take a list of
keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-identifier-chars=list <br>
Define non-alphanumeric characters that may be used in
identifiers. By default, ftnchek only accepts the dollar
sign and underscore as non-alphanumeric characters in <br>
identifier names. The characters in the list replace
whatever set of accepted non-alphanumeric characters was
previously in effect. Thus, if dollar sign or underscore
<br>
are not included in the list, they lose their status as
acceptable characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is provided to
enable ftnchek to handle source files containing
non-standard identifer names that may be needed, for
example, to access certain operating sys&acirc; <br>
tem services. See the section on Limitations and Extensions
for the treatment of identifiers containing these characters
in implicit typing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using -noidentifer-chars turns
off acceptance of non-alphanumeric characters entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-include=path <br>
Specifies a directory to be searched for files specified by
INCLUDE statements. Unlike other command-line options, this
setting is cumulative; that is, if it is given <br>
more than once on the command line, all the directories so
specified are placed on a list that will be searched in the
same order as they are given. The order in which <br>
ftnchek searches for a file to be included is: the current
directory; the directory specified by environment variable
FTNCHEK_INCLUDE if any; the directories specified by <br>
any -include options; the directory specified by environment
variable INCLUDE; and finally in a standard system-wide
directory (/usr/include for UNIX, SYS$LIBRARY for VMS, <br>
and include for MSDOS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -f77, -source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-intrinsic=list <br>
Controls whether ftnchek recognizes certain nonstandard
intrinsic functions as intrinsic. The list consists of
keywords separated by commas or colons. Some of the
key&acirc; <br>
words control whether to recognize certain groups of
functions, and other keywords control the expected syntax
for invoking some nonstandard intrinsics. Include a keyword
<br>
to turn on recognition of the corresponding set of
intrinsics or to allow the corresponding syntax. Include a
keyword prefixed by no- to turn off that recognition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are three special
keywords: all turns on recognition of all the nonstandard
intrinsics (listed below) and accepts either syntax for
those that have variations. Use <br>
none to turn off recognition of all nonstandard intrinsics
except those noted below. Use help to print the list of all
the keywords with a brief explanation of each. If <br>
list is omitted, -intrinsic is equivalent to -intrinsic=all,
and -nointrinsic is equivalent to -intrinsic=none.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The nonstandard intrinsic
functions needed to support the nonstandard extended
precision data types (double complex and quad precision) are
always recognized. The intrin&acirc; <br>
sics for the double complex data type are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDABS CDSQRT DREAL ZLOG <br>
CDCOS DCMPLX IMAG ZSIN <br>
CDEXP DCONJG ZABS ZSQRT <br>
CDLOG DIMAG ZEXP ZCOS <br>
CDSIN <br>
The intrinsics for the quad precision and quad complex types
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CQABS QARCOS QEXT QNINT <br>
CQCOS QARSIN QEXTD QPROD <br>
CQEXP QATAN QFLOAT QREAL <br>
CQLOG QATAN2 QIMAG QSIGN <br>

DBLEQ QCOS QLOG10 QSQRT <br>
IQINT QCOSH QMAX1 QTAN <br>
IQNINT QDIM QMIN1 QTANH <br>
QABS QEXP QMOD SNGLQ <br>
The keywords controlling recognition of other nonstandard
intrinsic functions are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">extra: <br>
recognize the following commonly available nonstandard
intrinsics (all except EXIT and LOC are defined in MIL-STD
1753):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTEST IBCLR IEOR ISHFTC <br>
EXIT IBITS IOR LOC <br>
IAND IBSET ISHFT NOT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unix: recognize these common
Unix-specific intrinsic functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABORT GMTIME LTIME SRAND <br>
AND IARGC OR SYSTEM <br>
GETARG IRAND RAND TIME <br>
GETENV LSHIFT RSHIFT XOR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">vms: recognize these common
VMS-specific intrinsic functions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATE IDATE SECNDS TIME <br>
ERRSNS RAN SIZEOF</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iargc-no-argument: <br>
specify that IARGC may be invoked with no arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iargc-one-argument: <br>
specify that IARGC may be invoked with one argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand-no-argument: <br>
specify that RAND and IRAND may be invoked with no
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rand-one-argument: <br>
specify that RAND and IRAND may be invoked with one
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The no-argument and one-argument
keywords work as follows: turning the option on causes
ftnchek to accept the corresponding syntax for invocation of
the function, without <br>
excluding the possibility of the alternative syntax. Turning
the option off causes the corresponding syntax not to be
accepted. If both options are turned on at once <br>
(the default), then either syntax is accepted. Turning both
options off at once would not be meaningful. These options
have no effect if recognition of Unix intrinsics <br>
has been turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that this setting does not
control whether non-standard warnings are issued about these
functions. It controls whether the functions are assumed to
be intrinsic or <br>
not, which determines how their usage is checked. When
functions in any of these sets are included, their
invocations will be checked according to the rules for the
<br>
intrinsic functions; otherwise they will be checked as
normal (user-written) external functions. The non-standard
warnings are controlled by the -f77=intrinsic option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default value of this
setting is equivalent to -intrinsic=all followed by
-intrinsic=no-vms for the Unix version, -intrinsic=no-unix
for the VMS version, and -intrin&acirc; <br>
sic=no-unix,no-vms for other versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: In versions of ftnchek
prior to 2.10, the -intrinsic flag took a numeric argument
instead of a list of options. For the sake of users who may
have written scripts <br>
invoking ftnchek in this way, the numeric form is still
accepted. The numeric form of the setting consists of three
digits. The ones digit selects the set of intrinsic <br>
functions to be supported. The digit 0 selects only Fortran
77 standard intrinsics plus those needed to support the
nonstandard extended precision data types. The digit <br>
1 is equivalent to extra, 2 is equivalent to extra,unix, and
3 is equivalent to extra,vms. The tens digit of this setting
controls the syntax of the RAND intrinsic func&acirc; <br>
tion, and the hundreds digit controls the syntax of the
IARGC function. For these digits, specify 0 to require
invocation with no argument, 1 to require one argument, and
<br>
2 to allow either form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -f77.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-library <br>
This switch is used when a number of subprograms are
contained in a file, but not all of them are used by the
application. Normally, ftnchek warns you if any subprograms
<br>
are defined but never used. This switch will suppress these
warnings. Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This switch also controls which
subprogram calls and COMMON block declarations are checked.
If a file is read with the -library flag in effect, the
subprogram calls and <br>
COMMON declarations contained in a routine in that file will
be checked only if that routine is in the main
program&rsquo;s call tree. On the other hand, if the
-library switch <br>
is turned off, then ftnchek checks the calls of every
routine by every other routine, regardless of whether those
routines could ever actually be invoked at run time, and
<br>
likewise all COMMON block declarations are compared for
agreement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The difference between this
switch and the -usage=no-ext-unused option for subprograms
is that the latter suppresses only the warning about
routines being declared but not <br>
used. The -library switch goes further and excludes unused
routines processed while it is in effect from all
cross-checking of arguments and COMMON block declarations as
<br>
well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(If there is no main program
anywhere in the set of files that ftnchek has read, so that
there is no call tree, then ftnchek will look for any
non-library routines that <br>
are not called by any other routine, and use these as
substitutes for the main program in constructing the call
tree and deciding what to check. If no such top-level non-
<br>
library routines are found, then all inter-module calls and
all COMMON declarations will be checked.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See also: -arguments, -calltree,
-common, -extern, -usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-list <br>
Specifies that a listing of the Fortran program is to be
printed out with line numbers. If ftnchek detects an error,
the error message follows the program line with a <br>
caret ( ^ ) specifying the location of the error. If no
source listing was requested, ftnchek will still print out
any line containing an error, to aid the user in
deter&acirc; <br>
mining where the error occurred. Default = no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-makedcls=list <br>
Prepare a neatly-formatted file of declarations of
variables, common blocks, and namelist lists, for possible
merging into the source code. The declarations are stored in
<br>
a file of the same name as the source code, but with the
extension changed to .dcl. If no declarations are written to
the file, it is deleted to reduce clutter from empty <br>
files.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>If input comes from standard
input, instead of a named file, then declarations are
written to standard output.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Variables are declared in
alphabetical order within each declaration class and type,
with integer variables first, because of their later
possible use in array dimensions.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>PARAMETER statements are an
exception to the alphabetical order rule, because the
Fortran 77 Standard requires that the expressions defining
parameter values refer only to <br>
constants and already-defined parameter names. This forces
the original source file order of such statements to be
preserved in the declaration files.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Explicit declaration of all
variables is considered good modern programming practice. By
using compiler options to reject undeclared variables,
misspelled variable names <br>
(or names extending past column 72) can be caught at compile
time. Explicit declarations also greatly facilitate changing
floating-point precision with filters such as <br>
dtoq(1L), dtos(1L), fd2s(1L), fs2d(1L), qtod(1L), and
stod(1L). These programs are capable of changing types of
explicit floating-point type declarations, intrinsic
func&acirc; <br>
tions, and constants, but because they do not carry out
rigorous lexical and grammatical analysis of the Fortran
source code, they cannot provide modified type
declara&acirc; <br>
tions for undeclared variables. Default setting = 0, turn-on
= 1.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Various options for the form

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>declarations (1): <br>
Write a declaration file. (This is implied by any of the
other options, and can be omitted if any other options are
given.)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>undeclared-only (2): <br>
By default, all variables are included in the declaration
file. With this option, include only undeclared variables.
This setting is useful if you want to check <br>
for undeclared variables, since Fortran source files with
all variables properly declared will not result in a .dcl
file. With this option, common blocks and <br>
namelist lists will not be included in the declaration file,
since by their nature they cannot be undeclared.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>compact (4): <br>
The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line up
neatly in common columns, as in the declaration files output
by the Extended PFORT Verifier, pfort(1L). This <br>

alignment.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>use-continuation-lines (8):

the form NPRddd, NXdddd, N2dddd, and N3dddd, where d is a

the SFTRAN3 source code, and will change if the SFTRAN3 code
is modified, such variables should not be explicitly

letter, N.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>asterisk-comment (128): <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>suppress-array-dimensions
(512): <br>
Suppress dimensioning of arrays in the generated
declarations. This option is for use with code lacking type
declarations, to allow the declaration files to be <br>
inserted without change into the code. Since the code will
have dimension statements already, dimensioning the array
variables in the type statements of the decla&acirc; <br>
ration file is redundant. This option should be used only in
conjunction with option 2 = undeclared-only because
otherwise any arrays that were dimensioned in a <br>
type statement will lose their dimensioning.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>free-form (1024): <br>
Produce declarations in free source form. This mode is
automatically used if the input source is free form. Use
this option to produce declarations in free form <br>

are indented only 2 columns instead of 6, use the
exclamation mark as the comment character, and indicate <br>
continuation lines by an ampersand at the end of the line to

option.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>A project file contains a
summary of information from the source file, for use in
checking agreement among FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, and COMMON
usages in other files. It <br>
allows incremental checking, which saves time whenever you
have a large set of files containing shared subroutines,
most of which seldom change. You can run ftnchek once <br>
on each file with the -project flag set, creating the
project files. Usually you would also set the -library and
-noextern flags at this time, to suppress messages

pertaining to each file by itself will be printed at this
time. Thereafter, run ftnchek without these flags on <br>
all the project files together, to check consistency among
the different files. All messages internal to the individual

Assume functions are &lsquo;&lsquo;pure&rsquo;&rsquo;, i.e.,
they will not have side effects by modifying their arguments
or variables in a COMMON block. When this flag is in effect,
ftnchek <br>
will base its determination of set and used status of the
actual arguments on the assumption that arguments passed to
a function are not altered. It will also issue a <br>
warning if a function is found to modify any of its
arguments or any COMMON variables. Default = yes.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>When this flag is turned off,
actual arguments passed to functions will be handled the
same way as actual arguments passed to subroutines. This
means that ftnchek will <br>
assume that arguments may be modified by the functions. No
warnings will be given if a function is found to have side
effects. Because stricter checking is possible if <br>
functions are assumed to be pure, you should turn this flag
off only if your program actually uses functions with side
effects.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-quiet <br>
This option reduces the amount of output relating to normal
operation, so that error messages are more apparent. This
option is provided for the convenience of users who <br>
are checking large suites of files. The eliminated output
includes the names of project files, and the message
reporting that no syntax errors were found. It also
elimi&acirc; <br>
nates some blank lines that are ordinarily included for
clarity. (Some of this output is turned back on by the -list

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The reference list omits
routines called by unused library modules. Thus it contains
the same information as for the call-tree format, namely the

units of the size of one item, not necessarily in <br>
bytes. When the initially allocated space is filled up, more
memory is allocated in chunks of this size. The following is
an explanation of the items printed:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Source lines processed: <br>
Total number of lines of code, with separate totals for
statement lines and comment lines. Comment lines include
lines with &rsquo;C&rsquo; or &rsquo;*&rsquo; in column 1 as
well as blank <br>
lines and lines containing only an inline comment. Statement
lines are all other lines, including lines that have an
inline comment following some code. Continuation <br>
lines are counted as separate lines. Lines in include files
are counted each time the file is included.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Total executable statements:
<br>
Number of statements in the program, other than
specification, data, statement-function, FORMAT, ENTRY, and
END statements.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Total number of modules: <br>
A module is any external subprogram, including the main
program, subroutines, functions, and block data units. This
count is of modules defined within the source, not <br>
modules referenced. Statement functions are not included. A
subprogram with multiple entry points is only counted
once.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Total statement labels
defined <br>
Number of labels attached to statements (often called
statement numbers). The total label count for the entire
program is given, as well as the maximum number in any <br>
single subprogram.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Max identifier name chars:
<br>
Number of characters used for storing identifier names. An
identifier is a variable, subprogram, or common block name.
Local names are those of local variables in a <br>
subprogram, whereas global names refer to subprogram and
common block names, as well as dummy argument names and
common variable names. Actual argument text (up to 15 <br>
characters for each argument) is also included here. The
space used for local names is not recovered at the end of
each module, so this number, like global space, <br>
grows until the whole program is analyzed. Unfortunately,
this figure may include some text stored more than once,
although a heuristic is used that will avoid dupli&acirc;
<br>
cates in many cases.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Max token text chars: <br>
A token is the smallest syntactic unit of the FORTRAN
language above the level of individual characters. For
instance a token can be a variable name, a numerical
con&acirc; <br>
stant, a quoted text string, or a punctuation character.
Token text is stored while a module is being processed. For
technical reasons, single-character tokens are <br>
not included in this total. Items that are not represented
in the symbol table may be duplicated. The space for token
text is recovered at the end of each module, so <br>
this figure represents the maximum for any one
module.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Max local symbols: <br>
This is the largest number of entries in the local symbol
table for any module. Local symbol table entries include all
variables and parameters, common block names, <br>
statement functions, external subprograms and intrinsic
functions referenced by the module. Literal constants are
not stored in the local symbol table.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Max global symbols: <br>
This is the number of entries in the global symbol table at
the end of processing. Global symbol table entries include
external subprogram and common block names. <br>
Intrinsic functions and statement functions are not
included.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Max number of tokenlists:
<br>
A token list is a sequence of tokens representing the actual
or dummy argument list of a subprogram, or the list of
variables in a common block or namelist. Therefore <br>
this number represents the largest sum of COMMON, CALL,
NAMELIST and ENTRY statements and function invocations for
any one module. The space is recovered at the end <br>
of each module.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Max token list/tree space:
<br>
This is the largest number of tokens in all the token lists
and token trees of any one module. A token tree is formed
when analyzing an expression: each operand is a <br>
leaf of the tree, and the operators are the nodes. Therefore
this number is a measure of the maximum complexity of an
individual module. For instance a module with <br>
many long arithmetic expressions will have a high number.
Note that unlike token text described above, the number of
tokens is independent of the length of the vari&acirc; <br>
able names or literal constants in the expressions.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Number of subprogram
invocations: <br>
This is the sum over all modules of the number of CALL
statements and function invocations (except intrinsic
functions and statement functions).</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Number of common block decls:
<br>
This is the sum over all modules of the number of common
block declarations. That is, each declaration of a block in
a different module is counted separately. (The <br>
standard allows multiple declarations of a block within the
same module; these are counted as only one declaration since
they are equivalent to a single long declara&acirc; <br>
tion.)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Number of array dim &amp;
param ptrs: <br>
This is the sum over all modules of the number of array
dimension and parameter definition text strings saved for
use by the -makedcls option. The length of the text <br>
strings is not counted. Each dimension of a multidimensional
array is counted separately.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>These numbers are obviously
not the same when project files are used in place of the
original source code. Even the numbers for global entities
may be different, since <br>
some redundant information is eliminated in project
files.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-sixchar <br>
One of the goals of the ftnchek program is to help users to
write portable Fortran programs. One potential source of
nonportability is the use of variable names that are <br>
longer than six characters. Some compilers just ignore the
extra characters. This behavior could potentially lead to
two different variables being considered as the <br>
same. For instance, variables named AVERAGECOST and
AVERAGEPRICE are the same in the first six characters. If
you wish to catch such possible conflicts, use this flag.
<br>
Default = no.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Use the -f77=long-names if

not just those pairs that are the same in the first
six.</b></p>

-portability.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-sort <br>
Specifies that a sorted list of all modules used in the
program be printed. This list is in
&lsquo;&lsquo;prerequisite&rsquo;&rsquo; order, i.e. each
module is printed only after all the modules <br>
from which it is called have been printed. This is also
called a &lsquo;&lsquo;topological sort&rsquo;&rsquo; of the
call tree. Each module is listed only once. Routines that
are not in the <br>
call tree of the main program are omitted. If there are any

warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>fixed: <br>
Interpret the source as fixed form (with supported
extensions such as exclamation mark for comments).
Statements must be in columns 7 to 72 (unless the -cols

significant outside character context (but warned about
under the -pretty option). This is the default mode <br>
unless the source file extension is .f90 or .F90. this
option cannot be given together with -source=free.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>free: Interpret the source as
free form. Statements may be anywhere in columns 1 to 132,
comments can only begin with an exclamation mark, and blanks
are required in some <br>
places such as between identifiers and keywords. This is the
default mode if the source file extension is .f90 or .F90.
This option cannot be given together with <br>
-source=fixed or -source=dec-tab</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>dec-tab (1): <br>
Accept DEC-style tab-formatted source. A line beginning with
an initial tab will be treated as a new statement line
unless the character after the tab is a nonzero <br>
digit, in which case it is treated as a continuation line.
The next column after the tab or continuation mark is taken
as column 7. A warning will be given in the <br>
case where the line is a continuation, if -f77=dec-tab is in
effect.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>vms-include (2): <br>
Accept VMS-style INCLUDE statements. These follow the normal
syntax, but with the following additional features: (1) the
file extension, if not given, defaults to <br>
the same as a normal source file extension; and (2) the
option /LIST or /NOLIST can be appended to the include-file
name, to control listing of its contents.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>unix-backslash (4): <br>
Handle UNIX-style backslash escapes in character strings.
The escape sequence following the backslash will be
evaluated according to the ANSI standard for strings <br>
in C: up to three digits signify an octal value, an x
signifies the start of a hexadecimal constant, any of the
letters a b f n r t signify special control codes, <br>
and any other character (including newline) signifies the
character itself. When this source code option is in effect,
a warning will be given if the -f77=backslash <br>
setting is specified.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The default behavior is to
treat the backslash like any other normal character, but a
warning about portability will be generated if the

much with the interpreted string, it is seldom necessary to

continue a string across multiple source lines; or (c) a
PARAMETER definition uses an intrinsic string func&acirc;
<br>
tion such as LEN with such a string as argument, and that
value is later used to define array dimensions, etc.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>param-implicit-type (8): <br>
Implicit typing of a parameter by the data type of the value
assigned. Some non-standard compilers may allow the data
type of the value to override the Fortran 77 <br>
default type of a parameter that is based on the first
letter of the parameter name. This option only applies to
PARAMETER statements of the standard form which has <br>
parentheses. A parameter that has been explicitly declared
in a type statement prior to the PARAMETER statement is not
affected by this option. A warning will be <br>
given under the -f77=param-implicit-type or

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Note that this implicit
typing is treated as equivalent to an explicit type
declaration for the parameter. Therefore, if you use
-makedcls=undeclared-only to gener&acirc; <br>
ate declarations only of undeclared variables, these
parameters will not be included.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>dec-param-standard-type (16):
<br>
Follow the Fortran 77 rule for data typing of DEC Fortran
style parameters. These are declared using a nonstandard
form of the PARAMETER statement which lacks <br>
parentheses. According to DEC Fortran, parameters defined by
this form of the statement have their data type given by the
data type of the value assigned. Use this <br>
option to tell ftnchek not to follow this rule but instead
to use the same rule as for standard PARAMETER statements.

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>distinct-do: <br>
Complain if two DO loops share a common terminator
statement.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>do-construct: <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>labeled-stmt: <br>
Complain about the presence of labels (numbers) on

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-wordsize=num <br>
Specifies the default word size to be num bytes. This is the
size of logical and single-precision numeric variables that

precisions for non-character variables are an extension to
the Fortran 77 Standard, and are given by type declarations
such as REAL*8 X.) Double-precision and complex <br>

variables four times. Quad-precision constants and intrinsic
function results will be four times this value. Note <br>
that variables declared as REAL*16 will be regarded as quad
precision only if the word size is 4 bytes. Default =

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The word size is used to

lower precision value to higher precision in an arithmetic
expression or an assignment statement.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Giving a word size of 0, or

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>CHANGING THE DEFAULTS <br>
ftnchek includes two mechanisms for changing the default
values of all options: by defining environment variables or
by creating a preferences file. When ftnchek starts up, it
<br>
looks in its environment for any variables whose names are
composed by prefixing the string FTNCHEK_ onto the
uppercased version of the option name. If such a variable is
found, <br>
its value is used to specify the default for the
corresponding switch or setting. In the case of settings
(for example, the -common strictness setting) the value of
the environ&acirc; <br>
ment variable is read as the default setting value. In the
case of switches, the default switch will be taken as true
or yes unless the environment variable has the value 0 or
<br>
NO.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Note that the environment
variable name must be constructed with the full-length
option name, which must be in uppercase. For example, to
make ftnchek print a source listing by <br>
default, set the environment variable FTNCHEK_LIST to 1 or
YES or anything other than 0 or NO. The names FTNCHEK_LIS
(not the full option name) or ftnchek_list (lower case) <br>
would not be recognized.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Here are some examples of how
to set environment variables on various systems. For
simplicity, all the examples set the default -list switch to
YES.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>1. UNIX, Bourne shell: $
FTNCHEK_LIST=YES <br>
$ export FTNCHEK_LIST</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>2. UNIX, C shell: % setenv

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>3. VAX/VMS: $ DEFINE
FTNCHEK_LIST YES</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>4. MSDOS: $ SET
FTNCHEK_LIST=YES</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>After processing any
environment variables, ftnchek looks for a preferences file
containing options and settings. It will search in the
following order, using only the first <br>
file found: (1) .ftnchekrc in the current directory, (2)
ftnchek.ini in the current directory, (3) .ftnchekrc in the
user&rsquo;s home directory, (4) ftnchek.ini in the home
directory. <br>
If such a file is found, the options defined in it are used
as defaults in place of the built-in defaults and overriding
any defaults set in the environment..</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Each option or setting in the
preferences file must be on a separate line. They are given
in the same form as on the command line, except without the
initial dash. The prefer&acirc; <br>
ences file can contain blank lines and comments. Comments
are introduced at any point in a line by a space character
(blank or tab) or the &rsquo;#&rsquo; character, and are
terminated by <br>
the end of the line.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Command-line options override
the defaults set in the environment or in the preferences
file, in the same way as they override the built-in

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>USING PROJECT FILES <br>
This section contains detailed information on how to use
project files most effectively, and how to avoid some
pitfalls.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>One can divide the checks
ftnchek does into two categories, local and global. Local
checking is restricted to within a single routine, and
catches things like uninitialized <br>
variables, unintended loss of precision in arithmetic
expressions, etc. This sort of checking can be done on each
subprogram independently. Furthermore, local checking of a
<br>
subprogram does not need to be repeated when some other
subprogram is changed. Global checking catches things like
calling a subroutine with the wrong argument types, or
dis&acirc; <br>
agreeing in common block declarations. It requires looking
at the whole set of subprograms interacting with each
other.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The purpose of project files
is to allow the local checking and global checking steps to
be separated. Assuming that each subprogram is in its own
source file, you can run <br>
ftnchek once on each one to do local checking while
suppressing global checking. Then ftnchek can be run once on
all the project files together to do the global checking.
The <br>
sample makefile below shows how to automate this task. The
&lsquo;&lsquo;.f.prj&rsquo;&rsquo; target updates a project
file for a particular file any time the source file changes.
The information <br>
needed for global checking is saved in the project file. The
&lsquo;&lsquo;check&rsquo;&rsquo; target does the combined
global checking. Typically &lsquo;&lsquo;make
check&rsquo;&rsquo; would repeat the &lsquo;&lsquo;ftnchek
-project&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
step only on changed source files, then do the global check.
This is obviously a big advantage for large programs, when
many subprograms seldom if ever change.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>It is best when using project
files to place each subprogram in a separate source file. If
each source file may contain more than one subprogram, it
complicates the definition <br>
of &lsquo;&lsquo;local&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;global&rsquo;&rsquo; checking because there is
some inter-module checking that is contained within a file.
ftnchek tries to do the right thing in this case, but there
are <br>
some complications (described below) due to the trade-off
between avoiding re-doing cross-checks and preserving
information about the program&rsquo;s structure.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Ordinarily, to do the least
amount of re-checking, project files should be created with
the -library flag in effect and trimming turned on. In this
mode, the information saved <br>
in the project file consists of all subprogram declarations,
all subprogram invocations not resolved by declarations in
the same file, and one instance of each COMMON block
dec&acirc; <br>
laration. This is the minimum amount of information needed
to check agreement between files.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>If the source file contains
more than one routine, there are some possible problems that
can arise from creating the project file in library mode,
because the calling hierarchy <br>
among routines defined within the file is lost. Also, if the
routines in the file make use of COMMON blocks that are
shared with routines in other files, there will not be <br>
enough information saved for the correct checking of set and
used status of COMMON blocks and COMMON variables according
to the -usage setting. Therefore if you plan to use <br>
project files when -usage checking is turned on (which is
the default situation), and if multiple routines in one
project file share COMMON blocks with routines in other
files, <br>
the project files should be created with the -library flag
turned off. In this mode, ftnchek saves, besides the
information listed above, one invocation of each subprogram
by <br>
any other subprogram in the same file, and all COMMON block
declarations. This means that the project file will be
larger than necessary, and that when it is read in, ftnchek
<br>
may repeat some inter-module checks that it already did when
the project file was created. If each project file contains
only one module, there is no loss of information in
cre&acirc; <br>
ating the project files in library mode.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Because of the possible loss
of information entailed by creating a project file with the
-library flag in effect, whenever that project file is read
in later, it will be treated <br>
as a library file regardless of the current setting of the
-library flag. On the other hand, a project file created
with library mode turned off can be read in later in either
<br>
mode.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The foregoing discussion
assumes that the trimming options of the -project setting
are turned on when the project file is created. This is the
normal situation. The no-trim <br>
options of the -project setting are provided in case one
wants to use the project files for purposes other than
checking the program with ftnchek. For instance, one could
write <br>
a Perl script to analyze the project files for information
about how the different subprograms are called. You should
not use the no-trim options to deal with the issues of <br>
information loss discussed above, since they cause more
information than necessary to be stored. This makes the
project files bigger and causes ftnchek to do more work
later <br>
when it reads them to check your complete program.
Ordinarily, you should use the -library option to control
how much information to store for later use by ftnchek in
checking <br>
your program.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Here is an example of how to
use the UNIX make utility to automatically create a new

lists all the names of object files to be linked together
<br>
to form the complete executable program. (In this makefile,
the indented lines should each begin with a tab, not
blanks.) If any source file contains multiple routines that

routines defined in a large number of different source files
in different directories, it can be cumbersome to specify
all the different project files <br>
needed to check the program properly. To deal with such
cases, ftnchek allows project files to be concatenated into
a single large file. This single file can then be given to
<br>
ftnchek to provide the information for checking the use of
any or all of the routines defined in the combined project
files. When using such a &lsquo;&lsquo;library&rsquo;&rsquo;
project file, you may <br>
want ftnchek&rsquo;s error reports to document precisely the
name of the file where the specific function is defined. If
the various source files are in several directories, an
error <br>
report that gives only the file name may be ambiguous, and
rather should include the path to the file. The solution is
to create each of the individual project files by giving
<br>
the complete path to the source file. Then this complete
path will appear in the error reports. For example, suppose
that all of the library subprogram source files are in
sub&acirc; <br>
directories of a directory named /util/lib. Then the
individual project files could first be created by a command
such as <br>
find /util/lib -name &rsquo;*.f&rsquo; -exec ftnchek
-project &rsquo;{}&rsquo; &rsquo;;&rsquo; <br>
(Possibly other options would be provided to ftnchek as
discussed above. Also, this step could be handled instead by
a revised makefile rule that would provide the complete <br>
source file path instead of just the local name when
invoking ftnchek.) Next, concatenate all of these project
files manually. <br>
find /util/lib -name &rsquo;*.prj&rsquo; -exec cat
&rsquo;{}&rsquo; &rsquo;;&rsquo; &gt; ourlib.prj <br>
Then a program source file can be checked by using the
command <br>
ftnchek prog.f ... -lib ourlib.prj <br>
and an error message related to any library routine will
include the full path to the routine&rsquo;s source
file.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>At present, there is no
archive utility like ar to manage the contents of a
concatenated project file like the one in the illustration
above. If changes are made to one of the <br>
library routines, the only way to update the combined
project file is to concatenate all the individual project
files once again. Such a utility would be quite easy to
write. <br>
Someone should do so and contribute it to the ftnchek
effort.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT <br>
The messages given by ftnchek include not only syntax errors
but also warnings and informational messages about things
that are legal Fortran but that may indicate errors or <br>
carelessness. Most of these messages can be turned off by
command-line options. Which option controls each message
depends on the nature of the condition being warned about.
<br>
See the descriptions of the command-line flags in the
previous sections, and of individual messages below. Each
message is prefixed with a word or phrase indicating the
nature <br>
of the condition and its severity.</b></p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Error&rsquo;&rsquo;
means a syntax error. The simplest kind of syntax errors are
typographical errors, for example unbalanced parentheses or
misspelling of a keyword. This type of error <br>
is caught by the parser and appears with the description
&lsquo;&lsquo;parse error&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;syntax error&rsquo;&rsquo; (depending on the
version of the parser generator and whether it is GNU bison
or <br>
UNIX yacc). This type of error message cannot be suppressed.
Be aware that this type of error often means that ftnchek
has not properly interpreted the statement where the <br>
error occurs, so that its subsequent checking operations
will be compromised. You should eliminate all syntax errors
before proceeding to interpret the other messages ftnchek
<br>
gives.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Warning:
Nonstandard syntax&rsquo;&rsquo; indicates an extension to
Fortran that ftnchek supports but that is not according to
the Fortran 77 Standard. The extensions that ftnchek accepts
<br>
are described in the section on Extensions below. One
example is the DO ... ENDDO construction. If a program uses
these extensions, warnings will be given according to
specifi&acirc; <br>
cations under the -f77 setting. The default behavior is to
give no warnings.</b></p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Warning&rsquo;&rsquo;
in other cases means a condition that is suspicious but that
may or may not be a programming error. Frequently these
conditions are legal under the standard. Some <br>
are illegal but do not fall under the heading of syntax
errors. Usage errors are one example. These refer to the
possibility that a variable may be used before it has been
<br>
assigned a value (generally an error), or that a variable is
declared but never used (harmless but may indicate
carelessness). The amount of checking for usage errors is
con&acirc; <br>
trolled by the -usage flag, which specifies the maximum
amount of checking by default.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Truncation warnings cover
situations in which accuracy may be lost unintentionally,
for example when a double precision value is assigned to a
real variable. These warnings are <br>
controlled by the -truncation setting, which is on by
default.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Nonportable
usage&rsquo;&rsquo; warns about some feature that may not be
accepted by some compilers even though it is not contrary to
the Fortran 77 Standard, or that may cause the program <br>
to perform differently on different platforms. For example,
equivalencing real and integer variables is usually a
non-portable practice. The use of extensions to the standard
<br>
language is, of course, another source of non-portability,
but this is handled as a separate case. To check a program
for true portability, both the -portability and the -f77
<br>
flags should be used. They are both turned off by default.
The -wordsize setting is provided to check only those
nonportable usages that depend on a particular machine
word&acirc; <br>
size.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Possibly
misleading appearance&rsquo;&rsquo; is used for legal
constructions that may not mean what they appear to mean at
first glance. For example, Fortran is insensitive to blank
<br>
space, so extraneous space within variable names or the lack
of space between a keyword and a variable can convey the
wrong impression to the reader. These messages can be
sup&acirc; <br>
pressed by turning off the -pretty flag, which is on by
default.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Other messages that are given
after all the files are processed, and having to do with
agreement between modules, do not use the word
&lsquo;&lsquo;warning&rsquo;&rsquo; but generally fall into
that <br>
category. Examples include type mismatches between
corresponding variables in different COMMON block
declarations, or between dummy and actual arguments of a
subprogram. These <br>
warnings are controlled by the -common and -arguments
settings respectively. By default both are set for maximum
strictness of checking.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Another group of warnings
about conditions that are often harmless refer to cases
where the array properties of a variable passed as a
subprogram argument differ between the two <br>
routines. For instance, an array element might be passed to
a subroutine that expects a whole array. This is a
commonly-used technique for processing single rows or
columns of <br>
two-dimensional arrays. However, it could also indicate a
programming error. The -array setting allows the user to
adjust the degree of strictness to be used in checking this
<br>
kind of agreement between actual and dummy array arguments.
By default the strictness is maximum.</b></p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Oops&rsquo;&rsquo;
indicates a technical problem, meaning either a bug in
ftnchek or that its resources have been exceeded.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The syntax error messages and
warnings include the filename along with the line number and
column number. ftnchek has two different options for the
appearance of these error <br>
messages. If -novice is in effect, which is the default, the
messages are in a style approximating normal English. (In
default style, the filename is not printed in messages <br>
within the body of the program if -list is in effect.) The
other style of error messages is selected by the -nonovice
option. In this style, the appearance of the messages is
<br>
similar to that of the UNIX lint program.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ftnchek is still blind to
some kinds of syntax errors. The two most important ones are
detailed checking of FORMAT statements, and almost anything
to do with control of execu&acirc; <br>
tion flow by means of IF, DO, and GOTO statements: namely
correct nesting of control structures, matching of opening
statements such as IF ... THEN with closing statements such
<br>
as ENDIF, and the proper use of statement labels (numbers).
Most compilers will catch these errors. See the section on
Limitations for a more detailed discussion.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>If ftnchek gives you a syntax
error message when the compiler does not, it may be because
your program contains an extension to standard Fortran which
is accepted by the compiler <br>
but not by ftnchek. (See the section on Extensions.) On a
VAX/VMS system, you can use the compiler option /STANDARD to
cause the compiler to accept only standard Fortran. On <br>
most UNIX or UNIX-like systems, this can be accomplished by
setting the flag -ansi.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Many of the messages given by
ftnchek are self-explanatory. Those that need some
additional explanation are listed below in alphabetical
order.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Common block NAME: data type
mismatch at position n <br>
The n-th variable in the COMMON block differs in data type
in two different declarations of the COMMON block. By
default (-common strictness level 3), ftnchek is very <br>
picky about COMMON blocks: the variables listed in them must
match exactly by data type and array dimensions. That is,
the legal pair of declarations in different mod&acirc; <br>
ules: <br>
COMMON /COM1/ A,B <br>
and <br>
COMMON /COM1/ A(2) <br>
will cause ftnchek to give warnings at strictness level 3.
These two declarations are legal in Fortran since they both
declare two real variables. At strictness level 1 <br>
or 2, no warning would be given in this example, but the
warning would be given if there were a data type mismatch,
for instance, if B were declared INTEGER. Controlled <br>
by -common setting.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Common block NAME has long
data type following short data type <br>
Some compilers require alignment of multi-byte items so that
each item begins at an address that is a multiple of the
item size. Thus if a short (e.g. single-precision <br>
real) item is followed by a long (e.g. double precision
real) item, the latter may not be aligned correctly.
Controlled by -portability=common-alignment option.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Common block NAME has mixed
character and non-character variables <br>
The ANSI standard requires that if any variable in a COMMON
block is of type CHARACTER, then all other variables in the
same COMMON block must also be of type CHARACTER. <br>
Controlled by -f77=mixed-common option.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Common block NAME: varying
length <br>
For -common setting level 2, this message means that a
COMMON block is declared to have different numbers of words
in two different subprograms. A word is the amount of <br>
storage occupied by one integer or real variable. For
-common setting level 3, it means that the two declarations
have different numbers of variables, where an array of <br>
any size is considered one variable. This is not necessarily
an error, but it may indicate that a variable is missing
from one of the lists. Note that according to the <br>
Fortran 77 Standard, it is an error for named COMMON blocks
(but not blank COMMON) to differ in number of words in
declarations in different modules. Given for -common <br>
setting 2 or 3.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: Badly formed
logical/relational operator or constant</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: Badly formed real
constant <br>
The syntax analyzer has found the start of one of the
special words that begin and end with a period (e.g. .EQ.),
or the start of a numeric constant, but did not succeed <br>
in finding a complete item of that kind.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: cannot be adjustable
size in module NAME <br>
A character variable cannot be declared with a size that is
an asterisk in parentheses unless it is a dummy argument, a
parameter, or the name of the function defined in <br>
the module.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: cannot be declared in
SAVE statement in module NAME <br>
Only local variables and common blocks can be declared in a
SAVE statement.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: No path to this
statement <br>
ftnchek will detect statements which are ignored or
by-passed because there is no foreseeable route to the
statement. For example, an unnumbered statement (a statement
<br>
without a statement label), occurring immediately after a
GOTO statement, cannot possibly be executed.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: Parse error <br>
This means that the parser, which analyzes the Fortran
program into expressions, statements, etc., has been unable
to find a valid interpretation for some portion of a <br>
statement in the program. If your compiler does not report a
syntax error at the same place, the most common explanations
are: (1) use of an extension to ANSI standard <br>
Fortran that is not recognized by ftnchek, or (2) the
statement requires more lookahead than ftnchek uses (see
section on Bugs).</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE: This message means that
the affected statement is not interpreted. Therefore, it is
possible that ftnchek&rsquo;s subsequent processing will be
in error, if it depends on <br>
any matters affected by this statement (type declarations,
etc.).</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Error: Syntax error <br>
This is the same as &lsquo;&lsquo;Error: Parse
error&rsquo;&rsquo; (see above). It is generated if your
version of ftnchek was built using the UNIX yacc parser
generator rather than GNU bison.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Identifiers which are not

some compilers. Controlled by -sixchar option.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Nonportable usage: argument
precision may not be correct for intrinsic function <br>
The precision of an argument passed to an intrinsic function
may be incorrect on some computers. Issued when a numeric
variable declared with explicit precision (e.g. <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Nonportable usage: File

ftnchek expands tabs to be equivalent to spaces up to the
next column which is a multiple of 8. Some compilers treat
tabs differently, and also it is possible that files <br>
sent by electronic mail will have the tabs converted to
blanks in some way. Therefore files containing tabs may not
be compiled correctly after being transferred. <br>
ftnchek does not give this message if tabs only occur within
comments or character constants. Controlled by
-portability=tab.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Nonportable usage:

This warning is only given when the DO index and bounds are

If not, then if the name of the subprogram does not appear

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS
<br>
ftnchek accepts ANSI standard Fortran-77 programs with some
minor limitations and numerous common extensions.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Limitations: <br>
The dummy arguments in statement functions are treated like
ordinary variables of the program. That is, their scope is
the entire subprogram, not just the statement func&acirc;
<br>
tion definition.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The checking of FORMAT
statements is lax, tolerating missing separators (comma,
etc.) between format descriptors in places where the
Standard requires them, and allowing <br>
.d fields on descriptors that should not have them. It does
warn under -f77=format-edit-descr about nonstandard
descriptor types (like O), and supported extensions.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>There are some syntactic
extensions and Fortran 90 elements that ftnchek accepts but
does very little checking. For instance, pointer usage
(whether the nonstandard Cray <br>
syntax or the Fortran 90 syntax) is not checked other than
for set and used status. It is hoped that some day more
thorough checking will be implemented, but for now the <br>
user should regard the acceptance of these syntactic
features simply as a convenience to enable checking of other
aspects of code that contains them. See the section <br>
Extensions for specifics about what features are accepted
but not fully checked.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>If a user-supplied subprogram
has the same name as one of the nonstandard intrinsic
functions recognized by ftnchek, it must be declared in an
EXTERNAL statement in any <br>
routine that invokes it. Otherwise it will be subject to the
checking normally given to the intrinsic function. Since the
nonstandard intrinsics are not standard, this <br>
EXTERNAL statement is not required by the Fortran 77
Standard. Using the -intrinsic=none setting, recognition of
most nonstandard intrinsics (excepting only those needed
<br>
to support the double complex data type) can be turned off.
See the lists of supported nonstandard intrinsic functions
under the discussion of the -intrinsic setting <br>
above.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Extensions: <br>
All of these extensions (except lower-case characters) will
generate warnings if the relevant -f77 option is set. Some
of the extensions listed below are part of the For&acirc;
<br>
tran-90 Standard. These are indicated by the notation
(F90).</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Tabs are permitted, and
translated into equivalent blanks which correspond to tab

72 columns provided that the setting -columns was used to

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Variable names may be longer
than six characters. The standard specifies six as the

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Variable names may contain
underscores and dollar signs (or other non-alphabetic
characters as specified by the -identifier-chars option).
These characters are are <br>
treated the same as alphabetic letters. The default type for
variables beginning with these characters is REAL. In
IMPLICIT type statements specifying a range of charac&acirc;
<br>
ters, the dollar sign follows Z and is followed by
underscore. (Any other user-defined characters are treated
the same as the dollar sign.) Fortran 90 permits
under&acirc; <br>
scores in variable names.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The UNIX version tolerates
the presence of preprocessor directives, namely lines
beginning with the pound sign (#). These are treated as

Note that #include directives are not processed by <br>
ftnchek. Programs that use them for including source files
should be passed through the preprocessor before being input
to ftnchek. As noted below, ftnchek does process <br>

POINTER (pointer, pointee) [,(pointer, pointee)] <br>
The pointer variables are assigned a data type of INTEGER
*4. Usage checking of the pointee variables is suppressed,
since in practice they are accessed indirectly via <br>
the pointers.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The following Fortran 90
pointer related syntaxes are accepted: ALLOCATABLE, POINTER,

as dangling pointers, or use of unallocated arrays.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Statements may have any

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Nonstandard keywords are
allowed in I/O statements, corresponding to those in VMS
Fortran.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The IMPLICIT NONE statement
is supported. The meaning of this statement is that all
variables must have their data types explicitly declared.
Rather than flag the occur&acirc; <br>
rences of such variables with syntax error messages, ftnchek
waits till the end of the module, and then prints out a list
of all undeclared variables, as it does for the <br>
-declare option. (F90)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Data types INTEGER, REAL,
COMPLEX, and LOGICAL are allowed to have an optional
precision specification in type declarations. For instance,
REAL*8 means an 8-byte floating <br>
point data type. The REAL*8 datatype is not necessarily
considered equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION, depending on the
-wordsize setting. The Fortran 77 Standard allows a <br>
length specification only for CHARACTER data.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ftnchek supports the DOUBLE
COMPLEX type specification for a complex quantity whose real

arithmetic involving single- <br>
precision complex with double-precision real data,
prohibited under the Standard, yields a double complex
result.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Combined type declarations
and data-statement-like initializers are accepted. These
have the form of a standard Fortran 77 type declaration,
followed by a slash-delimited <br>
list of constants like that used in a DATA statement. An
example of the syntax is <br>
INTEGER N / 100 / <br>
This bastard form of initializing declaration was not
adopted in Fortran 90. Such declarations should be written
using the standard form described below, which is <br>
accepted by ftnchek.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>There is limited support for
Fortran 90 attribute-based type declarations. This style of
declaration is distinguished by the use of a double colon
(::) between the list <br>
of attributes and the list of declared variables. The
features supported may be adequate for novice programmers,
but are not yet sufficient for professional-quality
For&acirc; <br>
tran 90 programs. I hope to add support for more features in
future releases. I invite volunteers to assist in this task.
See the ToDo file in the source code distribu&acirc; <br>
tion for details. The attributes currently accepted, besides
all the usual data types, are DIMENSION, EXTERNAL,
INTRINSIC, PARAMETER, and SAVE. The new form of
declara&acirc; <br>
tion also allows assignment of values to the variables
declared. At present, the (LEN=value) form of specifying
character lengths is also accepted. Kind specifications,

using (KIND=value) are parsed but are not processed: all
kinds are treated as default kind. Also, there is little
checking of these declarations beyond basic syntax.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Many commonly found
nonstandard intrinsic functions are provided. See the
discussion of -intrinsic for a list of functions and how to
control which ones are recognized.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Argument checking is not
tight for those nonstandard intrinsics that take arrays or
mixed argument types.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ftnchek permits the INCLUDE
statement, which causes inclusion of the text of the given
file. The syntax is <br>
INCLUDE &rsquo;filename&rsquo; <br>
This is compatible with Fortran 90. If the

conventions with respect to this statement: it assumes a
default <br>
extension of .for if no filename extension is given, and
allows the qualifier /[NO]LIST following the filename, to
control the listing of the included file. There is no <br>
support for including VMS text modules.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>In diagnostic output relating
to items contained in include files, the location of the
error is specified by both its location in the include file
and the location in the <br>
parent file where the file was included.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ftnchek accepts PARAMETER
statements which lack parentheses. These will be warned
about if the -f77=param-noparen flag is given.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ftnchek accepts PARAMETER
definitions that involve intrinsic functions and

value is a compile-time integer constant, ftnchek will

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>BUGS <br>
ftnchek still has much room for improvement. Your feedback
is appreciated. We want to know about any bugs you notice.
Bugs include not only cases in which ftnchek issues an <br>
error message where no error exists, but also if ftnchek
fails to issue a warning when it ought to. Note, however,
that ftnchek is not intended to catch all syntax errors (see
<br>
section on Limitations). Also, it is not considered a bug
for a variable to be reported as used before set, if the
reason is that the usage of the variable occurs prior in the
<br>
text to where the variable is set. For instance, this could
occur when a GOTO causes execution to loop backward to some
previously skipped statements. ftnchek does not analyze <br>
the program flow, but assumes that statements occurring
earlier in the text are executed before the following
ones.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>We especially want to know if
ftnchek crashes for any reason. It is not supposed to crash,
even on programs with syntax errors. Suggestions are
welcomed for additional features <br>
which you would find useful. Tell us if any of
ftnchek&rsquo;s messages are incomprehensible. Comments on
the readability and accuracy of this document are also
welcome.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>You may also suggest support
for additional extensions to the Fortran language. These
will be included only if it is felt that the extensions are
sufficiently widely accepted by <br>
compilers.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>If you find a bug in ftnchek,
first consult the list of known bugs below to see if it has
already been reported. Also check the section entitled
&lsquo;&lsquo;Limitations and Extensions&rsquo;&rsquo; <br>
above for restrictions that could be causing the problem. If
you do not find the problem documented in either place, then
send a report including</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>1. The operating system and
CPU type on which ftnchek is running.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>2. The version of ftnchek and
values of any environment options or settings defined in
startup file. (Capturing the output of ftnchek -help is
useful for this.)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>3. A brief description of the
bug.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>4. If possible, a small
sample program showing the bug.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The report should be sent to
Dr. Robert Moniot (see contact information in section
entitled &lsquo;&lsquo;Installation and
Support&rsquo;&rsquo;).</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Highest priority will be
given to bugs which cause ftnchek to crash.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Certain problems that arise
when checking large programs can be fixed by increasing the
sizes of the data areas in ftnchek. (These problems are
generally signaled by error mes&acirc; <br>
sages beginning with &lsquo;&lsquo;Oops&rsquo;&rsquo;.) The
simplest way to increase the table sizes is by recompiling
ftnchek with the LARGE_MACHINE macro name defined. Consult
the makefile and <br>
README file for the method of doing this.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The following is a list of
known bugs.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>1. Bug: Used-before-set
message is suppressed for any variable which is used as the
loop index in an implied-do loop, even if it was in fact
used before being set in some ear&acirc; <br>
lier statement. For example, consider J in the
statement</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>WRITE(5,*) (A(J),
J=1,10)</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Here ftnchek parses the I/O
expression, A(J), where J is used, before it parses the
implied loop where J is set. Normally this would cause
ftnchek to report a spurious used- <br>
before-set warning for J. Since this report is usually in
error and occurs fairly commonly, ftnchek suppresses the
warning for J altogether.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Prognosis: A future version
of ftnchek is planned which will handle implied-do loops
correctly.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>2. Bug: Variables used (not
as arguments) in statement-function subprograms do not have
their usage status updated when the statement function is
invoked.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Prognosis: To be fixed in a
future version of ftnchek.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>3. Bug: VAX version does not
expand wildcards in filenames on the command line if they
are followed without space by an option, e.g. ftnchek
*.f/calltree would not expand the <br>
*.f. This is because VMS-style options without intervening
space are not supported by the GNU shell_mung routine that
is used to expand wildcards.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Prognosis: unlikely to be
fixed.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>4. Bug: checking for
nonstandard format edit descriptors is done only in FORMAT
statements, not in character strings used as
formats.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Prognosis: may be fixed
someday.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br>
ftnchek was designed by Dr. Robert Moniot, professor at
Fordham University. During the academic year of 1988-1989,
Michael Myers and Lucia Spagnuolo developed the program to
<br>
perform the variable usage checks. During the following year
it was augmented by Lois Bigbie to check subprogram
arguments and COMMON block declarations. Brian Downing
assisted <br>
with the implementation of the INCLUDE statement. John Quinn
wrote the common block usage checks. Heba Elsayed wrote the
label table printout and label usage checks. Nelson H. <br>
F. Beebe of the University of Utah added most of the new
code to implement the -makedcls feature and wrote the
dcl2inc script. The -mkhtml feature was contributed by Mark
<br>
McVeigh of Framatome ANP, Inc. The -reference feature was
contributed by Gerome Emmanuel, Ecole des mines, U. Nancy
(slightly modified). The -vcg option was contributed by Dr.
<br>
Philip Rubini of Cranfield University, UK. The support for
Cray pointer syntax was provided by John Dannenhoffer of
United Technologies Research Center. John C. Bollinger of
<br>
Indiana University added the parser syntax for the SELECT
CASE construct. Robert Landrito added the parser syntax for
F90 pointer-related features. Additional features will be
<br>
added as time permits. As of Version 2.5, the name was
changed from forchek to ftnchek, to avoid confusion with a
similar program named forcheck, developed earlier at Leiden
<br>
University.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>INSTALLATION AND SUPPORT <br>
The ftnchek program is free software. It can be obtained by
anonymous ftp from many software servers, including
ftp://netlib.org/fortran . Note that on Netlib the
distribution <br>
is named ftnchek.tar.gz whereas on most other servers the
file name includes the version number, e.g.
ftnchek-3.3.0.tar.gz. If the file extension is .Z,
uncompress with the Unix <br>
uncompress(1) utility. If the file extension is .gz,
uncompress with the GNU gunzip(1L) program. Then use tar(1)
to unpack the files into a subdirectory.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Installation requires a C
compiler for your computer. See the INSTALL file provided
with the distribution for instructions on installing ftnchek
on your system. Executable <br>
binary for particular systems such as IBM PC or Macintosh,
as available, can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu/pub/ftnchek . Assistance in
preparing <br>
such executable binary forms is welcome.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>The nroff version of this
document is named ftnchek.man. On UNIX systems, this file
can be used as the man page, but actually it is a
multi-purpose source file which is used to <br>
produce the other forms of the documentation. The cleaned-up
man page document, created during installation of ftnchek,
is named ftnchek.1. The distribution also includes a <br>
plain ASCII version named ftnchek.doc, a PostScript version
named ftnchek.ps, an HTML version in directory html, and a
VMS HELP version named ftnchek.hlp.</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Information about the latest
version and the status of the project can be obtained by
visiting ftnchek&rsquo;s home page,

information <br>
and to report bugs, you may contact Dr. Robert Moniot, whose
contact information can be found by a Web search for his
