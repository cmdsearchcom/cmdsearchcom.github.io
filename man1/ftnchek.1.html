<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>ftnchek</b> (short for Fortran checker) is designed to detect certain errors
  in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not. <b>ftnchek</b> is not
  primarily intended to detect syntax errors. Its purpose is to assist the user
  in finding semantic errors. Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran language
  but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For example, variables
  which are never used may indicate some omission in the program; uninitialized
  variables contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be calculated;
  and variables which are not declared may not have the intended type.
  <b>ftnchek</b> is intended to assist users in the debugging of their Fortran
  program. It is not intended to catch all syntax errors. This is the function
  of the compiler. Prior to using <b>ftnchek</b>, the user should verify that
  the program compiles correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This document first summarizes how to invoke <b>ftnchek</b>. That section should
  be read before beginning to use <b>ftnchek</b>. Later sections describe
  <b>ftnchek</b>'s options in more detail, give an example of its use, and
  explain how to interpret the output. The final sections mention the
  limitations and known bugs in <b>ftnchek</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INVOKING_FTNCHEK"><a class="selflink" href="#INVOKING_FTNCHEK">INVOKING
  FTNCHEK</a></h1>
<b>ftnchek</b> is invoked through a command of the form:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
$ ftnchek [-option -option ...] filename [filename ...]
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The brackets indicate something which is optional. The brackets themselves are
  not actually typed. Here options are command-line switches or settings, which
  control the operation of the program and the amount of information that will
  be printed out. If no option is specified, the default action is to print
  error messages, warnings, and informational messages, but not the program
  listing or symbol tables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each option begins with the '-' character. (On VAX/VMS or MS-DOS systems you may
  use either '/' or '-'.) For the sake of conformity with an increasingly common
  convention, options can also begin with '--'. The options are described at
  greater length in the next section.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ftnchek</b> options fall into two categories: switches, which are either true
  or false, and settings, which have a numeric or string value. The name of a
  switch is prefixed by 'no' or 'no-' to turn it off: e.g. <b>-nopure</b> would
  turn off the warnings about impure functions. The 'no' prefix can also be used
  with numeric settings, having the effect of turning off the corresponding
  warnings. Settings that control lists of warnings have a special syntax
  discussed below. Only the first 3 characters of an option name (not counting
  the '-') need be provided. A colon may be used in place of an equals sign for
  numeric or string setting assignments; however, we show only the equals sign
  form below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The switches and settings which <b>ftnchek</b> currently recognizes are listed
  below. For each option, the default is the value used if the option is not
  explicitly specified, while the turn-on is the value used if the option is
  given without assigning it a value.

<div class="Pp"></div>
When more than one option is used, they should be separated by a blank space,
  except on systems such as VMS where options begin with slash ( / ). No blank
  spaces may be placed around the equals sign ( = ) in a setting. ftnchek
  &quot;?&quot; will produce a command summary listing all options and settings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For settings that take a list of keywords, namely <b>-arguments</b>,
  <b>-array</b>, <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-common</b>, <b>-crossref</b>,
  <b>-f77</b>, <b>-f90</b>, <b>-f95</b>, <b>-intrinsic</b>, <b>-makedcls</b>,
  <b>-mkhtml</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-pretty</b>, <b>-project</b>,
  <b>-source</b>, <b>-style</b>, <b>-truncation</b>, and <b>-usage</b>, the list
  consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. If the list of keywords is
  omitted, the effect is to set the option to its turn-on value (same as ``all''
  in most cases). Also, if the list is omitted, the setting name can be prefixed
  with <b>no</b> or <b>no-</b> to turn off all the options it controls. For
  example, <b>-f77</b> turns on all warnings about nonstandard constructions,
  while <b>-nof77</b> turns them all off. Three special keywords are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>help</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Print out all the option keywords controlled by the
      setting, with a brief explanation of their meanings. This keyword cannot
      be given in a list with other keywords.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>all</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Set all options. This turns on all options controlled by
      the setting.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>none</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Clear all options. This turns off all options controlled by
      the setting.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
These three special keywords must be given in full. For all other keywords, only
  as many letters of the keyword as are necessary to identify it unambiguously
  need be given, or a wildcard pattern may be used. Including a keyword in the
  list turns the corresponding option on. For example, <b>-f77=intrinsic</b>
  would turn on only the warnings about use of nonstandard intrinsic functions.
  Prefixing a keyword by <b>no-</b> turns its option off. For example,
  <b>-pretty=no-long-line</b> turns off warnings about lines exceeding 72
  columns in length while leaving all other warnings about misleading appearance
  in effect. If a setting has default <b>none</b>, you can turn on all options
  except one or two by using <b>all</b> first. For example,
  <b>-f77=all,no-include</b> enables warnings about all nonstandard extensions
  except INCLUDE statements. If a setting has default <b>all</b>, you can turn
  off all warnings except one or two by using <b>none</b> first. For example,
  <b>-truncation=none,demotion</b> would turn off all precision related warnings
  except about demotions. Wildcard patterns contain an asterisk to stand for any
  string of characters. If a wildcard pattern is used, all the warnings that
  match it are affected. If <b>no-</b> is prefixed to the pattern, all the
  matching warnings are turned off, otherwise they are all turned on. The
  minimum unambiguous length rule does not apply to wildcard matching. For
  example, use <b>-usage=no-*var*</b> to turn off all warnings relating to
  variable usage (both local and common). (Unix users may need to quote any
  options containing wildcards in order to prevent the shell from attempting to
  expand them.) Wildcards are recognized only in lists of warning keywords, not
  in the top-level options themselves.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>ftnchek</b> starts up, it looks for environment variables and also for a
  preferences file. Any options defined in the environment or in the preferences
  file are used as defaults in place of the built-in defaults. They are
  over-ridden by any command line options. See the section on changing the
  defaults for details about the environment options and the preferences file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When giving a name of an input file, the extension is optional. If no extension
  is given, <b>ftnchek</b> will first look for a project file with extension
  <i>.prj</i>, and will use that if it exists. If not, then <b>ftnchek</b> will
  look for a Fortran source file with the extension <i>.for</i> for VMS systems,
  <i>.f</i> for UNIX systems. More than one file name can be given to
  <b>ftnchek</b>, and it will process the modules in all files as if they were
  in a single file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Wildcards are allowed in the specification of filenames on the command line for
  the VMS and MS-DOS versions, as also of course under UNIX and any other system
  that performs wildcard expansion in the command processor.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If no filename is given, <b>ftnchek</b> will read input from the standard input.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
This section provides a more detailed discussion of <b>ftnchek</b> command-line
  options. Options and filenames may be interspersed on a command line. Most
  options are positional: each option remains in effect from the point it is
  encountered until it is overridden by a later change. Thus for example, the
  listing may be suppressed for some files and not for others. Exceptions are:
  the <b>-intrinsic</b>, <b>-pointersize</b>, and <b>-wordsize</b> settings,
  which cannot be changed once processing of input files has started; the
  <b>-arguments</b>, <b>-array</b>, <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-common</b>,
  <b>-crossref</b>, <b>-extern</b>, <b>-reference</b>, <b>-resources</b>,
  <b>-sort</b>, <b>-vcg</b>, and <b>-volatile</b> options, where the action
  depends only on the value of the option after the processing of input files is
  finished; and the <b>-include</b> setting, which is cumulative.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The option names in the following list are in alphabetical order.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-arguments=</b><i>list</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Controls warnings about mismatches between
  actual and dummy subprogram arguments, and also about mismatches between
  expected and actual subprogram type. (An actual argument is an argument passed
  to the subprogram by the caller; a dummy argument is an argument received by
  the subprogram.) By default, all warnings are turned on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>list</i> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. Since all
  these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b> to
  turn off a particular warning. There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to
  turn on all the warnings about arguments, <b>none</b> to turn them all off,
  and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation
  of each. If <i>list</i> is omitted, <b>-arguments</b> is equivalent to
  <b>-arguments=all</b>, and <b>-noarguments</b> is equivalent to
  <b>-arguments=none</b>. The warning keywords with their meanings are as
  follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>arrayness</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">warn about inconsistent use of arguments that are arrays.
      These warnings can be further controlled by the <b>-array</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>type</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">warn about dummy arguments of a different data type from
      the actual arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>function-type</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">warn if the invocation assumes the function's return value
      is a different type than it actually is. Also warns if a function is
      called as a subroutine, or vice-versa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>number</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">warn about invoking a subprogram with a different number of
      arguments than the subprogram expects.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>, a numeric form of
  this setting is also accepted: the <i>list</i> is replaced by a number from 0
  to 3. A value of 0 turns all the warnings off, 1 turns on only <b>number</b>,
  2 turns on all except <b>number</b>, and 3 turns all the warnings on.
<div class="Pp"></div>

  statement functions, which can only be turned off by the <b>-nocheck</b>
  option.

  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Controls the degree of strictness in checking
  agreement between actual and dummy subprogram arguments that are arrays. The
  warnings controlled by this setting are for constructions that might
  legitimately be used by a knowledgeable programmer, but that often indicate
  programming errors. By default, all warnings are turned on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>list</i> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. Since all
  these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b> to
  turn off a particular warning. There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to
  turn on all the warnings about array arguments, <b>none</b> to turn them all
  off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
  explanation of each. If <i>list</i> is omitted, <b>-array</b> is equivalent to
  <b>-array=all</b>, and <b>-noarray</b> is equivalent to <b>-array=none</b>.
  The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>dimensions</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">warn if the arguments differ in their number of dimensions,
      or if the actual argument is an array element while the dummy argument is
      a whole array.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>size</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">warn if both arguments are arrays, but they differ in
      number of elements.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>, a numeric form of
  this setting is also accepted: the <i>list</i> is replaced by a number from 0
  to 3. A value of 0 turns all the warnings off, 1 turns on only
  <b>dimensions</b>, 2 turns on only <b>size</b>, and 3 turns all the warnings
  on.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: A warning is always given regardless of this setting if the actual
  argument is an array while the dummy argument is a scalar variable, or if the
  actual argument is a scalar variable or expression while the dummy argument is
  an array. These cases are seldom intentional. (To turn off even these
  warnings, use <b>-arguments=no-arrayness</b>.) No warning is ever given if the
  actual argument is an array element while the dummy argument is a scalar
  variable. Variable-dimensioned arrays and arrays dimensioned with 1 or
  asterisk match any number of array elements. There is no check of whether
  multi-dimensional arrays agree in the size of each dimension separately.

  about variables that are set but not used or used before set, variable names
  that do not conform to the Fortran 77 standard, etc. (These warnings may be
  suppressed entirely depending on other flags, such as the <b>-usage</b> or
  <b>-f77</b> flags.) In the default format each variable is listed on a
  separate line, along with the line number where the variable is declared, set
  or used, according to the nature of the warning. The briefer format simply
  lists all variables to which the warning applies, with up to 4 variables per
  line.

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Causes <b>ftnchek</b> to print out the call
  structure of the complete program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>list</i> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. There are
  two special keywords: <b>none</b> to turn off all the options, and <b>help</b>
  to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each. (The
  keyword <b>all</b> turns on all the options, but should not normally be used
  since only one format should be specified.) If <i>list</i> is omitted,
  <b>-calltree</b> is equivalent to <b>-calltree=tree</b>, and
  <b>-nocalltree</b> is equivalent to <b>-calltree=none</b>. By default no call
  graph is printed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the -mkhtml option is invoked <i>and</i> tree is the applied calltree option,
  a file named CallTree.html, will also be produced depicting the tree in HTML
  format. This file is useful as a starting point for browsing the HTML files
  describing each component of the program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The keywords which control which format is used are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>tree</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">produce the call graph in tree format.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>reference</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">produce the call graph in who-calls-who format (same as
      <b>-reference</b> switch).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>vcg</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">produce the call graph in VCG format (same as <b>-vcg</b>
      switch).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Only one of the formats <b>tree</b>, <b>reference</b>, or <b>vcg</b> may be
  specified.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following keywords control options affecting the output:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>prune</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">prune repeated subtrees (applicable only with <b>tree</b>).
      This the default.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>sort</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">sort children of each routine into alphabetical order. This
      is the default.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
See the discussion of the <b>-reference</b> and <b>-vcg</b> flags for details
  about these formats.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For <b>tree</b> format, The call graph is printed out starting from the main
  program, which is listed on the first line at the left margin. Then on the
  following lines, each routine called by the main program is listed, indented a
  few spaces, followed by the subtree starting at that routine.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the default mode, if a routine is called by more than one other routine, its
  call subtree is printed only the first time it is encountered Later calls give
  only the routine name and the notice ``(see above)''. To have the subtree
  printed for each occurrence of the routine, use option <b>no-prune</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the call tree will be incomplete if any of the input files are project
  files containing more than one module that were created in <b>-library</b>
  mode. See the discussion of project files below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Technical points: Each list of routines called by a given routine is printed in
  alphabetical order unless the <b>no-sort</b> option is given. If multiple main
  programs are found, the call tree of each is printed separately. If no main
  program is found, a report to that effect is printed out, and the call trees
  of any top-level non-library routines are printed. This flag only controls the
  printing of the call tree: <b>ftnchek</b> constructs the call tree in any case
  because it is used to determine which library modules will be cross-checked.
  See the discussion of the <b>-library</b> flag.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>, a numeric form of
  this setting is also accepted: the <i>list</i> is replaced by a number from 0
  to 15. This number is formed from 1 for <b>tree</b> format, 2 for
  <b>reference</b> format, or 3 for <b>vcg</b> format, plus 4 for
  <b>no-prune</b>, and 8 for <b>no-sort</b>.

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch is provided so that errors and
  warning messages can be turned off when <b>ftnchek</b> is used for purposes
  other than finding bugs, such as making declarations or printing the call
  tree. It is positional, so after turning all checks off, selected checks can
  be turned back on. The effect of <b>-nocheck</b> is to put all switches,
  numeric settings, and settings controlling lists of warnings to their turn-off
  values, as if they had all been specified with the -no prefix. Switches and
  settings that specify options and modes of operation, rather than controlling
  warnings, are unaffected. These are <b>-columns</b>, <b>-crossref</b>,

Parse errors (syntax errors due to unrecognized or malformed statements) are not
  suppressed by this switch, since the results may be incorrect if
  <b>ftnchek</b> has not parsed the program correctly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some miscellaneous errors and warning messages that are not controlled
  by any other switch, and so can be turned off only by this switch. Note that
  using <b>-check</b> following <b>-nocheck</b> only has the effect of turning
  these special warnings back on, and does not restore all the checks it turned
  off. These warnings are:

<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>list</i> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. Since most
  of these warnings are on by default, include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b>
  to turn off a particular warning. There are three special keywords: <b>all</b>
  to turn on all the warnings, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b>
  to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each. If
  <i>list</i> is omitted, <b>-common</b> is equivalent to
  <b>-common=dimensions,exact,length,type</b>, and <b>-nocommon</b> is
  equivalent to <b>-common=none</b>. The warning keywords with their meanings
  are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>dimensions</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">corresponding arrays in each declaration of a block must
      agree in size and number of dimensions. This option only has an effect

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>volatile</b>:</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Assume that COMMON blocks are volatile.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many Fortran programmers assume that variables, whether local or in COMMON, are
  static, i.e. that once assigned a value, they retain that value permanently
  until assigned a different value by the program. However, in fact the Fortran
  77 Standard does not require this to be the case. Local variables may become
  undefined between activations of a module in which they are declared.
  Similarly, COMMON blocks may become undefined if no module in which they are
  declared is active. (The technical term for entities with this behavior is
  ``automatic'', but <b>ftnchek</b> uses the word ``volatile'' since it is
  clearer to the nonspecialist.) Only COMMON blocks declared in a SAVE
  statement, or declared in the main program or in a block data subprogram
  remain defined as long as the program is running. Variables and COMMON blocks
  that can become undefined at some point are called volatile.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>-common=volatile</b> flag is turned on, <b>ftnchek</b> will warn you
  if it finds a volatile COMMON block. If, at the same time, the
  <b>-usage=com-block-volatile </b> option is turned on (which is the default),
  <b>ftnchek</b> will try to check whether such a block can lose its defined
  status between activations of the modules where it is declared. <b>ftnchek</b>
  does not do a very good job of this: the rule used is to see whether the block
  is declared in two separated subtrees of the call tree. For instance, this
  would be the case if two modules, both called from the main program, shared a
  volatile COMMON block. A block can also become undefined between two
  successive calls of the same subprogram, but <b>ftnchek</b> is not smart
  enough to tell whether a subprogram can be called more than once, so this case
  is not checked for.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-common=volatile</b> flag does not affect the way <b>ftnchek</b> checks
  the usage of local variables.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>, a numeric form of
  this setting is also accepted: the <i>list</i> is replaced by a number from 0
  to 3. A value of 0 turns all the warnings off, 1 or greater turns on
  <b>type</b>, 2 or greater turns on <b>length</b>, and 3 turns on
  <b>dimensions</b> and <b>exact</b> also. The numeric form cannot turn on the
  <b>volatile</b> option.

  block declarations, and so forth, sometimes a single case will generate a long
  string of warnings. Often this simply indicates some other cause than a
  genuine item-by-item mismatch, such as for example a varible missing from one
  list. So in such cases <b>ftnchek</b> stops printing the warnings after the
  cascade limit is reached, and the trailer ``etc...'' is printed to indicate
  that there were more errors not printed. If you think that these warnings are
  likely to be genuine, use this setting to see more of them. Turn-on = default
  = 3, max = 999. A value of 0 means no limit.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This setting does not set an overall limit on the number of error messages
  printed, only the number printed in any one cascade. Most types of warnings
  and error messages are not subject to the cascade effect and so are not

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This setting provides detailed control over
  the warnings about supported extensions to the Fortran 77 Standard that were
  not adopted as part of the Fortran 90 Standard. Note that <b>ftnchek</b> does
  not support the full Fortran 90 language. However, it does support some common
  extensions to Fortran 77 that were prevalent before Fortran 90 was defined.
  Some of these extensions became part of the Fortran 90 Standard, but others
  did not. The <b>-f90</b> setting warns only about the latter. That is, this
  flag covers things that are neither legal Fortran 77 nor legal Fortran 90.
  Therefore, the warnings controlled by this flag are basically a subset of the
  warnings controlled by <b>-f77</b>. There are a few cases, described below,
  where the circumstances in which the warning is given are slightly different
  for the two flags.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>list</i> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. There are
  three special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the warnings about
  nonstandard extensions, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to
  print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each. If
  <i>list</i> is omitted, <b>-f90</b> is equivalent to <b>-f90=all</b>, and

There is one other Fortran 77 syntax feature that was deleted in Fortran 95,

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Define non-alphanumeric characters that may be
  used in identifiers. By default, <b>ftnchek</b> only accepts the dollar sign
  and underscore as non-alphanumeric characters in identifier names. The
  characters in the <i>list</i> replace whatever set of accepted
  non-alphanumeric characters was previously in effect. Thus, if dollar sign or
  underscore are not included in the list, they lose their status as acceptable
  characters.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This option is provided to enable <b>ftnchek</b> to handle source files
  containing non-standard identifer names that may be needed, for example, to
  access certain operating system services. See the section on Limitations and
  Extensions for the treatment of identifiers containing these characters in
  implicit typing.

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Controls whether <b>ftnchek</b> recognizes
  certain nonstandard intrinsic functions as intrinsic. The <i>list</i> consists
  of keywords separated by commas or colons. Some of the keywords control

  turn off that recognition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> turns on recognition of all the
  nonstandard intrinsics (listed below) and accepts either syntax for those that
  have variations. Use <b>none</b> to turn off recognition of all nonstandard
  intrinsics except those noted below. Use <b>help</b> to print the list of all

<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>no-argument</b> and <b>one-argument</b> keywords work as follows: turning
  the option on causes <b>ftnchek</b> to accept the corresponding syntax for
  invocation of the function, without excluding the possibility of the
  alternative syntax. Turning the option off causes the corresponding syntax not
  to be accepted. If both options are turned on at once (the default), then
  either syntax is accepted. Turning both options off at once would not be
  meaningful. These options have no effect if recognition of Unix intrinsics has
  been turned off.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that this setting does not control whether non-standard warnings are issued
  about these functions. It controls whether the functions are assumed to be
  intrinsic or not, which determines how their usage is checked. When functions
  in any of these sets are included, their invocations will be checked according
  to the rules for the intrinsic functions; otherwise they will be checked as
  normal (user-written) external functions. The non-standard warnings are
  controlled by the <b>-f77=intrinsic</b> option.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default value of this setting is equivalent to <b>-intrinsic=all</b>
  followed by <b>-intrinsic=no-vms</b> for the Unix version,
  <b>-intrinsic=no-unix</b> for the VMS version, and
  <b>-intrinsic=no-unix,no-vms</b> for other versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note: In versions of <b>ftnchek</b> prior to 2.10, the <b>-intrinsic</b> flag
  took a numeric argument instead of a list of options. For the sake of users
  who may have written scripts invoking <b>ftnchek</b> in this way, the numeric
  form is still accepted. The numeric form of the setting consists of three
  digits. The ones digit selects the set of intrinsic functions to be supported.
  The digit 0 selects only Fortran 77 standard intrinsics plus those needed to
  support the nonstandard extended precision data types. The digit 1 is
  equivalent to <b>extra</b>, 2 is equivalent to <b>extra,unix</b>, and 3 is
  equivalent to <b>extra,vms</b>. The tens digit of this setting controls the
  syntax of the RAND intrinsic function, and the hundreds digit controls the
  syntax of the IARGC function. For these digits, specify 0 to require
  invocation with no argument, 1 to require one argument, and 2 to allow either
  form.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-library</b></dt>

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">This switch is used when a number of
  subprograms are contained in a file, but not all of them are used by the
  application. Normally, <b>ftnchek</b> warns you if any subprograms are defined
  but never used. This switch will suppress these warnings. Default = no.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This switch also controls which subprogram calls and COMMON block declarations
  are checked. If a file is read with the <b>-library</b> flag in effect, the
  subprogram calls and COMMON declarations contained in a routine in that file
  will be checked only if that routine is in the main program's call tree. On
  the other hand, if the <b>-library</b> switch is turned off, then
  <b>ftnchek</b> checks the calls of every routine by every other routine,
  regardless of whether those routines could ever actually be invoked at run
  time, and likewise all COMMON block declarations are compared for agreement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The difference between this switch and the <b>-usage=no-ext-unused</b> option
  for subprograms is that the latter suppresses only the warning about routines
  being declared but not used. The <b>-library</b> switch goes further and
  excludes unused routines processed while it is in effect from all
  cross-checking of arguments and COMMON block declarations as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(If there is no main program anywhere in the set of files that <b>ftnchek</b>
  has read, so that there is no call tree, then <b>ftnchek</b> will look for any
  non-library routines that are not called by any other routine, and use these
  as substitutes for the main program in constructing the call tree and deciding
  what to check. If no such top-level non-library routines are found, then all
  inter-module calls and all COMMON declarations will be checked.)

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Prepare a neatly-formatted file of
  declarations of variables, common blocks, and namelist lists, for possible
  merging into the source code. The declarations are stored in a file of the
  same name as the source code, but with the extension changed to <i>.dcl</i>.
  If no declarations are written to the file, it is deleted to reduce clutter
  from empty files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If input comes from standard input, instead of a named file, then declarations
  are written to standard output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Variables are declared in alphabetical order within each declaration class and
  type, with integer variables first, because of their later possible use in
  array dimensions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
PARAMETER statements are an exception to the alphabetical order rule, because
  the Fortran 77 Standard requires that the expressions defining parameter
  values refer only to constants and already-defined parameter names. This
  forces the original source file order of such statements to be preserved in
  the declaration files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Explicit declaration of <i>all</i> variables is considered good modern
  programming practice. By using compiler options to reject undeclared
  variables, misspelled variable names (or names extending past column 72) can
  be caught at compile time. Explicit declarations also greatly facilitate
  changing floating-point precision with filters such as <b>dtoq</b>(1L),
  <b>dtos</b>(1L), <b>fd2s</b>(1L), <b>fs2d</b>(1L), <b>qtod</b>(1L), and
  <b>stod</b>(1L). These programs are capable of changing types of explicit
  floating-point type declarations, intrinsic functions, and constants, but
  because they do not carry out rigorous lexical and grammatical analysis of the
  Fortran source code, they cannot provide modified type declarations for
  undeclared variables. Default setting = 0, turn-on = 1.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Various options for the form of the declarations file are controlled by the
  <i>list</i>, which consists of keywords separated by commas or colons. There
  are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the options, <b>none</b>
  to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords
  with a brief explanation of each. If <i>list</i> is omitted, <b>-makedcls</b>
  is equivalent to <b>-makedcls=declarations</b> (i.e. produce the declarations
  file using the default options), and <b>-nomakedcls</b> is equivalent to
  <b>-makedcls=none</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>, a numeric form of
  this setting is also accepted: the <i>list</i> is replaced by a number which
  is the sum of the numbers in parentheses beside the keywords in the following
  list. The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>declarations</b> (1):</dt>

  <dd class="It-tag">By default, all variables are included in the declaration

      setting is useful if you want to check for undeclared variables, since
      Fortran source files with all variables properly declared will not result
      in a <i>.dcl</i> file. With this option, common blocks and namelist lists

      <i>N2dddd</i>, and <i>N3dddd</i>, where <i>d</i> is a decimal digit.
      Because they are invisible in the SFTRAN3 source code, and will change if
      the SFTRAN3 code is modified, such variables should not be explicitly

      the array variables in the type statements of the declaration file is
      redundant. This option should be used only in conjunction with option 2 =

  Creates individual HTML files from ftnchek analysis and code comments. All

<div class="Pp"></div>
Various options for the form of the HTML files are controlled by the

<div class="Pp"></div>
A project file contains a summary of information from the source file, for use
  in checking agreement among FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, and COMMON usages in other
  files. It allows incremental checking, which saves time whenever you have a
  large set of files containing shared subroutines, most of which seldom change.
  You can run <b>ftnchek</b> once on each file with the <b>-project</b> flag
  set, creating the project files. Usually you would also set the
  <b>-library</b> and <b>-noextern</b> flags at this time, to suppress messages
  relating to consistency with other files. Only error messages pertaining to
  each file by itself will be printed at this time. Thereafter, run
  <b>ftnchek</b> without these flags on all the project files together, to check
  consistency among the different files. All messages internal to the individual
  files will now be omitted. Only when a file is altered will a new project file
  need to be made for it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Naturally, when the <b>-project</b> option is turned on, <b>ftnchek</b> will not
  read project files as input.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ordinarily, the trim options should be left on when you intend to create project
  files for future input to <b>ftnchek</b>. Since trimming is on by default,
  this means that simply giving the command <b>-project</b> with no option list
  is the recommended mode. The trim options are provided only as a convenience
  for those who want to make use of project files for purposes other than
  checking the program with <b>ftnchek</b>. To use project files for their
  intended purpose, the trim options should not be turned off.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Project files contain only information needed for checking agreement between
  files. This means that a project file is of no use if all modules of the
  complete program are contained in a single file.

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Assume functions are ``pure'', i.e., they will
  not have side effects by modifying their arguments or variables in a COMMON
  block. When this flag is in effect, <b>ftnchek</b> will base its determination

  if a function is found to modify any of its arguments or any COMMON variables.
  Default = yes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When this flag is turned off, actual arguments passed to functions will be
  handled the same way as actual arguments passed to subroutines. This means
  that <b>ftnchek</b> will assume that arguments may be modified by the

In this listing, the term ``chunk size'' is the size of the blocks of memory

  <dd class="It-tag">A module is any external subprogram, including the main

      common variable names. Actual argument text (up to 15 characters for each
      argument) is also included here. The space used for local names is not

      can be a variable name, a numerical constant, a quoted text string, or a

      processed. For technical reasons, single-character tokens are not included
      in this total. Items that are not represented in the symbol table may be

  <dd class="It-tag">A token list is a sequence of tokens representing the
      actual or dummy argument list of a subprogram, or the list of variables in
      a common block or namelist. Therefore this number represents the largest
      sum of COMMON, CALL, NAMELIST and ENTRY statements and function
      invocations for any one module. The space is recovered at the end of each
      module.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Max token list/tree space:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is the largest number of tokens in all the token lists
      and token trees of any one module. A token tree is formed when analyzing
      an expression: each operand is a leaf of the tree, and the operators are
      the nodes. Therefore this number is a measure of the maximum complexity of
      an individual module. For instance a module with many long arithmetic
      expressions will have a high number. Note that unlike token text described
      above, the number of tokens is independent of the length of the variable

<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">One of the goals of the <b>ftnchek</b> program
  is to help users to write portable Fortran programs. One potential source of
  nonportability is the use of variable names that are longer than six

      using the standard mechanism of doubling the delimiter; (b) the backslash
      is used to escape the end-of-line in order to continue a string across

      PARAMETER statements of the standard form which has parentheses. A

      Sometimes <b>ftnchek</b> makes a mistake in the warnings about local
      variable usage. Usually it errs on the side of giving a warning where no
      problem exists, but in rare cases it may fail to warn where the problem
      does exist. See the section on Bugs for examples. If variables are
      equivalenced, the rule used by <b>ftnchek</b> is that a reference to any
      variable implies the same reference to all variables it is equivalenced
      to. For arrays, the rule is that a reference to any array element is

Note: In versions of <b>ftnchek</b> prior to 2.10, the <b>-usage</b> flag took a

  have written scripts invoking <b>ftnchek</b> in this way, the numeric form is
  still accepted. The numeric setting is composed of three digits. The first
  digit (hundreds place) controls warnings about subprograms (functions and
  subroutines), the second digit (tens place) warnings about common blocks and
  common variables,, and the third digit (ones place) warnings about local
  variables. Each digit controls warnings according to the convention that a 1
  means warn about undefined items and variables that are used before set, a 2
  means warn about items that are unused, and a 3 means warn about both types.
  These numbers are now converted to the appropriate values for the above-listed
  keywords, except for <b>com-block-volatile</b>, which is not affected by the

</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">Specifies the default word size to be
  <i>num</i> bytes. This is the size of logical and single-precision numeric
  variables that are not given explicit precisions. (Explicit precisions for
  non-character variables are an extension to the Fortran 77 Standard, and are
  given by type declarations such as REAL*8 X.) Double-precision and complex
  variables will be twice this value, and double complex variables four times.
  Quad-precision constants and intrinsic function results will be four times
  this value. Note that variables declared as REAL*16 will be regarded as quad
  precision only if the word size is 4 bytes. Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The word size value does not matter for checking standard-conforming programs
  that do not declare explicit precisions for non-character variables or store
  Hollerith data in variables. This setting also does not affect the default
  size of character variables, which is always 1 byte. Hollerith constants also
  are assumed to occupy 1 byte per character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The word size is used to determine whether truncation occurs in assignment
  statements, and to catch precision mismatches in subprogram argument lists and
  common block lists. The exact warnings that are issued will depend on the
  status of other flags. Under both the <b>-portability=mixed-size</b> and the
  <b>-nowordsize</b> flag, any mixing of explicit with default precision objects
  (character expressions not included) is warned about. This applies to
  arithmetic expressions containing both types of objects, and to subprogram
  arguments and COMMON variables. Under control of the
  <b>-truncation=demotion</b> and <b>promotion</b> options, a warning is given
  for assignment of an expression to a shorter variable of the same type, or for
  promotion of a lower precision value to higher precision in an arithmetic
  expression or an assignment statement.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Giving a word size of 0, or equivalently, using <b>-nowordsize</b> means that no
  default value will be assumed. This is equivalent to specifying
  <b>-portability=mixed-size</b>. Use it to find cases of mixing default and
  explicit precision, for example to flag places where REAL*8 is treated as
  equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION.

  THE DEFAULTS</a></h1>
<b>ftnchek</b> includes two mechanisms for changing the default values of all
  options: by defining environment variables or by creating a preferences file.
  When <b>ftnchek</b> starts up, it looks in its environment for any variables
  whose names are composed by prefixing the string FTNCHEK_ onto the uppercased
  version of the option name. If such a variable is found, its value is used to
  specify the default for the corresponding switch or setting. In the case of
  settings (for example, the <b>-common</b> strictness setting) the value of the
  environment variable is read as the default setting value. In the case of
  switches, the default switch will be taken as true or yes unless the
  environment variable has the value 0 or NO.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the environment variable name must be constructed with the full-length
  option name, which must be in uppercase. For example, to make <b>ftnchek</b>
  print a source listing by default, set the environment variable FTNCHEK_LIST
  to 1 or YES or anything other than 0 or NO. The names FTNCHEK_LIS (not the
  full option name) or ftnchek_list (lower case) would not be recognized.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here are some examples of how to set environment variables on various systems.
  For simplicity, all the examples set the default <b>-list</b> switch to YES.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&gt;1. UNIX, Bourne shell: &gt;$ FTNCHEK_LIST=YES
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
&gt; &gt;$ export FTNCHEK_LIST
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&gt;2. UNIX, C shell: &gt;% setenv FTNCHEK_LIST YES
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&gt;3. VAX/VMS: &gt;$ DEFINE FTNCHEK_LIST YES
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&gt;4. MSDOS: &gt;$ SET FTNCHEK_LIST=YES
<div class="Pp"></div>
After processing any environment variables, ftnchek looks for a preferences file
  containing options and settings. It will search in the following order, using
  only the first file found: (1) <i>.ftnchekrc</i> in the current directory, (2)
  <i>ftnchek.ini</i> in the current directory, (3) <i>.ftnchekrc</i> in the
  user's home directory, (4) <i>ftnchek.ini</i> in the home directory. If such a
  file is found, the options defined in it are used as defaults in place of the
  built-in defaults and overriding any defaults set in the environment..
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each option or setting in the preferences file must be on a separate line. They
  are given in the same form as on the command line, except without the initial
  dash. The preferences file can contain blank lines and comments. Comments are
  introduced at any point in a line by a space character (blank or tab) or the
  '#' character, and are terminated by the end of the line.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Command-line options override the defaults set in the environment or in the
  preferences file, in the same way as they override the built-in defaults.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USING_PROJECT_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#USING_PROJECT_FILES">USING
  PROJECT FILES</a></h1>
This section contains detailed information on how to use project files most
  effectively, and how to avoid some pitfalls.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One can divide the checks <b>ftnchek</b> does into two categories, local and
  global. Local checking is restricted to within a single routine, and catches
  things like uninitialized variables, unintended loss of precision in
  arithmetic expressions, etc. This sort of checking can be done on each
  subprogram independently. Furthermore, local checking of a subprogram does not
  need to be repeated when some other subprogram is changed. Global checking
  catches things like calling a subroutine with the wrong argument types, or
  disagreeing in common block declarations. It requires looking at the whole set
  of subprograms interacting with each other.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The purpose of project files is to allow the local checking and global checking
  steps to be separated. Assuming that each subprogram is in its own source
  file, you can run <b>ftnchek</b> once on each one to do local checking while
  suppressing global checking. Then <b>ftnchek</b> can be run once on all the
  project files together to do the global checking. The sample makefile below
  shows how to automate this task. The ``.f.prj'' target updates a project file
  for a particular file any time the source file changes. The information needed
  for global checking is saved in the project file. The ``check'' target does
  the combined global checking. Typically ``make check'' would repeat the
  ``ftnchek -project'' step only on changed source files, then do the global
  check. This is obviously a big advantage for large programs, when many
  subprograms seldom if ever change.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is best when using project files to place each subprogram in a separate
  source file. If each source file may contain more than one subprogram, it
  complicates the definition of ``local'' and ``global'' checking because there
  is some inter-module checking that is contained within a file. <b>ftnchek</b>
  tries to do the right thing in this case, but there are some complications
  (described below) due to the trade-off between avoiding re-doing cross-checks
  and preserving information about the program's structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Ordinarily, to do the least amount of re-checking, project files should be
  created with the <b>-library</b> flag in effect and trimming turned on. In
  this mode, the information saved in the project file consists of all
  subprogram declarations, all subprogram invocations not resolved by
  declarations in the same file, and one instance of each COMMON block
  declaration. This is the minimum amount of information needed to check
  agreement between files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the source file contains more than one routine, there are some possible
  problems that can arise from creating the project file in library mode,
  because the calling hierarchy among routines defined within the file is lost.
  Also, if the routines in the file make use of COMMON blocks that are shared
  with routines in other files, there will not be enough information saved for
  the correct checking of set and used status of COMMON blocks and COMMON
  variables according to the <b>-usage</b> setting. Therefore if you plan to use
  project files when <b>-usage</b> checking is turned on (which is the default
  situation), and if multiple routines in one project file share COMMON blocks
  with routines in other files, the project files should be created with the
  <b>-library</b> flag turned off. In this mode, <b>ftnchek</b> saves, besides
  the information listed above, one invocation of each subprogram by any other
  subprogram in the same file, and all COMMON block declarations. This means
  that the project file will be larger than necessary, and that when it is read
  in, <b>ftnchek</b> may repeat some inter-module checks that it already did
  when the project file was created. If each project file contains only one
  module, there is no loss of information in creating the project files in
  library mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Because of the possible loss of information entailed by creating a project file
  with the <b>-library</b> flag in effect, whenever that project file is read in
  later, it will be treated as a library file regardless of the current setting
  of the <b>-library</b> flag. On the other hand, a project file created with
  library mode turned off can be read in later in either mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The foregoing discussion assumes that the trimming options of the
  <b>-project</b> setting are turned on when the project file is created. This
  is the normal situation. The <b>no-trim</b> options of the <b>-project</b>
  setting are provided in case one wants to use the project files for purposes
  other than checking the program with <b>ftnchek</b>. For instance, one could
  write a Perl script to analyze the project files for information about how the
  different subprograms are called. You should not use the <b>no-trim</b>
  options to deal with the issues of information loss discussed above, since
  they cause more information than necessary to be stored. This makes the
  project files bigger and causes <b>ftnchek</b> to do more work later when it
  reads them to check your complete program. Ordinarily, you should use the
  <b>-library</b> option to control how much information to store for later use
  by <b>ftnchek</b> in checking your program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is an example of how to use the UNIX <b>make</b> utility to automatically
  create a new project file each time the corresponding source file is altered,
  and to check the set of files for consistency. Add these lines to your
  makefile. The example assumes that a macro OBJS has been defined which lists
  all the names of object files to be linked together to form the complete
  executable program. (In this makefile, the indented lines should each begin
  with a tab, not blanks.) If any source file contains multiple routines that
  share common blocks among themselves, then the no-com-\* option should be
  removed from NOGLOBAL, and/or drop the -library flag.
<pre>
    # tell make what a project file suffix is
    .SUFFIXES: .prj
<div class="Pp"></div>
    # these options suppress global checks.
    NOGLOBAL=-usage=no-ext-undefined,no-com-\*
<div class="Pp"></div>
    # tell make how to create a .prj file from a .f file
    .f.prj:
            ftnchek -project $(NOGLOBAL) -library $&lt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
    # set up macro PRJS containing project filenames
    PRJS= $(OBJS:.o=.prj)
<div class="Pp"></div>
    # &quot;make check&quot; will check everything that has been changed.
    check: $(PRJS)
            ftnchek $(PRJS)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a program uses many routines defined in a large number of different source
  files in different directories, it can be cumbersome to specify all the
  different project files needed to check the program properly. To deal with
  such cases, <b>ftnchek</b> allows project files to be concatenated into a
  single large file. This single file can then be given to <b>ftnchek</b> to
  provide the information for checking the use of any or all of the routines
  defined in the combined project files. When using such a ``library'' project
  file, you may want <b>ftnchek</b>'s error reports to document precisely the
  name of the file where the specific function is defined. If the various source
  files are in several directories, an error report that gives only the file
  name may be ambiguous, and rather should include the path to the file. The
  solution is to create each of the individual project files by giving the
  complete path to the source file. Then this complete path will appear in the
  error reports. For example, suppose that all of the library subprogram source
  files are in subdirectories of a directory named /util/lib. Then the
  individual project files could first be created by a command such as
<pre>
find /util/lib -name '*.f' -exec ftnchek -project '{}' ';'
</pre>
(Possibly other options would be provided to <b>ftnchek</b> as discussed above.
  Also, this step could be handled instead by a revised makefile rule that would
  provide the complete source file path instead of just the local name when
  invoking <b>ftnchek</b>.) Next, concatenate all of these project files
  manually.
<pre>
find /util/lib -name '*.prj' -exec cat '{}' ';' &gt; ourlib.prj
</pre>
Then a program source file can be checked by using the command
<pre>
ftnchek prog.f ... -lib ourlib.prj
</pre>
and an error message related to any library routine will include the full path
  to the routine's source file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At present, there is no archive utility like <b>ar</b> to manage the contents of
  a concatenated project file like the one in the illustration above. If changes
  are made to one of the library routines, the only way to update the combined
  project file is to concatenate all the individual project files once again.
  Such a utility would be quite easy to write. Someone should do so and
  contribute it to the <b>ftnchek</b> effort.

According to <b>ftnchek</b>, the program contains variables which may be used
  before they are assigned an initial value, and variables which are not needed.
  <b>ftnchek</b> also warns the user that an integer quotient has been converted
  to a real. This may assist the user in catching an unintended roundoff error.
  Since the <b>-symtab</b> flag was given, <b>ftnchek</b> prints out a table
  containing identifiers from the local module and their corresponding datatype
  and number of dimensions. Finally, <b>ftnchek</b> warns that the function
  COMPAV is not used with the proper type of arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
With <b>ftnchek</b>'s help, we can debug the program. We can see that there were
  the following errors:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">SUM and COUNT should have been converted to real before
      doing the division.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">NUMS should have been declared INTEGER instead of

</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
We also see that I, not J, should have been declared INTEGER in function COMPAV.
  Also, MAXNOS was not declared as INTEGER, nor COMPAV as REAL, in program
  AVENUM. These are not errors, but they may indicate carelessness. As it
  happened, the default type of these variables coincided with the intended
  type.

  THE OUTPUT</a></h1>
The messages given by <b>ftnchek</b> include not only syntax errors but also
  warnings and informational messages about things that are legal Fortran but
  that may indicate errors or carelessness. Most of these messages can be turned
  off by command-line options. Which option controls each message depends on the
  nature of the condition being warned about. See the descriptions of the
  command-line flags in the previous sections, and of individual messages below.
  Each message is prefixed with a word or phrase indicating the nature of the
  condition and its severity.
<div class="Pp"></div>
``Error'' means a syntax error. The simplest kind of syntax errors are
  typographical errors, for example unbalanced parentheses or misspelling of a
  keyword. This type of error is caught by the parser and appears with the
  description ``parse error'' or ``syntax error'' (depending on the version of
  the parser generator and whether it is GNU <b>bison</b> or UNIX <b>yacc</b>).
  This type of error message cannot be suppressed. Be aware that this type of
  error often means that <b>ftnchek</b> has not properly interpreted the
  statement where the error occurs, so that its subsequent checking operations
  will be compromised. You should eliminate all syntax errors before proceeding
  to interpret the other messages <b>ftnchek</b> gives.
<div class="Pp"></div>
``Warning: Nonstandard syntax'' indicates an extension to Fortran that
  <b>ftnchek</b> supports but that is not according to the Fortran 77 Standard.
  The extensions that <b>ftnchek</b> accepts are described in the section on
  Extensions below. One example is the DO ... ENDDO construction. If a program
  uses these extensions, warnings will be given according to specifications
  under the <b>-f77</b> setting. The default behavior is to give no warnings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
``Warning'' in other cases means a condition that is suspicious but that may or
  may not be a programming error. Frequently these conditions are legal under
  the standard. Some are illegal but do not fall under the heading of syntax
  errors. Usage errors are one example. These refer to the possibility that a
  variable may be used before it has been assigned a value (generally an error),
  or that a variable is declared but never used (harmless but may indicate
  carelessness). The amount of checking for usage errors is controlled by the
  <b>-usage</b> flag, which specifies the maximum amount of checking by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Truncation warnings cover situations in which accuracy may be lost
  unintentionally, for example when a double precision value is assigned to a
  real variable. These warnings are controlled by the <b>-truncation</b>
  setting, which is on by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
``Nonportable usage'' warns about some feature that may not be accepted by some
  compilers even though it is not contrary to the Fortran 77 Standard, or that
  may cause the program to perform differently on different platforms. For
  example, equivalencing real and integer variables is usually a non-portable
  practice. The use of extensions to the standard language is, of course,
  another source of non-portability, but this is handled as a separate case. To
  check a program for true portability, both the <b>-portability</b> and the
  <b>-f77</b> flags should be used. They are both turned off by default. The
  <b>-wordsize</b> setting is provided to check only those nonportable usages
  that depend on a particular machine wordsize.
<div class="Pp"></div>
``Possibly misleading appearance'' is used for legal constructions that may not
  mean what they appear to mean at first glance. For example, Fortran is
  insensitive to blank space, so extraneous space within variable names or the
  lack of space between a keyword and a variable can convey the wrong impression
  to the reader. These messages can be suppressed by turning off the
  <b>-pretty</b> flag, which is on by default.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Other messages that are given after all the files are processed, and having to
  do with agreement between modules, do not use the word ``warning'' but
  generally fall into that category. Examples include type mismatches between
  corresponding variables in different COMMON block declarations, or between
  dummy and actual arguments of a subprogram. These warnings are controlled by
  the <b>-common</b> and <b>-arguments</b> settings respectively. By default
  both are set for maximum strictness of checking.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Another group of warnings about conditions that are often harmless refer to
  cases where the array properties of a variable passed as a subprogram argument
  differ between the two routines. For instance, an array element might be
  passed to a subroutine that expects a whole array. This is a commonly-used
  technique for processing single rows or columns of two-dimensional arrays.
  However, it could also indicate a programming error. The <b>-array</b> setting
  allows the user to adjust the degree of strictness to be used in checking this
  kind of agreement between actual and dummy array arguments. By default the
  strictness is maximum.
<div class="Pp"></div>
``Oops'' indicates a technical problem, meaning either a bug in <b>ftnchek</b>
  or that its resources have been exceeded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The syntax error messages and warnings include the filename along with the line
  number and column number. <b>ftnchek</b> has two different options for the
  appearance of these error messages. If <b>-novice</b> is in effect, which is
  the default, the messages are in a style approximating normal English. (In
  default style, the filename is not printed in messages within the body of the
  program if <b>-list</b> is in effect.) The other style of error messages is
  selected by the <b>-nonovice</b> option. In this style, the appearance of the
  messages is similar to that of the UNIX <b>lint</b> program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ftnchek</b> is still blind to some kinds of syntax errors. The two most
  important ones are detailed checking of FORMAT statements, and almost anything
  to do with control of execution flow by means of IF, DO, and GOTO statements:
  namely correct nesting of control structures, matching of opening statements
  such as IF ... THEN with closing statements such as ENDIF, and the proper use
  of statement labels (numbers). Most compilers will catch these errors. See the
  section on Limitations for a more detailed discussion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If <b>ftnchek</b> gives you a syntax error message when the compiler does not,
  it may be because your program contains an extension to standard Fortran which
  is accepted by the compiler but not by <b>ftnchek</b>. (See the section on
  Extensions.) On a VAX/VMS system, you can use the compiler option /STANDARD to
  cause the compiler to accept only standard Fortran. On most UNIX or UNIX-like
  systems, this can be accomplished by setting the flag <b>-ansi.</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many of the messages given by <b>ftnchek</b> are self-explanatory. Those that
  need some additional explanation are listed below in alphabetical order.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Common block NAME: data type mismatch at position
    n</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <i>n</i>-th variable in the COMMON block differs in
      data type in two different declarations of the COMMON block. By default (
      <b>-common</b> strictness level 3), <b>ftnchek</b> is very picky about
      COMMON blocks: the variables listed in them must match exactly by data
      type and array dimensions. That is, the legal pair of declarations in
      different modules:
    <pre>
     COMMON /COM1/ A,B
and
     COMMON /COM1/ A(2)
    </pre>
    <div>&#x00A0;</div>
    will cause <b>ftnchek</b> to give warnings at strictness level 3. These two
      declarations are legal in Fortran since they both declare two real
      variables. At strictness level 1 or 2, no warning would be given in this
      example, but the warning would be given if there were a data type
      mismatch, for instance, if B were declared INTEGER. Controlled by
      <b>-common</b> setting.

      that the two declarations have different numbers of variables, where an
      array of any size is considered one variable. This is not necessarily an
      error, but it may indicate that a variable is missing from one of the
      lists. Note that according to the Fortran 77 Standard, it is an error for

The checking of FORMAT statements is lax, tolerating missing separators (comma,
  etc.) between format descriptors in places where the Standard requires them,
  and allowing <i>.d</i> fields on descriptors that should not have them. It
  does warn under <b>-f77=format-edit-descr</b> about nonstandard descriptor
  types (like O), and supported extensions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are some syntactic extensions and Fortran 90 elements that <b>ftnchek</b>
  accepts but does very little checking. For instance, pointer usage (whether
  the nonstandard Cray syntax or the Fortran 90 syntax) is not checked other
  than for set and used status. It is hoped that some day more thorough checking
  will be implemented, but for now the user should regard the acceptance of
  these syntactic features simply as a convenience to enable checking of other
  aspects of code that contains them. See the section Extensions for specifics
  about what features are accepted but not fully checked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a user-supplied subprogram has the same name as one of the nonstandard
  intrinsic functions recognized by <b>ftnchek</b>, it must be declared in an
  EXTERNAL statement in any routine that invokes it. Otherwise it will be
  subject to the checking normally given to the intrinsic function. Since the
  nonstandard intrinsics are not standard, this EXTERNAL statement is not
  required by the Fortran 77 Standard. Using the <b>-intrinsic=none</b> setting,
  recognition of most nonstandard intrinsics (excepting only those needed to
  support the double complex data type) can be turned off. See the lists of

<div class="Pp"></div>
Tabs are permitted, and translated into equivalent blanks which correspond to
  tab stops every 8 columns. The standard does not recognize tabs. Note that
  some compilers allow tabs, but treat them differently. The treatment defined
  for DEC FORTRAN can be achieved using the <b>-source=dec-tab</b> setting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Strings may be delimited by either quote marks or apostrophes. A sequence of two
  delimiter characters is interpreted as a single embedded delimiter character.
  (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Strings may contain UNIX-style backslash escape sequences. They will be
  interpreted as such if the <b>-source=unix-backslash</b> setting is given.
  Otherwise the backslash character will be treated as a normal printing
  character.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Source code can be in either Fortran 90 free format or traditional fixed format.
  (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
A semicolon is allowed as a statement separator. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Lower case characters are permitted, and are converted internally to uppercase
  except in character strings. The standard specifies upper case only, except in
  comments and strings. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hollerith constants are permitted, in accordance with the Fortran 77 Standard,
  appendix C. They should not be used in expressions, or confused with datatype
  CHARACTER.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The letter 'D' (upper or lower case) in column 1 is treated as the beginning of
  a comment. There is no option to treat such lines as statements instead of
  comments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Statements may be longer than 72 columns provided that the setting
  <b>-columns</b> was used to increase the limit. According to the standard, all
  text from columns 73 through 80 is ignored, and no line may be longer than 80
  columns.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Variable names may be longer than six characters. The standard specifies six as
  the maximum. <b>ftnchek</b> permits names up to 31 characters long (F90).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Variable names may contain underscores and dollar signs (or other non-alphabetic
  characters as specified by the <b>-identifier-chars</b> option). These
  characters are are treated the same as alphabetic letters. The default type
  for variables beginning with these characters is REAL. In IMPLICIT type
  statements specifying a range of characters, the dollar sign follows Z and is
  followed by underscore. (Any other user-defined characters are treated the
  same as the dollar sign.) Fortran 90 permits underscores in variable names.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The UNIX version tolerates the presence of preprocessor directives, namely lines
  beginning with the pound sign (#). These are treated as comments, except for
  #line directives, which are interpreted, and are used to set the line number
  and source file name for warnings and error messages. Note that #include
  directives are not processed by <b>ftnchek</b>. Programs that use them for
  including source files should be passed through the preprocessor before being
  input to <b>ftnchek</b>. As noted below, <b>ftnchek</b> does process INCLUDE
  statements, which have a different syntax. An optional program,
  <b>ftnpp</b>(1L) (available separately) provides preprocessing that properly
  handles INCLUDE files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Fortran 90 DO ... ENDDO control structure is permitted. The CYCLE and EXIT
  statements are accepted. All of these may have an optional do-construct name,
  but construct names are not checked for consistency. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The Fortran 90 SELECT CASE construct is accepted. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Construct names are also accepted on IF, THEN, ELSE, ENDIF and SELECT CASE
  statements. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
The ACCEPT and TYPE statements (for terminal I/O) are permitted, with the same
  syntax as PRINT.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The so-called ``Cray pointer'' syntax is tolerated. It is not the same as the
  Fortran 90 POINTER statement. There is no real checking of the statement other
  than basic syntax. The form of this statement is
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
POINTER ( <i>pointer</i>, <i>pointee</i>) [,( <i>pointer</i>, <i>pointee</i>)]
<br/>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The pointer variables are assigned a data type of INTEGER *4. Usage checking of
  the pointee variables is suppressed, since in practice they are accessed
  indirectly via the pointers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following Fortran 90 pointer related syntaxes are accepted: ALLOCATABLE,
  POINTER, and TARGET statements and the same attributes in type declarations;
  ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, and NULLIFY executable statements; pointer assignment
  using =&gt; operator; and the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED and ASSOCIATED.
  Little semantic checking of pointer variables and operations is done beyond
  basic set and used status. For instance, there is no checking for such errors
  as dangling pointers, or use of unallocated arrays.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Statements may have any number of continuation lines. The Fortran 77 and Fortran
  90 standards allow a maximum of 19 in fixed source form. The Fortran 90
  standard allows a maximum of 39 in free source form.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Relational (comparison) operators composed of punctuation, namely: &lt; &lt;= ==
  /= &gt; &gt;= are allowed. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inline comments, beginning with an exclamation mark, are permitted. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
NAMELIST I/O is supported. The syntax is the same as in Fortran 90.
<div class="Pp"></div>
FORMAT statements can contain a dollar sign to indicate suppression of
  carriage-return. An integer expression enclosed in angle brackets can be used
  anywhere in a FORMAT statement where the Fortran 77 Standard allows an integer
  constant (except for the length of a Hollerith constant), to provide a
  run-time value for a repeat specification or field width.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Nonstandard keywords are allowed in I/O statements, corresponding to those in
  VMS Fortran.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The IMPLICIT NONE statement is supported. The meaning of this statement is that
  all variables must have their data types explicitly declared. Rather than flag
  the occurrences of such variables with syntax error messages, <b>ftnchek</b>
  waits till the end of the module, and then prints out a list of all undeclared
  variables, as it does for the <b>-declare</b> option. (F90)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Data types INTEGER, REAL, COMPLEX, and LOGICAL are allowed to have an optional
  precision specification in type declarations. For instance, REAL*8 means an
  8-byte floating point data type. The REAL*8 datatype is not necessarily
  considered equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION, depending on the <b>-wordsize</b>
  setting. The Fortran 77 Standard allows a length specification only for
  CHARACTER data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ftnchek</b> supports the DOUBLE COMPLEX type specification for a complex
  quantity whose real and imaginary parts are double precision. Mixed-mode
  arithmetic involving single-precision complex with double-precision real data,
  prohibited under the Standard, yields a double complex result.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Combined type declarations and data-statement-like initializers are accepted.
  These have the form of a standard Fortran 77 type declaration, followed by a
  slash-delimited list of constants like that used in a DATA statement. An
  example of the syntax is
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
INTEGER N / 100 /
<br/>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This bastard form of initializing declaration was not adopted in Fortran 90.
  Such declarations should be written using the standard form described below,
  which is accepted by <b>ftnchek</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is limited support for Fortran 90 attribute-based type declarations. This
  style of declaration is distinguished by the use of a double colon (::)
  between the list of attributes and the list of declared variables. The
  features supported may be adequate for novice programmers, but are not yet
  sufficient for professional-quality Fortran 90 programs. I hope to add support
  for more features in future releases. I invite volunteers to assist in this
  task. See the ToDo file in the source code distribution for details. The
  attributes currently accepted, besides all the usual data types, are
  DIMENSION, EXTERNAL, INTRINSIC, PARAMETER, and SAVE. The new form of
  declaration also allows assignment of values to the variables declared. At
  present, the (LEN= <i>value</i>) form of specifying character lengths is also
  accepted. Kind specifications, using (KIND= <i>value</i>) are parsed but are
  not processed: all kinds are treated as default kind. Also, there is little
  checking of these declarations beyond basic syntax.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many commonly found nonstandard intrinsic functions are provided. See the
  discussion of <b>-intrinsic</b> for a list of functions and how to control
  which ones are recognized.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Argument checking is not tight for those nonstandard intrinsics that take arrays
  or mixed argument types.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ftnchek</b> permits the INCLUDE statement, which causes inclusion of the text
  of the given file. The syntax is
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
INCLUDE ' <i>filename</i>'
<br/>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
This is compatible with Fortran 90. If the <b>-source=vms-include</b> option is
  given, <b>ftnchek</b> follows VMS conventions with respect to this statement:
  it assumes a default extension of <i>.for</i> if no filename extension is
  given, and allows the qualifier /[NO]LIST following the filename, to control
  the listing of the included file. There is no support for including VMS text
  modules.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In diagnostic output relating to items contained in include files, the location
  of the error is specified by both its location in the include file and the
  location in the parent file where the file was included.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ftnchek</b> accepts PARAMETER statements which lack parentheses. These will
  be warned about if the <b>-f77=param-noparen</b> flag is given.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>ftnchek</b> accepts PARAMETER definitions that involve intrinsic functions
  and exponentiation by a non-integer exponent. Both of these cases are
  prohibited by the Fortran 77 Standard, and will be warned about if the
  <b>-f77=param-intrinsic</b> flag is given. If an intrinsic function value is a
  compile-time integer constant, <b>ftnchek</b> will evaluate it. This allows
  better checking if the parameter is used in declaring array sizes. Fortran 90
  allows intrinsic functions in PARAMETER definitions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The intrinsic functions that are evaluated are:
<table class="tbl">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 5.00ex;"/>
    <col style="width: 4.00ex;"/>
    <col style="width: 5.00ex;"/>
    <col style="width: 5.00ex;"/>
    <col style="width: 4.00ex;"/>
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td>ABS</td>
    <td>IABS</td>
    <td>DIM</td>
    <td>IDIM</td>
    <td>MAX</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MAX0</td>
    <td>MIN</td>
    <td>MIN0</td>
    <td>MOD</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ISIGN</td>
    <td>LEN</td>
    <td>ICHAR</td>
    <td>INDEX</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
The functions of integer arguments are evaluated only if the arguments are
  integer constant expressions. (These may involve integer constants,
  parameters, and evaluated intrinsic functions.) The function LEN is evaluated
  if its argument is an expression involving only character constants and
  variables whose length is not adjustable. The functions ICHAR and INDEX are
  evaluated only if the arguments are character constants. <b>ftnchek</b> gives
  a warning if it needs the value of some intrinsic function that is not
  evaluated.</div>

<b>ftnchek</b> still has much room for improvement. Your feedback is
  appreciated. We want to know about any bugs you notice. Bugs include not only
  cases in which <b>ftnchek</b> issues an error message where no error exists,
  but also if <b>ftnchek</b> fails to issue a warning when it ought to. Note,
  however, that <b>ftnchek</b> is not intended to catch all syntax errors (see
  section on Limitations). Also, it is not considered a bug for a variable to be
  reported as used before set, if the reason is that the usage of the variable
  occurs prior in the text to where the variable is set. For instance, this
  could occur when a GOTO causes execution to loop backward to some previously
  skipped statements. <b>ftnchek</b> does not analyze the program flow, but
  assumes that statements occurring earlier in the text are executed before the
  following ones.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We especially want to know if <b>ftnchek</b> crashes for any reason. It is not
  supposed to crash, even on programs with syntax errors. Suggestions are
  welcomed for additional features which you would find useful. Tell us if any
  of <b>ftnchek</b>'s messages are incomprehensible. Comments on the readability
  and accuracy of this document are also welcome.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You may also suggest support for additional extensions to the Fortran language.
  These will be included only if it is felt that the extensions are sufficiently
  widely accepted by compilers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you find a bug in <b>ftnchek</b>, first consult the list of known bugs below
  to see if it has already been reported. Also check the section entitled
  ``Limitations and Extensions'' above for restrictions that could be causing
  the problem. If you do not find the problem documented in either place, then
  send a report including
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The operating system and CPU type on which <b>ftnchek</b>
      is running.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The version of <b>ftnchek</b> and values of any environment

  <dd class="It-tag">If possible, a small sample program showing the bug.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The report should be sent to Dr. Robert Moniot (see contact information in
  section entitled ``Installation and Support'').
<div class="Pp"></div>
Highest priority will be given to bugs which cause <b>ftnchek</b> to crash.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Certain problems that arise when checking large programs can be fixed by
  increasing the sizes of the data areas in <b>ftnchek</b>. (These problems are
  generally signaled by error messages beginning with ``Oops''.) The simplest
  way to increase the table sizes is by recompiling <b>ftnchek</b> with the
  LARGE_MACHINE macro name defined. Consult the makefile and README file for the
  method of doing this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following is a list of known bugs.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Bug: Used-before-set message is suppressed for any variable
      which is used as the loop index in an implied-do loop, even if it was in
      fact used before being set in some earlier statement. For example,
      consider J in the statement</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
      WRITE(5,*) (A(J), J=1,10)
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here <b>ftnchek</b> parses the I/O expression, A(J), where J is used, before it
  parses the implied loop where J is set. Normally this would cause
  <b>ftnchek</b> to report a spurious used-before-set warning for J. Since this
  report is usually in error and occurs fairly commonly, <b>ftnchek</b>
  suppresses the warning for J altogether.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prognosis: A future version of <b>ftnchek</b> is planned which will handle
  implied-do loops correctly.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Bug: Variables used (not as arguments) in
      statement-function subprograms do not have their usage status updated when
      the statement function is invoked.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prognosis: To be fixed in a future version of <b>ftnchek</b>.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Bug: VAX version does not expand wildcards in filenames on
      the command line if they are followed without space by an option, e.g.
      ftnchek *.f/calltree would not expand the *.f. This is because VMS-style
      options without intervening space are not supported by the GNU shell_mung
      routine that is used to expand wildcards.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prognosis: unlikely to be fixed.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Bug: checking for nonstandard format edit descriptors is
      done only in FORMAT statements, not in character strings used as
    formats.</dd>
</dl>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<div class="Pp"></div>
Prognosis: may be fixed someday.</div>

<b>ftnchek</b> was designed by Dr. Robert Moniot, professor at Fordham
  University. During the academic year of 1988-1989, Michael Myers and Lucia
  Spagnuolo developed the program to perform the variable usage checks. During
  the following year it was augmented by Lois Bigbie to check subprogram
  arguments and COMMON block declarations. Brian Downing assisted with the
  implementation of the INCLUDE statement. John Quinn wrote the common block
  usage checks. Heba Elsayed wrote the label table printout and label usage
  checks. Nelson H. F. Beebe of the University of Utah added most of the new
  code to implement the <b>-makedcls</b> feature and wrote the dcl2inc script.
  The <b>-mkhtml</b> feature was contributed by Mark McVeigh of Framatome ANP,
  Inc. The <b>-reference</b> feature was contributed by Gerome Emmanuel, Ecole
  des mines, U. Nancy (slightly modified). The <b>-vcg</b> option was
  contributed by Dr. Philip Rubini of Cranfield University, UK. The support for
  Cray pointer syntax was provided by John Dannenhoffer of United Technologies
  Research Center. John C. Bollinger of Indiana University added the parser
  syntax for the SELECT CASE construct. Robert Landrito added the parser syntax
  for F90 pointer-related features. Additional features will be added as time
  permits. As of Version 2.5, the name was changed from <b>forchek</b> to
  <b>ftnchek</b>, to avoid confusion with a similar program named
  <b>forcheck</b>, developed earlier at Leiden University.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INSTALLATION_AND_SUPPORT"><a class="selflink" href="#INSTALLATION_AND_SUPPORT">INSTALLATION
  AND SUPPORT</a></h1>
The <b>ftnchek</b> program is free software. It can be obtained by anonymous ftp
  from many software servers, including ftp://netlib.org/fortran . Note that on
  Netlib the distribution is named <i>ftnchek.tar.gz</i> whereas on most other
  servers the file name includes the version number, e.g.
  <i>ftnchek-3.3.0.tar.gz</i>. If the file extension is <i>.Z</i>, uncompress
  with the Unix <b>uncompress</b>(1) utility. If the file extension is
  <i>.gz</i>, uncompress with the GNU <b>gunzip</b>(1L) program. Then use
  <b>tar</b>(1) to unpack the files into a subdirectory.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Installation requires a C compiler for your computer. See the INSTALL file
  provided with the distribution for instructions on installing <b>ftnchek</b>
  on your system. Executable binary for particular systems such as IBM PC or
  Macintosh, as available, can be obtained by anonymous ftp from
  ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu/pub/ftnchek . Assistance in preparing such
  executable binary forms is welcome.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>nroff</b> version of this document is named <i>ftnchek.man</i>. On UNIX
  systems, this file can be used as the man page, but actually it is a
  multi-purpose source file which is used to produce the other forms of the
  documentation. The cleaned-up man page document, created during installation
  of <b>ftnchek</b>, is named <i>ftnchek.1</i>. The distribution also includes a
  plain ASCII version named <i>ftnchek.doc</i>, a PostScript version named
  <i>ftnchek.ps</i>, an HTML version in directory <i>html</i>, and a VMS HELP
  version named <i>ftnchek.hlp</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Information about the latest version and the status of the project can be
  obtained by visiting <b>ftnchek</b>'s home page,
  http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/~ftnchek . For further information and to report
  bugs, you may contact Dr. Robert Moniot, whose contact information can be
  found by a Web search for his name and Fordham University. (E-mail address is
  not provided here because it attracts unsolicited commercial e-mail, but it is
  easily constructed by combining his last name with the name of the university
  and the edu domain.)
