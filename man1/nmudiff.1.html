<p>NMUDIFF(1) General Commands Manual NMUDIFF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nmudiff - email an NMU diff to the Debian BTS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nmudiff [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nmudiff should be run in the source tree of the package
being NMUed, after the NMU is built. It assumes that the
source packages (specifically, the .dsc and any
corresponding tar <br>
and diff files) for both the previous version of the package
and the newly built NMU version are in the parent directory.
It then uses debdiff to generate a diff between the
pre&acirc; <br>
vious version and the current NMU, and either runs mutt or
an editor (using sensible-editor) so that the mail message
(including the diff) can be examined and modified; once you
<br>
exit the editor the diff will be mailed to the Debian
BTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default behaviour is that if
exactly one bug is closed by this NMU, then that bug will be
mailed, otherwise a new bug will be submitted. This
behaviour may be changed by <br>
command line options and configuration file options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--new Instead of mailing the bug reports which are to be
closed by this NMU, a new bug report is submitted directly
to the BTS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--old Send the bug report to all
of the bugs which are being closed by this NMU, rather than
opening a new bug report. This option has no effect if no
bugs are being closed by <br>
this NMU.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mutt Use mutt(1) for editing
and sending the message to the BTS (default behaviour). This
can be controlled using a configuration file option (see
below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-mutt <br>
Use sensible-editor(1) to edit the message and then mail it
directly using /usr/bin/sendmail. This can be controlled
using a configuration file option (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sendmail SENDMAILCMD <br>
Specify the sendmail command. The command will be split on
white space and will be interpreted by the shell. Default is
/usr/sbin/sendmail. The -t option will be auto&acirc; <br>
matically added if the command is /usr/sbin/sendmail or
/usr/sbin/exim*. For other mailers, if they require a -t
option, this must be included in the SENDMAILCMD, for <br>
example: --sendmail=&quot;/usr/sbin/mymailer -t&quot;. This
can also be set using the devscripts configuration files;
see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--from EMAIL <br>
If using the sendmail (--no-mutt) option, then the email to
the BTS will be sent using the name and address in the
environment variables DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME. If <br>
these are not set, then the variables EMAIL and NAME will be
used instead. These can be overridden using the --from
option. The program will not work in this case if an <br>
email address cannot be determined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delay DELAY <br>
Indicate in the generated mail that the NMU has been
uploaded to the DELAYED queue, with a delay of DELAY days.
The default value is XX which adds a placeholder to the e-
<br>
mail. A value of 0 indicates that the upload has not been
sent to a delayed queue. This can also be set using the
devscripts configuration files; see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-delay, --nodelay <br>
Equivalent to --delay 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-conf, --noconf <br>
Do not read any configuration files. This can only be used
as the first option given on the command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--help Display a help message
and exit successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--version <br>
Display version and copyright information and exit
successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION VARIABLES <br>
The two configuration files /etc/devscripts.conf and
~/.devscripts are sourced in that order to set configuration
variables. Command line options can be used to override
config&acirc; <br>
uration file settings. Environment variable settings are
ignored for this purpose. The currently recognised variables
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NMUDIFF_DELAY <br>
If this is set to a number, e-mails generated by nmudiff
will by default mention an upload to the DELAYED queue,
delayed for the specified number of days. The value 0 <br>
indicates that the DELAYED queue has not been used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NMUDIFF_MUTT <br>
Can be yes (default) or no, and specifies whether to use
mutt to compose and send the message or not, as described
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NMUDIFF_NEWREPORT <br>
This option controls whether a new bug report is made, or
whether the diff is sent to the bugs closed by this NMU. Can
be maybe (default), which sends to the existing bug <br>
reports if exactly one bug is being closed; yes, which
always creates a new report, or no, which always sends to
the reports of the bugs being closed (unless no bugs are
<br>
being closed, in which case a new report is always
made).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BTS_SENDMAIL_COMMAND <br>
If this is set, specifies a sendmail command to use instead
of /usr/sbin/sendmail. Same as the --sendmail command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
debdiff(1), sensible-editor(1), devscripts.conf(5)</p>
