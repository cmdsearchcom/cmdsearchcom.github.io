<p>COOK(1) General Commands Manual COOK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
cook - a file construction tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
[ option... ][ filename... ] <br>
-Help <br>
-VERSion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The program is a tool for constructing files. It is given a
set of files to create, and instructions detailing how to
construct them. In any non-trivial program there will be
<br>
prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to
creating any file, such as extraction from a source-control
system. The program provides a mechanism to define
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a program is being
developed or maintained, the programmer will typically
change one file of several which comprise the program. The
program examines the last-modified <br>
times of the files to see when the prerequisites of a file
have changed, implying that the file needs to be recreated
as it is logically out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program also provides a
facility for implicit recipes, allowing users to specify how
to form a file with a given suffix from a file with a
different suffix. For example, to <br>
create filename.o from filename.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options and filenames may be
arbitrarily mixed on the command line; no processing is done
until all options and filenames on the command line have
been scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The program will attempt to
create the named files from the recipes given to it. The
recipes are contained in a file called Howto.cook in the
current directory. This file may, <br>
in turn, include other files containing additional
recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no filenames are given on the
command line the targets of the first recipe defined are
cooked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The valid options for are listed below. Any other options
(words on the command line beginning with &lsquo;-&rsquo;)
will cause a diagnostic message to be issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Action <br>
Execute the commands given in the recipes. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Action <br>
Do not execute the commands given in the recipes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Book filename <br>
Tells to used the named cookbook, rather than the default
&lsquo;&lsquo;Howto.cook&rsquo;&rsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CAScade <br>
This option may be used to enable the use of cascaded
ingredients. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_CAScade <br>
This option may be used to disable the use of cascaded
ingredients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Continue <br>
If cooking a target should fail, continue with other recipes
for which the failed target is not an ingredient, directly
or indirectly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Continue <br>
If cooking a target should fail, will exit. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CTime The inode st_ctime data
is used to supplement the st_mtime data when determining
whether or not files have changed. This is the default. (If
you have no idea what this <br>
is, don&rsquo;t mess with it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_CTime <br>
Do not supplement st_mtime with st_ctime. This may be
important when st_nlink changes at critical times, because
making and breaking hard links touches st_ctime. (If <br>
you have no idea what this is, seriously, don&rsquo;t mess
with it.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Errok <br>
When a command is executed, the exit code will be
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Errok <br>
When a command is executed, if the exit code is positive it
will be deemed to fail, and thus the recipe containing it to
have failed. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FingerPrint <br>
When cook examines a file to determine if it has changed, it
uses the last-modified time information available in the
file system. There are times when this is altered, <br>
but the file contents do not actually change. The
fingerprinting facility examines the file contents when it
appears to have changed, and compares the old fingerprint
<br>
against the present file contents. (See cookfp(1) for a
description of the fingerprinting algorithm.) If the
fingerprint did not change, the last-modified time in the
<br>
file system is ignored. Note that this has implications if
you are in the habit of using the touch(1) command - cook
will do nothing until you actually change the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_FingerPrint <br>
Do not use fingerprints to supplement the last-modified time
file information. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-FingerPrint_Update <br>
This option may be used to scan the directory tree below the
current directory and update the file fingerprints. This
helps when you use another tool (such as RCS or <br>
ClearCase) which alters the file but preserves the
file&rsquo;s modification time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Force <br>
Always perform the actions of recipes, irrespective of the
last-modified times of any of the ingredients. This option
is useful if something beyond the scope of the <br>
cookbook has been modified; for example, a bug fix in a
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Force <br>
Perform the actions of the recipes if any of the ingredients
are logically out of date. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Help <br>
Provide information about how to execute on stdout, and
perform no other function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Include filename <br>
Search the named directory before the standard places for
included cookbooks. Each directory so named will be scanned
in the order given. The standard places are <br>
$HOME/.cook then .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Include_Cooked <br>
This option may be used to require the cooking of files
named on #include-cooked and #include-cooked-nowarn include
lines in cookbooks. The files named will be included, <br>
if present. If the files named need to be updated or
created, this will be done, and then the cookbook re-read.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Include_Cooked <br>
This option may be used to inhibit the implicit cooking of
files named on #include-cooked and #include-cooked-nowarn
include lines in cookbooks. The files will be <br>
included, if present, but they will not be updated or
created, even if required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Include_Cooked_Warning <br>
This option enables the warnings about derived dependencies
in derived cookbooks. This is usually the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Include_Cooked_Warning <br>
This option disables the warnings about derived dependencies
in derived cookbooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-List <br>
Causes to automatically redirect the stdout and stderr of
the session. Output will continue to come to the terminal,
unless is executing in the background. The name of <br>
the file will be the name of the cookbook with any suffix
removed and &quot;.list&quot; appended; this will usually be
Howto.list. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-List filename <br>
Causes to automatically redirect the stdout and stderr of
the session into the named file. Output will continue to
come to the terminal, unless is executing in the back&acirc;
<br>
ground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_List <br>
No automatic redirection of the output of the session will
be made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_List filename <br>
No automatic redirection of the output of the session will
be made, however subsequent -List options will default to
listing to the named file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Meter <br>
After each command is executed, print a summary of the
command&rsquo;s CPU usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Meter <br>
Do not print a CPU usage summary after each command. This is
the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Pairs <br>
This option may be used to generate a list of pair-wise file
dependencies, similar to lorder(1) output. This may be used
to draw file dependency diagrams. It can also <br>
be useful when debugging cookbooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Page-Length number <br>
This option may be used to set the length of the page, used
when Cook needs to paginate output. Defaults to what the
LINES environment variable tells it, or the terminal <br>
emulator tells it if LINES isn&rsquo;t set. -Page-Width
number This option may be used to set the width of the page,
used when Cook needs to wrap output (e.g. when it prints
<br>
commends being executed). Defaults to what the COLS
environment variable tells it, or the terminal emulator
tells it if COLS isn&rsquo;t set. The maximum value for
number is <br>
32767.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-PARallel [ number ] <br>
This option may be used to specify the number of parallel
executions threads. The number defaults to 4 if no specific
number of threads is specified. See also the par&acirc; <br>
allel_jobs variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of this option on
single-processor machines needs to be done with great care,
as it can bring other processing to a complete halt. Several
users doing so simultane&acirc; <br>
ously on a multi-processor machine will have a similar
effect. It is also to rapidly run out of virtual memory and
temporary disk space if the parallel tasks are com&acirc;
<br>
plex.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_PARallel <br>
This option may be used to specify that a single execution
thread is to be used. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Precious <br>
When commands in the body of a recipe fail, do not delete
the targets of the recipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Precious <br>
When commands in the body of a recipe fail, delete the
targets of the recipe. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Reason <br>
Two options are provided for tracing the inferences makes
when attempting to cook a target. The -Reason option will
cause will emit copious amounts of information about <br>
the inferences it is making when cooking targets. This
option may be used when you think is acting strangely, or
are just curious.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Reason <br>
This option may be used to cause will not emit information
about the inferences it is making when cooking targets. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SCript <br>
This option may be used to request a shell script be printed
on the standard output. This shell script may be used to
construct the files; it captures many of the seman&acirc;
<br>
tics of the cookbook. This can be useful when a project
needs to be distributed, and the recipients do not have
cook(1) installed. It can also be very useful when <br>
debugging cookbooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Silent <br>
Do not echo commands before they are executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Silent <br>
Echo commands before they are executed. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-STar <br>
Emit progress indicators once a second. These progress
indicators include</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">+ Reading the cookbook <br>
- Executing a collect function <br>
* Building the dependency graph <br>
# Walking the dependency graph <br>
@ Writing fingerprint files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_STar <br>
Do not emit progress indicators. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Strip_Dot <br>
Remove leading &quot;./&quot; from filenames before
attempting to cook them; applies to all filenames and all
recipes. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Strip_Dot <br>
Leave leading &quot;./&quot; on filenames while cooking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-SymLink-Ingredients <br>
The option asks that, when using a search path, that
non-top-level recipe ingredients get a top-level symlink to
the actual file. This is intended for brain dead tools, <br>
like GNU Autoconf, that don&rsquo;t grok search paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No-SymLink-Ingredients <br>
Do not create top level symlinks to ingredients. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tell_Position <br>
This option may be used to cause the position of commands
(filename and line number) to be printed along with the
command just before it is executed (provided the <br>
-No_Silent option is in force).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Tell_Position <br>
This option may be used to suppress printing the position of
commands (filename and line number) along with the command
just before it is executed. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Touch <br>
Update the last-modified times of the target files, rather
than execute the actions bound to recipes. This can be
useful if you have made a modification to a file that <br>
you know will make a system of files logically out of date,
but has no significance; for example, adding a comment to a
widely used include file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Touch <br>
Execute the actions bound to recipes, rather than update the
last-modified times of the target files. This is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TErminal <br>
When listing, also send the output stream to the terminal.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_TErminal <br>
When listing, do not send the output to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Time_Adjust <br>
This option causes cook to check the last-modified time of
the targets of recipes, and updates them if necessary, to
make sure they are consistent with (younger than) the <br>
last-modified times of the ingredients. This results in more
system calls, and can slow things down on some systems. This
corresponds to the time-adjust recipe flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-No_Time_Adjust <br>
Do not update the file last-modified times after performing
the body of a recipe. This is the default. This corresponds
to the no-time-adjust recipe flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Web <br>
This option may be used to request a HTML web page be
printed on the standard output. This web page may be used to
document the file dependencies; it captures many of <br>
the semantics of the cookbook. It can also be very useful
when debugging cookbooks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name=value <br>
Assign the value to the named variable. The value may
contain spaces if you can convince the shell to pass them
through.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
The following files are used by cook:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Howto.cook <br>
This file contains instructions to cook for how to construct
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This directory contains
&quot;system&quot; cookbooks for various tools and
activities.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.cook.fp <br>
This text file is used to remember fingerprints between
invocations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables are used by cook:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COOK May be set to contain
command-line options, changing the default behavior of cook.
May be overridden by the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Use to paginate the output
of the -Help and -VERSion options. Defaults to more(1) if
not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COOK_AUTOMOUNT_POINTS <br>
A colon-separated list of directories which the automounter
may use to mount file systems. Use with extreme care, as
this distorts Cook&rsquo;s idea of the shape of the file
<br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This feature assumes that paths
below the automounter&rsquo;s mount directory are echoes of
paths without it. E.g. When /home is the trigger, and
/tmp_mnt/home is where the <br>
on-demand NFS mount is performed, with /home appearing to
processes to be a symlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is the behavior of the Sun
automounter. The AMD automounter is capable of being
configured in this way, though it is not typical of the
examples in the manual. Nor <br>
is it typical of the out-of-the-box Linux AMD configuration
in many distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defaults to
&lsquo;&lsquo;/tmp_mnt:/a:/.automount&rsquo;&rsquo; if not
set.</p>
