<p>instant(1) General Commands Manual instant(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
instant - manipulates ESIS from parsed SGML instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Synopsis <br>
instant [ -bhuvxHISW ] [ -t file] [ -s file] [ -c file] [ -o
file] [ -D variable=value ...] [ -i id] [ -l directory]
[file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
The instant program manipulates an SGML document instance in
a variety of ways, including translating into a form
suitable for a formatting application and printing
information <br>
about this instance. Input to instant is the output of
onsgmls, whose format is called Element Structure
Information Set (ESIS).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Flags <br>
The following are the possible command line options to
instant. Output is sent to the standard output, except where
otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t file <br>
Translate the SGML instance to another form, usually
suitable for a formatting application. The file is called a
translation spec, which specifies how the tags are to be
<br>
translated. See transpec(5). By convention, names for file
use the suffix .ts, for translation spec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s file <br>
Specifies a file of mappings for SDATA entities in the
instance. The file is of two columns, separated by one or
more tabs. Spaces can not be used as the separator <br>
because spaces are allowable as the content of the columns.
The first column is the entity data to map, the second is
the string that the data is mapped to. The entity <br>
data is typically what is found in public ISO entity sets,
such as the General Technical and Publishing sets. The
mappings are specific to the formatting application <br>
used. For example, to map the em dash entity, [mdash ], in
the Publishing set to the TeX representation, the first
column would be [mdash ] and the second column ---. <br>
Lines beginning with a # are comments, and are ignored.
Empty lines are also ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c file <br>
Specifies a file of string mappings for characters in the
instance. The file is of two columns, separated by white
space. The first is the character to map, the second <br>
is the string that the character is mapped to. The mappings
are specific to the formatting application used. Lines
beginning with a # are comments, and are ignored. <br>
Empty lines are also ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d strip newline at the
beginning of data records</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f length <br>
Set the threshold for the length, in characters, of an
&lt;Entry&gt;, over which it is called a block of filled
text, to length.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o file <br>
Write all output (except error and warning messages) to file
file. By default, output goes to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a text representation
of the hierarchy of the instance elements. The deeper an
element is in the tree, the more it is indented. The data
content is not printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Print a summary of the usage
of each element in the instance. Information given includes
attributes, number of children, and depth in the
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Print some statistics about
element usage in the instance, including how often each
element is used and how much PCDATA is contained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Print the context of each
element in the instance, from each element to the root of
the document tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Validate the SGML instance
based on the set of constraints or descriptions in the
transpec file. This flags tells instant to turn off normal
output, leaving only diagnos&acirc; <br>
tics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l directory <br>
Try to read the translation specs or other files from in the
directory directory if not found in the current directory.
This is called the library directory. The envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable TPT_LIB may also be used to specify
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Interactive browser mode. The
user is prompted for actions, which include moving among and
examining the various nodes in the hierarchy of the
instance, displaying infor&acirc; <br>
mation about them, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I List the IDs of all elements
in the instance that have an ID. The format is more suitable
for other programs than humans. Lines show the ID, element
GI, filename, and <br>
line, separated by colons. (This depends on the -l option to
onsgmls which provide filenames and line numbers.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i id When translating the
instance, begin processing at the element whose ID is id
instead of the topmost element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D variable=value <br>
Define the variable variable with value value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Do not print warning
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Print a help message briefly
describing the options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Read the instance from the
file file. This is expected to be the output of the program
onsgmls. If not specified, instant reads the instance from
its standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases it makes no sense
to combine options. This is especially true if one of the
options is to perform a translation. No checking is done for
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Interactive Browser <br>
These are the commands to the interactive browser:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd args ... <br>
Change to a different element in the hierarchy. cd id id
will change to the element whose ID is id. cd N will change
to the Nth child element of the current element. <br>
Several values of N may be specified, so the program will
change to successively descending elements in the hierarchy.
The string .. may appear for N to move up a level <br>
in the hierarchy (like in a unix file system). A / may be
specified for N to change to the top of the hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cont Print the context of each
element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">data N Show the data content
(PCDATA, RCDATA, and DATA) of child node N.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">find spec <br>
Find paths to elements matching spec, where spec may be one
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parent gi <br>
Find all elements whose parent element is gi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">child gi <br>
Find all elements which have a child element gi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gi gi Find all elements whose
name is gi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">attr name value <br>
Find all elements that have a attribute name that have a
value value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">id ID Show location of element
whose ID is ID. If ID is ?, it will list all IDs with the
paths to them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ls List information about the
current element in the hierarchy. This includes element
name, line number in instance, context, attributes and their
values, child elements, <br>
data directly within this element, and the order of the
current element among its siblings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">q relation element <br>
Report whether or not the current element has the relation
relation to the named element element. Values of relation
are the same as for _followrel in transpec reference <br>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">stat Show statistics about the
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sum Show a tag usage summary
about the hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tran transpec outfile <br>
Write translated output using trans spec transpec to file
outfile. If outfile is not specified, output is sent to
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tree Print a textual
representation of the hierarchy of the instance, where
deeper elements are indented more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where Show current position in
the hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;control-D&gt; <br>
Exits the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The stat, sum, tree, cont
commands take an optional first argument (of any value),
which means to only consider the entire instance instead of
the hierarchy from the current ele&acirc; <br>
ment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
file.ts <br>
Translation specification file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.sdata <br>
SDATA entity mapping file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file.cmap <br>
Character mapping file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Related Information <br>

Language (SGML), ISO 8879.</p>
