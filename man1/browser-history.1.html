<p>BROWSER-HISTORY(1) General Commands Manual
BROWSER-HISTORY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
browser-history - external history of web browsers, such as
netscape</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
browser-history [ options ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Browser-History is a client-side X daemon maintaining a
browser-independent global history of all the web sites you
visited. Its usage is very simple, just put the following
line <br>
in your .xinitrc or your X start-up script: <br>
browser-history &amp; <br>
And open the file ~/.browser-history/history-log.html and
bookmark it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browser-history came from the
will to overcome a Netscape bug: there was no global
history, and if you close a window, its whole history is
lost. For people browsing lots of <br>
sites, having a possibility to track back where one has been
before means that you don&rsquo;t have to put everything in
your bookmarks file. If you are not sure if a site may be
worth <br>
remembering, don&rsquo;t add it in your bookmarks. If you
need it later, just browse your history files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Later, it came to our minds that
this also could be a valuable add-on to people writing
experimental browsers, so they don&rsquo;t have to add this
functionality to their browser <br>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Browser-history is a small and
efficient daemon. Real user services could be built on top
of the log files it maintains for more possibilities
(graphical representation, advanced <br>
search options, collective histories). It can be seen as a
quick-and-dirty hack wrt to the general solution of using a
personal proxy to provide this history and housekeeping <br>
facilities. But in the meantime, it is easy to use and it
works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION <br>
Browser-History spies your web browser and logs in
~/.browser-history/history-log.html all the URLs you went
through. You can then browse the log under Netscape or other
<br>
browsers via the URL:
file:~/.browser-history/history-log.html (replace the ~ by
your home directory). It tracks automagically all already
present browser windows, and all new <br>
ones created in the future. This program has no user
interface. It just appends information to a log file in html
format so you can browse it through a web browser. If more
that <br>
one hour has passed since last entry, it draws an horizontal
lines, and adds H1 headers to delimit new days. Each week
(Sunday mornings), it archives the week history, compresses
<br>
it by gzip (that you must have in your path), and starts a
new history with links to the older ones. To make room you
can just remove the obsolete history files. You can search
<br>
files for string XXX in shell via: <br>
zgrep XXX ~/.browser-history/*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This version (2.6) works with
Netscape, Arena and Amaya.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URLs can be excluded from
logging by putting them, one per line in the file
~/.browser-history/history-log.exclude , then, if an URL
begins with a line from this file, it is not <br>
logged. In this file, empty lines or lines beginning by #
are comments This file is read once at startup, and re-read
when receiving the signal 1. e.g:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># We exclude local files <br>
file: <br>
# Exclude search engines... <br>
http://home.netscape.com <br>
http://guide.infoseek.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When browser-history is run, it
looks if another one is running, and by default it kills the
previous one if it is an older version. Otherwise, it the
new one is the same version <br>
number or older, it just aborts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
All options can be given by their first letter: you can
specify either -verbose or -v, but you cannot group options,
e.g. you must say -v -k , but not -vk</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-display display_name <br>
Specifies X display, otherwise contents of $DISPLAY is
used</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-verbose <br>
outputs information on what it is doing. useful for
debug.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Version <br>
prints version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logdir directory <br>
which directory to store files into? defaults to
~/.browser-history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gzip gzip_filename <br>
the complete path to the gzip compressor. Defaults to
&quot;gzip&quot;. E.g: <br>
-gzip /usr/gnu/bin/gzip</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-seconds delay <br>
if two entries are made are more than delay seconds apart,
an horizontal rule will separate them, else just a simple
line break. Defaults to one hour (3600).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-replace <br>
If there is an already running browser-history on the
display, aborts. Default is to replace it only if the
version is older than ours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-noreplace <br>
If there is an already running browser-history on the
display, aborts. Default is to replace it only if the
version is older than ours.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kill If there is an already
running browser-history on the display, kills it, then
terminates immediately in all cases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-DontGrab <br>
Never Grab the X Server, which might cause deadlocks while
debugging, when browser-history or gdb tries to print on the
grabbed xterm or emacs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-checkpoint <br>
Cause the currently running instance of browser-history to
save a list of all the URLs and their titles that are
currently being viewed by a browser-history compatible <br>
browser to the normal history file as a
&quot;checkpoint&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOG FILE FORMAT <br>
A log file can have some decorative HTML to represent days,
but each entry has the form: (on a single line since version
2.4) <br>
separator <br>
&lt;b&gt;name&lt;/b&gt; <br>
&lt;a href=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; <br>
YYYY/MM/DD-HH:MN:SS &lt;small&gt;windowid&lt;/small&gt; <br>
where the following items are: <br>
separator: either &lt;hr&gt; or &lt;br&gt; <br>
name: the name of the document (window title) <br>
URL: its URL <br>
YYYY/MM/DD-HH:MN:SS: year, month number, day number, hour,
<br>
minutes, seconds. (2-digit numbers) <br>
windowid: the X window ID of the browser window, in
hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Before version 2.4, the 4
sub-parts were separated by newlines, but since 2.4, they
are only blank-separated to ease searching for URL in log
files via &quot;grep&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: Before version 2.5, the
year was stored in 2 digits. Now it is stored in 4 (or more
:-) digits, to fix this Y2K bug</p>
