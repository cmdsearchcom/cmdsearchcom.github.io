<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pkcs15-init - smart card personalization utility</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pkcs15-init [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The pkcs15-init utility can be used to create a PKCS #15
structure on a smart card, and add key or certificate
objects. Details of the structure that will be created are
<br>
controlled via profiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The profile used by default is
pkcs15. Alternative profiles can be specified via the -p
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PIN USAGE <br>
pkcs15-init can be used to create a PKCS #15 structure on
your smart card, create PINs, and install keys and
certificates on the card. This process is also called <br>
personalization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An OpenSC card can have one
security officer PIN, and zero or more user PINs. PIN stands
for Personal Identification Number, and is a secret code you
need to present to the card <br>
before being allowed to perform certain operations, such as
using one of the stored RSA keys to sign a document, or
modifying the card itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usually, PINs are a sequence of
decimal digits, but some cards will accept arbitrary ASCII
characters. Be aware however that using characters other
than digits will make the card <br>
unusable with PIN pad readers, because those usually have
keys for entering digits only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The security officer (SO) PIN is
special; it is used to protect meta data information on the
card, such as the PKCS #15 structure itself. Setting the SO
PIN is optional, because <br>
the worst that can usually happen is that someone finding
your card can mess it up. To extract any of your secret keys
stored on the card, an attacker will still need your user
<br>
PIN, at least for the default OpenSC profiles. However, it
is possible to create card profiles that will allow the
security officer to override user PINs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each PIN, you can specify a
PUK (also called unblock PIN). The PUK can be used to
overwrite or unlock a PIN if too many incorrect values have
been entered in a row.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some cards that use the
PKCS#15 emulation, the attributes of private objects are
protected and cannot be parsed without authentication
(usually with User PIN). This <br>
authentication need to be done immediately after the card
binding. In such cases --verify-pin has to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MODES OF OPERATION <br>
Initialization <br>
This is the first step during card personalization, and will
create the basic files on the card. To create the initial
PKCS #15 structure, invoke the utility as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will then be asked for the
security officer PIN and PUK. Simply pressing return at the
SO PIN prompt will skip installation of an SO PIN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the card supports it, you
should erase the contents of the card with pkcs15-init
--erase-card before creating the PKCS#15 structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User PIN Installation <br>
Before installing any user objects such as private keys, you
need at least one PIN to protect these objects. you can do
this using</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkcs15-init --store-pin --id
&quot; nn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where nn is a PKCS #15 ID in
hexadecimal notation. Common values are 01, 02, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Entering the command above will
ask you for the user&rsquo;s PIN and PUK. If you do not wish
to install an unblock PIN, simply press return at the PUK
prompt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To set a label for this PIN
object (which can be used by applications to display a
meaningful prompt to the user), use the --label command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key generation <br>
pkcs15-init lets you generate a new key and store it on the
card. You can do this using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkcs15-init --generate-key
&quot; keyspec &quot; --auth-id &quot; nn</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where keyspec describes the
algorithm and length of the key to be created, such as
rsa/512. This will create a 512 bit RSA key. Currently, only
RSA key generation is supported. <br>
Note that cards usually support just a few different key
lengths. Almost all cards will support 512 and 1024 bit
keys, some will support 768 or 2048 as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nn is the ID of a user PIN
installed previously, e.g. 01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to storing the
private portion of the key on the card, pkcs15-init will
also store the the public portion of the key as a PKCS #15
public key object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Private Key Upload <br>
You can use a private key generated by other means and
upload it to the card. For instance, to upload a private key
contained in a file named okir.pem, which is in PEM format,
<br>
you would use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkcs15-init --store-private-key
okir.pem --id 45 --auth-id 01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to storing the
private portion of the key on the card, pkcs15-init will
also store the the public portion of the key as a PKCS #15
public key object.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that usage of --id option
in the pkcs15-init commands to generate or to import a new
key is deprecated. Better practice is to let the middleware
to derive the identifier <br>
from the key material. (SHA1(modulus) for RSA, SHA1(pub) for
DSA, ...). This allows easily set up relation between
&rsquo;related&rsquo; objects (private/public keys and
certificates).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to the PEM key file
format, pkcs15-init also supports DER encoded keys, and PKCS
#12 files. The latter is the file format used by Netscape
Navigator (among others) <br>
when exporting certificates to a file. A PKCS #12 file
usually contains the X.509 certificate corresponding to the
private key. If that is the case, pkcs15-init will store the
<br>
certificate instead of the public key portion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Public Key Upload <br>
You can also upload individual public keys to the card using
the --store-public-key option, which takes a filename as an
argument. This file is supposed to contain the public <br>
key. If you don&rsquo;t specify a key file format using the
--format option, pkcs15-init will assume PEM format. The
only other supported public key file format is DER.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since the corresponding public
keys are always uploaded automatically when generating a new
key, or when uploading a private key, you will probably use
this option only very <br>
rarely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certificate Upload <br>
You can upload certificates to the card using the
--store-certificate option, which takes a filename as an
argument. This file is supposed to contain the PEM encoded
X.509 <br>
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Uploading PKCS #12 bags <br>
Most browsers nowadays use PKCS #12 format files when you
ask them to export your key and certificate to a file.
pkcs15-init is capable of parsing these files, and storing
their <br>
contents on the card in a single operation. This works just
like storing a private key, except that you need to specify
the file format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pkcs15-init --store-private-key
okir.p12 --format pkcs12 --auth-id 01</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will install the private
key contained in the file okir.p12, and protect it with the
PIN referenced by authentication ID 01. It will also store
any X.509 certificates <br>
contained in the file, which is usually the user certificate
that goes with the key, as well as the CA certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--card-profile name, -c name <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to load the specified card profile option.
You will rarely need this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-pkcs15, -C <br>
This tells pkcs15-init to create a PKCS #15 structure on the
card, and initialize any PINs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--erase-card, -E <br>
This will erase the card prior to creating the PKCS #15
structure, if the card supports it. If the card does not
support erasing, pkcs15-init will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--generate-key keyspec, -G
keyspec <br>
Tells the card to generate new key and store it on the card.
keyspec consists of an algorithm name (currently, the only
supported name is RSA), optionally followed by a <br>
slash and the length of the key in bits. It is a good idea
to specify the key ID along with this command, using the id
option, otherwise an intrinsic ID will be calculated <br>
from the key material. Look the description of the
&rsquo;pkcs15-id-style&rsquo; attribut in the
&rsquo;pkcs15.profile&rsquo; for the details about the
algorithm used to calculate intrinsic ID. For <br>
the multi-application cards the target PKCS#15 application
can be specified by the hexadecimal AID value of the aid
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--options-file filename <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to read additional options from filename.
The file is supposed to contain one long option per line,
without the leading dashes, for instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pin frank <br>
puk zappa</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can specify --options-file
several times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--pin, --puk --so-pin, --so-puk,
<br>
These options can be used to specify PIN/PUK values on the
command line. Note that on most operation systems, any user
can display the command line of any process on the <br>
system using utilities such as ps(1). Therefore, you should
use these options only on a secured system, or in an options
file specified with --options-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--profile name, -p name <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to load the specified general profile.
Currently, the only application profile defined is pkcs15,
but you can write your own profiles and specify them using
<br>
this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The profile name can be combined
with one or more profile options, which slightly modify the
profile&rsquo;s behavior. For instance, the default OpenSC
profile supports the openpin <br>
option, which installs a single PIN during card
initialization. This PIN is then used both as the SO PIN as
well as the user PIN for all keys stored on the card.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Profile name and options are
separated by a + character, as in pkcs15+onepin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--store-certificate filename, -X
filename <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to store the certificate given in filename
on the card, creating a certificate object with the ID
specified via the --id option. Without supplied ID an <br>
intrisic ID will be calculated from the certificate&rsquo;s
public key. Look the description of the
&rsquo;pkcs15-id-style&rsquo; attribut in the
&rsquo;pkcs15.profile&rsquo; for the details about the <br>
algorithm used to calculate intrinsic ID. The file is
assumed to contain the PEM encoded certificate. For the
multi-application cards the target application can be
specified <br>
by the hexadecimal AID value of the aid option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--store-public-key filename <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to download the specified public key to
the card and create a public key object with the key ID
specified via the --id. By default, the file is assumed to
<br>
contain the key in PEM format. Alternative formats can be
specified using --format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--store-private-key filename, -S
filename <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to download the specified private key to
the card. This command will also create a public key object
containing the public key portion. By default, the file <br>
is assumed to contain the key in PEM format. Alternative
formats can be specified using --format. It is a good idea
to specify the key ID along with this command, using the
<br>
--id option, otherwise an intrinsic ID will be calculated
from the key material. Look the description of the
&rsquo;pkcs15-id-style&rsquo; attribut in the
&rsquo;pkcs15.profile&rsquo; for the <br>
details about the algorithm used to calculate intrinsic ID.
For the multi-application cards the target PKCS#15
application can be specified by the hexadecimal AID value of
<br>
the aid option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--update-certificate filename,
-U filename <br>
Tells pkcs15-init to update the certificate object with the
ID specified via the --id option with the certificate in
filename. The file is assumed to contain a PEM encoded <br>
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pay extra attention when
updating mail decryption certificates, as missing
certificates can render e-mail messages unreadable!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-default-transport-keys, -T
<br>
Tells pkcs15-init to not ask for the transport keys and use
default keys, as known by the card driver.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verbose, -v <br>
Causes pkcs15-init to be more verbose. Specify this flag
several times to enable debug output in the OpenSC
library.</p>
