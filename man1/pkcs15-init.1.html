pkcs15-init - smart card personalization utility
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 12.00ex; text-indent: -12.00ex;"><b>pkcs15-init</b>
  [ <i>OPTIONS</i>]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>pkcs15-init</b> utility can be used to create a PKCS #15 structure on a
  smart card, and add key or certificate objects. Details of the structure that
  will be created are controlled via profiles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The profile used by default is <b>pkcs15</b>. Alternative profiles can be
  specified via the <b>-p</b> switch.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PIN_USAGE"><a class="selflink" href="#PIN_USAGE">PIN
  USAGE</a></h1>
<b>pkcs15-init</b> can be used to create a PKCS #15 structure on your smart
  card, create PINs, and install keys and certificates on the card. This process
  is also called <i>personalization</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An OpenSC card can have one security officer PIN, and zero or more user PINs.
  PIN stands for Personal Identification Number, and is a secret code you need
  to present to the card before being allowed to perform certain operations,
  such as using one of the stored RSA keys to sign a document, or modifying the
  card itself.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Usually, PINs are a sequence of decimal digits, but some cards will accept
  arbitrary ASCII characters. Be aware however that using characters other than
  digits will make the card unusable with PIN pad readers, because those usually
  have keys for entering digits only.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The security officer (SO) PIN is special; it is used to protect meta data
  information on the card, such as the PKCS #15 structure itself. Setting the SO
  PIN is optional, because the worst that can usually happen is that someone
  finding your card can mess it up. To extract any of your secret keys stored on
  the card, an attacker will still need your user PIN, at least for the default
  OpenSC profiles. However, it is possible to create card profiles that will
  allow the security officer to override user PINs.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each PIN, you can specify a PUK (also called <i>unblock PIN</i>). The PUK
  can be used to overwrite or unlock a PIN if too many incorrect values have
  been entered in a row.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For some cards that use the PKCS#15 emulation, the attributes of private objects
  are protected and cannot be parsed without authentication (usually with User
  PIN). This authentication need to be done immediately after the card binding.
  In such cases <b>--verify-pin</b> has to be used.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODES_OF_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#MODES_OF_OPERATION">MODES
  OF OPERATION</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Initialization"><a class="selflink" href="#Initialization">Initialization</a></h2>
This is the first step during card personalization, and will create the basic
  files on the card. To create the initial PKCS #15 structure, invoke the
  utility as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pkcs15-init --create-pkcs15</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
You will then be asked for the security officer PIN and PUK. Simply pressing
  return at the SO PIN prompt will skip installation of an SO PIN.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the card supports it, you should erase the contents of the card with
  <b>pkcs15-init --erase-card</b> before creating the PKCS#15 structure.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="User_PIN_Installation"><a class="selflink" href="#User_PIN_Installation">User
  PIN Installation</a></h2>
Before installing any user objects such as private keys, you need at least one
  PIN to protect these objects. you can do this using
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pkcs15-init --store-pin --id &quot; nn</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>nn</i> is a PKCS #15 ID in hexadecimal notation. Common values are 01,
  02, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Entering the command above will ask you for the user's PIN and PUK. If you do
  not wish to install an unblock PIN, simply press return at the PUK prompt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To set a label for this PIN object (which can be used by applications to display
  a meaningful prompt to the user), use the <b>--label</b> command line option.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Key_generation"><a class="selflink" href="#Key_generation">Key
  generation</a></h2>
<b>pkcs15-init</b> lets you generate a new key and store it on the card. You can
  do this using:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pkcs15-init --generate-key &quot; keyspec &quot; --auth-id &quot; nn</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where <i>keyspec</i> describes the algorithm and length of the key to be
  created, such as rsa/512. This will create a 512 bit RSA key. Currently, only
  RSA key generation is supported. Note that cards usually support just a few
  different key lengths. Almost all cards will support 512 and 1024 bit keys,
  some will support 768 or 2048 as well.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>nn</i> is the ID of a user PIN installed previously, e.g. 01.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to storing the private portion of the key on the card,
  <b>pkcs15-init</b> will also store the the public portion of the key as a PKCS
  #15 public key object.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Private_Key_Upload"><a class="selflink" href="#Private_Key_Upload">Private
  Key Upload</a></h2>
You can use a private key generated by other means and upload it to the card.
  For instance, to upload a private key contained in a file named okir.pem,
  which is in PEM format, you would use
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pkcs15-init --store-private-key okir.pem --id 45 --auth-id 01</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to storing the private portion of the key on the card,
  <b>pkcs15-init</b> will also store the the public portion of the key as a PKCS
  #15 public key object.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that usage of <b>--id</b> option in the <b>pkcs15-init</b> commands to
  generate or to import a new key is deprecated. Better practice is to let the
  middleware to derive the identifier from the key material. (SHA1(modulus) for
  RSA, SHA1(pub) for DSA, ...). This allows easily set up relation between
  'related' objects (private/public keys and certificates).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the PEM key file format, <b>pkcs15-init</b> also supports DER
  encoded keys, and PKCS #12 files. The latter is the file format used by
  Netscape Navigator (among others) when exporting certificates to a file. A
  PKCS #12 file usually contains the X.509 certificate corresponding to the
  private key. If that is the case, <b>pkcs15-init</b> will store the
  certificate instead of the public key portion.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Public_Key_Upload"><a class="selflink" href="#Public_Key_Upload">Public
  Key Upload</a></h2>
You can also upload individual public keys to the card using the
  <b>--store-public-key</b> option, which takes a filename as an argument. This
  file is supposed to contain the public key. If you don't specify a key file
  format using the <b>--format</b> option, <b>pkcs15-init</b> will assume PEM
  format. The only other supported public key file format is DER.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Since the corresponding public keys are always uploaded automatically when
  generating a new key, or when uploading a private key, you will probably use
  this option only very rarely.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Certificate_Upload"><a class="selflink" href="#Certificate_Upload">Certificate
  Upload</a></h2>
You can upload certificates to the card using the <b>--store-certificate</b>
  option, which takes a filename as an argument. This file is supposed to
  contain the PEM encoded X.509 certificate.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Uploading_PKCS_#12_bags"><a class="selflink" href="#Uploading_PKCS_#12_bags">Uploading
  PKCS #12 bags</a></h2>
Most browsers nowadays use PKCS #12 format files when you ask them to export
  your key and certificate to a file. <b>pkcs15-init</b> is capable of parsing
  these files, and storing their contents on the card in a single operation.
  This works just like storing a private key, except that you need to specify
  the file format:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pkcs15-init --store-private-key okir.p12 --format pkcs12 --auth-id 01</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
This will install the private key contained in the file okir.p12, and protect it
  with the PIN referenced by authentication ID 01. It will also store any X.509
  certificates contained in the file, which is usually the user certificate that
  goes with the key, as well as the CA certificate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>--card-profile</b> <i>name</i>, <b>-c</b> <i>name</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to load the specified
  card profile option. You will rarely need this option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--create-pkcs15</b>, <b>-C</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to create a PKCS
  #15 structure on the card, and initialize any PINs.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--erase-card</b>, <b>-E</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This will erase the card prior to creating the
  PKCS #15 structure, if the card supports it. If the card does not support
  erasing, <b>pkcs15-init</b> will fail.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--generate-key</b> <i>keyspec</i>, <b>-G</b> <i>keyspec</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells the card to generate new key and store
  it on the card. <i>keyspec</i> consists of an algorithm name (currently, the
  only supported name is <b>RSA</b>), optionally followed by a slash and the
  length of the key in bits. It is a good idea to specify the key ID along with
  this command, using the <b>id</b> option, otherwise an intrinsic ID will be
  calculated from the key material. Look the description of the
  'pkcs15-id-style' attribut in the 'pkcs15.profile' for the details about the
  algorithm used to calculate intrinsic ID. For the multi-application cards the
  target PKCS#15 application can be specified by the hexadecimal AID value of
  the <b>aid</b> option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--options-file</b> <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to read additional
  options from <i>filename</i>. The file is supposed to contain one long option
  per line, without the leading dashes, for instance:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">
<pre>
	pin		frank
	puk		zappa
</pre>
</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can specify <b>--options-file</b> several times.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--pin</b>, <b>--puk</b> <b>--so-pin</b>, <b>--so-puk</b>,
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">These options can be used to specify PIN/PUK
  values on the command line. Note that on most operation systems, any user can
  display the command line of any process on the system using utilities such as
  <b>ps(1)</b>. Therefore, you should use these options only on a secured
  system, or in an options file specified with <b>--options-file</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--profile</b> <i>name</i>, <b>-p</b> <i>name</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to load the specified
  general profile. Currently, the only application profile defined is pkcs15,
  but you can write your own profiles and specify them using this option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The profile name can be combined with one or more profile options, which
  slightly modify the profile's behavior. For instance, the default OpenSC
  profile supports the <b>openpin</b> option, which installs a single PIN during
  card initialization. This PIN is then used both as the SO PIN as well as the
  user PIN for all keys stored on the card.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Profile name and options are separated by a + character, as in
  pkcs15+onepin.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--store-certificate</b> <i>filename</i>, <b>-X</b> <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to store the
  certificate given in <b>filename</b> on the card, creating a certificate
  object with the ID specified via the <b>--id</b> option. Without supplied ID
  an intrisic ID will be calculated from the certificate's public key. Look the
  description of the 'pkcs15-id-style' attribut in the 'pkcs15.profile' for the
  details about the algorithm used to calculate intrinsic ID. The file is
  assumed to contain the PEM encoded certificate. For the multi-application
  cards the target application can be specified by the hexadecimal AID value of
  the <b>aid</b> option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--store-public-key</b> <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to download the
  specified public key to the card and create a public key object with the key
  ID specified via the <b>--id</b>. By default, the file is assumed to contain
  the key in PEM format. Alternative formats can be specified using
  <b>--format</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--store-private-key</b> <i>filename</i>, <b>-S</b> <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to download the
  specified private key to the card. This command will also create a public key
  object containing the public key portion. By default, the file is assumed to
  contain the key in PEM format. Alternative formats can be specified using
  <b>--format</b>. It is a good idea to specify the key ID along with this
  command, using the <b>--id</b> option, otherwise an intrinsic ID will be
  calculated from the key material. Look the description of the
  'pkcs15-id-style' attribut in the 'pkcs15.profile' for the details about the
  algorithm used to calculate intrinsic ID. For the multi-application cards the
  target PKCS#15 application can be specified by the hexadecimal AID value of
  the <b>aid</b> option.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--update-certificate</b> <i>filename</i>, <b>-U</b> <i>filename</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to update the
  certificate object with the ID specified via the <b>--id</b> option with the
  certificate in <b>filename</b>. The file is assumed to contain a PEM encoded
  certificate.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Pay extra attention when updating mail decryption certificates, as missing
  certificates can render e-mail messages unreadable!</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--use-default-transport-keys</b>, <b>-T</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Tells <b>pkcs15-init</b> to not ask for the
  transport keys and use default keys, as known by the card driver.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Causes <b>pkcs15-init</b> to be more verbose.
  Specify this flag several times to enable debug output in the OpenSC
  library.</div>
