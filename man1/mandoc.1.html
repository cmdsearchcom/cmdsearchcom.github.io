<p>MANDOC(1) General Commands Manual MANDOC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mandoc - format and display UNIX manuals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mandoc [-acfhkl] [-Ios=name] [-Kencoding] [-mformat]
[-Ooption] [-Toutput] [-Wlevel] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The mandoc utility formats UNIX manual pages for
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, mandoc reads mdoc(7)
or man(7) text from stdin, implying -mandoc, and produces
-Tlocale output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a If the standard output is a
terminal device and -c is not specified, use more(1) to
paginate the output, just like man(1) would.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Copy the formatted manual
pages to the standard output without using more(1) to
paginate them. This is the default. It can be specified to
override -a.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f A synonym for whatis(1). This
overrides any earlier -k and -l options. -Ios=name Override
the default operating system name for the mdoc(7)
&acirc;Os&acirc; and for the man(7) &acirc;TH&acirc; <br>
macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Display only the SYNOPSIS
lines. Implies -c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Kencoding <br>
Specify the input encoding. The supported encoding arguments
are us-ascii, iso-8859-1, and utf-8. If not specified,
autodetection uses the first match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf-8 if the first three bytes
of the input file are the UTF-8 byte order mark (BOM,
0xefbbbf)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">encoding if the first or second
line of the input file matches the emacs mode line
format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">utf-8 if the first non-ASCII
byte in the file introduces a valid UTF-8 sequence</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iso-8859-1 otherwise <br>
-k A synonym for apropos(1). This overrides any earlier -f
and -l options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l A synonym for -a. Also
reverts any earlier -f and -k options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-mformat <br>
Input format. See Input Formats for available formats.
Defaults to -mandoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ooption <br>
Comma-separated output options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Toutput <br>
Output format. See Output Formats for available formats.
Defaults to -Tlocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Wlevel Specify the minimum
message level to be reported on the standard error output
and to affect the exit status. The level can be warning,
error, or unsupp; all is an alias <br>
for warning. By default, mandoc is silent. See EXIT STATUS
and DIAGNOSTICS for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special option -Wstop tells
mandoc to exit after parsing a file that causes warnings or
errors of at least the requested level. No formatted output
will be produced <br>
from that file. If both a level and stop are requested, they
can be joined with a comma, for example -Werror,stop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file Read input from zero or
more files. If unspecified, reads from stdin. If multiple
files are specified, mandoc will halt with the first failed
parse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In -f and -k mode, mandoc also
supports the options -CMmOSsw described in the apropos(1)
manual.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input Formats <br>
The mandoc utility accepts mdoc(7) and man(7) input with
-mdoc and -man, respectively. The mdoc(7) format is strongly
recommended; man(7) should only be used for legacy
manuals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A third option, -mandoc, which
is also the default, determines encoding on-the-fly: if the
first non-comment macro is &acirc;Dd&acirc; or
&acirc;Dt&acirc;, the mdoc(7) parser is used; otherwise, the
<br>
man(7) parser is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple files are specified
with -mandoc, each has its file-type determined this way. If
multiple files are specified and -mdoc or -man is specified,
then this format is <br>
used exclusively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output Formats <br>
The mandoc utility accepts the following -T arguments, which
correspond to output modes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tascii Produce 7-bit ASCII
output. See ASCII Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Thtml Produce HTML5, CSS1, and
MathML output. See HTML Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tlint Parse only: produce no
output. Implies -Wwarning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tlocale <br>
Encode output using the current locale. This is the default.
See Locale Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tman Produce man(7) format
output. See Man Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tpdf Produce PDF output. See
PDF Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tps Produce PostScript output.
See PostScript Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Ttree Produce an indented parse
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Tutf8 Encode output in the
UTF-8 multi-byte format. See UTF-8 Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Txhtml This is a synonym for
-Thtml.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple input files are
specified, these will be processed by the corresponding
filter in-order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ASCII Output <br>
Output produced by -Tascii is rendered in standard 7-bit
ASCII documented in ascii(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Font styles are applied by using
back-spaced encoding such that an underlined character
&acirc;c&acirc; is rendered as &acirc;_c&acirc;, where
&acirc;&acirc; is the back-space character number 8. <br>
Emboldened characters are rendered as &acirc;cc&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The special characters
documented in mandoc_char(7) are rendered best-effort in an
ASCII equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Output width is limited to 78
visible columns unless literal input lines exceed this
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following -O arguments are
accepted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">indent=indent <br>
The left margin for normal text is set to indent blank
characters instead of the default of five for mdoc(7) and
seven for man(7). Increasing this is not recommended; it
<br>
may result in degraded formatting, for example overfull
lines or ugly line breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">width=width <br>
The output width is set to width, which will normalise to
&acirc;&yen;58.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTML Output <br>
Output produced by -Thtml conforms to HTML5 using optional
self-closing tags. Default styles use only CSS1. Equations
rendered from eqn(7) blocks use MathML.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The example.style.css file
documents style-sheet classes available for customising
output. If a style-sheet is not specified with -Ostyle,
-Thtml defaults to simple output (via <br>
an embedded style-sheet) readable in any graphical or
text-based web browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special characters are rendered
in decimal-encoded UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following -O arguments are
accepted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fragment <br>
Omit the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration and the &lt;html&gt;,
&lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; elements and only emit the
subtree below the &lt;body&gt; element. The style argument
will be ignored. This <br>
is useful when embedding manual content within existing
documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">includes=fmt <br>
The string fmt, for example, ../src/%I.html, is used as a
template for linked header files (usually via the
&acirc;In&acirc; macro). Instances of &acirc;%I&acirc; are
replaced with the include <br>
filename. The default is not to present a hyperlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">man=fmt <br>
The string fmt, for example, ../html%S/%N.%S.html, is used
as a template for linked manuals (usually via the
&acirc;Xr&acirc; macro). Instances of &acirc;%N&acirc; and
&acirc;%S&acirc; are replaced with <br>
the linked manual&rsquo;s name and section, respectively. If
no section is included, section 1 is assumed. The default is
not to present a hyperlink.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">style=style.css <br>
The file style.css is used for an external style-sheet. This
must be a valid absolute or relative URI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locale Output <br>
Locale-depending output encoding is triggered with -Tlocale.
This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is not available on
all systems: systems without locale support, or those whose
internal representation is not natively UCS-4, will fall
back to -Tascii. See ASCII <br>
Output for font style specification and available
command-line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Man Output <br>
Translate input format into man(7) output format. This is
useful for distributing manual sources to legacy systems
lacking mdoc(7) formatters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If mdoc(7) is passed as input,
it is translated into man(7). If the input format is man(7),
the input is copied to the output, expanding any roff(7)
&acirc;so&acirc; requests. The parser <br>
is also run, and as usual, the -W level controls which
DIAGNOSTICS are displayed before copying the input to the
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PDF Output <br>
PDF-1.1 output may be generated by -Tpdf. See PostScript
Output for -O arguments and defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PostScript Output <br>
PostScript &quot;Adobe-3.0&quot; Level-2 pages may be
generated by -Tps. Output pages default to letter sized and
are rendered in the Times font family, 11-point. Margins are
calculated <br>
as 1/9 the page length and width. Line-height is 1.4m.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Special characters are rendered
as in ASCII Output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following -O arguments are
accepted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">paper=name <br>
The paper size name may be one of a3, a4, a5, legal, or
letter. You may also manually specify dimensions as NNxNN,
width by height in millimetres. If an unknown value <br>
is encountered, letter is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UTF-8 Output <br>
Use -Tutf8 to force a UTF-8 locale. See Locale Output for
details and options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
MANPAGER Any non-empty value of the environment variable
MANPAGER will be used instead of the standard pagination
program, more(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PAGER Specifies the pagination
program to use when MANPAGER is not defined. If neither
PAGER nor MANPAGER is defined, /usr/bin/more -s will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The mandoc utility exits with one of the following values,
controlled by the message level associated with the -W
option:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">0 No warnings or errors
occurred, or those that did were ignored because they were
lower than the requested level. <br>
2 At least one warning occurred, but no error, and -Wwarning
was specified. <br>
3 At least one parsing error occurred, but no unsupported
feature was encountered, and -Werror or -Wwarning was
specified. <br>
4 At least one unsupported feature was encountered, and
-Wunsupp, -Werror or -Wwarning was specified. <br>
5 Invalid command line arguments were specified. No input
files have been read. <br>
6 An operating system error occurred, for example exhaustion
of memory, file descriptors, or process table entries. Such
errors cause mandoc to exit at once, possibly in <br>
the middle of parsing or formatting a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that selecting -Tlint
output mode implies -Wwarning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
To page manuals to the terminal:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mandoc -Wall,stop mandoc.1
2&gt;&amp;1 | less <br>
$ mandoc mandoc.1 mdoc.3 mdoc.7 | less</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce HTML manuals with
style.css as the style-sheet:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mandoc -Thtml
-Ostyle=style.css mdoc.7 &gt; mdoc.7.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To check over a large set of
manuals:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mandoc -Tlint &lsquo;find
/usr/src -name [1-9]&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce a series of
PostScript manuals for A4 paper:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mandoc -Tps -Opaper=a4 mdoc.7
man.7 &gt; manuals.ps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Convert a modern mdoc(7) manual
to the older man(7) format, for use on systems lacking an
mdoc(7) parser:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ mandoc -Tman foo.mdoc &gt;
foo.man</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
Messages displayed by mandoc follow this format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mandoc: file:line:column: level:
message: macro args</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Line and column numbers start at
1. Both are omitted for messages referring to an input file
as a whole. Macro names and arguments are omitted where
meaningless. Fatal <br>
messages about invalid command line arguments or operating
system errors, for example when memory is exhausted, may
also omit the file and level fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message levels have the
following meanings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsupp An input file uses
unsupported low-level roff(7) features. The output may be
incomplete and/or misformatted, so using GNU troff instead
of mandoc to process the file <br>
may be preferable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">error An input file contains
invalid syntax that cannot be safely interpreted. By
discarding part of the input or inserting missing tokens,
the parser is able to continue, <br>
and the error does not prevent generation of formatted
output, but typically, preparing that output involves
information loss, broken document structure or unintended
<br>
formatting, no matter whether mandoc or GNU troff is used.
In many cases, the output of mandoc and GNU troff is
identical, but in some, mandoc is more resilient than <br>
GNU troff with respect to malformed input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Non-existent or unreadable input
files are also reported on the error level. In that case,
the parser cannot even be started and no output is produced
from those input <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">warning An input file uses
obsolete, discouraged or non-portable syntax. All the same,
the meaning of the input is unambiguous and a correct
rendering can be produced. <br>
Documents causing warnings may render poorly when using
other formatting tools instead of mandoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Messages of the warning, error,
and unsupp levels except those about non-existent or
unreadable input files are hidden unless their level, or a
lower level, is requested using a <br>
-W option or -Tlint output mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings related to the document
prologue <br>
missing manual title, using UNTITLED <br>
(mdoc) A Dt macro has no arguments, or there is no Dt macro
before the first non-prologue macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing manual title, using
&quot;&quot; <br>
(man) There is no TH macro, or it has no arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">lower case character in document
title <br>
(mdoc, man) The title is still used as given in the Dt or TH
macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing manual section, using
&quot;&quot; <br>
(mdoc, man) A Dt or TH macro lacks the mandatory section
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknown manual section <br>
(mdoc) The section number in a Dt line is invalid, but still
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing date, using
today&rsquo;s date <br>
(mdoc, man) The document was parsed as mdoc(7) and it has no
Dd macro, or the Dd macro has no arguments or only empty
arguments; or the document was parsed as man(7) and it has
<br>
no TH macro, or the TH macro has less than three arguments
or its third argument is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cannot parse date, using it
verbatim <br>
(mdoc, man) The date given in a Dd or TH macro does not
follow the conventional format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing Os macro, using
&quot;&quot; <br>
(mdoc) The default or current system is not shown in this
case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate prologue macro <br>
(mdoc) One of the prologue macros occurs more than once. The
last instance overrides all previous ones.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">late prologue macro <br>
(mdoc) A Dd or Os macro occurs after some non-prologue
macro, but still takes effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping late title macro <br>
(mdoc) The Dt macro appears after the first non-prologue
macro. Traditional formatters cannot handle this because
they write the page header before parsing the document body.
<br>
Even though this technical restriction does not apply to
mandoc, traditional semantics is preserved. The late macro
is discarded including its arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">prologue macros out of order
<br>
(mdoc) The prologue macros are not given in the conventional
order Dd, Dt, Os. All three macros are used even when given
in another order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings regarding document
structure <br>
.so is fragile, better use ln(1) <br>
(roff) Including files only works when the parser program
runs with the correct current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no document body <br>
(mdoc, man) The document body contains neither text nor
macros. An empty document is shown, consisting only of a
header and a footer line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">content before first section
header <br>
(mdoc, man) Some macros or text precede the first Sh or SH
section header. The offending macros and text are parsed and
added to the top level of the syntax tree, outside any <br>
section block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">first section is not NAME <br>
(mdoc) The argument of the first Sh macro is not
&acirc;NAME&acirc;. This may confuse makewhatis(8) and
apropos(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME section without name <br>
(mdoc) The NAME section does not contain any Nm child
macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME section without description
<br>
(mdoc) The NAME section lacks the mandatory Nd child
macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">description not at the end of
NAME <br>
(mdoc) The NAME section does contain an Nd child macro, but
other content follows it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bad NAME section content <br>
(mdoc) The NAME section contains plain text or macros other
than Nm and Nd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing description line, using
&quot;&quot; <br>
(mdoc) The Nd macro lacks the required argument. The title
line of the manual will end after the dash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sections out of conventional
order <br>
(mdoc) A standard section occurs after another section it
usually precedes. All section titles are used as given, and
the order of sections is not changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate section title <br>
(mdoc) The same standard section title occurs more than
once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unexpected section <br>
(mdoc) A standard section header occurs in a section of the
manual where it normally isn&rsquo;t useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unusual Xr order <br>
(mdoc) In the SEE ALSO section, an Xr macro with a lower
section number follows one with a higher number, or two Xr
macros refering to the same section are out of alphabetical
<br>
order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unusual Xr punctuation <br>
(mdoc) In the SEE ALSO section, punctuation between two Xr
macros differs from a single comma, or there is trailing
punctuation after the last Xr macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTHORS section without An macro
<br>
(mdoc) An AUTHORS sections contains no An macros, or only
empty ones. Probably, there are author names lacking
markup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings related to macros and
nesting <br>
obsolete macro <br>
(mdoc) See the mdoc(7) manual for replacements.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">macro neither callable nor
escaped <br>
(mdoc) The name of a macro that is not callable appears on a
macro line. It is printed verbatim. If the intention is to
call it, move it to its own input line; otherwise, <br>
escape it by prepending &acirc;&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping paragraph macro <br>
In mdoc(7) documents, this happens <br>
- at the beginning and end of sections and subsections <br>
- right before non-compact lists and displays <br>
- at the end of items in non-column, non-compact lists <br>
- and for multiple consecutive paragraph macros. <br>
In man(7) documents, it happens <br>
- for empty P, PP, and LP macros <br>
- for IP macros having neither head nor body arguments <br>
- for br or sp right after SH or SS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moving paragraph macro out of
list <br>
(mdoc) A list item in a Bl list contains a trailing
paragraph macro. The paragraph macro is moved after the end
of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping no-space macro <br>
(mdoc) An input line begins with an Ns macro. The macro is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">blocks badly nested <br>
(mdoc) If two blocks intersect, one should completely
contain the other. Otherwise, rendered output is likely to
look strange in any output format, and rendering in
SGML-based <br>
output formats is likely to be outright wrong because such
languages do not support badly nested blocks at all. Typical
examples of badly nested blocks are &quot;Ao Bo Ac Bc&quot;
and &quot;Ao <br>
Bq Ac&quot;. In these examples, Ac breaks Bo and Bq,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nested displays are not portable
<br>
(mdoc) A Bd, D1, or Dl display occurs nested inside another
Bd display. This works with mandoc, but fails with most
other implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">moving content out of list <br>
(mdoc) A Bl list block contains text or macros before the
first It macro. The offending children are moved before the
beginning of the list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.Vt block has child macro <br>
(mdoc) The Vt macro supports plain text arguments only.
Formatting may be ugly and semantic searching for the
affected content might not work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fill mode already enabled,
skipping <br>
(man) A fi request occurs even though the document is still
in fill mode, or already switched back to fill mode. It has
no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fill mode already disabled,
skipping <br>
(man) An nf request occurs even though the document already
switched to no-fill mode and did not switch back to fill
mode yet. It has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line scope broken <br>
(man) While parsing the next-line scope of the previous
macro, another macro is found that prematurely terminates
the previous one. The previous, interrupted macro is deleted
<br>
from the parse tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings related to missing
arguments <br>
skipping empty request <br>
(roff, eqn) The macro name is missing from a macro
definition request, or an eqn(7) control statement or
operation keyword lacks its required argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">conditional request controls
empty scope <br>
(roff) A conditional request is only useful if any of the
following follows it on the same logical input line: <br>
- The &acirc;&acirc; keyword to open a multi-line scope.
<br>
- A request or macro or some text, resulting in a
single-line scope. <br>
- The immediate end of the logical line without any
intervening whitespace, resulting in next-line scope. <br>
Here, a conditional request is followed by trailing
whitespace only, and there is no other content on its
logical input line. Note that it doesn&rsquo;t matter
whether the logical <br>
input line is split across multiple physical input lines
using &acirc;&acirc; line continuation characters. This is
one of the rare cases where trailing whitespace is
syntactically <br>
significant. The conditional request controls a scope
containing whitespace only, so it is unlikely to have a
significant effect, except that it may control a following
el <br>
clause.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping empty macro <br>
(mdoc) The indicated macro has no arguments and hence no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty block <br>
(mdoc, man) A Bd, Bk, Bl, D1, Dl, RS, or UR block contains
nothing in its body and will produce no output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty argument, using 0n <br>

not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing -width in -tag list,

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty head in list item <br>
(mdoc) In a Bl -diag, -hang, -inset, -ohang, or -tag list,
an It macro lacks the required argument. The item head is
left empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty list item <br>

(mdoc) The Bf argument is invalid. The default font is used
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">nothing follows prefix <br>
(mdoc) A Pf macro has no argument, or only one argument and
no macro follows on the same input line. This defeats its
purpose; in particular, spacing is not suppressed before

the text or macros following on the next input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty reference block <br>
(mdoc) An Rs macro is immediately followed by an Re macro on

any output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing -std argument, adding it
<br>
(mdoc) An Ex or Rv macro lacks the required -std argument.
The mandoc utility assumes -std even when it is not

unterminated quoted argument <br>
(roff) Macro arguments can be enclosed in double quote
characters such that space characters and macro names
contained in the quoted argument need not be escaped. The
closing <br>
quote of the last argument of a macro can be omitted.
However, omitting it is not recommended because it makes the
code harder to read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duplicate argument <br>
(mdoc) A Bd or Bl macro has more than one -compact, more
than one -offset, or more than one -width argument. All but
the last instances of these arguments are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping duplicate argument <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wrong number of cells <br>
In a line of a Bl -column list, the number of tabs or Ta
macros is less than the number expected from the list header
line or exceeds the expected number by more than one. <br>
Missing cells remain empty, and all cells exceeding the
number of columns are joined into one single cell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknown AT&amp;T UNIX version
<br>
(mdoc) An At macro has an invalid argument. It is used
verbatim, with &quot;AT&amp;T UNIX &quot; prefixed to
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">comma in function argument <br>
(mdoc) An argument of an Fa or Fn macro contains a comma; it
should probably be split into two arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">parenthesis in function name
<br>
(mdoc) The first argument of an Fc or Fn macro contains an
opening or closing parenthesis; that&rsquo;s probably wrong,
parentheses are added automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid content in Rs block <br>
(mdoc) An Rs block contains plain text or non-% macros. The
bogus content is left in the syntax tree. Formatting may be
poor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid Boolean argument <br>
(mdoc) An Sm macro has an argument other than on or off. The
invalid argument is moved out of the macro, which leaves the
macro empty, causing it to toggle the spacing mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknown font, skipping request

(man, tbl) A roff(7) ft request or a tbl(7) f layout
modifier has an unknown font argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">odd number of characters in

(roff) A tr request contains an odd number of characters.
The last character is mapped to the blank character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings related to plain text
<br>
blank line in fill mode, using .sp <br>
(mdoc) The meaning of blank input lines is only well-defined
in non-fill mode: In fill mode, line breaks of text input
lines are not supposed to be significant. However, for <br>
compatibility with groff, blank lines in fill mode are
replaced with sp requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tab in filled text <br>
(mdoc, man) The meaning of tab characters is only
well-defined in non-fill mode: In fill mode, whitespace is
not supposed to be significant on text input lines. As an
<br>
implementation dependent choice, tab characters on text
lines are passed through to the formatters in any case.
Given that the text before the tab character will be filled,
it <br>
is hard to predict which tab stop position the tab will
advance to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">whitespace at end of input line
<br>
(mdoc, man, roff) Whitespace at the end of input lines is
almost never semantically significant &acirc; but in the odd
case where it might be, it is extremely confusing when
reviewing <br>
and maintaining documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bad comment style <br>
(roff) Comment lines start with a dot, a backslash, and a
double-quote character. The mandoc utility treats the line
as a comment line even without the backslash, but leaving
<br>
out the backslash might not be portable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid escape sequence <br>
(roff) An escape sequence has an invalid opening argument
delimiter, lacks the closing argument delimiter, or the
argument has too few characters. If the argument is
incomplete, <br>
and expand to an empty string, 0to the digit
&acirc;0&acirc;, and 48the length of the incomplete
argument. All other invalid escape sequences are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">undefined string, using
&quot;&quot; <br>
(roff) If a string is used without being defined before, its
value is implicitly set to the empty string. However,
defining strings explicitly before use keeps the code more

readable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Warnings related to tables <br>

ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">empty tbl layout <br>
(tbl) A table layout specification is completely empty,
specifying zero lines and zero columns. As a fallback, a
single left-justified column is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">invalid character in tbl layout
<br>
(tbl) A table layout specification contains a character that
can neither be interpreted as a layout key character nor as
a layout modifier, or a modifier precedes the first key.
<br>
The invalid character is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unmatched parenthesis in tbl

(tbl) A table layout specification contains an opening
parenthesis, but no matching closing parenthesis. The rest
of the input line, starting from the parenthesis, has no

input stack limit exceeded, infinite loop? <br>
(roff) Explicit recursion limits are implemented for the
following features, in order to prevent infinite loops: <br>
- expansion of nested escape sequences including expansion
of strings and number registers, <br>
- expansion of nested user-defined macros, <br>
- and so file inclusion. <br>
When a limit is hit, the output is incorrect, typically
losing some content, but the parser can continue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping bad character <br>
(mdoc, man, roff) The input file contains a byte that is not
a printable ascii(7) character. The message mentions the
character number. The offending byte is replaced with a <br>
question mark (&acirc;?&acirc;). Consider editing the input
file to replace the byte with an ASCII transliteration of
the intended character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping unknown macro <br>
(mdoc, man, roff) The first identifier on a request or macro
line is neither recognized as a roff(7) request, nor as a
user-defined macro, nor, respectively, as an mdoc(7) or <br>
man(7) macro. It may be mistyped or unsupported. The request
or macro is discarded including its arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping insecure request <br>
(roff) An input file attempted to run a shell command or to
read or write an external file. Such attempts are denied for
security reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping item outside list <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping end of block that is
not open <br>
(mdoc, man, eqn, tbl, roff) Various syntax elements can only
be used to explicitly close blocks that have previously been
opened. An mdoc(7) block closing macro, a man(7) RE or <br>
UE macro, an eqn(7) right delimiter or closing brace, or the
end of an equation, table, or roff(7) conditional request is
encountered but no matching block is open. The <br>
offending request or macro is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">fewer RS blocks open, skipping
<br>
(man) The RE macro is invoked with an argument, but less
than the specified number of RS blocks is open. The RE macro
is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">inserting missing end of block
<br>
(mdoc, tbl) Various mdoc(7) macros as well as tables require
explicit closing by dedicated macros. A block that
doesn&rsquo;t support bad nesting ends before all of its
children are <br>
properly closed. The open child nodes are closed
implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">appending missing end of block
<br>
(mdoc, man, eqn, tbl, roff) At the end of the document, an
explicit mdoc(7) block, a man(7) next-line scope or RS or UR
block, an equation, table, or roff(7) conditional or <br>
ignore block is still open. The open block is closed
implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">escaped character not allowed in
a name <br>
(roff) Macro, string and register identifiers consist of
printable, non-whitespace ASCII characters. Escape sequences
and characters and strings expressed in terms of them <br>
cannot form part of a name. The first argument of an am, as,
de, ds, nr, or rr request, or any argument of an rm request,
or the name of a request or user defined macro being <br>
called, is terminated by an escape sequence. In the cases of
as, ds, and nr, the request has no effect at all. In the
cases of am, de, rr, and rm, what was parsed up to this <br>
point is used as the arguments to the request, and the rest
of the input line is discarded including the escape
sequence. When parsing for a request or a user-defined macro
name <br>
to be called, only the escape sequence is discarded. The
characters preceding it are used as the request or macro
name, the characters following it are used as the arguments
to <br>
the request or macro.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOT IMPLEMENTED: Bd -file <br>
(mdoc) For security reasons, the Bd macro does not support
the -file argument. By requesting the inclusion of a
sensitive file, a malicious document might otherwise trick a
<br>
privileged user into inadvertently displaying the file on
the screen, revealing the file content to bystanders. The
argument is ignored including the file name following
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing list type, using -item

(mdoc) A Bl macro fails to specify the list type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">missing manual name, using

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unknown standard specifier <br>
(mdoc) An St macro has an unknown argument and is
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping request without numeric
argument <br>
(roff, eqn) An it request or an eqn(7) size or gsize
statement has a non-numeric or negative argument or no
argument at all. The invalid request or statement is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOT IMPLEMENTED: .so with
absolute path or &quot;..&quot; <br>
(roff) For security reasons, mandoc allows so file inclusion
requests only with relative paths and only without ascending
to any parent directory. By requesting the inclusion of <br>
a sensitive file, a malicious document might otherwise trick
a privileged user into inadvertently displaying the file on
the screen, revealing the file content to bystanders. <br>
mandoc only shows the path as it appears behind so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.so request failed <br>
(roff) Servicing a so request requires reading an external
file, but the file could not be opened. mandoc only shows
the path as it appears behind so.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping all arguments <br>
(mdoc, man, eqn, roff) An mdoc(7) Bt, Ed, Ef, Ek, El, Lp,
Pp, Re, Rs, or Ud macro, an It macro in a list that
don&rsquo;t support item heads, a man(7) LP, P, or PP macro,
an eqn(7) EQ <br>
or EN macro, or a roff(7) br, fi, or nf request or
&acirc;..&acirc; block closing request is invoked with at
least one argument. All arguments are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">skipping excess arguments <br>
(mdoc, man, roff) A macro or request is invoked with too
many arguments: <br>
- Fo, PD, RS, UR, ft, or sp with more than one argument <br>
- An with another argument after -split or -nosplit <br>
- RE with more than one argument or with a non-integer
argument <br>
- OP or a request of the de family with more than two
arguments <br>
- Dt with more than three arguments <br>
- TH with more than five arguments <br>
- Bd, Bk, or Bl with invalid arguments <br>
The excess arguments are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unsupported features <br>
input too large <br>
(mdoc, man) Currently, mandoc cannot handle input files
larger than its arbitrary size limit of 2^31 bytes (2
Gigabytes). Since useful manuals are always small, this is
not a <br>
problem in practice. Parsing is aborted as soon as the
condition is detected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsupported control character
<br>
(roff) An ASCII control character supported by other roff(7)
implementations but not by mandoc was found in an input
file. It is replaced by a question mark.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unsupported roff request <br>
(roff) An input file contains a roff(7) request supported by
GNU troff or Heirloom troff but not by mandoc, and it is
likely that this will cause information loss or considerable
<br>
misformatting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eqn delim option in tbl <br>
(eqn, tbl) The options line of a table defines equation
delimiters. Any equation source code contained in the table
