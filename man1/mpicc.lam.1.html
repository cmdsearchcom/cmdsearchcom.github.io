<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mpicc, mpiCC / mpic++ - Compile LAM/MPI C/C++ programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mpicc [-showme|-showme:compile|-showme:link] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpiCC
[-showme|-showme:compile|-showme:link] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpic++
[-showme|-showme:compile|-showme:link] ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-showme <br>
Does not invoke the underlying C/C++ compiler. Instead, it
shows the command line that would be executed to compile the
C/C++ program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showme:compile <br>
Does not invoke the underlying C/C++ compiler. Instead, it
shows the compiler flags that would be supplied to the C/C++
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-showme:link <br>
Does not invoke the underlying C/C++ compiler. Instead, it
shows the linker flags that would be supplied to the C/C++
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See cc(1) and CC(1) (or whatever
your underlying C/C++ compilers are) for all other
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mpicc and mpiCC (mpic++ is a synonym for mpiCC provided for
filenames that do not support case-sensitive filenames) are
convenience wrappers for the local native C and C++
com&acirc; <br>
pilers. Translation of a LAM program requires the linkage of
the LAM specific libraries which may not reside in one of
the standard search directories of ld(1). It also often <br>
requires the inclusion of header files what may also not be
found in a standard location. mpicc passes its arguments to
the local native C compiler along with the -I, -L and -l
<br>
options required by LAM programs. This includes all
necessary options for ROMIO and/or C++ bindings support (if
ROMIO/C++ support was included when LAM was compiled).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mpiCC (and therefore mpic++) is
similar, but invokes the native C++ compiler instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LAM Team strongly encourages
using mpicc and mpiCC instead of attempting to link to the
LAM libraries manually. This allows the specific
implementation of LAM to change <br>
without forcing changes to linker directives in users&rsquo;
Makefiles (the specific set of underlying LAM libraries has
already changed multiple times, and will likely change again
in <br>
future versions).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Indeed, since mpicc/mpiCC are
very thin wrappers on top of an underlying compiler, there
are very, very few compelling reasons not to use
mpicc/mpiCC. When it is not possible to <br>
use mpicc/mpiCC, the -showme:compile and -showme:link
arguments should be used instead. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ cc -c file1.c
&lsquo;mpicc -showme:compile&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ cc -c file2.c
&lsquo;mpicc -showme:compile&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell$ cc file1.o file2.o
&lsquo;mpicc -showme:link&lsquo; -o my_mpi_program</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
By default, mpicc uses the C compiler that was selected when
LAM was configured (with the --with-cc flag to ./configure,
or by setting the environment variable CC before
./con&acirc; <br>
figure was invoked) as the local native C compiler, but this
can be overridden by the LAMMPICC environment variable (an
older name for this environment variable is LAMHCC -- this
<br>
also still works, but its use is deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, mpiCC uses the C++
compiler that was selected when LAM was configured (with the
--with-cpp flag to ./configure, or by setting the
environment variable CXX before invok&acirc; <br>
ing ./configure) by default, but this can be overridden by
the LAMMPICXX environment variable (an older name for this
environment variable is LAMHCP -- this also still works, but
<br>
its use is deprecated).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
LAMHOME is set, mpicc and mpiCC will use its value as the
location of the LAM installation directory instead of the
value that was compiled into <br>
mpicc/mpiCC. This means that mpicc/mpiCC will use the value
of LAMHOME as the base to create the -I and -L arguments
that are passed to the lower-level compiler, not the
instal&acirc; <br>
lation directory that was supplied when mpicc/mpiCC were
created. This is almost always a Bad Idea.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The use of LAMHOME is
discouraged except for some rare configuration cases in
oddly networked sites (in which case your system
administrator should probably set this up), and for <br>
advanced users with multiple LAM/MPI installations who
really know what they are doing; if the LAMHOME environment
variable is unintentionally left set, it can lead to
tremendous <br>
user confusion. For example, if LAMHOME points to LAM
installation A, but the user&rsquo;s PATH points to LAM
installation B, then even though B&rsquo;s mpicc will be
used, the user program <br>
will be compiled and linked against LAM installation A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The LAMHOME environment variable
is mainly only left in place for backwards compatibility; it
is not required for normal functioning of LAM/MPI. The LAM
Team discourages the use <br>
of the LAMHOME environment variable, and instead advocates
simply setting the PATH properly to switch between multiple
LAM/MPI implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
Previous versions of LAM encouraged the use of hcc and hcp
to compile LAM and/or MPI C and C++ applications,
respectively. In very old versions of LAM, hcc and hcp did
not auto&acirc; <br>
matically add -lmpi to the command line. hcc and hcp were
eventually deprecated and replaced with mpicc and mpiCC (or
mpic++ on case-insensitive filesystems). The executables
<br>
hcc and hcp are now simply symbolic links to mpicc and
mpic++, respectively, just in case there&rsquo;s anyone out
there that still uses those names. It should be harmless to
pass in <br>
the additional -lmpi; mpicc and mpic++ should silently do
the Right Thing (only link in the MPI library once).</p>
