<p>PERL5221DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5221DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5221delta - what is new for perl v5.22.1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.22.0
release and the 5.22.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are upgrading from an
earlier release such as 5.20.0, first read perl5220delta,
which describes differences between 5.20.0 and 5.22.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incompatible Changes <br>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0
other than the following single exception, which we deemed
to be a sensible change to make in order to get the new w b
} &quot; a n d ( i n p <br>
&quot;a r t i c u l a r ) &quot; <br>
If any others exist, they are bugs, and we request that you
submit a report. See &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bounds Checking Constructs <br>
Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been
fixed with the bounds checking constructs (introduced in
Perl g c b 5.22) &quot;} &quot; , &quot; <br>
and &quot;0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
Updated Modules and Pragmata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Module::CoreList has been upgraded from
version 5.20150520 to 5.20151213.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; PerlIO::scalar
has been upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; POSIX has been
upgraded from version 1.53 to 1.53_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;POSIX::strerror&quot;
was passed $! as its argument then it accidentally cleared
$!. This has been fixed. [perl #126229]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126229&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Storable has
been upgraded from version 2.53 to 2.53_01.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; warnings has
been upgraded from version 1.32 to 1.34.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;warnings::enabled&quot; example now actually uses
&quot;warnings::enabled&quot;. [perl #126051]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126051&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Win32 has been
upgraded from version 0.51 to 0.52.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This has been updated for
Windows 8.1, 10 and 2012 R2 Server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
Changes to Existing Documentation <br>
perltie</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The usage of
&quot;FIRSTKEY&quot; and &quot;NEXTKEY&quot; has been
clarified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlvar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The specific
true value of $!{E...} is now documented, noting that it is
subject to change and not guaranteed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics <br>
The following additions or changes have been made to
diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error
messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see
perldiag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing Diagnostics
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; The &quot;printf&quot; and
&quot;sprintf&quot; builtins are now more careful about the
warnings they emit: argument reordering now disables the
&quot;redundant argument&quot; warning in all cases. [perl
<br>
#125469]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125469&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration and Compilation
<br>
&Acirc;&middot; Using the &quot;NO_HASH_SEED&quot; define in
combination with the default hash algorithm
&quot;PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD&quot; resulted in a
fatal error while compiling the interpreter, <br>
since Perl 5.17.10. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configuring with
ccflags containing quotes (e.g.
&quot;-Accflags=&rsquo;-DAPPLLIB_EXP= <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125314&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Support <br>
Platform-Specific Notes <br>
IRIX <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Under some circumstances IRIX stdio fgetc()
and fread() set the errno to &quot;ENOENT&quot;, which made
no sense according to either IRIX or POSIX docs. Errno is
now cleared in <br>
such cases. [perl #123977]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123977&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Problems when
multiplying long doubles by infinity have been fixed. [perl
#126396]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126396&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; All tests pass
now on IRIX with the default build configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Bug Fixes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;qr/(?[ () ])/&quot; no longer
segfaults, giving a syntax error message instead. [perl
#125805]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125805&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Regular
expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now
fixed.
&quot;qr/&quot;PAT&quot;{&quot;min,max&quot;}+&quot;&quot;/&quot;
is supposed to behave identically to
&quot;qr/(?&gt;&quot;PAT&quot;{&quot;min,max&quot;})/&quot;.
Since <br>
Perl 5.20, this didn&rsquo;t work if min and max were equal.
[perl #125825]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125825&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Certain syntax
errors in &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot;
in perlrecharclass caused panics instead of the proper error
message. This has now been fixed. [perl <br>
#126481]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126481&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;BEGIN
&lt;&gt;&quot; no longer segfaults and properly produces an
error message. [perl #125341]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125341&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A regression
from Perl 5.20 has been fixed, in which some syntax errors
in &quot;(?[...])&quot; constructs within regular expression
patterns could cause a segfault instead of a proper <br>
error message. [perl #126180]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Another problem
with &quot;(?[...])&quot; constructs has been fixed wherein
things like &quot; <br>
&Acirc;&middot; In Perl 5.22.0, the logic changed when
parsing a numeric parameter to the -C option, such that the
successfully parsed number was not saved as the option value
if it parsed <br>
to the end of the argument. [perl #125381]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125381&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Warning fatality
is now ignored when rewinding the stack. This prevents
infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes
rewinding of the stack. [perl #123398] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123398&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A crash with
&quot;%::=(); J-&gt;${</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Nested
quantifiers such as &quot;/.{1}??/&quot; should cause perl
to throw a fatal error, but were being silently accepted
since Perl 5.20.0. This has been fixed. [perl #126253] <br>

&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Regular
expression sequences such as &quot;/(?i/&quot; (and
similarly with other recognized flags or combination of
flags) should cause perl to throw a fatal error, but were
being <br>
silently accepted since Perl 5.18.0. This has been fixed.
[perl #126178]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A bug in
hexadecimal floating point literal support meant that
high-order bits could be lost in cases where mantissa
overflow was caused by too many trailing zeros in the <br>
fractional part. This has been fixed. [perl #126582]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Another
hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be
lost in cases where the last hexadecimal digit of the
mantissa has bits straddling the limit of the <br>
number of bits allowed for the mantissa, has also been
fixed. [perl #126586]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Further
hexadecimal floating point bugs have been fixed: In some
circumstances, the %a format specifier could variously lose
the sign of the negative zero, fail to display <br>
zeros after the radix point with the requested precision, or
even lose the radix point after the leftmost hexadecimal
digit completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A crash caused
by incomplete expressions within &quot;/(?[ ])/&quot; (e.g.
&quot;/(?[[0]+()+])/&quot;) has been fixed. [perl #126615]
&lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126615&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The list above is almost
certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from
version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much <br>
appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl
bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the changes included in
this version originated in the CPAN modules included in
Perl&rsquo;s core. We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire CPAN
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

of Perl&rsquo;s historical contributors, please see the
AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reporting Bugs <br>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the
articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc
newsgroup and the perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/
. There <br>
may also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl
Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you believe you have an
unreported bug, please run the perlbug program included with
your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case. Your bug <br>
report, along with the output of &quot;perl -V&quot;, will
be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl
porting team.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the bug you are reporting has
security implications, which make it inappropriate to send
to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to
<br>
perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the
core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact
<br>
of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the
release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use <br>
this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for
modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
