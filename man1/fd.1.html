<p>FD(1) General Commands Manual FD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
fd - file &amp; directory maintenance tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
fd [ -abCefhiklmNnPrSsTtuvx ] [ -NAME=value ] [ directory [
directory2 ... ]] <br>
fdsh [ -abCcefhiklmNnPrSsTtuvx ] [ args ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Fd is a file &amp; directory maintenance tool considered for
the text terminals on general UNIX. It aims for a clone of
the same named utility which is made for the PC/AT
compatible <br>
machine and PC-9800 series. In fact, it is upper compatible
functionally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fd shows the browser screen
listing files when you have invoked it. You can input some
key which is bound each command, to execute various
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(In the following description,
(UNIX) means that the operation is implemented only on UNIX
version and not effective on MS-DOS version. As well as it,
(DOS) means that the oper&acirc; <br>
ation is implemented only on MS-DOS version.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
The command line option is used for setting internal shell
operations and setting the internal variables described
below. You can use any variable name as the internal
variable, <br>
but fd can accept only those which are described in the
below section of ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES. If you specify
directory, the current directory is moved to the directory
ini&acirc; <br>
tially. If you specify directory2 ..., the split window mode
is invoked, and the current directories of the supplemental
windows are moved to the each directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are
available for the internal shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c string <br>
Commands described by string are executed and exit
immediately. It is effective only when it is invoked as
fdsh.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i If the -i flag is present or
if the standard input/output is a terminal, the shell is the
interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s If the -s flag is present or
if no args is specified, commands for the shell are read
from the standard input. Any remaining argument specifies
the positional parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r The shell is a restricted
shell. Specifically, the following operations are
disallowed. <br>
changing the current directory <br>
setting the value of $PATH, $SHELL and $ENV <br>
specifying command names include / <br>
redirecting output (&gt; and &gt;&gt;) <br>
IN_DIR OUT_DIR LOG_TOP <br>
LOG_DIR ATTR_FILE COPY_FILE <br>
MOVE_FILE DELETE_FILE DELETE_DIR <br>
RENAME_FILE MAKE_DIR WRITE_DIR <br>
TREE_DIR BACKUP_TAPE EDIT_FILE <br>
UNPACK_FILE PACK_FILE LOG_TREE <br>
COPY_TREE MOVE_TREE UNPACK_TREE <br>
FIND_DIR ATTR_DIR <br>
When invoked as rfd or rfdsh, it becomes this restricted
shell automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l The shell is a login
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N Reading the initial
configuration files is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, the options
described below in the description of set the builtin
command are available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Screen Layout <br>
Fd has the 3 major screen modes. In the browser screen, you
can select from the file list and execute each command. In
the archive browser screen, files in the archive file are
<br>
listed separately by directory, and you can browse as well
as the browser screen. In the tree screen, you can move on
the directory tree and select the directory path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In all screen modes, each 3
lines on the top/bottom of the screen are used for the
various information of fd. The top information lines
sometimes become 4 lines. The screen <br>
layout is the following.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">line# Description</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 The title line. The clock at
the right end is updated every 10 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 The information line. It
displays information in this order: the current page (and
the total pages), the number of marks (ant the total marks),
the sorted type, the <br>
pattern string for file search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 The path line. It displays the
fullpath of the current directory. In the archive browser
screen, it displays the fullpath of the archive file and the
current path in <br>
the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 (optional) <br>
The file size information line. It displays the total size
of the marked files in the directory (and the total size of
all files), the total capacity and the free size <br>
of the file system including the current directory. This
line appears by SIZEINFO the internal variable setting. When
this line is displayed, The information line and <br>
the path line are displayed 1 line under each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bottom - 2 <br>
The stack line. It displays files temporarily which you push
in stack, when arranging files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bottom - 1 <br>
The function line. It displays the operations of function
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bottom The status line. It
displays the status of the file on the cursor position. It
also displays warning messages when command is executed with
some troubles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Commands <br>
You can use the following internal commands on fd. While any
user can change the key binding for these internal commands,
here shows the default key binding. The identifier is <br>
used when it is executed from the command line of EXECUTE_SH
command, and when the user defines the key binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The last 2 internal commands are
used when you want change the default key binding to
cancel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Commands Description
<br>
The detail of each internal command is the following.
Internal commands with similar function are described
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move cursor <br>
Move a cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turn page <br>
Turn to the previous/next page, when files are not
completely held in a screen. Also if you try to move out of
the page with Cursor move, the page will be turned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move to the top/bottom <br>
Move a cursor to the top/bottom of the file list. When the
list is not held in a screen, the page is turned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Shift filename <br>
Shift the displayed string of filename on the cursor
position, when the filename is longer than the prepared
column width. It is displayed as shifted to right/left by 1
<br>
character. The display of the status line is also shifted
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change layout <br>
Change the number of columns into each value. There are
usually 2 columns per screen. As the column width per file
is changed according to the number of columns, the <br>
displayed information is also changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mark file <br>
Mark the file on the cursor position. You cannot mark any
directory. [Space] marks and moves down a cursor. [^Space]
also marks and moves down a cursor, but doesn&rsquo;t <br>
turn the page. [Home] marks all the files, [End] marks all
the files reversely. [&acirc;] additionally marks the file
which matches the wildcard. You must input the wildcard <br>
string whenever you push [&acirc;].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Marked files are used as the
target of ATTR_FILE, COPY_FILE, DELETE_FILE, MOVE_FILE,
UNPACK_FILE and the user defined command macros.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change directory <br>
[Return] changes the current directory to the directory on
the cursor position. If you want to change it to the parent
directory, you should move a cursor to the file of <br>
&quot;..&quot; and push [Return], or simply push [Bs]. []
changes the current directory to the root directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Push/pop file stack <br>
[Del] pushes the file on the cursor position to the file
stack, and temporarily deletes the file from the file list
screen. You can push files to the file stack up to 5 <br>
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[Ins] pops the file from the
file stack and insert it on the cursor position. The last
pushed file is popped first. But this order is expediently
displayed in fd, and <br>
it is reset by Directory move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Redraw screen <br>
Redraw the file list screen by rereading the information of
the current directory. It is useful when some other process
add/delete files, or when something break the <br>
screen display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, when you use the
terminal which doesn&rsquo;t raise SIGWINCH signal at
changing the screen size (like kterm(1) on HP-UX etc.), you
must intentionally redraw after you <br>
change the screen size.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change logical directory
(Logdir) <br>
Change the current directory to the inputted pathname. When
you input the pathname which starts with &rsquo;/&rsquo;, it
means not the relative move but the absolute move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you input the pathname
&quot;.&quot;, the pathname of the current directory is
adjusted into absolute expression. Except this case, the
current directory always is shown as <br>
the virtual pathname, by reason of a link and so on. When
you input the pathname &quot;?&quot;, you can move to the
current directory when fd was invoked. When you input the
<br>
pathname &quot;-&quot;, you can move to the last visited
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, When you input the
pathname &quot;@&quot; in floppy drive, you can move to the
directory on UNIX file system, where you existed before
moving to floppy drive. (UNIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note: This command is called as
&quot;Loddsk&quot; in the original FD on MS-DOS, which is
short for &quot;LOGical DiSK drive&quot;. This
&quot;logical&quot; means the drive name prefixed to
path&acirc; <br>
names, and it is virtually named against &quot;physical disk
drive&quot;. On UNIX, since &quot;logical disk drive&quot;
never means pathname nor directory, this command name
&quot;Change logical <br>
directory&quot; is not suitable. But this name is
expediently inherited from the original version.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute file (eXec) <br>
Execute the file on the cursor position with some
parameters, as the child process. The cursor position in
command line exists after the filename in case of the
exe&acirc; <br>
cutable file, and before the filename except it. You should
fill suitable parameters or command name in each case. The
up/down cursor keys can provide the command his&acirc; <br>
tory which you executed before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On MS-DOS version, the LFN form
filename in the command line which is quoted with the
quotation mark &quot; is automatically replaced into 8+3
form filename before execution. <br>
In this case, when there is the filename described by the
string quoted with &quot;, this string is always replaced
into 8+3 form filename after deleting &quot;, otherwise it
is <br>
never replaced including &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copy file (Copy) <br>
Copy the file on the cursor position to the specified
directory. When the cursor position indicates a directory,
its contents are copied recursively. When some files <br>
are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor
position but the marked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the same named file exists
in the destination, you can select the operation from the
following: &quot;Update (by timestamp)&quot;, &quot;Rename
(each copied file)&quot;, &quot;Overwrite&quot;, <br>
&quot;Not_copy_the_same_name&quot;, &quot;Forward&quot;. If
you select &quot;Forward&quot;, you should specify the
directory as the destination to forward. All files which
have the same names are <br>
moved to the specified directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete file (Delete) <br>
Delete the file on the cursor position. No directory can be
deleted. When some files are marked, the target is not the
file on the cursor position but the marked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you don&rsquo;t have write
permission on the file, you are confirmed for security.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rename file (Rename) <br>
Rename the file on the cursor position. You cannot rename to
the same name as any existent file. When you specify the
pathname with some directory name, it is also <br>
moved to the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sort file (Sort) <br>
Sort files in the current directory. You can select the
sorted type from the following: &quot;fileName&quot;,
&quot;Extension&quot;, &quot;Size&quot;,
&quot;Timestamp&quot;, &quot;Length (of filename)&quot;, and
specify <br>
&quot;Up (incremental order)&quot; or &quot;Down
(decremental order)&quot;. When the sorted type before
sorting is the one except &quot;No chg (not sort)&quot;, the
choice will include &quot;No chg&quot;. <br>
When you sort after sorting another sorted type, the
previous sorted result is based in sorting. This sorting has
a priority except specified type, the directory is <br>
always precedes any file, except for the case of &quot;No
chg&quot;. In case of &quot;Length&quot;, files which have
the same filename length are sorted in order of their
names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">But this sorting is expediently
displayed in fd, and it is reset by Directory move.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find file (Find) <br>
Find the files matching the wildcard, and display only them.
The filename which starts with &rsquo;.&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t
match the wildcard which starts with &rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;
nor &rsquo;?&rsquo;. If you want <br>
to cancel the File find, you should move the current
directory, or do FIND_FILE again and input a null line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the current directory has
the files which have the extension registered to associate
with an archive browser, the string which starts with
&rsquo;/&rsquo; is used to find not <br>
the filename but the filename in archive files, and only the
archive files which contain matched files are displayed.
This function is available in the archive browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After Find file, you can not do
WRITE_DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display tree screen (Tree) <br>
Display the directory tree based on the current directory.
You can select the directory in the tree screen, to move the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit file (Editor) <br>
Edit the file on the cursor position. The editor is used
referring EDITOR the internal variable, or referring EDITOR
the environment variable when the internal variable <br>
is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unpack file (Unpack) <br>
Unpack the archive file on the cursor position into the
specified directory. In builtin configuration, you can
unpack only the tar file and its compressed file and the
<br>
LHa compressed file. You can describe configurations in the
initial configuration file to support archivers except
these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change attribute (Attr) <br>
Change the file access mode, the timestamp and the
owner/group of the file on the cursor position. When some
files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor
<br>
position but the marked files. In case of the marked files,
you must select the mode, the timestamp or the owner/group,
before changing it all together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you input the mode, cursor
keys move a cursor to the position you want to change,
[Space] reverses the attribute on the position. You should
notice that the <br>
attribute of the execution bit is not a binary toggle but a
triple toggle, which includes setuid bit, setgid bit and
sticky bit respectively. If the target is the marked <br>
files, [m](Mask) will mask a bit on the cursor position with
&rsquo;*&rsquo;, to keep the value of the original file
attribute. When you input the timestamp, you move a cursor
to <br>
the position you want to change, and input a numeric value.
When you input the owner/group, you move a cursor to the
position for each name, and input a name or a ID <br>
value with [Space]. You can use the completion for a user
name and a group name to input each name. Finally, [Return]
executes the change. You can cancel with [Esc]. <br>
Be careful that the limit check of date is not perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moreover, [a](Attr), [d](Date),
[t](Time), [o](Owner) and [g](Group) move a cursor to the
each beginning of input line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On the OS which has the
attribute of file flags, you can change the file flags as
well as the mode. In this case, [f](Flag) move a cursor to
the beginning of input line <br>
of file flags. But the value of flags which you can change
is based on your permission.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File system information (Info)
<br>
Display the information of the specified file system. When
the inputted pathname is not the special file which
indicates a file system, the information of the file
sys&acirc; <br>
tem including the pathname is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Move file (Move) <br>
Move the file on the cursor position to the specified
directory. When the cursor position indicates a directory,
the directory itself is moved. When some files are <br>
marked, the target is not the file on the cursor position
but the marked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the same named file exists
in the destination, you can select the operation as well as
COPY_FILE. When the destination belongs to the different
file system, copy <br>
and delete are just executed continuously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete directory (rmDir) <br>
Delete the directory on the cursor position recursively.
When the directory in a symbolic link, only the link is
deleted and the linked directory has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make directory (mKdir) <br>
Make the sub directory on the current directory. When the
inputted sub directory string includes &rsquo;/&rsquo;,
which is the pathname delimiter, it goes on making directory
recur&acirc; <br>
sively until the directory described by the string is
finally created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you input the pathname
which starts with &rsquo;/&rsquo;, the directory is made not
on the current directory but on the absolute path
described.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Execute child process (sHell)
<br>
Execute the inputted command string as the child process, by
handling the internal shell. You can refer the command
history and use automatic LFN replacement, as well as <br>
EXECUTE_FILE. When you push only [Return] without any input,
the user shell which is described by SHELL the internal
variable or the environment variable is invoked. In <br>
this case, you should input &quot;exit&quot; to return to
fd. When the value of SHELL is fdsh, the internal shell is
executed as the interactive shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, when there is the same
command name as a builtin command or a internal command, the
builtin command or the internal command are executed instead
of the external <br>
command. You can refer the clause of &lsquo;Builtin
Commands&rsquo; for the details of the builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write directory (Write) <br>
Write the displayed directory. The gap between files on the
directory entry is filled. When it is executed after
arranged by PUSH_FILE, POP_FILE and SORT_DIR, the <br>
result is written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the displayed directory
doesn&rsquo;t belong to the hierarchy under your home
directory, you are confirmed for security whether if any
other user doesn&rsquo;t use the direc&acirc; <br>
tory. Since it is insecure, you cannot write the NFS mounted
directory and some special directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you execute the internal
command which arranges the file order, and then try to
execute the internal command which will break that order,
you will be confirmed whether <br>
if you write the directory or not, just before the internal
command is executed. For this function, you can write the
directory without intentionally executing this <br>
Directory write command. But when the displayed directory is
not under your home directory, this confirmation is not
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backup tape (Backup) <br>
Backup the file on the cursor position into the specified
storage device. When the cursor position indicates a
directory, all of its contents is backuped. When some <br>
files are marked, the target is not the file on the cursor
position but the marked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tar(1) is used for backup. When
you specify the filename except special files indicates
devices as input of the device name, the archive file is
created with that file&acirc; <br>
name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View file (View) <br>
View the file on the cursor position. The pager is used
referring PAGER the internal variable, or referring PAGER
the environment variable when the internal variable is <br>
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pack file (Pack) <br>
Pack the file on the cursor position into the specified
archive file. When the cursor position indicates a
directory, all of its contents is packed into the archive
<br>
file. When some files are marked, the target is not the file
on the cursor position but the marked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to the extension of
the inputted archive file, the associated archiver is
automatically selected. In builtin configuration, you can
pack only the tar file and <br>
its compressed file and the LHa compressed file. You can
describe configurations in the initial configuration file to
support archivers except these.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you use tar(1), you may
sometimes be unable to pack a lot of files at once, because
of the maximum parameter length which can be given at once.
In those case, you <br>
can create the archive file with BACKUP_TAPE.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operations with tree <br>
[L], [C], [M] and [U] can make you select the pathname from
the directory tree instead of the string input. They execute
the internal command equivalent to LOG_DIR, <br>
COPY_FILE, MOVE_FILE and UNPACK_FILE, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Find file recursively <br>
Find the file matching the wildcard recursively under the
current directory, and move the directory where the found
file exists. When the cursor position indicates a <br>
directory, it find the file under the directory on the
cursor position instead of the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You will be confirmed for each
matching file whether if you move or not, and you can select
[n](No) unless the target file is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Change attributes recursively
<br>
Change attributes the directory on the cursor position
revursively. As well as changing attributes of the marked

owner/group, before changing it all together with each file
under the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you input the mode, you
should notice that the attribute of the execution bit is not
a triple toggle but a 5-states toggle, which includes
&rsquo;X&rsquo; and &rsquo;!&rsquo;. &rsquo;X&rsquo; means

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Commands <br>
In EXECUTE_SH and the initial configuration file, you can
use the internal commands described above and the builtin
commands described below, as well as the external commands.
<br>
With these commands, a pipeline can consist of one or more
commands separated by &acirc;&ordf; or &acirc;&ordf;&amp;.
&acirc;&ordf; connects the standard output of the previous
command to the standard input of the <br>
next command. &acirc;&ordf;&amp; connects both the standard
output and the standard error output of the previous command
to the standard input of the next command. The exit status
of a pipe&acirc; <br>
line is the exit status of the last command. You can start a
pipeline with !, then the exit status of a pipeline will be
the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command. <br>
Moreover, a command list can consist of one or more
pipelines separated by ;, &amp;, &amp;&acirc;&ordf;,
&amp;&amp;, &acirc;&ordf;&acirc;&ordf;. This command list
can end with ;, &amp; or &amp;&acirc;&ordf;. These
separators mean the following. <br>
; Execute commands sequentially. <br>
&amp; Execute commands synchronously, not waiting for the
preceding pipeline to finish. (UNIX) <br>
&amp;&acirc;&ordf; Same as &amp;, except to immediately
disown the job. (UNIX) <br>
&amp;&amp; Execute the following pipeline only if the
preceding pipeline returns a 0 exit status. <br>
&acirc;&ordf;&acirc;&ordf; Execute the following pipeline
only if the preceding pipeline returns a non-0 exit status.
<br>
In these command lists, a newline means as same as ;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input/output of each command
in the command list can be redirected with the following
redirectees. These redirectees can be placed on any position
in the command string. <br>
n&lt;file Redirect the input indicated by the file

Redirect the input indicated by the file descriptor n into
the input which is read up to a input line as same as word,
or to an end of file. If any part of word is <br>
quoted, no input line is evaluated. Otherwise, each input
line is evaluated to expand variables or replace strings.
When you specify -, all tabs on the beginning <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify the file with
each redirect, you can describe the filename as
&lsquo;scheme://host:port&rsquo; form to open the following
TCP sockets, according to the string of scheme. <br>
The authentication of your OS will restrict specifying the
accepting port. (UNIX) <br>
connect://host:port <br>
This socket is connected to the remote host specified by
host with the TCP port number specified by port. <br>
accept://[host][:port] <br>
This socket is accepted to the local host specified by host
with the TCP port number specified by port. If host is
omitted, this socket will be accepted to any <br>
host. If port is omitted, the port within the range
determined by the OS is used. <br>
bind://[host][:port] <br>
This socket is bound to the local host specified by host
with the TCP port number specified by port, preparing accept
the builtin command. If host is omitted, this <br>
socket will be accepted to any host. If port is omitted, the
port within the range determined by the OS is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On each command line, the string

ignored. When the line ends with &rsquo;&acute;, it is
referred as continuing into the next line, so that <br>
you can split a long line with this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Builtin Commands <br>
Fd has the following builtin commands. These builtin
commands can be used in EXECUTE_SH and the initial
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">if list then [elif list then
list] ... [else list] fi <br>
The list of if clause and elif clauses are executed in
order, and if each exit status is a 0, then the list of then
clause associated with it is executed and the <br>
elif clauses after it are ignored. If no list of if clause
nor elif clauses return a 0, the list of else clause is
executed. If no list of then clauses nor else <br>
clause is executed, then if returns a 0 exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">while list do list done <br>
The list of while clause is executed repeatedly, and while
its exit status is 0, the list of do clause is executed
repeatedly. If the list of do clause is never <br>
executed, then while returns a 0 exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">until list do list done <br>
The list of until clause is executed repeatedly, and while
its exit status is NOT 0, the list of do clause is executed
repeatedly. If the list of do clause is <br>
never executed, then until returns a 0 exit status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for NAME [in value ...] do list
done <br>
NAME the internal variable is substituted for values of
value one by one, and list is executed according to the each
value. If in value is omitted, then each posi&acirc; <br>
tional parameter is substituted one by one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">case word in [pattern
[&acirc;&ordf; pattern] ... ) list ;;] ... esac <br>
The string word is compared with the each pattern, list

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(list) Execute list in a sub
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">{ list; } Execute list in the
current shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME=[value] [com ...] <br>
Define a internal variable which is available only in fd. It
substitutes the value (string) value for NAME the internal
variable. When you describe the command <br>
com after the definition of a variable, com is executed on
the state where this variable is regarded as the environment
variable. In this case, the definition of <br>
NAME is not remain as the environment variable nor the
internal variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If value is omitted, the value
of NAME the internal variable is defined as a null. If you
want to delete the definition of a internal variable, use
unset the <br>
builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name() { list; } <br>
Define a function whose body is list, as the name of name.
The defined function can be used in the command line of
EXECUTE_SH and each command macro described <br>
below. You can use the positional parameter $n in each
description of list, which indicates the argument when the
function is invoked. $0 is name itself, and <br>
$1-$9 indicates each argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although you cannot omit { } and
list, you can omit { } before/after list which consists of a
single command. If you want to delete the definition of a
function, <br>
use unset the builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!num Execute the command which
has the history number specified with the numeric value num.
When num is negative value, it executes the command which
has the history <br>
number as the current history number minus num.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!! Execute the previous command.
This is synonym for !-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!str Execute the command history
which starts with the string str.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: [arg ...] No effect. But it
evaluates arg and performs redirection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">. file <br>
source file Read and evaluate commands from file. File must
exists on the directory which PATH includes, or be described
with pathname. The each line format is based on the <br>
format of EXECUTE_SH. You can describe this in the file as
nesting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">accept [fd] Accept the
connection with the file descriptor indicated by fd, and the
connected socket will be assign to fd of the same file
descriptor. At the same time, the <br>
accepted socket will be closed. When fd is not the
redirection as the form of bind://, this command will be
failed. In comparison with the redirection as the form <br>
of accept://, the shell can receive controls before
establishing connection to negotiate the TCP port number
with the remote host in advance. (UNIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If fd is omitted, the connection
will be accepted with the standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addcr [-1] [file] <br>
Output the string read from the file specified by file, line
by line. The newline of each line is0. It is useful to pipe
the output to unified into CR-NL ( <br>
some socket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If file is omitted, it is
regarded as the standard input is specified. If -1 is
specified, it will output just 1 line and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">alias [name[=com]] <br>
Define a alias whose body is com, as the name of name. The
defined alias can be used in the command line of EXECUTE_SH
and each command macro described below. The <br>
alias substitution is performed recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If com is omitted, the alias of
name is displayed. If both com and name are omitted, all the
current alias definition list is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">arch ext [pack unpack] <br>
Register the archiver command associated with the archive
file which has ext the extension. The pack command is
specified as pack, and the unpack command is speci&acirc;
<br>
fied as unpack, using the macro representation quoted with
&quot;. When ext starts with /, uppercase/lowercase is
ignored in the comparison of any extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both pack and unpack are
omitted, the archiver command registration for ext the
extension is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bg [job] Continue the execution
of the job specified with job in the background. The
following format is available to specify a job. (UNIX) <br>
% <br>
%+ the current job <br>
%- the previous job <br>
%n the job with job number n <br>
%str the job whose command line starts with str <br>
But, you must describe these % in the command line of
EXECUTE_SH as the duplicated expression, such as %%, for the
reason of the parameter macro function described <br>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If job is omitted, the current
job is continued in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind c [com1 [com2] [:comment]]
<br>
Bind the command com1 to the key c. When you want to specify
a control character for c, you can prefix ^ into 2
characters, such as ^A. When you want to specify a <br>
character with the META key (or the ALT key on MS-DOS
version), you can prefix @ into 2 characters, such as @a.
When you want to specify a function key and a spe&acirc;
<br>
cial key, you can use each identifier described in keymap
command after, such as F10. Or you can describe the escape
sequence, such as and \, and the octal <br>
expression, such as .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In case of binding the internal
command of fd, you can the command identifier as it is. When
you want to define the internal command with some arguments
or define <br>
the command in the macro representation, you should describe
the string quoted with &quot;. If com2 is not omitted, com2
is executed when the cursor position indicates <br>
a directory. When the key c is the function key of F1-F20,
if you describe comment prefixed with : trailing the command
description, you can change the display of <br>
associated part in the function line into comment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, note that, with the key
binding for the control key, the configuration in the edit
mode described below is prior to the key binding.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If both com1 and com2 are

deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">break [n] Exit from the loop, it
is used in the for statement and so on. If n is specified,
it breaks n levels from the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">browse [-@ file] <br>
browse com [-ftbie arg] [-p com2] [-dn {noprep,loop}] ...
<br>
Execute com the command, and invoke the archive browser who
receives its output. You should the macro representation
quoted with &quot; as com. -f, -t, -b, -i and -e <br>
options are the same as the one for launch the builtin
command. In case that multiple coms are specified, the next
com the command is executed one after another <br>
when you select each files in the archive browser, and the
formats and patterns described after each com the command
are adopted. In order to return to the previ&acirc; <br>
ous level of archive browser, you should select the file
named as .. or push the key [Bs]. Or you can use QUIT_SYSTEM
the command to escape from all of the ar&acirc; <br>
chive browsers invoked by browse. You must describe -f
option, except for the last com the command. When the last
com has no -f option, the command has been just <br>
executed instead of invoking an archive browser, and then
will return to the previous archive browser when it is
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify -p option, the
execution of com2 the command precedes the execution of the
next com the command when you select a file. While com is
executed in <br>
the sub shell for a pipeline, com2 is executed in the
current shell to inherit the values of internal variables
set in this command after com2 has been done. The <br>
filenames which is selected toward this level of archive
browser are held in positional parameters sequentially, and
the last selected filename is held in $1. <br>
These parameters will be newly set whenever you select a
file, so that they are reset in sequential order when you
select the next file even if you replace them <br>
with set or shift the builtin command. -d and -n options
specify a control if the selected file is a directory or not
respectively. When you specify noprep, com2 <br>
specified by -p option is not executed. When you specify
loop, you don&rsquo;t step the next com the command but the
same com the command again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">And when you think troublesome
to describe too many arguments for browse, you can specify
file the file in which some arguments are described with -@
option. You <br>
can describe -@ option in any place of arguments, the
arguments described in file are inserted in the place where
-@ is described. If you specify - as file, argu&acirc; <br>
ments are read from the standard input instead of the file.
You should describe arguments in file with spaces or
newlines as separator. The null line and the line <br>
started with # will be ignored. When you describe -@ option
in file, the argument file is referred recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">builtin arg ... <br>
Execute arg as a simple builtin command. When the same named
function is defined, the function will not be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cd [-LP] [dir] <br>
chdir [-LP] [dir] <br>
Change the current directory in fd to dir. If dir is
omitted, it moves to the directory indicated by HOME the
internal variable. If you specify the pathname as <br>
&quot;.&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;@&quot;,
it behaves like as LOG_DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If -L is specified, the logical
pathname following symbolic links is used. If -P is
specified, the physical pathname following no symbolic links
is used. Other&acirc; <br>
wise, the physical option for set the builtin command is
effective.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">checkid [file ...] <br>
Calculate the unique ID of the specified file and display
it, according to the MD5 algorithm in RFC1321. When you
specify multiple files, the IDs of all specified <br>
files are calculated and displayed. When you specify
nothing, the ID of running fd itself is displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Since this algorithm is
guaranteed to be secure, it is available to confirm the
identity of files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cls Clear the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">command [-p | -v | -V] arg ...
<br>
Execute arg as a simple command. When the same named
function is defined, the function will not be executed. If
-p is specified, the default value of PATH is used <br>
to search the path. If -v is specified, the absolute path
for arg is displayed instead of executing arg. In this case,
arg the builtin command will cause simply <br>
its name. If -V is specified, verbose description for arg is
displayed as same as type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">continue n Resume the next
iteration in the loop, it is used in the for statement and
so on. If n is specified, it resumes the next iteration in
the loop n - 1 levels out of <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">copy [-ABVY-Y] src [-AB] [+ src2
[-AB] [+ ...]] [dest [-AB]] <br>
Copy the file indicated by src into the file or the
directory indicated by dest. When dest indicates a
directory, the filename in the destination is src. If dest
<br>
is omitted, it is copied into the current directory. You can
specify multiple source files by describing to separate them
with +, or by using the wildcard. When <br>
you separate them with +, those files are concatenated and
copied. When you use the wildcard, they are copied one by
one in case that the destination is a direc&acirc; <br>
tory, and they are concatenated in case that the destination
is a file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify -A, it is
treated as the ASCII text file. When you specify -B, it is
treated as the binary file. When you specify -V, it is
verified to copy. <br>
When you specify -Y, it doesn&rsquo;t prompts for confirming
to overwrite into the destination. When you specify --Y, it
prompts for confirmation before overwriting into <br>
the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tree Screen <br>
Since representing the whole file system in tree structure
takes too many time, only the directories which are direct
ancestors and the direct sub directories are displayed, <br>
first in the tree screen. In the directories which are
direct ancestors, the other sub directories (if exists) are
grouped as &quot;...&quot;. These grouped sub directories
will be <br>
expanded automatically when a cursor is placed on its
position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The sub directories which are
not expanded yet are represented with &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;
trailing the filename, which shows as they are. Such
directory is never expanded until it is required to <br>
expand explicitly, then you should expand it by the
following key inputs before moving to any hidden sub
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the tree screen, the
following key inputs are available. <br>
Up, Down Move a cursor. <br>
Right Expand the sub directory on the cursor position. <br>
Tab Expand the sub directory on the cursor position
recursively. <br>
PageUp, PageDown <br>
Move a cursor by half screen. <br>
Home(&lt;), End(&gt;) <br>
Move a cursor to the top/bottom of tree. <br>
? Move a cursor to the current directory. <br>
Bs Move a cursor to the parent directory. <br>
Left Group sub directories of the directory on the cursor
position, or move a cursor to the parent directory. <br>
(, ) Move a cursor to the previous/next directory among the

A - Z Move a cursor to the directory whose name starts with
the character or its lowercase. <br>
l Change the directory tree into the specified directory.
Moving to the floppy drive is also available. <br>
^L Redraw the tree structure. <br>
Return Select the directory. <br>
Esc Cancel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When directories are recursively
expanded, the machine operation is so late that it maybe
seems to freeze. In this case, you can input any key while
operating. If key input is <br>
recognized while expanding directories, expanding has been
stopped at that moment in spite of not finishing. Even if
key repeat keeps effective, any operation will be delayed
<br>
for this function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Archive Browser <br>
When the launcher is invoked on the position of the file
whose extension is registered to associate with an archive
browser, the archive browser screen has come. In this
screen, <br>
you can browse files in the archive file as well as in the
normal directory. But you cannot use the following internal
commands in this screen. <br>
LOG_TOP ATTR_FILE COPY_FILE MOVE_FILE <br>
DELETE_FILE DELETE_DIR RENAME_FILE MAKE_DIR <br>
WRITE_DIR TREE_DIR EDIT_FILE LOG_TREE <br>
COPY_TREE MOVE_TREE FIND_DIR ATTR_DIR <br>
SYMLINK_MODE DOTFILE_MODE FILEFLG_MODE SPLIT_WINDOW <br>
KILL_WINDOW</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you want to register a new
archive browser, you must describe the format listed by the
archiver as the following representation. One format string
represents the format for <br>
1 file in the list. <br>
%a Field which indicates a file mode <br>
%u Field which indicates UID of a file <br>
%g Field which indicates GID of a file <br>
%s Field which indicates a file size <br>
%y Field which indicates a file creation year <br>
%m Field which indicates a file creation month <br>
(No concerning if numeric or alphabetical) <br>
%d Field which indicates a file creation day <br>
%w Field which indicates a file creation week (ignored) <br>
%t Field which indicates a file creation time <br>
(&quot;HH:MM:SS&quot; form, MM and SS can be lacking) <br>
%p Field which indicates a file creation am/pm <br>
%B Field which indicates a major device ID <br>
%b Field which indicates a minor device ID <br>
%/str/ Field which indicates a type is directory <br>
when this field string is str <br>
(case insensitive) <br>
%!str! 0 or more continuous fields <br>
which consists of the string str <br>
(case insensitive) <br>
%f Field which indicates a filename <br>
%x Field which is needless (ignored) <br>
%% % itself <br>
Newline <br>
Space Tab 0 or more characters of spaces or tabs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this description, the field
means the area separated by spaces, tabs or newlines. When
the string which indicates each information is separated by
these characters, you can <br>
simply describe the above string which indicates that field.
When the string is separated by another character, you
should describe the above string with that separator. You
<br>
can describe to indicate the field length as numeric, such
as %10a. This example means that the field which indicates a
file mode consists of 10 characters. If you describe it <br>
with a character * as the field length instead of numeric,
such as %*f, the string to the end of line is regarded as a
field, in which any space and tab will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a field may have the
different meanings according to situation, you should
describe it quoted with { }, such as %{yt}. This example
means that this field indicates a cre&acirc; <br>
ation year or a creation time. When the information for 1
file consists of multiple lines, you should place a on the
position of newline in the format string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, the following are
the format strings for the list of some archivers. While
some spaces are used here for easiness to see, these spaces
are not always necessary <br>
because any space between fields is ignored. <br>
&lsquo;lha l&rsquo; &quot;%9a %u/%g %s %x %m %d %{yt}
%f&quot; <br>
&lsquo;lha v&rsquo; (MS-DOS) &quot;%f1s %x %x %y-%m-%d
%t&quot; <br>
&lsquo;tar tvf&rsquo; (BSD) &quot;%9a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y
%f&quot; <br>
&lsquo;tar tvf&rsquo; (SVR4) &quot;%a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y
%f&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you register archive browsers
with above format, in the builtin command of EXECUTE_SH or
in the initial configuration file, you can use the archive
browser which is not pre&acirc; <br>
pared by default. But, if you want to execute or view files
in the archive file, you must register the archiver command
for the archive file, too, don&rsquo;t forget this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">On some OS, tar(1) may output
the Japanese timestamp when japanese is substituted for LANG
the environment variable. Since fd cannot analyze the
representation like this, you <br>
should describe &lsquo;export LANG=C&rsquo; in the initial
configuration file, or specify LANG in the description of
listing command, such as &lsquo;LANG=C tar tvf&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Floppy Drive (UNIX) <br>
You can access the MS-DOS formatted floppy disk, by
representing to prefix &quot;c:&quot; to the directory name.
But, it is necessary to register the floppy drive and set
DOSDRIVE the <br>
internal variable which makes this function effective, in
advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each registered drive is
distinguished with the drive name. You should tag the
physically different drive as the different drive name. When
the same physical drive supports <br>
multiple formats, you can register each format with the same
drive name, or the different drive name each other. If you
tag the same drive name, the justice of the format is <br>
tried in registered order, so that you should register the
format which you often use in the first place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each drive of the floppy drive
has the its own current directory. The default value of this
is a root directory, and the current directory is moved back
to a root directory <br>
again whenever you change a floppy disk. When you describe
the directory name as starting with &rsquo;/&rsquo; after
&rsquo;:&rsquo;, it means the absolute path representation
of that drive. If this <br>
&rsquo;/&rsquo; is not exist, it means the relative path
representation from the current directory of that drive,
don&rsquo;t forget this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regrettably, some internal
commands like as WRITE_DIR, INFO_FILESYS cannot support the
floppy drive. Some filenames are renamed when they are
copied from UNIX for reason of the <br>
filename length limit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you use a lowercase letter
as the drive name, you can access it as the floppy drive
which can treat the Long File Name (LFN) for MS-Windows
formatted floppy disk. In this <br>
case, you can copy a file with a long filename on UNIX as it
is. But, when the UNICODE translation table fd-unicd.tbl
does not exist in the same directory as the invoked fd <br>
exists, any Kanji filename cannot be treated as LFN
representation. Reversely, when you use a uppercase letter
as the drive name, LFN is ignored and 8+3 formed filename is
<br>
treated. MS-DOS version inherits this specification by the
case of a drive name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URL Drive (UNIX) <br>
You can access remote services on the network, by
representing the URL string as the directory name. The URL
format is scheme://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/directory/.
You <br>
can specify ftp or http as scheme. You can specify the name
or IP address of the remote host as host. You can specify
the TCP port number as port. If port is omitted, the <br>
default port number is used. The default port number for ftp
is 21, and the default port number for http is 80. You can
specify account information to connect the remote host <br>
as user and password. If user is omitted, the anonymous FTP
connection will be used with ftp, or you will be queried as
needed with http. If password is omitted, you will be <br>
queried as needed. But, it is necessary to set URLDRIVE the
internal variable which makes this function effective, in
advance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regrettably, some internal
commands cannot support the URL drive, for the sake of
restrictions of the FTP and HTTP protocols or settings of
the host side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String Input <br>
When you input the string, such as the pathname, the
following key inputs are available. The kind of referred
history differs with the input string required. In the split
win&acirc; <br>
dow mode, the current directory of another window is always
placed on the top of the pathname history. <br>
Left, Right <br>
Move a cursor. <br>
Up, Down Refer the previous histories (only commands and
pathnames), or move a cursor. <br>
Beg Move a cursor to the beginning of string. <br>
Eol Move a cursor to the end of string. <br>
Ins Switch a input method to the insert/overwrite mode.
(Default value is the insert mode.) <br>
Del Delete a character on the cursor position. <br>
Bs Delete a character before the cursor position. <br>
DelLine Delete a string after the cursor position. <br>
InsLine Treat the next input character as it is, effective
to input control characters. <br>
Enter Insert a filename of the file on the cursor position.
<br>
PageUp Convert a character on the cursor position to
uppercase. <br>
PageDown Convert a character on the cursor position to
lowercase. <br>
Tab Complete a pathname, a command name or a variable name
on the cursor position. <br>
When there are two or more completion choices, inputting
this continuously can display the completion choice list.
Except for command line in the internal shell, you <br>
can make a choice from this list with cursor keys and
[Return]. <br>
^L Redraw the input string. <br>
^S, ^R Search the previous histories (only commands and
pathnames) incrementally. <br>
Return Decide the input, or decide the choice in the
completion choice list. <br>
Esc Cancel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The inputted string is expanded
before evaluation as following. These expansions are also
valid in the string of command macros. But these expansions
are restrained in the <br>
string quoted with the quotation mark &rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~ Indicate your home directory,

particular that it is not suitable for those who don&rsquo;t
use vi editor everyday.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kana-Kanji IME (UNIX) <br>
You can input strings in the Kana-Kanji IME mode, if you
input the key specified by IMEKEY or select
&quot;Kanji&quot; from the pseudo terminal menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The translation performance will
depend on the Kana-Kanji translation dictionary fd-dict.tbl.
When it does not exist in the same directory as the invoked
fd exists, translation <br>
to Kanji will not be available. The standard installed
dictionary file is the Tan-Kanji dictionary, which can
support only the Tan-Kanji translation. The dictionaly such
as the <br>
pubdic, which includes the Hinsi information, will bring you
the Tan-Bunsetsu translation. The Ren-Bunsetsu translation
is not be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Kana-Kanji IME mode, the
following key inputs are available. <br>
Space Trancelate to Kanji, or select the next translation
candidate. <br>
Left, Right <br>
Up, Down Move a cursor in the list of the translation
candidate. <br>
Bs, Del Delete a character before the cursor position. <br>

Kanji. Then the menu will be desplayed to select Kanji whose
<br>
reading starts with the Kana.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Parameter Macros <br>
You can use the following parameter macros in the string
which is used for the registration of command macros and for
executing command. But, you cannot use them in the
func&acirc; <br>
tions, the input file for source command, and the initial
configuration file, then you should use evalmacro command
when you want to use any parameter macro in them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%C The filename on the cursor
position. Or, it indicates the archive filename, in the
macro to register the archiver command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%X The filename except its
extension on the cursor position. Or, it indicates the
archive filename except its extension, in the macro to
register the archiver command. <br>
Only the last one extension is removed. T, TA, M trailing %X
are replaced by %T, %TA, %M except its extension
respectively. On MS-DOS version, you can describe a
trail&acirc; <br>
ing S as well as them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%P The pathname of the current
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%K Prompt and return to fd after
a command is finished. But, the meaning of %K is reverse in
EXECUTE_FILE and EXECUTE_SH; it prompts by default and
doesn&rsquo;t prompt if %K is <br>
specified. You can never specify to prompt in macros to
register the archive browser of the launcher and macros to
register the archiver command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%T List marked files separated
by spaces as possible. When files are so many that the
command line length exceeds the OS limitation, the rest of
marked files are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%TA List marked files as well as
%T, and repeat the same command for spilt files to complete
all marked files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%M Execute the same command as

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%N Restrain the filename
addition even if the parameter is omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%R Make you input the additional
parameter in executing a macro, if the length of command
string has enough margin. The cursor position in input is
placed on the position <br>
of %R in a macro. But, %R is ignored in macros to register
the archive browser of the launcher, macros to register the
archiver command, and EXECUTE_FILE, EXECUTE_SH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%S The 8+3 formed filename with
which the LFN formed filename on the cursor position is
replaced. You can use it when you use external commands
which can treat only 8+3 <br>

executing command, or when %N macro is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customize <br>
You can customize fd as the following ways. If you specify
some configuration in multiple ways overlapped, it is prior
in this order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Executing builtin commands with
EXECUTE_SH <br>
You can execute builtin commands for each registration for
the internal variable definition, the environment variable
definition, the alias definition, the function <br>
definition, the key binding, the keymap changing, the
launcher registration, the archiver command registration,
and the floppy drive registration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customizer <br>
EDIT_CONFIG command is available for the internal variable
definition, the key binding, the keymap changing, the
launcher registration, the archiver command regis&acirc;
<br>
tration, and the floppy drive registration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Command line options <br>
You can specify the command line options as
&lsquo;-NAME=value&rsquo; form, to define the internal
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.fd2rc You can prepare the
initial configuration file .fd2rc on your home directory, to
execute the command which is written in this file, before
the startup of fd. You <br>
can describe builtin commands and external commands in it to
set up each configuration. Yet, when fdsh is invoked as a
login shell, .fdshrc is read instead of <br>
.fd2rc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The initial configuration file
/etc/fd2rc which is prepared by a system administrator is
read preceding .fd2rc and .fdshrc. If this file exists, the
initial config&acirc; <br>
urations prepared by a system administrator are valid unless
you intentionally delete them in .fd2rc and .fdshrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(On MS-DOS version, these
filenames are $HOME2.rc, $HOMEsh.rc and ~FD2rc.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment variables <br>
Any valid variable name as the internal variable can be
valid to be defined as the environment variable in advance.
But the internal variable is always prior to the <br>
environment variable in fd. When the same named environment
variable is used in another application, you can also use
the name which FD_ is prefixed to each envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable for fd only. This environment variable with
FD_ is always prior to the environment variable without it,
then the definition of the environment <br>
variable with FD_ is prior to the definition of the internal
variable without FD_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Customizer <br>
EDIT_CONFIG command invokes the customizer to set up
configurations interactively. You can select the category
with the right/left cursor key, and select the item with the
<br>
up/down cursor key, and change its content with [Return].
When you finish to change, exit from the customizer with
[Esc].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following categories are
prepared. <br>
Variables Change the value of internal variables. The input
method is different with the variable, then you should input
following the guidance on screen. <br>
Key bind Change the command bound to each key. When you
newly bind a command to the key with no binding, you should
select &quot;NewEntry&quot;. If you select &quot;Delete
bind&quot;, the <br>
existent key binding is deleted. <br>
Key map Change the key code mapping for each special key. If
you push [Esc] when you are prompted to push the key, the
existent key mapping is deleted. (UNIX) <br>
Launcher Change the launcher registration for each
extension. When you newly register a launcher for the
extension with no registration, you should select
&quot;NewEntry&quot;. If <br>
you input a null line when you input a command for the
launcher, the existent launcher registration is deleted.
<br>
Archiver Change the archiver command registration for each
extension. When you newly register a archiver command for
the extension with no registration, you should select <br>
&quot;NewEntry&quot;. If you input a null line both when you
input a command for pack/unpack, the existent archiver
command registration is deleted. <br>
DOS drive Change the floppy drive registration. When you
newly register a floppy drive for the drive name with no
registration, you should select &quot;NewEntry&quot;. If you
input a <br>
null line when you input a device name, the existent floppy
drive registration is deleted. (UNIX) <br>
Save Save the configurations changed with the customizer
into a file, or cancel configurations to restore to the
previous state. <br>
Cancel Cancel the changed configurations within the
specified categories, and restore to the state before the
customizer is invoked. <br>
Clear Cancel all the configurations within the specified
categories, and restore to the default state. <br>
Load Load configurations from the specified file. <br>
Save Save all the configurations within the specified
categories to the specified file. <br>
Overwrite Overwrite all the configurations within the
specified categories to the specified existent file. The
original configurations which has existed in the file <br>
are parsed, and the configuration for the same target is
overwritten at the same place as possible. The
configurations which are not set up at present and <br>
the configurations which are not supported by the customizer
are remains as it is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you specify the range of
categories, all categories are selected by default, then you
should turn on/off each selection with [Space] and decide
with [Return].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you try to exit from the
customizer without saving after changing any configuration,
you will be confirmed whether if it is right to exit without
saving. While the changed <br>
configurations themselves are valid even if you exit without
saving, when you want them to be valid in the next invoked
fd, you must save them into the initial configuration <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
The following environment variables are valid in fd. These
environment variables can be valid if they are defined as
the internal variables. You can specify them as the command
<br>
line options in &lsquo;-NAME=value&rsquo; form. But the
variables followed by &acirc; cannot be use with the prefix
FD_ as the environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ADJTTY Reset the terminal mode
forcedly to the normal state, when fd is finished. Invoking
fd can adjust the terminal rightly from the state displaying
broken characters. <br>
Any value except 0 and null effects valid. (UNIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANSICOLOR Colorize the file
display. When the terminal which you use supports the color
control escape sequence of ANSI standard, each file is
displayed with color according <br>
to its file type. If the value is 1, it is colorized. If the
value is 2, the background color is forced to be black, for
the case that the foreground color is the <br>
same as the background color and indistinguishable. If the
value is 3, the foreground color is forced to be black.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ANSIPALETTE Specify color
palette according to file type when the file display is
colorized. This variable value consists of a numeric value
whose maximum columns are 11 col&acirc; <br>
umns. The number of each column shows a color number, which
specifies the color of file type corresponding with its
column. The following are correspondence of <br>
the column number to the file type. <br>
1 normal file <br>
2 background <br>
3 directory <br>
4 unwritable file <br>
5 unreadable file <br>
6 symbolic link <br>
7 socket (or system file on MS-DOS) <br>
8 FIFO (or label on MS-DOS) <br>
9 block device <br>
10 character device <br>
11 executable file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following are the meaning of
color number specified on each column. <br>
0 black <br>
1 red <br>
2 green <br>
3 yellow <br>
4 blue <br>
5 magenta <br>
6 cyan <br>
7 white <br>
8 default color for foreground <br>
9 default color for background</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The color number 8 is forced to
be black, if the value of ANSICOLOR the variable is 3. The
color number 9 is forced to be black, if the value of
ANSICOLOR the <br>
variable is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the columns are less than
11 or this variable is not set, the standard color palette
will be applied for the file type corresponding with the
following col&acirc; <br>
umns. The standard color palette is described with the above
color number as 89624351888.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AUTOUPDATE Specify the interval
in seconds to update automatically the browser screen or the
tree screen. When the key input idles for the specified
seconds, the current <br>
information of file list will be updated. If this value is
0, the screen will never updated automatically. The default
value is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BASICCUSTOM Limit the internal
variables for configuration only to basic variables in the
customizer, to hide advanced variables. Any value except 0
and null effects valid.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CDPATH&acirc; Specify the search
path when an argument of cd the builtin command does not
start with /. You can specify multiple paths separating with
&rsquo;:&rsquo;. No search path is <br>
specified by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COLUMNS&acirc; The variable for
the columns of a terminal screen. If some value is set, this
value will be replaced automatically according to changing
the screen size. If no <br>
value is set, this value will remain unset.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMSPEC Specify the shell used
to invoke a batch file. If undefined, the shell defined by
SHELL the internal variable or M is used. (DOS)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYCMD&acirc; Specify the
default options used by copy the builtin command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFCOLUMNS Specify the columns

it is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFKCODE Specify the system
default Kanji code. The arguments passed to external
commands invoked from fd will be converted into the
specified Kanji code. When you use <br>
macros such as %C and %JJ, it will be converted into the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIRCOUNTLIMIT Specify the
maximum number of files read from the directory in the tree
screen. When the directory trailed by &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; has
no sub directory, the expanded result is not <br>
changed. If the number of files (including directories) in
the directory is within this value, the directory with no
sub directory is not trailed &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; from the
<br>
first. Moreover, the file list in the directory displayed on
the right of screen is not displayed over this value. If
this value is 0, you can realize a comfort&acirc; <br>

first time, in 1989. Fd was created for UNIX from scratch
following that <br>
implementation, in 1995.</p>

keys and special keys. The sequence compatible with VT200 is
assigned as the default sequence which is not registered in

termcap(5), and when the terminal cannot support this, the
key receipt or the screen control due to be brought by this
is not available.</p>
