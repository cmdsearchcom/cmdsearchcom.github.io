<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Darcs is a free, open source revision control system. It
is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Distributed:
Every user has access to the full command set, removing
boundaries between server and client or committer and
non&acirc;committers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Interactive:
Darcs is easy to learn and efficient to use because it asks
you questions in response to simple commands, giving you
choices in your work flow. You can choose to <br>
record one change in a file, while ignoring another. As you
update from upstream, you can review each patch name, even
the full &lsquo;diff&rsquo; for interesting patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Smart:
Originally developed by physicist David Roundy, darcs is
based on a unique algebra of patches. This smartness lets
you respond to changing demands in ways that would <br>
otherwise not be possible. Learn more about spontaneous
branches with darcs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
Different options are accepted by different Darcs commands.
Each command&rsquo;s most important options are listed in
the COMMANDS section. For a full list of all options
accepted by <br>
a particular command, run &lsquo;darcs command
--help&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selecting Patches: <br>
The --patches option yields patches with names matching an
*extended* regular expression. See regex(7) for details. The
--matches option yields patches that match a logical <br>
(Boolean) expression: one or more primitive expressions
combined by grouping (parentheses) and the complement (not),
conjunction (and) and disjunction (or) operators. The C <br>
notation for logic operators (!, &amp;&amp; and ||) can also
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- --patches=regex is a synonym
for --matches=&rsquo;name regex&rsquo; - --hash=HASH is a
synonym for --matches=&rsquo;hash HASH&rsquo; - --from-patch
and --to-patch are synonyms for <br>
--from-match=&rsquo;name... and --to-match=&rsquo;name... -
--from-patch and --to-match can be unproblematically
combined: <br>
&lsquo;darcs log
--from-patch=&rsquo;html.*documentation&rsquo;
--to-match=&rsquo;date 20040212&rsquo;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following primitive Boolean
expressions are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">- exact - check a literal string
against the patch name. - name - check a regular expression
against the patch name. - author - check a regular
expression against the author <br>
name. - hunk - check a regular expression against the
contents of a hunk patch. - comment - check a regular
expression against the log message. - hash - match a full
hash or a <br>
prefix for a patch. - date - match the patch date. - touch -
match file paths for a patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs log --match &rsquo;exact
&quot;Resolve issue17: use dynamic memory
allocation.&quot;&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;name issue17&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;name &quot;^[Rr]esolve
issue17&gt;&quot;&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;author &quot;David
Roundy&quot;&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;author droundy&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;author droundy@darcs.net&rsquo;
<br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;hunk &quot;foo = 2&quot;&rsquo;
<br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;hunk &quot;^instance .* Foo

darcs log --match &rsquo;comment &quot;prevent
deadlocks&quot;&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;hash

darcs log --match &rsquo;hash c7195&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;date &quot;2006-04-02
22:41&quot;&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;date &quot;tea time

darcs log --match &rsquo;touch src/foo.c&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;touch src/&rsquo; <br>
darcs log --match &rsquo;touch
&quot;src/*.(c|h)&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
darcs help [&lt;darcs_command&gt; [darcs_subcommand]] <br>
Without arguments, &lsquo;darcs help&lsquo; prints a
categorized list of darcs commands and a short description
of each one. With an extra argument, &lsquo;darcs help
foo&lsquo; prints detailed <br>
help about the darcs command foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Most used/starting out: <br>
darcs initialize [&lt;directory&gt;] <br>
The &lsquo;darcs initialize&lsquo; command creates an empty
repository in the current directory. This repository lives
in a new &lsquo;_darcs&lsquo; directory, which stores
version control metadata <br>
and settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any existing files and
subdirectories become UNSAVED changes: record them with
&lsquo;darcs record --look-for-adds&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, patches of the new
repository are in the darcs-2 semantics. However it is
possible to create a repository in darcs-1 semantics with
the flag &lsquo;--darcs-1&lsquo;, <br>
althought this is not recommended except for sharing patches
with a project that uses patches in the darcs-1
semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Initialize is commonly
abbreviated to &lsquo;init&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs add &lt;file|directory&gt;
... <br>
Generally the working tree contains both files that should
be version controlled (such as source code) and files that
Darcs should ignore (such as executables compiled from <br>
the source code). The &lsquo;darcs add&lsquo; command is
used to tell Darcs which files to version control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When an existing project is
first imported into a Darcs repository, it is common to run
&lsquo;darcs add -r *&lsquo; or &lsquo;darcs record
-l&lsquo; to add all initial source files into darcs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Adding symbolic links (symlinks)
is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs will ignore all files and
folders that look &quot;boring&quot;. The
&lsquo;--boring&lsquo; option overrides this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs will not add file if
another file in the same folder has the same name, except
for case. The &lsquo;--case-ok&lsquo; option overrides this
behaviour. Windows and OS X usually use <br>
filesystems that do not allow files a folder to have the
same name except for case (for example, &lsquo;ReadMe&lsquo;
and &lsquo;README&lsquo;). If &lsquo;--case-ok&lsquo; is
used, the repository might be <br>
unusable on those systems!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs whatsnew
[file|directory]... <br>
The &lsquo;darcs whatsnew&lsquo; command lists unrecorded
changes to the working tree. If you specify a set of files
and directories, only unrecorded changes to those files and
directo&acirc; <br>
ries are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the &lsquo;--summary&lsquo;
option, the changes are condensed to one line per file, with
mnemonics to indicate the nature and extent of the change.
The &lsquo;--look-for-adds&lsquo; option <br>
causes candidates for &lsquo;darcs add&lsquo; to be included
in the summary output. Summary mnemonics are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* &lsquo;A f&lsquo; and &lsquo;A
d/&lsquo; respectively mean an added file or directory. *
&lsquo;R f&lsquo; and &lsquo;R d/&lsquo; respectively mean a
removed file or directory. * &lsquo;M f -N +M rP&lsquo;
means a modified file, <br>
with &lsquo;N&lsquo; lines deleted, &lsquo;M&lsquo; <br>
lines added, and &lsquo;P&lsquo; lexical replacements. *
&lsquo;f -&gt; g&lsquo; means a moved file or directory. *
&lsquo;a f&lsquo; and &lsquo;a d/&lsquo; respectively mean a
new, but unadded, file or <br>
directory, when using &lsquo;--look-for-adds&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An exclamation mark (!) as in
&lsquo;R! foo.c&lsquo;, means the hunk is known to <br>
conflict with a hunk in another patch. The phrase
&lsquo;duplicated&lsquo; <br>
means the hunk is known to be identical to a hunk in another
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;--machine-readable&lsquo; option implies
&lsquo;--summary&lsquo; while making it more parsable.
Modified files are only shown as &lsquo;M f&lsquo;, and
moves are shown in two lines: &lsquo;F f&lsquo; and &lsquo;T
g&lsquo; <br>
(as in &rsquo;From f To g&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, &lsquo;darcs
whatsnew&lsquo; uses Darcs&rsquo; internal format for
changes. To see some context (unchanged lines) around each
change, use the &lsquo;--unified&lsquo; option. To view
changes <br>
in conventional &lsquo;diff&lsquo; format, use the
&lsquo;darcs diff&lsquo; command; but note that &lsquo;darcs
whatsnew&lsquo; is faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command exits
unsuccessfully (returns a non-zero exit status) if there are
no unrecorded changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs record [file|directory]...
<br>
The &lsquo;darcs record&lsquo; command is used to create a
patch from changes in the working tree. If you specify a set
of files and directories, changes to other files will be
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Every patch has a name, an
optional description, an author and a date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs will launch a text editor
(see &lsquo;darcs help environment&lsquo;) after the
interactive selection, to let you enter the patch name
(first line) and the patch description (subse&acirc; <br>
quent lines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can supply the patch name in
advance with the &lsquo;-m&lsquo; option, in which case no
text editor is launched, unless you use
&lsquo;--edit-long-comment&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The patch description is an
optional block of free-form text. It is used to supply
additional information that doesn&rsquo;t fit in the patch
name. For example, it might include <br>
a rationale of WHY the change was necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A technical difference between
patch name and patch description, is that matching with the
flag &lsquo;-p&lsquo; is only done on patch names.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
&lsquo;--logfile&lsquo; option allows you to supply a file
that already contains the patch name and description. This
is useful if a previous record failed and left a <br>
&lsquo;_darcs/patch_description.txt&lsquo; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each patch is attributed to its
author, usually by email address (for example, &lsquo;Fred
Bloggs &lt;fred@example.net&gt;&lsquo;). Darcs looks in
several places for this author string: the <br>
&lsquo;--author&lsquo; option, the files
&lsquo;_darcs/prefs/author&lsquo; (in the repository) and
&lsquo;~/.darcs/author&lsquo; (in your home directory), and
the environment variables &lsquo;$DARCS_EMAIL&lsquo; and
<br>
&lsquo;$EMAIL&lsquo;. If none of those exist, Darcs will
prompt you for an author string and write it to
&lsquo;~/.darcs/author&lsquo;. Note that if you have more
than one email address, you can <br>
put them all in &lsquo;~/.darcs/author&lsquo;, one author
per line. Darcs will still prompt you for an author, but it
allows you to select from the list, or to type in an
alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to manually define
any extra dependencies for your patch, you can use the
&lsquo;--ask-deps&lsquo; flag. Some dependencies may be
automatically inferred from the patch&rsquo;s con&acirc;
<br>
tent and cannot be removed. A patch with specific
dependencies can be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The patch date is generated
automatically. It can only be spoofed by using the
&lsquo;--pipe&lsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you run record with the
&lsquo;--pipe&lsquo; option, you will be prompted for the
patch date, author, and the long comment. The long comment
will extend until the end of file or stdin <br>
is reached. This interface is intended for scripting darcs,
in particular for writing repository conversion scripts. The
prompts are intended mostly as a useful guide (since <br>
scripts won&rsquo;t need them), to help you understand the
input format. Here&rsquo;s an example of what the
&lsquo;--pipe&lsquo; prompts look like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What is the date? Mon Nov 15
13:38:01 EST 2004 <br>
Who is the author? David Roundy <br>
What is the log? One or more comment lines</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a test command has been
defined with &lsquo;darcs setpref&lsquo;, attempting to
record a patch will cause the test command to be run in a
clean copy of the working tree (that is, <br>
including only recorded changes). If the test fails, you
will be offered to abort the record operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;--set-scripts-executable&lsquo; option causes scripts
to be made executable in the clean copy of the working tree,
prior to running the test. See &lsquo;darcs clone&lsquo; for
an expla&acirc; <br>
nation of the script heuristic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your test command is
tediously slow (e.g. &lsquo;make all&lsquo;) and you are
recording several patches in a row, you may wish to use
&lsquo;--no-test&lsquo; to skip all but the final test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see some context (unchanged
lines) around each change, use the &lsquo;--unified&lsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs clone &lt;repository&gt;
[&lt;directory&gt;] <br>
Clone creates a copy of a repository. The optional second
argument specifies a destination directory for the new copy;
if omitted, it is inferred from the source location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default Darcs will copy every
patch from the original repository. If you expect the
original repository to remain accessible, you can use
&lsquo;--lazy&lsquo; to avoid copying <br>
patches until they are needed (&rsquo;copy on
demand&rsquo;). This is particularly useful when copying a
remote repository with a long history that you don&rsquo;t
care about.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When cloning locally, Darcs
automatically uses hard linking where possible. As well as
saving time and space, this enables to move or delete the
original repository without <br>
affecting the copy. Hard linking requires that the copy be
on the same filesystem as the original repository, and that
the filesystem support hard linking. This includes <br>
NTFS, HFS+ and all general-purpose Unix filesystems (such as
ext, UFS and ZFS). FAT does not support hard links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When cloning from a remote
location, Darcs will look for and attempt to use packs
created by &lsquo;darcs optimize http&lsquo; in the remote
repository. Packs are single big files that <br>
can be downloaded faster than many little files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs clone will not copy
unrecorded changes to the source repository&rsquo;s working
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can copy a repository to a
ssh url, in which case the new repository will always be
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is often desirable to make a
copy of a repository that excludes some patches. For
example, if releases are tagged then &lsquo;darcs clone
--tag .&lsquo; would make a copy of the <br>
repository as at the latest release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An untagged repository state can
still be identified unambiguously by a context file, as
generated by &lsquo;darcs log --context&lsquo;. Given the
name of such a file, the &lsquo;--context&lsquo; <br>
option will create a repository that includes only the
patches from that context. When a user reports a bug in an
unreleased version of your project, the recommended way to
<br>
find out exactly what version they were running is to have
them include a context file in the bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can also make a copy of an
untagged state using the &lsquo;--to-patch&lsquo; or
&lsquo;--to-match&lsquo; options, which exclude patches
*after* the first matching patch. Because these options <br>
treat the set of patches as an ordered sequence, you may get
different results after reordering with &lsquo;darcs
optimize reorder&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;--set-scripts-executable&lsquo; option causes scripts
to be made executable in the working tree. A script is any
file that starts with a shebang (&quot;#!&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs pull [repository]... <br>
Pull is used to bring patches made in another repository
into the current repository (that is, either the one in the
current directory, or the one specified with the <br>
&lsquo;--repodir&lsquo; option). Pull accepts arguments,
which are URLs from which to pull, and when called without
an argument, pull will use the repository specified at <br>
&lsquo;_darcs/prefs/defaultrepo&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default
(&lsquo;--union&lsquo;) behavior is to pull any patches that
are in any of the specified repositories. If you specify the
&lsquo;--intersection&lsquo; flag, darcs will only pull
those <br>
patches which are present in all source repositories. If you
specify the &lsquo;--complement&lsquo; flag, darcs will only
pull elements in the first repository that do not exist in
any <br>
of the remaining repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lsquo;--reorder&lsquo; is
supplied, the set of patches that exist only in the current
repository is brought at the top of the current history.
This will work even if there are no new <br>
patches to pull.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See &lsquo;darcs help
apply&lsquo; for detailed description of many options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs push [repository] <br>
Push is the opposite of pull. Push allows you to copy
patches from the current repository into another
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you give the
&lsquo;--apply-as&lsquo; flag, darcs will use
&lsquo;sudo&lsquo; to apply the patches as a different user.
This can be useful if you want to set up a system where
several users can <br>
modify the same repository, but you don&rsquo;t want to
allow them full write access. This isn&rsquo;t secure
against skilled malicious attackers, but at least can
protect your reposi&acirc; <br>
tory from clumsy, inept or lazy users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;darcs push&lsquo; will
compress the patch data before sending it to a remote
location via ssh. This works as long as the remote darcs is
not older than version 2.5. If you get <br>
errors that indicate a corrupt patch bundle, you should try
again with the &lsquo;--no-compress&lsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preparing patches before
recording: <br>
darcs move &lt;source&gt; ... &lt;destination&gt; <br>
Darcs cannot reliably distinguish between a file being
deleted and a new one added, and a file being moved.
Therefore Darcs always assumes the former, and provides the
<br>
&lsquo;darcs mv&lsquo; command to let Darcs know when you
want the latter. This command will also move the file in the
working tree (unlike &lsquo;darcs remove&lsquo;), unless it
has already been <br>
moved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs will not rename a file if
another file in the same folder has the same name, except
for case. The &lsquo;--case-ok&lsquo; option overrides this
behaviour. Windows and OS X usu&acirc; <br>
ally use filesystems that do not allow files a folder to
have the same name except for case (for example,
&lsquo;ReadMe&lsquo; and &lsquo;README&lsquo;). If
&lsquo;--case-ok&lsquo; is used, the repository <br>
might be unusable on those systems!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs remove
&lt;file|directory&gt; ... <br>
The &lsquo;darcs remove&lsquo; command exists primarily for
symmetry with &lsquo;darcs add&lsquo;, as the normal way to
remove a file from version control is simply to delete it
from the working <br>
tree. This command is only useful in the unusual case where
one wants to record a removal patch WITHOUT deleting the
copy in the working tree (which can be re-added).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that applying a removal
patch to a repository (e.g. by pulling the patch) will
ALWAYS affect the working tree of that repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs replace &lt;old&gt;
&lt;new&gt; &lt;file&gt; ... <br>
In addition to line-based patches, Darcs supports a limited
form of lexical substitution. Files are treated as sequences
of words, and each occurrence of the old word is <br>
replaced by the new word. This is intended to provide a
clean way to rename a function or variable. Such renamings
typically affect lines all through the source code, so a
<br>
traditional line-based patch would be very likely to
conflict with other branches, requiring manual merging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files are tokenized according to
one simple rule: words are strings of valid token
characters, and everything between them (punctuation and
whitespace) is discarded. By <br>
default, valid token characters are letters, numbers and the
underscore (i.e. &lsquo;[A-Za-z0-9_]&lsquo;). However if the
old and/or new token contains either a hyphen or period,
BOTH <br>
hyphen and period are treated as valid (i.e.
&lsquo;[A-Za-z0-9_.-]&lsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The set of valid characters can
be customized using the &lsquo;--token-chars&lsquo; option.
The argument must be surrounded by square brackets. If a
hyphen occurs between two charac&acirc; <br>
ters in the set, it is treated as a set range. For example,
in most locales &lsquo;[A-Z]&lsquo; denotes all uppercase
letters. If the first character is a caret, valid tokens are
taken <br>
to be the complement of the remaining characters. For
example, &lsquo;[^:0&lsquo; could be used to match fields in
the passwd(5), where records and fields are separated by
newlines <br>
and colons respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you choose to use
&lsquo;--token-chars&lsquo;, you are STRONGLY encouraged to
do so consistently. The consequences of using multiple
replace patches with different &lsquo;--token-chars&lsquo;
<br>
arguments on the same file are not well tested nor well
understood.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default Darcs will refuse to
perform a replacement if the new token is already in use,
because the replacements would be not be distinguishable
from the existing tokens. <br>
This behaviour can be overridden by supplying the
&lsquo;--force&lsquo; option, but an attempt to &lsquo;darcs
rollback&lsquo; the resulting patch will affect these
existing tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tokenizer treats files as
byte strings, so it is not possible for
&lsquo;--token-chars&lsquo; to include multi-byte
characters, such as the non-ASCII parts of UTF-8. Similarly,
try&acirc; <br>
ing to replace a &quot;high-bit&quot; character from a
unibyte encoding will also result in replacement of the same
byte in files with different encodings. For example, an
acute a <br>
from ISO 8859-1 will also match an alpha from ISO
8859-7.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Due to limitations in the patch
file format, &lsquo;--token-chars&lsquo; arguments cannot
contain literal whitespace. For example, &lsquo;[^ ]&lsquo;
cannot be used to declare all characters <br>
except the space, tab and newline as valid within a word,
because it contains a literal space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike POSIX regex(7) bracket
expressions, character classes (such as
&lsquo;[[:alnum:]]&lsquo;) are NOT supported by
&lsquo;--token-chars&lsquo;, and will be silently treated as
a simple set of <br>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Querying the repository: <br>
darcs log [file|directory]... <br>
The &lsquo;darcs log&lsquo; command lists patches of the
current repository or, with &lsquo;--repo&lsquo;, a remote
repository. Without options or arguments, ALL patches will
be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When given files or directories
paths as arguments, only patches which affect those paths
are listed. This includes patches that happened to files
before they were moved or <br>
renamed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When given
&lsquo;--from-tag&lsquo; or &lsquo;--from-patch&lsquo;, only
patches since that tag or patch are listed. Similarly, the
&lsquo;--to-tag&lsquo; and &lsquo;--to-patch&lsquo; options
restrict the list to older <br>
patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;--last&lsquo; and
&lsquo;--max-count&lsquo; options both limit the number of
patches listed. The former applies BEFORE other filters,
whereas the latter applies AFTER other filters. For <br>
example &lsquo;darcs log foo.c --max-count 3&lsquo; will
print the last three patches that affect foo.c, whereas
&lsquo;darcs log --last 3 foo.c&lsquo; will, of the last
three patches, print only <br>
those that affect foo.c.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Four output formats exist. The
default is &lsquo;--human-readable&lsquo;. The slightly
different &lsquo;--machine-readable&lsquo; format enables to
see patch dependencies in non-interactive mode. <br>
You can also select &lsquo;--context&lsquo;, which is an
internal format that can be re-read by Darcs (e.g.
&lsquo;darcs clone --context&lsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, there is
&lsquo;--xml-output&lsquo;, which emits valid XML... unless
a the patch metadata (author, name or description) contains
a non-ASCII character and was recorded in a <br>
non-UTF8 locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs annotate [file|directory]
<br>
When &lsquo;darcs annotate&lsquo; is called on a file, it
will find the patch that last modified each line in that
file. This also works on directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;--machine-readable&lsquo; option can be used to
generate output for machine postprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs diff [file|directory]...
<br>
The &lsquo;darcs diff&lsquo; command compares two versions
of the working tree of the current repository. Without
options, the pristine (recorded) and unrecorded working
trees are com&acirc; <br>
pared. This is lower-level than the &lsquo;darcs
whatsnew&lsquo; command, since it outputs a line-by-line
diff, and it is also slower. As with &lsquo;darcs
whatsnew&lsquo;, if you specify files or <br>
directories, changes to other files are not listed. The
command always uses an external diff utility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the &lsquo;--patch&lsquo;
option, the comparison will be made between working trees
with and without that patch. Patches *after* the selected
patch are not present in either of the <br>
compared working trees. The &lsquo;--from-patch&lsquo; and
&lsquo;--to-patch&lsquo; options allow the set of patches in
the &lsquo;old&rsquo; and &lsquo;new&rsquo; working trees to
be specified separately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The associated tag and match
options are also understood, e.g. &lsquo;darcs diff
--from-tag 1.0 --to-tag 1.1&lsquo;. All these options assume
an ordering of the patch set, so results <br>
may be affected by operations such as &lsquo;darcs optimize
reorder&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">diff(1) is called with the
arguments &lsquo;-rN&lsquo;. The &lsquo;--unified&lsquo;
option causes &lsquo;-u&lsquo; to be passed to diff(1). An
additional argument can be passed using
&lsquo;--diff-opts&lsquo;, such as <br>
&lsquo;--diff-opts=-ud&lsquo; or
&lsquo;--diff-opts=-wU9&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;--diff-command&lsquo;
option can be used to specify an alternative utility.
Arguments may be included, separated by whitespace. The
value is not interpreted by a shell, so <br>
shell constructs cannot be used. The arguments %1 and %2
MUST be included, these are substituted for the two working
trees being compared. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs diff -p . --diff-command
&quot;meld %1 %2&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is used,
&lsquo;--diff-opts&lsquo; is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show contents [file]...
<br>
Show contents can be used to display an earlier version of
some file(s). If you give show contents no version
arguments, it displays the recorded version of the
file(s).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show dependencies <br>
The &lsquo;darcs show dependencies&lsquo; command is used to
create a graph of the dependencies between patches of the
repository (by default up to last tag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The resulting graph is described
in Dot Language, a general example of use could be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show dependencies | dot
-Tpdf -o FILE.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show files
[file|directory]... <br>
The &lsquo;darcs show files&lsquo; command lists those files
and directories in the working tree that are under version
control. This command is primarily for scripting purposes;
end <br>
users will probably want &lsquo;darcs whatsnew
--summary&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A file is &quot;pending&quot; if
it has been added but not recorded. By default, pending
files (and directories) are listed; the
&lsquo;--no-pending&lsquo; option prevents this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default &lsquo;darcs show
files&lsquo; lists both files and directories, but the
&lsquo;--no-files&lsquo; and &lsquo;--no-directories&lsquo;
flags modify this behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default entries are
one-per-line (i.e. newline separated). This can cause
problems if the files themselves contain newlines or other
control characters. To get around <br>
this, the &lsquo;--null&lsquo; option uses the null
character instead. The script interpreting output from this
command needs to understand this idiom; &lsquo;xargs
-0&lsquo; is such a command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, to list
version-controlled files by size:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show files -0 | xargs -0
ls -ldS</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show index <br>
The &lsquo;darcs show index&lsquo; command lists all
version-controlled files and directories along with their
hashes as stored in &lsquo;_darcs/index&lsquo;. For files,
the fields correspond to <br>
file size, sha256 of the current file content and the
filename. <br>
darcs show pristine <br>
The &lsquo;darcs show pristine&lsquo; command lists all
version-controlled files and directories along with the
hashes of their pristine copies. For files, the fields
correspond to file <br>
size, sha256 of the pristine file content and the filename.
<br>
darcs show repo <br>
The &lsquo;darcs show repo&lsquo; command displays
statistics about the current repository, allowing
third-party scripts to access this information without
inspecting &lsquo;_darcs&lsquo; directly <br>
(and without breaking when the &lsquo;_darcs&lsquo; format
changes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the number of
patches is shown. If this data isn&rsquo;t needed, use
&lsquo;--no-files&lsquo; to accelerate this command from
O(n) to O(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &rsquo;Weak Hash&rsquo;
identifies the set of patches of a repository independently
of ordering. It can be used to easily compare two
repositories of a same project. It is not cryp&acirc; <br>
tographically secure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, output is in a
human-readable format. The &lsquo;--xml-output&lsquo; option
can be used to generate output for machine
postprocessing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show authors <br>
The &lsquo;darcs show authors&lsquo; command lists the
authors of the current repository, sorted by the number of
patches contributed. With the &lsquo;--verbose&lsquo;
option, this command simply <br>
lists the author of each patch (without aggregation or
sorting).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An author&rsquo;s name or email
address may change over time. To tell Darcs when multiple
author strings refer to the same individual, create an
&lsquo;.authorspellings&lsquo; file in the <br>
root of the working tree. Each line in this file begins with
an author&rsquo;s canonical name and address, and may be
followed by a comma separated list of extended regular <br>
expressions. Blank lines and lines beginning with two
hyphens are ignored. The format of
&lsquo;.authorspelling&lsquo; can be described by this
pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">name &lt;address&gt; [, regexp
]*</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are some pitfalls
concerning special characters: Whitespaces are stripped, if
you need space in regexp use [ ]. Because comma serves as a
separator you have to escape <br>
it if you want it in regexp. Note that
&lsquo;.authorspelling&lsquo; use extended regular
expressions so +, ? and so on are metacharacters and you
need to escape them to be interpreted <br>
literally.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any patch with an author string
that matches the canonical address or any of the associated
regexps is considered to be the work of that author. All
matching is case-insen&acirc; <br>
sitive and partial (it can match a substring). Use ^,$ to
match the whole string in regexps</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Currently this canonicalization
step is done only in &lsquo;darcs show authors&lsquo;. Other
commands, such as &lsquo;darcs log&lsquo; use author strings
verbatim.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An example
&lsquo;.authorspelling&lsquo; file is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- This is a comment. <br>
Fred Nurk &lt;fred@example.com&gt; <br>
John Snagge &lt;snagge@bbc.co.uk&gt;, John, snagge@,
js@(si|mit).edu <br>
Chuck Jones Jr. &lt;chuck@pobox.com&gt;,
cj+user@example.com</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show tags <br>
The tags command writes a list of all tags in the repository
to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tab characters (ASCII character
9) in tag names are changed to spaces for better
interoperability with shell tools. A warning is printed if
this happens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs show patch-index <br>
When given the &lsquo;--verbose&lsquo; flag, the command
dumps the complete content of the patch index and checks its
integrity. <br>
darcs test [[initialization] command] <br>
Run test on the current recorded state of the repository.
Given no arguments, it uses the default repository test (see
&lsquo;darcs setpref&lsquo;). Given one argument, it treats
it as <br>
a test command. Given two arguments, the first is an
initialization command and the second is the test (meaning
the exit code of the first command is not taken into account
<br>
to determine success of the test). If given the
&lsquo;--linear&lsquo; or &lsquo;--bisect&lsquo; flags, it
tries to find the most recent version in the repository
which passes a test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--linear&lsquo; does
linear search starting from head, and moving away from head.
This strategy is best when the test runs very quickly or the
patch you&rsquo;re seeking is near the <br>
head.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--bisect&lsquo; does
binary search. This strategy is best when the test runs very
slowly or the patch you&rsquo;re seeking is likely to be in
the repository&rsquo;s distant past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;--backoff&lsquo; starts
searching from head, skipping further and further into the
past until the test succeeds. It then does a binary search
on a subset of those skipped <br>
patches. This strategy works well unless the patch
you&rsquo;re seeking is in the repository&rsquo;s distant
past.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under the assumption that
failure is monotonous, &lsquo;--linear&lsquo; and
&lsquo;--bisect&lsquo; produce the same result. (Monotonous
means that when moving away from head, the test result <br>
changes only once from &quot;fail&quot; to &quot;ok&quot;.)
If failure is not monotonous, any one of the patches that
break the test is found at random.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Undoing and correcting: <br>
darcs revert [file|directory]... <br>
The &lsquo;darcs revert&lsquo; command discards unrecorded
changes the working tree. As with &lsquo;darcs
record&lsquo;, you will be asked which hunks (changes) to
revert. The &lsquo;--all&lsquo; switch can <br>
be used to avoid such prompting. If files or directories are
specified, other parts of the working tree are not
reverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In you accidentally reverted
something you wanted to keep (for example, typing
&lsquo;darcs rev -a&lsquo; instead of &lsquo;darcs rec
-a&lsquo;), you can immediately run &lsquo;darcs
unrevert&lsquo; to restore <br>
it. This is only guaranteed to work if the repository has
not changed since &lsquo;darcs revert&lsquo; ran.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs unrevert <br>
Unrevert is a rescue command in case you accidentally
reverted something you wanted to keep (for example, typing
&lsquo;darcs rev -a&lsquo; instead of &lsquo;darcs rec
-a&lsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command may fail if the
repository has changed since the revert took place. Darcs
will ask for confirmation before executing an interactive
command that will DEFINITELY <br>
prevent unreversion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs amend [file|directory]...
<br>
Amend updates a &quot;draft&quot; patch with additions or
improvements, resulting in a single &quot;finished&quot;
patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default &lsquo;amend&lsquo;
proposes you to record additional changes. If instead you
want to remove changes, use the flag
&lsquo;--unrecord&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When recording a draft patch, it
is a good idea to start the name with &lsquo;DRAFT:&lsquo;.
When done, remove it with &lsquo;darcs amend
--edit-long-comment&lsquo;. Alternatively, to change the
<br>
patch name without starting an editor, use the
&lsquo;--name&lsquo;/&lsquo;-m&lsquo; flag:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs amend --match &rsquo;name
&quot;DRAFT: foo&quot;&rsquo; --name &rsquo;foo2&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like &lsquo;darcs record&lsquo;,
if you call amend with files as arguments, you will only be
asked about changes to those files. So to amend a patch to
foo.c with improvements in bar.c, <br>
you would run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs amend --match &rsquo;touch
foo.c&rsquo; bar.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is usually a bad idea to
amend another developer&rsquo;s patch. To make amend only
ask about your own patches by default, you can add something
like &lsquo;amend match David Roundy&lsquo; <br>
to &lsquo;~/.darcs/defaults&lsquo;, where &lsquo;David
Roundy&lsquo; is your name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs rebase pull
[repository]... <br>
Copy and apply patches from another repository, suspending
any local patches that conflict. <br>
darcs rebase apply &lt;patchfile&gt; <br>
Apply a patch bundle, suspending any local patches that
conflict. <br>
darcs rebase suspend <br>
Select patches to move into a suspended state at the end of
the repo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs rebase unsuspend <br>
Selected patches to restore from a suspended state to the
end of the repo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs rebase obliterate <br>
Obliterate a patch that is currently suspended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs rebase log <br>
List the currently suspended changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs rollback
[file|directory]... <br>
Rollback is used to undo the effects of some changes from
patches in the repository. The selected changes are undone
in your working tree, but the repository is left <br>
unchanged. First you are offered a choice of which patches
to undo, then which changes within the patches to undo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before doing
&lsquo;rollback&lsquo;, you may want to temporarily undo the
changes of your working tree (if there are) and save them
for later use. To do so, you can run &lsquo;revert&lsquo;,
then <br>
run &lsquo;rollback&lsquo;, record a patch, and run
&lsquo;unrevert&lsquo; to restore the saved changes into
your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs unrecord <br>
Unrecord does the opposite of record: it deletes patches
from the repository, without changing the working tree.
Deleting patches from the repository makes active changes
<br>
again which you may record or revert later. Beware that you
should not use this command if there is a possibility that
another user may have already pulled the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs obliterate <br>
Obliterate completely removes recorded patches from your
local repository. The changes will be undone in your working
tree and the patches will not be shown in your changes <br>
list anymore. Beware that you can lose precious code by
obliterating!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One way to save obliterated
patches is to use the -O flag. A patch bundle will be
created locally, that you will be able to apply later to
your repository with &lsquo;darcs apply&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Direct modification of the
repository: <br>
darcs tag [tagname] <br>
The &lsquo;darcs tag&lsquo; command names the current
repository state, so that it can easily be referred to
later. Every *important* state should be tagged; in
particular it is good <br>
practice to tag each stable release with a number or
codename. Advice on release numbering can be found at
&lt;http://producingoss.com/en/development-cycle.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To reproduce the state of a
repository &lsquo;R&lsquo; as at tag &lsquo;t&lsquo;, use
the command &lsquo;darcs clone --tag t R&lsquo;. The command
&lsquo;darcs show tags&lsquo; lists all tags in the current
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tagging also provides
significant performance benefits: when Darcs reaches a
shared tag that depends on all antecedent patches, it can
simply stop processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like normal patches, a tag has a
name, an author, a timestamp and an optional long
description, but it does not change the working tree. A tag
can have any name, but it is <br>
generally best to pick a naming scheme and stick to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default a tag names the
entire repository state at the time the tag is created. If
the --ask-deps option is used, the patches to include as
part of the tag can be explic&acirc; <br>
itly selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;darcs tag&lsquo;
command accepts the &lsquo;--pipe&lsquo; option, which
behaves as described in &lsquo;darcs record&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs setpref &lt;pref&gt;
&lt;value&gt; <br>
When working on project with multiple repositories and
contributors, it is sometimes desirable for a preference to
be set consistently project-wide. This is achieved by <br>
treating a preference set with &lsquo;darcs setpref&lsquo;
as an unrecorded change, which can then be recorded and then
treated like any other patch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Valid preferences are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* test -- a shell command that
runs regression tests * predist -- a shell command to run
before &lsquo;darcs dist&rsquo; * boringfile -- the path to
a version-controlled boring file * <br>
binariesfile -- the path to a version-controlled binaries
file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, a project using GNU
autotools, with a &lsquo;make test&lsquo; target to perform
regression tests, might enable Darcs&rsquo; integrated
regression testing with the following com&acirc; <br>
mand:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs setpref test
&rsquo;autoconf &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make
&amp;&amp; make test&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that merging is not
currently implemented for preferences: if two patches
attempt to set the same preference, the last patch applied
to the repository will always take <br>
precedence. This is considered a low-priority bug, because
preferences are seldom set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exchanging patches by e-mail:
<br>
darcs send [repository] <br>
Send is used to prepare a bundle of patches that can be
applied to a target repository. Send accepts the URL of the
repository as an argument. When called without an
argu&acirc; <br>
ment, send will use the most recent repository that was
either pushed to, pulled from or sent to. By default, the
patch bundle is saved to a file, although you may directly
<br>
send it by mail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;--output&lsquo;,
&lsquo;--output-auto-name&lsquo;, and &lsquo;--to&lsquo;
flags determine what darcs does with the patch bundle after
creating it. If you provide an &lsquo;--output&lsquo;
argument, the patch <br>
bundle is saved to that file. If you specify
&lsquo;--output-auto-name&lsquo;, the patch bundle is saved
to a file with an automatically generated name. If you give
one or more &lsquo;--to&lsquo; <br>
arguments, the bundle of patches is sent to those locations.
The locations may either be email addresses or urls that the
patch should be submitted to via HTTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you provide the
&lsquo;--mail&lsquo; flag, darcs will look at the contents
of the &lsquo;_darcs/prefs/email&lsquo; file in the target
repository (if it exists), and send the patch by email to
<br>
that address. In this case, you may use the
&lsquo;--cc&lsquo; option to specify additional recipients
without overriding the default repository email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If
&lsquo;_darcs/prefs/post&lsquo; exists in the target
repository, darcs will upload to the URL contained in that
file, which may either be a &lsquo;mailto:&lsquo; URL, or an
&lsquo;http://&lsquo; URL. In the <br>
latter case, the patch is posted to that URL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If there is no email address
associated with the repository, darcs will prompt you for an
email address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the &lsquo;--subject&lsquo;
flag to set the subject of the e-mail to be sent. If you
don&rsquo;t provide a subject on the command line, darcs
will make one up based on names of the <br>
patches in the patch bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use the
&lsquo;--in-reply-to&lsquo; flag to set the In-Reply-To and
References headers of the e-mail to be sent. By default no
additional headers are included so e-mail will not be <br>
treated as reply by mail readers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to include a
description or explanation along with the bundle of patches,
you need to specify the &lsquo;--edit-description&lsquo;
flag, which will cause darcs to open up an <br>
editor with which you can compose a message to go along with
your patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use a command
different from the default one for sending email, you need
to specify a command line with the
&lsquo;--sendmail-command&lsquo; option. The command line
can <br>
contain some format specifiers which are replaced by the
actual values. Accepted format specifiers are
&lsquo;%s&lsquo; for subject, &lsquo;%t&lsquo; for to,
&lsquo;%c&lsquo; for cc, &lsquo;%b&lsquo; for the body of
the <br>
mail, &lsquo;%f&lsquo; for from, &lsquo;%a&lsquo; for the
patch bundle and the same specifiers in uppercase for the
URL-encoded values. Additionally you can add
&lsquo;%&lt;&lsquo; to the end of the command line <br>
if the command expects the complete email message on
standard input. E.g. the command lines for evolution and
msmtp look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">evolution
&quot;mailto:%T?subject=%S&amp;attach=%A&amp;cc=%C&amp;body=%B&quot;
<br>
msmtp -t %&lt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not confuse the
&lsquo;--author&lsquo; options with the return address that
&lsquo;darcs send&lsquo; will set for your patch bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if you have two
email addresses A and B:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If you use &lsquo;--author
A&lsquo; but your machine is configured to send mail from
<br>
address B by default, then the return address on your
message will be B. * If you use &lsquo;--from A&lsquo; and
your mail client supports setting the <br>
From: address arbitrarily (some non-Unix-like mail clients,
especially, <br>
may not support this), then the return address will be A; if
it does <br>
not support this, then the return address will be B. * If
you supply neither &lsquo;--from&lsquo; nor
&lsquo;--author&lsquo; then the return <br>
address will be B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, unless you specify
the sendmail command with &lsquo;--sendmail-command&lsquo;,
darcs sends email using the default email command on your
computer. This default command is <br>
determined by the &lsquo;configure&lsquo; script. Thus, on
some non-Unix-like OSes, &lsquo;--from&lsquo; is likely to
not work at all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs apply &lt;patchfile&gt;
<br>
The &lsquo;darcs apply&lsquo; command takes a patch bundle
and attempts to insert it into the current repository. In
addition to invoking it directly on bundles created by
&lsquo;darcs send&lsquo;, <br>
it is used internally by &lsquo;darcs push&lsquo; on the
remote end of an SSH connection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no file is supplied, the
bundle is read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If given an email instead of a
patch bundle, Darcs will look for the bundle as a MIME
attachment to that email. Currently this will fail if the
MIME boundary is rewritten, <br>
such as in Courier and Mail.app.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the &lsquo;--reply
noreply@example.net&lsquo; option is used, and the bundle is
attached to an email, Darcs will send a report (indicating
success or failure) to the sender of the <br>
bundle (the &lsquo;To&lsquo; field). The argument to noreply
is the address the report will appear to originate FROM.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;--cc&lsquo; option
will cause the report to be CC&rsquo;d to another address,
for example &lsquo;--cc
reports@lists.example.net,admin@lists.example.net&lsquo;.
Using &lsquo;--cc&lsquo; without &lsquo;--reply&lsquo; <br>
is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to use a command
different from the default one for sending mail, you need to
specify a command line with the
&lsquo;--sendmail-command&lsquo; option. The command line
can <br>
contain the format specifier &lsquo;%t&lsquo; for to and you
can add &lsquo;%&lt;&lsquo; to the end of the command line
if the command expects the complete mail on standard input.
For example, the com&acirc; <br>
mand line for msmtp looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">msmtp -t %&lt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If gpg(1) is installed, you can
use &lsquo;--verify pubring.gpg&lsquo; to reject bundles
that aren&rsquo;t signed by a key in
&lsquo;pubring.gpg&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lsquo;--test&lsquo; is
supplied and a test is defined (see &lsquo;darcs
setpref&lsquo;), the bundle will be rejected if the test
fails after applying it. In that case, the rejection email
from <br>
&lsquo;--reply&lsquo; will include the test output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A patch bundle may introduce
unresolved conflicts with existing patches or with the
working tree. By default, Darcs will add conflict markers
(see &lsquo;darcs mark-conflicts&lsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;--external-merge&lsquo; option lets you resolve these
conflicts using an external merge tool. In the option,
&lsquo;%a&lsquo; is replaced with the common ancestor (merge
base), &lsquo;%1&lsquo; with <br>
the first version, &lsquo;%2&lsquo; with the second version,
and &lsquo;%o&lsquo; with the path where your resolved
content should go. For example, to use the xxdiff visual
merge tool you&rsquo;d spec&acirc; <br>
ify: &lsquo;--external-merge=&rsquo;xxdiff -m -O -M %o %1 %a
%2&rsquo;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;--allow-conflicts&lsquo; option will skip conflict
marking; this is useful when you want to treat a repository
as just a bunch of patches, such as using &lsquo;darcs pull
--union&lsquo; <br>
to download of your co-workers patches before going
offline.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can mess up unrecorded
changes in the working tree, forcing you to resolve the
conflict immediately. To simply reject bundles that
introduce unresolved conflicts, using <br>
the &lsquo;--dont-allow-conflicts&lsquo; option. Making this
the default in push-based workflows is strongly
recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlike most Darcs commands,
&lsquo;darcs apply&lsquo; defaults to &lsquo;--all&lsquo;.
Use the &lsquo;--interactive&lsquo; option to pick which
patches to apply from a bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other commands: <br>
darcs optimize clean <br>
This command deletes obsolete files within the repository.
<br>
darcs optimize http <br>
Using this option creates &rsquo;repository packs&rsquo;
that could dramatically speed up performance when a user
does a &lsquo;darcs clone&lsquo; of the repository over
HTTP. To make use of packs, <br>
the clients must have a darcs of at least version 2.10.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs optimize reorder <br>
This command moves recent patches (those not included in the
latest tag) to the &quot;front&quot;, reducing the amount
that a typical remote command needs to download. It should
also <br>
reduce the CPU time needed for some operations. <br>
darcs optimize enable-patch-index <br>
Build the patch index, an internal data structure that
accelerates commands that need to know what patches touch a
given file. Such as annotate and log. <br>
darcs optimize disable-patch-index <br>
Delete and stop maintaining the patch index from the
repository. <br>
darcs optimize compress <br>
By default patches are compressed with zlib (RFC 1951) to
reduce storage (and download) size. In exceptional
circumstances, it may be preferable to avoid compression. In
<br>
this case the &lsquo;--dont-compress&lsquo; option can be
used (e.g. with &lsquo;darcs record&lsquo;) to avoid
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;darcs optimize
uncompress&lsquo; and &lsquo;darcs optimize compress&lsquo;
commands can be used to ensure existing patches in the
current repository are respectively uncompressed or
com&acirc; <br>
pressed. <br>
darcs optimize uncompress <br>
By default patches are compressed with zlib (RFC 1951) to
reduce storage (and download) size. In exceptional
circumstances, it may be preferable to avoid compression. In
<br>
this case the &lsquo;--dont-compress&lsquo; option can be
used (e.g. with &lsquo;darcs record&lsquo;) to avoid
compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &lsquo;darcs optimize
uncompress&lsquo; and &lsquo;darcs optimize compress&lsquo;
commands can be used to ensure existing patches in the
current repository are respectively uncompressed or
com&acirc; <br>
pressed. <br>
darcs optimize relink <br>
The &lsquo;darcs optimize relink&lsquo; command hard-links
patches that the current repository has in common with its
peers. Peers are those repositories listed in <br>
&lsquo;_darcs/prefs/sources&lsquo;, or defined with the
&lsquo;--sibling&lsquo; option (which can be used multiple
times).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs uses hard-links
automatically, so this command is rarely needed. It is most
useful if you used &lsquo;cp -r&lsquo; instead of
&lsquo;darcs clone&lsquo; to copy a repository, or if you
pulled <br>
the same patch from a remote repository into multiple local
repositories. <br>
darcs optimize pristine <br>
This command updates the format of
&lsquo;_darcs/pristine.hashed/&lsquo;, which was different
before darcs 2.3.1. <br>
darcs optimize upgrade <br>
Convert old-fashioned repositories to the current default
hashed format. <br>
darcs optimize cache &lt;directory&gt; ... <br>
This command deletes obsolete files within the global cache.
It takes one or more directories as arguments, and
recursively searches all repositories within these
directo&acirc; <br>
ries. Then it deletes all files in the global cache not
belonging to these repositories. When no directory is given,
it searches repositories in the user&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It also automatically migrates
the global cache to the (default) bucketed format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs dist <br>
&lsquo;darcs dist&lsquo; creates a compressed archive in the
repository&rsquo;s root directory, containing the recorded
state of the working tree (unrecorded changes and the
&lsquo;_darcs&lsquo; directory <br>
are excluded). The command accepts matchers to create an
archive of some past repository state, for instance
&lsquo;--tag&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, the archive (and the
top-level directory within the archive) has the same name as
the repository, but this can be overridden with the
&lsquo;--dist-name&lsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a predist command is set (see
&lsquo;darcs setpref&lsquo;), that command will be run on
the recorded state prior to archiving. For example,
autotools projects would set it to &lsquo;auto&acirc; <br>
conf &amp;&amp; automake&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &lsquo;--zip&lsquo; is used,
matchers and the predist command are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs mark-conflicts <br>
Darcs requires human guidance to unify changes to the same
part of a source file. When a conflict first occurs, darcs
will add the initial state and both choices to the <br>
working tree, delimited by the markers &lsquo;v v v&lsquo;,
&lsquo;=====&lsquo;, &lsquo;* * *&lsquo; and &lsquo;^ ^
^&lsquo;, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">v v v v v v v <br>
Initial state. <br>
============= <br>
First choice. <br>
************* <br>
Second choice. <br>
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you might revert or
manually delete these markers without actually resolving the
conflict. In this case, &lsquo;darcs mark-conflicts&lsquo;
is useful to show where are the <br>
unresolved conflicts. It is also useful if &lsquo;darcs
apply&lsquo; is called with &lsquo;--apply-conflicts&lsquo;,
where conflicts aren&rsquo;t marked initially.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless you use the
&lsquo;--dry-run&lsquo; flag, any unrecorded changes to the
working tree WILL be lost forever when you run this command!
You will be prompted for confirmation before <br>
this takes place.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs repair <br>
The &lsquo;darcs repair&lsquo; command attempts to fix
corruption in the current repository. Currently it can only
repair damage to the pristine tree, which is where most
corruption <br>
occurs. This command rebuilds a pristine tree by applying
successively the patches in the repository to an empty
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag &lsquo;--dry-run&lsquo;
make this operation read-only, making darcs exit
unsuccessfully (with a non-zero exit status) if the rebuilt
pristine is different from the current pris&acirc; <br>
tine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs convert darcs-2
&lt;source&gt; [&lt;destination&gt;] <br>
This command converts a repository that uses the old patch
semantics &lsquo;darcs-1&lsquo; to a new repository with
current &lsquo;darcs-2&lsquo; semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: the repository produced
by this command is not understood by Darcs 1.x, and patches
cannot be exchanged between repositories in darcs-1 and
darcs-2 formats.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, repositories
created by different invocations of this command SHOULD NOT
exchange patches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs convert export <br>
This command enables you to export darcs repositories into
git.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a one-time export you can
use the recipe:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cd repo <br>
$ git init ../mirror <br>
$ darcs convert export | (cd ../mirror &amp;&amp; git
fast-import)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For incremental export using
marksfiles:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ cd repo <br>
$ git init ../mirror <br>
$ touch ../mirror/git.marks <br>
$ darcs convert export --read-marks darcs.marks
--write-marks darcs.marks <br>
| (cd ../mirror &amp;&amp; git fast-import
--import-marks=git.marks --export-marks=git.marks)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the case of incremental
export, be careful to never amend, delete or reorder patches
in the source darcs repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, be aware that exporting a
darcs repo to git will not be exactly faithful in terms of
history if the darcs repository contains conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Empty directories are not
supported by the fast-export protocol. * Unicode filenames
are currently not correctly handled. <br>
See http://bugs.darcs.net/issue2359 .</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs convert import
[&lt;directory&gt;] <br>
This command imports git repositories into new darcs
repositories. Further options are accepted (see &lsquo;darcs
help init&lsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To convert a git repo to a new
darcs one you may run: <br>
$ (cd gitrepo &amp;&amp; git fast-export --all -M) | darcs
convert import darcsmirror</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNING: git repositories with
branches will produce weird results, <br>
use at your own risks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Incremental import with
marksfiles is currently not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs fetch [repository]... <br>
Fetch is similar to &lsquo;pull&lsquo; except that it does
not apply any patches to the current repository. Instead, it
generates a patch bundle that you can apply later with
&lsquo;apply&lsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Fetch&rsquo;s behaviour is
essentially similar to pull&rsquo;s, so please consult the
help of &lsquo;pull&lsquo; to know more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME and APPDATA <br>
Per-user preferences are set in $HOME/.darcs (on Unix) or
%APPDATA%/darcs (on Windows). This is also the default
location of the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_EDITOR, DARCSEDITOR,
VISUAL, and EDITOR <br>
To edit a patch description of email comment, Darcs will
invoke an external editor. Your preferred editor can be set
as any of the environment variables $DARCS_EDITOR,
$DARCSED&acirc; <br>
ITOR, $VISUAL or $EDITOR. If none of these are set,
editor(1) is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_PAGER and PAGER <br>
Darcs will invoke a pager if the output of some command is
longer than 20 lines. Darcs will use the pager specified by
$DARCS_PAGER or $PAGER. If neither are set, pager(1) will
<br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_DONT_COLOR,
DARCS_ALWAYS_COLOR, DARCS_ALTERNATIVE_COLOR, and
DARCS_DO_COLOR_LINES <br>
If the terminal understands ANSI color escape sequences,
darcs will highlight certain keywords and delimiters when
printing patches. This can be turned off by setting the
envi&acirc; <br>
ronment variable DARCS_DONT_COLOR to 1. If you use a pager
that happens to understand ANSI colors, like &lsquo;less
-R&lsquo;, darcs can be forced always to highlight the
output by setting <br>
DARCS_ALWAYS_COLOR to 1. If you can&rsquo;t see colors you
can set DARCS_ALTERNATIVE_COLOR to 1, and darcs will use
ANSI codes for bold and reverse video instead of colors. In
addi&acirc; <br>
tion, there is an extra-colorful mode, which is not enabled
by default, which can be activated with
DARCS_DO_COLOR_LINES</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_SPACES
and DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_CR <br>
By default darcs will escape (by highlighting if possible)
any kind of spaces at the end of lines when showing patch
contents. If you don&rsquo;t want this you can turn it off
by set&acirc; <br>
ting DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_SPACES to 1. A special case
exists for only carriage returns:
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_CR</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_ANYTHING,
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_ISPRINT, DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_8BIT,
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA, and DARCS_ESCAPE_EXTRA <br>
Darcs needs to escape certain characters when printing patch
contents to a terminal. Characters like backspace can
otherwise hide patch content from the user, and other
character <br>
sequences can even in some cases redirect commands to the
shell if the terminal allows it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default darcs will only allow
printable 7-bit ASCII characters (including space), and the
two control characters tab and newline. All other octets are
printed in quoted form <br>
(as &lsquo;^&lt;control letter&gt;&lsquo; or &lsquo;&lt;hex
code&gt;&lsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darcs has some limited support
for locales. If the system&rsquo;s locale is a single-byte
character encoding, like the Latin encodings, you can set
the environment variable <br>
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_ISPRINT to 1 and darcs will display all
the printables in the current system locale instead of just
the ASCII ones. NOTE: This curently does not work on some
<br>
architectures if darcs is compiled with GHC 6.4 or later.
Some non-ASCII control characters might be printed and can
possibly spoof the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For multi-byte character
encodings things are less smooth. UTF-8 will work if you set
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_8BIT to 1, but non-printables outside the
7-bit ASCII range are no longer <br>
escaped. E.g., the extra control characters from Latin-1
might leave your terminal at the mercy of the patch
contents. Space characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range are
no <br>
longer recognized and will not be properly escaped at line
endings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a last resort you can set
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_ANYTHING to 1. Then everything that
doesn&rsquo;t flip code sets should work, and so will all
the bells and whistles in your terminal. <br>
This environment variable can also be handy if you pipe the
output to a pager or external filter that knows better than
darcs how to handle your encoding. Note that all escaping,
<br>
including the special escaping of any line ending spaces,
will be turned off by this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two environment
variables you can set to explicitly tell darcs to not escape
or escape octets. They are DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA and
DARCS_ESCAPE_EXTRA. Their values <br>
should be strings consisting of the verbatim octets in
question. The do-escapes take precedence over the
dont-escapes. Space characters are still escaped at line
endings though. <br>
The special environment variable
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_CR turns off escaping of carriage
return last on the line (DOS style).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_TMPDIR and TMPDIR <br>
Darcs often creates temporary directories. For example, the
&lsquo;darcs diff&lsquo; command creates two for the working
trees to be diffed. By default temporary directories are
created in <br>
/tmp, or if that doesn&rsquo;t exist, in _darcs (within the
current repo). This can be overridden by specifying some
other directory in the file _darcs/prefs/tmpdir or the
environment <br>
variable $DARCS_TMPDIR or $TMPDIR.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_KEEP_TMPDIR <br>
If the environment variable DARCS_KEEP_TMPDIR is defined,
darcs will not remove the temporary directories it creates.
This is intended primarily for debugging Darcs itself, but
<br>
it can also be useful, for example, to determine why your
test preference (see &lsquo;darcs setpref&lsquo;) is failing
when you run &lsquo;darcs record&lsquo;, but working when
run manually.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_EMAIL and EMAIL <br>
Each patch is attributed to its author, usually by email
address (for example, &lsquo;Fred Bloggs
&lt;fred@example.net&gt;&lsquo;). Darcs looks in several
places for this author string: the <br>
&lsquo;--author&lsquo; option, the files
&lsquo;_darcs/prefs/author&lsquo; (in the repository) and
&lsquo;~/.darcs/author&lsquo; (in your home directory), and
the environment variables &lsquo;$DARCS_EMAIL&lsquo; and
&lsquo;$EMAIL&lsquo;. <br>
If none of those exist, Darcs will prompt you for an author
string and write it to &lsquo;~/.darcs/author&lsquo;. Note
that if you have more than one email address, you can put
them all in <br>
&lsquo;~/.darcs/author&lsquo;, one author per line. Darcs
will still prompt you for an author, but it allows you to
select from the list, or to type in an alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SENDMAIL <br>
On Unix, the &lsquo;darcs send&lsquo; command relies on
sendmail(8). The &lsquo;--sendmail-command&lsquo; or
$SENDMAIL environment variable can be used to provide an
explicit path to this program; oth&acirc; <br>
erwise the standard locations /usr/sbin/sendmail and
/usr/lib/sendmail will be tried.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_SLOPPY_LOCKS <br>
If on some filesystems you get an error of the kind:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">darcs: takeLock [...]:
atomic_create [...]: unsupported operation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">you may want to try to export
DARCS_SLOPPY_LOCKS=True.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_SSH <br>
Repositories of the form [user@]host:[dir] are taken to be
remote repositories, which Darcs accesses with the external
program ssh(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment variable
$DARCS_SSH can be used to specify an alternative SSH client.
Arguments may be included, separated by whitespace. The
value is not interpreted by a <br>
shell, so shell constructs cannot be used; in particular, it
is not possible for the program name to contain whitespace
by using quoting or escaping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_SCP and DARCS_SFTP <br>
When reading from a remote repository, Darcs will attempt to
run &lsquo;darcs transfer-mode&lsquo; on the remote host.
This will fail if the remote host only has Darcs 1
installed, doesn&rsquo;t <br>
have Darcs installed at all, or only allows SFTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If transfer-mode fails, Darcs
will fall back on scp(1) and sftp(1). The commands invoked
can be customized with the environment variables $DARCS_SCP
and $DARCS_SFTP respec&acirc; <br>
tively, which behave like $DARCS_SSH. If the remote end
allows only sftp, try setting DARCS_SCP=sftp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_PORT <br>
If this environment variable is set, it will be used as the
port number for all SSH calls made by Darcs (when accessing
remote repositories over SSH). This is useful if your SSH
<br>
server does not run on the default port, and your SSH client
does not support ssh_config(5). OpenSSH users will probably
prefer to put something like &lsquo;Host *.example.net Port
<br>
443&lsquo; into their ~/.ssh/config file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY,
FTP_PROXY, ALL_PROXY, and NO_PROXY <br>
If Darcs was built with libcurl, the environment variables
HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and FTP_PROXY can be set to the URL
of a proxy in the form</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[protocol://]&lt;host&gt;[:port]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In which case libcurl will use
the proxy for the associated protocol (HTTP, HTTPS and FTP).
The environment variable ALL_PROXY can be used to set a
single proxy for all libcurl <br>
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
NO_PROXY is a comma-separated list of host names, access to
those hosts will bypass proxies defined by the above
variables. For example, it is quite <br>
common to avoid proxying requests to machines on the local
network with</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">NO_PROXY=localhost,*.localdomain</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For compatibility with lynx et
al, lowercase equivalents of these environment variables
(e.g. $http_proxy) are also understood and are used in
preference to the uppercase ver&acirc; <br>
sions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If Darcs was not built with
libcurl, all these environment variables are silently
ignored, and there is no way to use a web proxy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DARCS_PROXYUSERPWD <br>
If Darcs was built with libcurl, and you are using a web
proxy that requires authentication, you can set the
$DARCS_PROXYUSERPWD environment variable to the username and
password <br>
expected by the proxy, separated by a colon. This
