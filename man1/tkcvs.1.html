<p>TkCVS(1) General Commands Manual TkCVS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
TkCVS - a Tk/Tcl Graphical Interface to CVS and
Subversion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tkcvs [-dir directory] [-root cvsroot] [-win
workdir|module|merge] [-log file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS and
Subversion configuration management systems. It displays the
status of the files in the current working directory, and
<br>
provides buttons and menus to execute
configuration-management commands on the selected files.
Limited RCS functionality is also present. TkDiff is bundled
in for browsing and <br>
merging your changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TkCVS also aids in browsing the
repository. For Subversion, the repository tree is browsed
like an ordinary file tree. For CVS, the CVSROOT/modules
file is read. TkCVS extends <br>
CVS with a method to produce a browsable, &quot;user
friendly&quot; listing of modules. This requires special
comments in the CVSROOT/modules file. See &quot;CVS Modules
File&quot; for more guid&acirc; <br>
ance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
TkCVS accepts the following options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-dir directory <br>
Start TkCVS in the specified directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help Print a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-log file <br>
Invoke a log browser for the specified file. -log and -win
are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-root cvsroot <br>
Set $CVSROOT to the specified repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-win workdir|module|merge <br>
Start by displaying the directory browser (the default), the
module browser, or the directory-merge tool. -win and -log
are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Examples <br>
% tkcvs -win module -root /jaz/repository <br>
Browse the modules located in CVSROOT /jaz/repository <br>
% tkcvs -log tstheap.c <br>
View the log of the file tstheap.c</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Working Directory Browser <br>
The working directory browser shows the files in your local
working copy, or &quot;sandbox.&quot; It shows the status of
the files at a glance and provides tools to help with most
of the <br>
common CVS, SVN, and RCS operations you might do.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the top of the browser you
will find:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The name of the current
directory. You can change directories by typing in this
field. Recently visited directories are saved in the
picklist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The relative path of the
current directory in the repository. If it is not contained
in the repository you may import it using the menu or
toolbar button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* A Directory Tag name, if the
directory is contained in the repository and it has been
checked out against a particular branch or tag. In
Subversion, the branch or tag is <br>
inferred from the URL based on the conventional
trunk-branches-tags repository organization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The CVSROOT of the current
directory if it&rsquo;s under CVS control, or the URL of the
Subversion repository if it&rsquo;s under Subversion
control. If neither is true, it may default <br>
to the value of the $CVSROOT environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main part of the working
directory browser is a list of the files in the current
directory with an icon next to each showing its status. You
select a file by clicking on its <br>
name or icon once with the left mouse button. Holding the
Control key while clicking will add the file to the group of
those already selected. You can select a contiguous group
<br>
of files by holding the Shift key while clicking. You can
also select a group of files by dragging the mouse with the
middle or right button pressed to select an area. Selecting
<br>
an item that&rsquo;s already selected de-selects that item.
To unselect all files, click the left mouse button in an
empty area of the file list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The Date column (can be
hidden) shows the modification time of the file is shown.
The format of the date column may be specified with
cvscfg(dateformat). The default format <br>
was chosen because it sorts the same way alphabetically as
chronologically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the directory belongs to a
revision system, other columns are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The revision column shows
which revision of the file is checked out, and whether
it&rsquo;s on the trunk or on a branch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The status column (can be
hidden) shows the revision of the file spelled out in text.
This information is mostly redundant to the icon in the file
column.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* The Editor/Author/Locker
column (can be hidden) varies according to revision system.
In Subversion, the author of the most recent checkin is
shown. In CVS, it shows a list of <br>
people editing the files if your site uses &quot;cvs
watch&quot; and/or &quot;cvs edit&quot;. Otherwise, it will
be empty. In RCS, it shows who, if anyone, has the file
locked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The optional columns can be
displayed or hidden using the Options menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can move into a directory by
double-clicking on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Double clicking on a file will
load the file into a suitable editor so you can change it. A
different editor can be used for different file types (see
Configuration Files).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Status <br>
When you are in a directory that is under CVS or Subversion
control, the file status will be shown by an icon next to
each file. Checking the &quot;Status Column&quot; option
causes the <br>
status to be displayed in text in its own column. Some
possible statuses are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Up-to-date <br>
The file is up to date with respect to the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locally Modified <br>
The file has been modified in the current directory since
being checked out of the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locally Added <br>
The file has been added to the repository. This file will
become permanent in the repository once a commit is
made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Locally Removed <br>
You have removed the file with remove, and not yet committed
your changes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Needs Checkout <br>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
repository. The name is slightly misleading; you will
ordinarily use update rather than checkout to get that newer
revi&acirc; <br>
sion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Needs Patch <br>
Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send a patch
rather than the entire file. Sending a patch or sending an
entire file accomplishes the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Needs Merge <br>
Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
repository, and you have also made modifications to the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unresolved Conflict <br>
This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous update
command gave a conflict. You need to resolve the conflict
before checking in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? The file is not contained in
the repository. You may need to add the file to the
repository by pressing the &quot;Add&quot; button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[directory:CVS] <br>
A directory which has been checked out from a CVS
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[directory:SVN] <br>
The file is a directory which has been checked out from a
Subversion repository. In Subversion, directories are
themselves versioned objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[directory:RCS] <br>
A directory which contains an RCS sub-directory or some
files with the ,v suffix, presumably containing some files
that are under RCS revision control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[directory] <br>
The file is a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Filters <br>
You can specify file matching patterns to instruct TkCVS
which files you wish to see. You can also specify patterns
telling it which files to remove when you press the
&quot;Clean&quot; <br>
button or select the File-&gt;Cleanup menu item.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Hide&quot; works exactly
the way a .cvsignore file works. That is, it causes non-CVS
files with the pattern to be ignored. It&rsquo;s meant for
hiding .o files and such. Any file under CVS <br>
control will be listed anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Show&quot; is the inverse.
It hides non-CVS files except for those with the
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Buttons <br>
Module Browser: <br>
The big button at the upper right opens the module browser.
Opens a module browser window which will enable you to
explore items in the repository even if they&rsquo;re not
<br>
checked out. In CVS, this requires that there be entries in
the CVSROOT/modules file. Browsing can be improved by using
TkCVS-specific comments in CVSROOT/modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Go Up: The button to the left of
the entry that shows the current directory. Press it and you
go up one level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are a number of buttons at
the bottom of the window. Pressing on one of these causes
the following actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Delete: <br>
Press this button to delete the selected files. The files
will not be removed from the repository. To remove the files
from the repository as well as delete them, press <br>
the &quot;Remove&quot; button instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Edit: Press this button to load
the selected files in to an appropriate editor.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View: Press this button to view
the selected files in a Tk text window. This can be a lot
faster then Edit, in case your preferred editor is xemacs or
something of that magni&acirc; <br>
tude.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refresh: <br>
Press this button to re-read the current directory, in case
the status of some files may have changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Check: <br>
Shows, in a searchable text window, the status of all the
files. By default, it is recursive and lists unknown (?)
files. These can be changed in the Options menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Directory Branch Browse: <br>
For merging the entire directory. In Subversion, it opens
the Branch Browser for &quot;.&quot; In CVS, it chooses a
&quot;representative&quot; file in the current directory and
opens a <br>
graphical tool for directory merges.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log (Branch) Browse: <br>
This button will bring up the log browser window for each of
the selected files in the window. See the Log Browser
section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annotate: <br>
This displays a window in which the selected file is shown
with the lines highlighted according to when and by whom
they were last revised. In Subversion, it&rsquo;s also <br>
called &quot;blame.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff: This compares the selected
files with the equivalent files in the repository. A
separate program called &quot;TkDiff&quot; (also supplied
with TkCVS) is used to do this. For more <br>
information on TkDiff, see TkDiff&rsquo;s help menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge Conflict: <br>
If a file&rsquo;s status says &quot;Needs Merge&quot;,
&quot;Conflict&quot;, or is marked with a &quot;C&quot; in
CVS Check, there was a difference which CVS needs help to
reconcile. This button invokes TkD&acirc; <br>
iff with the -conflict option, opening a merge window to
help you merge the differences.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check In: <br>
This button commits your changes to the repository. This
includes adding new files and removing deleted files. When
you press this button, a dialog will appear asking you <br>
for the version number of the files you want to commit, and
a comment. You need only enter a version number if you want
to bring the files in the repository up to the next <br>
major version number. For example, if a file is version
1.10, and you do not enter a version number, it will be
checked in as version 1.11. If you enter the version number
<br>
3, then it will be checked in as version 3.0 instead. It is
usually better to use symbolic tags for that purpose. If you
use rcsinfo to supply a template for the com&acirc; <br>
ment, you must use an external editor. Set
cvscfg(use_cvseditor) to do this. For checking in to RCS, an
externel editor is always used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update: <br>
This updates your sandbox directory with any changes
committed to the repository by other developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Update with Options: <br>
Allows you to update from a different branch, with a tag,
with empty directories, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Add Files: <br>
Press this button when you want to add new files to the
repository. You must create the file before adding it to the
repository. To add some files, select them and press <br>
the Add Files button. The files that you have added to the
repository will be committed next time you press the Check
In button. It is not recursive. Use the menu CVS -&gt; <br>
Add Recursively for that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remove Files: <br>
This button will remove files. To remove files, select them
and press the Remove button. The files will disappear from
the directory, and will be removed from the reposi&acirc;
<br>
tory next time you press the Check In button. It is not
recursive. Use the menu CVS -&gt; Remove Recursively for
that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tag: This button will tag the
selected files. In CVS, the -F (force) option will move the
tag if it already exists on the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Branch Tag: <br>
This button will tag the selected files, creating a branch.
In CVS, the -F (force) option will move the tag if it
already exists on the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lock (CVS and RCS): <br>
Lock an RCS file for editing. If cvscfg(cvslock) is set,
lock a CVS file. Use of locking is philosophically
discouraged in CVS since it&rsquo;s against the
&quot;concurrent&quot; part <br>
of Concurrent Versioning System, but locking policy is
nevertheless used at some sites. One size doesn&rsquo;t fit
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unlock (CVS and RCS): <br>
Unlock an RCS file. If cvscfg(cvslock) is set, unlock a CVS
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set Edit Flag (CVS): <br>
This button sets the edit flag on the selected files,
enabling other developers to see that you are currently
editing those files (See &quot;cvs edit&quot; in the CVS
documenta&acirc; <br>
tion).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset Edit Flag (CVS): <br>
This button resets the edit flag on the selected files,
enabling other developers to see that you are no longer
editing those files (See &quot;cvs edit&quot; in the CVS
documenta&acirc; <br>
tion). As the current version of cvs waits on a prompt for
&quot;cvs unedit&quot; if changes have been made to the file
in question (to ask if you want to revert the changes to the
<br>
current revision), the current action of tkcvs is to abort
the unedit (by piping in nothing to stdin). Therefore, to
lose the changes and revert to the current revision, <br>
it is necessary to delete the file and do an update (this
will also clear the edit flag). To keep the changes, make a
copy of the file, delete the original, update, and <br>
then move the saved copy back to the original filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close: Press this button to
close the Working Directory Browser. If no other windows are
open, TkCVS exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log (Branch) Browser <br>
The TkCVS Log Browser window enables you to view a graphical
display of the revision log of a file, including all
previous versions and any branched versions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can get to the log browser
window in three ways, either by invoking it directly with
&quot;tkcvs [-log] &lt;filename&gt;&quot;, by selecting a
file within the main window of TkCVS and press&acirc; <br>
ing the Log Browse button, or by selecting a file in a list
invoked from the module browser and pressing the Log Browse
button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the Log Browser is examining
a checked-out file, the buttons for performing merge
operations are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log Browser Window <br>
The log browser window has three components. These are the
file name and version information section at the top, the
log display in the middle, and a row of buttons along the
<br>
bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log Display <br>
The main log display is fairly self explanatory. It shows a
group of boxes connected by lines indicating the main trunk
of the file development (on the left hand side) and any <br>
branches that the file has (which spread out to the right of
the main trunk).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each box contains the version
number, author of the version, and other information
determined by the menu View -&gt; Revision Layout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constructing the branch diagram
from Subversion is inefficient, so the Log Browser counts
the tags when doing a Subversion diagram and pops up a
dialog giving you a chance to <br>
skip the tag step if there are too many tags (where
&quot;many&quot; arbitrarily equals 10.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version Numbers <br>
Once a file is loaded into the log browser, one or two
version numbers may be selected. The primary version
(Selection A) is selected by clicking the left mouse button
on a ver&acirc; <br>
sion box in the main log display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The secondary version (Selection
B) is selected by clicking the right mouse button on a
version box in the main log display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operations such as
&quot;View&quot; and &quot;Annotate&quot; operate only on
the primary version selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Operations such as
&quot;Diff&quot; and &quot;Merge Changes to Current&quot;
require two versions to be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Searching the Diagram <br>
You can search the canvas for tags, revisions, authors, and
dates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following special characters
are used in the search pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Matches any sequence of
characters in string, including a null string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Matches any single character
in string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[chars] Matches any character in
the set given by chars. If a sequence of the form x-y
appears in chars, then any character between x and y,
inclusive, will match.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Matches the single character x.
This provides a way of avoiding the special interpretation
of the characters *?[] in pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only enter
&quot;FOO&quot; (without the</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log Browser Buttons <br>
The log browser contains the following buttons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Refresh: <br>
Re-reads the revision history of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View: Pressing this button
displays a Tk text window containing the version of the file
at Selection A.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Annotate: <br>
This displays a window in which the file is shown with its
lines highlighted according to when and by whom they were
last revised. In Subversion, it&rsquo;s also called <br>
&quot;blame.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Diff: Pressing this button runs
the &quot;tkdiff&quot; program to display the differences
between version A and version B.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge: To use this button,
select a branch version of the file, other than the branch
you are currently on, as the primary version (Selection A).
The changes made along the <br>
branch up to that version will be merged into the current
version, and stored in the current directory. Optionally,
select another version (Selection B) and the changes <br>
will be from that point rather than from the base of the
branch. The version of the file in the current directory
will be merged, but no commit will occur. Then you <br>
inspect the merged files, correct any conflicts which may
occur, and commit when you are satisfied. Optionally, TkCVS
will tag the version that the merge is from. It <br>
suggests a tag of the form
&quot;mergefrom_&lt;rev&gt;_date.&quot; If you use this
auto-tagging function, another dialog containing a suggested
tag for the merged-to version will appear. <br>
It&rsquo;s suggested to leave the dialog up until you are
finished, then copy-and-paste the suggested tag into the
&quot;Tag&quot; dialog. It is always a good practice to tag
when doing <br>
merges, and if you use tags of the suggested form, the
Branch Browser can diagram them. (Auto-tagging is not
implemented in Subversion because, despite the fact that
tags <br>
are &quot;cheap,&quot; it&rsquo;s somewhat impractical to
auto-tag single files. You can do the tagging manually,
however.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">View Tags: <br>
This button lists all the tags applied to the file in a
searchable text window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close: This button closes the
Log Browser. If no other windows are open, TkCVS exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The View Options Menu <br>
The View Menu allows you to control what you see in the
branch diagram. You can choose how much information to show
in the boxes, whether to show empty revisions, and whether
to <br>
show tags. You can even control the size of the boxes. If
you are using Subversion, you may wish to turn the display
of tags off. If they aren&rsquo;t asked for they won&rsquo;t
be read <br>
from the repository, which can save a lot of time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge Tool for CVS <br>
The Merge Tool chooses a &quot;representative&quot; file in
the current directory and diagrams the branch tags. It tries
to pick the &quot;bushiest&quot; file, or failing that, the
most-revised <br>
file. If you disagree with its choice, you can type the name
of another file in the top entry and press Return to diagram
that file instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The main purpose of this tool is
to do merges (cvs update -j rev [-j rev]) on the whole
directory. For merging one file at a time, you should use
the Log Browser. You can only <br>
merge to the line (trunk or branch) that you are currently
on. Select a branch to merge from by clicking on it. Then
press either the &quot;Merge&quot; or &quot;Merge
Changes&quot; button. The ver&acirc; <br>
sion of the file in the current directory will be
over-written, but it will not be committed to the
repository. You do that after you&rsquo;ve reconciled
conflicts and decided if it&rsquo;s <br>
what you really want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge Branch to Current: <br>
The changes made on the branch since its beginning will be
merged into the current version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Merge Changes to Current: <br>
Instead of merging from the base of the branch, this button
merges the changes that were made since a particular version
on the branch. It pops up a dialog in which you <br>
fill in the version. It should usually be the version that
was last merged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Browser <br>
Operations that are performed on the repository instead of
in a checked-out working directory are done with the Module
Browser. The most common of these operations is checking
<br>
out or exporting from the repository. The Module Browser can
be started from the command line (tkcvs -win module) or
started from the main window by pressing the big button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subversion repositories can be
browsed like a file tree, and that is what you will see in
the Module Browser. CVS repositories aren&rsquo;t directly
browsable, but if the CVSROOT/mod&acirc; <br>
ules file is maintained appropriately, TkCVS can display the
modules and infer tree structures if they are present. See
the &quot;CVS Modules File&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using the module browser window,
you can select a module to check out. When you check out a
module, a new directory is created in the current working
directory with the same name <br>
as the module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tagging and Branching (cvs rtag)
<br>
You can tag particular versions of a module or file in the
repository, with plain or branch tags, without having the
module checked out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exporting <br>
Once a software release has been tagged, you can use a
special type of checkout called an export. This allows you
to cleanly check out files from the repository, without all
of <br>
the administrivia that CVS needs to have while working on
the files. It is useful for delivery of a software release
to a customer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing <br>
TkCVS contains a special dialog to allow users to import new
files into the repository. In CVS, new modules can be
assigned places within the repository, as well as
descriptive <br>
names (so that other people know what they are for).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the Module Browser displays
a CVS repository, the first column is a tree showing the
module codes and directory names of all of the items in the
repository. The icon shows <br>
whether the item is a directory (which may contain other
directories or modules), or whether it is a module (which
may be checked out from TkCVS). It is possible for an item
to <br>
be both a module and a directory. If it has a red ball on
it, you can check it out. If it shows a plain folder icon,
you have to open the folder to get to the items that you can
<br>
check out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To select a module, click on it
with the left mouse button. The right mouse button will
perform a secondary selection, which is used only for
Subversion diff and patch. To clear <br>
the selection, click on the item again or click in an empty
area of the module column. There can only be one primary and
one secondary selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Repository Browser Buttons <br>
The module browser contains the following buttons:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Who: Shows which modules are
checked out by whom.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Import: <br>
This item will import the contents of the current directory
(the one shown in the Working Directory Display) into the
repository as a module. See the section titled <br>
Importing for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Browse: <br>
Displays a list of the selected module&rsquo;s files. From
the file list, you can view the file, browse its revision
history, or see a list of its tags.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check Out: <br>
Checks out the current version of a module. A dialog allows
you to specify a tag, change the destination, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Export: <br>
Exports the current version of a module. A dialog allows you
to specify a tag, change the destination, and so on. Export
is similar to check-out, except exported directo&acirc; <br>
ries do not contain the CVS or administrative directories,
and are therefore cleaner (but cannot be used for checking
files back in to the repository). You must supply a <br>
tag name when you are exporting a module to make sure you
can reproduce the exported files at a later date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tag: This button tags an entire
module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Branch Tag: <br>
This creates a branch of a module by giving it a branch
tag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Patch Summary: <br>
This item displays a short summary of the differences
between two versions of a module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Create Patch File: <br>
This item creates a Larry Wall format patch(1) file of the
module selected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Close: This button closes the
Repository Browser. If no other windows are open, TkCVS
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing New Modules <br>
Before importing a new module, first check to make sure that
you have write permission to the repository. Also
you&rsquo;ll have to make sure the module name is not
already in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To import a module you first
need a directory where the module is located. Make sure that
there is nothing in this directory except the files that you
want to import.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press the big &quot;Repository
Browser&quot; button in the top part of the tkcvs UI, or use
CVS -&gt; Import WD into Repository from the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the module browser, press the
Import button on the bottom, the one that shows a folder and
an up arrow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the dialog that pops up, fill
in a descriptive title for the module. This will be what you
see in the right side of the module browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK the dialog. Several things
happen now. The directory is imported, the CVSROOT/module
file is updated, your original directory is saved as
directory.orig, and the newly cre&acirc; <br>
ated module is checked out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it finishes, you should
find the original Working Directory Browser showing the
files in the newly created, checked out module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a more detailed
description of the fields in the Import Dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Name: <br>
A name for the module. This name must not already exist in
the repository. Your organization could settle on a single
unambiguous code for modules. One possibility is <br>
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[project code]-[subsystem
code]-[module code]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Path: <br>
The location in the repository tree where your new module
will go.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Descriptive Title: <br>
A one-line descriptive title for your module. This will be
displayed in the right-hand column of the browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version Number: <br>
The current version number of the module. This should be a
number of the form X.Y.Z where .Y and .Z are optional. You
can leave this blank, in which case 1 will be used as <br>
the first version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing a directory into
Subversion is similar but not so complicated. You use the
SVN -&gt; Import CWD into Repository menu. You need supply
only the path in the repository <br>
where you want the directory to go. The repository must be
prepared and the path must exist, however.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Importing to an Existing Module
(CVS) <br>
Before importing to an existing module, first check to make
sure that you have write permission to the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To import to an existing module
you first need a directory where the code is located. Make
sure that there is nothing in this directory (including no
CVS directory) except the <br>
files that you want to import.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Open up the Repository Browser
by selecting File/Browse Modules from the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Repository Browser,
select File/Import To An Existing Module from the menu
bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the dialog that pops up,
press the Browse button and select the name of an existing
module. Press the OK to close this dialog box. Enter the
version number of the code to be <br>
imported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK the dialog. Several things
happen now. The directory is imported, your original
directory is saved as directory.orig, and the newly created
module is checked out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When it finishes, you will find
the original Working Directory Browser showing the original
code. If you press the &quot;Re-read the current
directory&quot; button you will see the results <br>
of the checked out code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a more detailed
description of the fields in the Import Dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Name: <br>
A name for the existing module. Filled in by the use of the
the Browse button</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module Path: <br>
The location in the repository tree where the existing
module is. Filled in by the use of the Browse button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version Number: <br>
The current version number of the module to be imported.
This should be a number of the form X.Y.Z where .Y and .Z
are optional. You can leave this blank, in which case 1 <br>
will be used as the first version number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vendor Merge (CVS) <br>
Software development is sometimes based on source
distribution from a vendor or third-party distributor. After
building a local version of this distribution, merging or
tracking <br>
the vendor&rsquo;s future release into the local version of
the distribution can be done with the vendor merge
command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The vendor merge command assumes
that a separate module has already been defined for the
vendor or third-party distribution with the use of the
&quot;Import To A New Module&quot; and <br>
&quot;Import To An Existing Module&quot; commands. It also
assumes that a separate module has already been defined for
the local code for which the vendor merge operation is to be
applied <br>
to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Start from an empty directory
and invoke tkcvs. Open up the Repository Browser by
selecting File/Browse Modules from the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Checkout the module of the local
code to be merged with changes from the vendor module. (Use
the red icon with the down arrow)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Repository Browser, after
verifying that the Module entry box still has the name the
module of the local code to which the vendor code is to be
merged into, select <br>
File/Vendor Merge from the menu bar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the Module Level Merge With
Vendor Code window, press the Browse button to select the
module to be used as the vendor module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OK the dialog. All revisions
from the vendor module will be shown in the two scroll
lists. Fill in the From and To entry boxes by clicking in
the appropriate scroll lists. Ok <br>
the dialog. Several things happens now. Several screens will
appear showing the output from cvs commands for (1)checking
out temp files, (2)cvs merge, and (3)cvs rdiff.
Informa&acirc; <br>
tion in these screens will tell you what routines will have
merge conflicts and what files are new or deleted. After
perusing the files, close each screen. .TP (In the
preceeding <br>
dialog box, there was an option to save outputs from the
merge and rdiff operations to files CVSmerge.out and
CVSrdiff.out.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The checked out local code will
now contain changes from a merge between two revisions of
the vendor modules. This code will not be checked into the
repository. You can do that <br>
after you&rsquo;ve reconciled conflicts and decide if that
is what you really want.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A detailed example on how to use
the vendor merge operation is provided in the PDF file
vendor5readme.pdf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration Files <br>
There are two configuration files for TkCVS. The first is
stored in the directory in which the *.tcl files for TkCVS
are installed. This is called tkcvs_def.tcl. You can put a
<br>
file called site_def in that directory, too. That&rsquo;s a
good place for site-specific things like tagcolours. Unlike
tkcvs_def.tcl, it will not be overwritten when you install a
<br>
newer version of TkCVS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Values in the site configuration
files can be over-ridden at the user level by placing a
.tkcvs file in your home directory. Commands in either of
these files should use Tcl syn&acirc; <br>
tax. In other words, to set a variable name, you should have
the following command in your .tkcvs file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set variablename value</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">for example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set cvscfg(editor)
&quot;gvim&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables are
supported by TkCVS:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Startup <br>
cvscfg(startwindow) <br>
Which window you want to see on startup. (workdir or
module)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVS <br>
cvscfg(cvsroot) <br>
If set, it overrides the CVSROOT environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Subversion <br>
If your SVN repository has a structure similar to trunk,
branches, and tags but with different names, you can tell
TkCVS about it by setting variables in tkcvs_def.tcl: <br>
set cvscfg(svn_trunkdir) &quot;elephants&quot; <br>
set cvscfg(svn_branchdir) &quot;dogs&quot; <br>
set cvscfg(svn_tagdir) &quot;ducklings&quot; The branch
browser depends on the convention of having a trunk,
branches, and tags structure to draw the diagram. These
variables may give <br>
you a little more flexibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GUI <br>
Most colors and fonts can be customized by using the options
database. For example, you can add lines like these to your
.tkcvs file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">option add *Canvas.background
#c3c3c3 <br>
option add *Menu.background #c3c3c3 <br>
option add *selectColor #ffec8b <br>
option add *Text.background gray92 <br>
option add *Entry.background gray92 <br>
option add *Listbox.background gray92 <br>
option add *ToolTip.background LightGoldenrod1 <br>
option add *ToolTip.foreground black</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(picklist_items) <br>
Maximum number of visited directories and repositories to
save in the picklist history</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Log browser <br>
cvscfg(colourA) cvscfg(colourB) <br>
Hilight colours for revision-log boxes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(tagdepth) <br>
Number of tags you want to see for each revision on the
branching diagram before it says &quot;more...&quot; and
offers a pop-up to show the rest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(toomany_tags) <br>
Number of tags in a Subversion repository that&rsquo;s
&quot;too many&quot;, ie. will take longer to proecess for
the branch diagram than you&rsquo;re willing to wait.
(Building a branch dia&acirc; <br>
gram for Subversion is very inefficient.) If there are more
than that number and cvscfg(confirm_prompt) is true, a
dialog will appear asking whether to process the tags or
<br>
to draw the diagram without them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(tagcolour,tagstring) <br>
Colors for marking tags. For example: <br>
set cvscfg(tagcolour,tkcvs_r6) Purple</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Module browser <br>
cvscfg(aliasfolder) <br>
In the CVS module browser, if true this will cause the alias
modules to be grouped in one folder. Cleans up clutter if
there are a lot of aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User preferences <br>
cvscfg(allfiles) <br>
Set this to false to see normal files only in the directory
browser. Set it to true to see all files including hidden
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(auto_status) <br>
Set the default for automatic status-refresh of a CVS
controlled directory. Automatic updates are done when a
directory is entered and after some operations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(auto_tag) <br>
Whether to tag the merged-from revision when using TkCVS to
merge different revisions of files by default. A dialog
still lets you change your mind, regardless of the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(confirm_prompt) <br>
Ask for confirmation before performing an operation(true or
false)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(dateformat) <br>
Format for the date string shown in the &quot;Date&quot;
column, for example &quot;%Y/%m/%d %H:%M&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(cvslock) <br>
Set to true to turn on the ability to use cvs-admin locking
from the GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(econtrol) <br>
Set this to true to turn on the ability to use CVS Edit and
Unedit, if your site is configured to allow the feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(editor) <br>
Preferred default editor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(editors) <br>
String pairs giving the editor-command and
string-match-pattern, for deciding which editor to use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(editorargs) <br>
Command-line arguments to send to the default editing
program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(ldetail) <br>
Detail level for status reports (latest, summary,
verbose)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(mergetoformat)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(mergefromformat) <br>
Format for mergeto- and mergefrom- tags. The _BRANCH_ part
must be left as-is, but you can change the prefix and the
date format, for example &quot;mergeto_BRANCH_%d%b%y&quot;.
<br>
The date format must be the same for both. CVS rule: a tag
must not contain the characters &lsquo;$,.:;@&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(rdetail) <br>
Detail for repository and workdir reports (terse, summary,
verbose)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(recurse) <br>
Whether reports are recursive (true or false)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(savelines) <br>
How many lines to keep in the trace window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(status_filter) <br>
Filter out unknown files (status &quot;?&quot;) from CVS
Check and CVS Update reports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(use_cvseditor) <br>
Let CVS invoke an editor for commit log messages rather than
having tkcvs use its own input box. By doing this, your
site&rsquo;s commit template (rcsinfo) can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File filters <br>
cvscfg(file_filter) <br>
Pattern for which files to list. Empty string is equivalent
to the entire directory (minus hidden files)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(ignore_file_filter) <br>
Pattern used in the workdir filter for files to be
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(clean_these) <br>

unwanted files)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">System <br>
cvscfg(print_cmd) <br>
System command used for printing. lpr, enscript -Ghr,
etc)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(shell) <br>
What you want to happen when you ask for a shell</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(terminal) <br>
Command prefix to use to run something in a terminal
window</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Portability <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(tkdiff) <br>
How to start tkdiff. Example sh /usr/local/bin/tkdiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(tmpdir) <br>
Directory in which to do behind-the-scenes checkouts.
Usually /tmp or /var/tmp)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Debugging <br>
cvscfg(log_classes) <br>
For debugging: C=CVS commands, E=CVS stderr output, F=File
creation/deletion, T=Function entry/exit tracing,
D=Debugging</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvscfg(logging) <br>
Logging (debugging) on or off</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Environment Variables <br>
You should have the CVSROOT environment variable pointing to
the location of your CVS repository before you run TkCVS. It
will still allow you to work with different repositories
<br>
within the same session.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish TkCVS to point to a
Subversion repository by default, you can set the
environment variable SVNROOT. This has no meaning to
Subversion itself, but it will clue TkCVS <br>
if it&rsquo;s started in an un-versioned directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">User Configurable Menu
Extensions <br>
It is possible to extend the TkCVS menu by inserting
additional commands into the .tkcvs or tkcvs_def.tcl files.
These extensions appear on an extra menu to the right of the
<br>
TkCVS Options menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To create new menu entries on
the user-defined menu, set the following variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cvsmenu(command) <br>
Setting a variable with this name to a value like
&quot;commandname&quot; causes the CVS command &quot;cvs
commandname&quot; to be run when this menu option is
selected. For example, the following <br>
line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set cvsmenu(update_A)
&quot;update -A&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes a new menu option titled
&quot;update_A&quot; to be added to the user defined menu
that will run the command &quot;cvs update -A&quot; on the
selected files when it is activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(This example command, for
versions of CVS later than 1.3, will force an update to the
head version of a file, ignoring any sticky tags or versions
attached to the file).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">usermenu(command) <br>
Setting a variable with this name to a value like
&quot;commandname&quot; causes the command
&quot;commandname&quot; to be run when this menu option is
selected. For example, the following line:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set usermenu(view)
&quot;cat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Causes a new menu option titled
&quot;view&quot; to be added to the User defined menu that
will run the command &quot;cat&quot; on the selected files
when it is activated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any user-defined commands will
be passed a list of file names corresponding to the files
selected on the directory listing on the main menu as
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output of the user defined
commands will be displayed in a window when the command is
finished.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CVS Modules File <br>
If you haven&rsquo;t put anything in your CVSROOT/modules
file, please do so. See the &quot;Administrative Files&quot;
section of the CVS manual. Then, you can add comments which
TkCVS can use <br>
to title the modules and to display them in a tree
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The simplest use of
TkCVS&rsquo;s &quot;#D&quot; directive is to display a
meaningful title for the module:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#D softproj Software Development
Projects <br>
softproj softproj</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A fancier use is to organize the
modules into a tree which will mimic their directory nesting
in the repository when they appear in the module browser.
For example, suppose we <br>
have a directory called &quot;chocolate&quot; which is
organized like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">chocolate/ <br>
truffle/ <br>
cocoa3/ <br>
biter/ <br>
sniffer/ <br>
snuffler/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To display its hierarchy, as
well as make the deepest directories more accessible by
giving them module names, we could put this in the modules
file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">#D chocolate Top Chocolate <br>
#D chocolate/truffle Cocoa Level 2 <br>
#D chocolate/truffle/cocoa3 Cocoa Level 3 <br>
#D sniffer Chocolate Sniffer <br>
sniffer chocolate/truffle/cocoa3/sniffer <br>
#D snuff Chocolate Snuffler <br>
snuff chocolate/truffle/cocoa3/snuffler <br>
#D biter Chocolate Biter <br>
biter chocolate/truffle/cocoa3/biter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you are installing TkCVS,
you may like to add these additional lines to the modules
file (remember to check out the modules module from the
repository, and then commit it <br>
again when you have finished the edits).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These extension lines commence
with a &quot;#&quot; character, so CVS interprets them as
comments. They can be safely left in the file whether you
are using TkCVS or not.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;#M&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;#D&quot;. The two had different functions in previous
versions of TkCVS, but now both are parsed the same way.</p>
