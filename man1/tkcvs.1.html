TkCVS - a Tk/Tcl Graphical Interface to CVS and Subversion
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>tkcvs</b> [-dir directory] [-root cvsroot] [-win workdir|module|merge] [-log
  file]
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS and Subversion
  configuration management systems. It displays the status of the files in the
  current working directory, and provides buttons and menus to execute
  configuration-management commands on the selected files. Limited RCS
  functionality is also present. TkDiff is bundled in for browsing and merging
  your changes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
TkCVS also aids in browsing the repository. For Subversion, the repository tree
  is browsed like an ordinary file tree. For CVS, the CVSROOT/modules file is
  read. TkCVS extends CVS with a method to produce a browsable, &quot;user
  friendly&quot; listing of modules. This requires special comments in the
  CVSROOT/modules file. See &quot;CVS Modules File&quot; for more guidance.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
TkCVS accepts the following options.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Working_Directory_Browser"><a class="selflink" href="#Working_Directory_Browser">Working
  Directory Browser</a></h1>
The working directory browser shows the files in your local working copy, or
  &quot;sandbox.&quot; It shows the status of the files at a glance and provides
  tools to help with most of the common CVS, SVN, and RCS operations you might
  do.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the top of the browser you will find:
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The name of the current directory. You can change directories by typing in
  this field. Recently visited directories are saved in the picklist.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The relative path of the current directory in the repository. If it is not
  contained in the repository you may import it using the menu or toolbar
  button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* A Directory Tag name, if the directory is contained in the repository and it
  has been checked out against a particular branch or tag. In Subversion, the
  branch or tag is inferred from the URL based on the conventional
  trunk-branches-tags repository organization.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The CVSROOT of the current directory if it's under CVS control, or the URL of
  the Subversion repository if it's under Subversion control. If neither is
  true, it may default to the value of the $CVSROOT environment variable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main part of the working directory browser is a list of the files in the
  current directory with an icon next to each showing its status. You select a
  file by clicking on its name or icon once with the left mouse button. Holding
  the Control key while clicking will add the file to the group of those already
  selected. You can select a contiguous group of files by holding the Shift key
  while clicking. You can also select a group of files by dragging the mouse
  with the middle or right button pressed to select an area. Selecting an item
  that's already selected de-selects that item. To unselect all files, click the
  left mouse button in an empty area of the file list.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The Date column (can be hidden) shows the modification time of the file is
  shown. The format of the date column may be specified with cvscfg(dateformat).
  The default format was chosen because it sorts the same way alphabetically as
  chronologically.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the directory belongs to a revision system, other columns are present.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The revision column shows which revision of the file is checked out, and
  whether it's on the trunk or on a branch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The status column (can be hidden) shows the revision of the file spelled out
  in text. This information is mostly redundant to the icon in the file column.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* The Editor/Author/Locker column (can be hidden) varies according to revision
  system. In Subversion, the author of the most recent checkin is shown. In CVS,
  it shows a list of people editing the files if your site uses &quot;cvs
  watch&quot; and/or &quot;cvs edit&quot;. Otherwise, it will be empty. In RCS,
  it shows who, if anyone, has the file locked.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The optional columns can be displayed or hidden using the Options menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can move into a directory by double-clicking on it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Double clicking on a file will load the file into a suitable editor so you can
  change it. A different editor can be used for different file types (see
  Configuration Files).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="File_Status"><a class="selflink" href="#File_Status">File
  Status</a></h2>
When you are in a directory that is under CVS or Subversion control, the file
  status will be shown by an icon next to each file. Checking the &quot;Status
  Column&quot; option causes the status to be displayed in text in its own
  column. Some possible statuses are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Up-to-date</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file is up to date with respect to the repository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Locally Modified</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file has been modified in the current directory since
      being checked out of the repository.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Locally Added</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file has been added to the repository. This file will
      become permanent in the repository once a commit is made.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Locally Removed</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">You have removed the file with remove, and not yet
      committed your changes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Needs Checkout</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
      repository. The name is slightly misleading; you will ordinarily use
      update rather than checkout to get that newer revision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Needs Patch</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Like Needs Checkout, but the CVS server will send a patch
      rather than the entire file. Sending a patch or sending an entire file
      accomplishes the same thing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Needs Merge</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Someone else has committed a newer revision to the
      repository, and you have also made modifications to the file.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Unresolved Conflict</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">This is like Locally Modified, except that a previous
      update command gave a conflict. You need to resolve the conflict before
      checking in.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>?</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file is not contained in the repository. You may need

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>[directory:SVN]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The file is a directory which has been checked out from a

      objects.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>[directory:RCS]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A directory which contains an RCS sub-directory or some

You can specify file matching patterns to instruct TkCVS which files you wish to
  see. You can also specify patterns telling it which files to remove when you
  press the &quot;Clean&quot; button or select the <b>File-&gt;Cleanup</b> menu
  item.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Hide&quot; works exactly the way a .cvsignore file works. That is, it
  causes non-CVS files with the pattern to be ignored. It's meant for hiding .o
  files and such. Any file under CVS control will be listed anyway.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Show&quot; is the inverse. It hides non-CVS files except for those with
  the pattern.

  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Module Browser:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The big button at the upper right opens the module browser.
      Opens a module browser window which will enable you to explore items in

      number if you want to bring the files in the repository up to the next
      major version number. For example, if a file is version 1.10, and you do
      not enter a version number, it will be checked in as version 1.11. If you
      enter the version number 3, then it will be checked in as version 3.0
      instead. It is usually better to use symbolic tags for that purpose. If
      you use rcsinfo to supply a template for the comment, you must use an
      external editor. Set cvscfg(use_cvseditor) to do this. For checking in to

      have been made to the file in question (to ask if you want to revert the
      changes to the current revision), the current action of tkcvs is to abort
      the unedit (by piping in nothing to stdin). Therefore, to lose the changes
      and revert to the current revision, it is necessary to delete the file and
      do an update (this will also clear the edit flag). To keep the changes,

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Log_(Branch)_Browser"><a class="selflink" href="#Log_(Branch)_Browser">Log
  (Branch) Browser</a></h1>
The TkCVS Log Browser window enables you to view a graphical display of the
  revision log of a file, including all previous versions and any branched
  versions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can get to the log browser window in three ways, either by invoking it
  directly with &quot;tkcvs [-log] &lt;filename&gt;&quot;, by selecting a file
  within the main window of TkCVS and pressing the Log Browse button, or by
  selecting a file in a list invoked from the module browser and pressing the
  Log Browse button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the Log Browser is examining a checked-out file, the buttons for performing
  merge operations are enabled.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Log_Browser_Window"><a class="selflink" href="#Log_Browser_Window">Log
  Browser Window</a></h2>
The log browser window has three components. These are the file name and version
  information section at the top, the log display in the middle, and a row of
  buttons along the bottom.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Log_Display"><a class="selflink" href="#Log_Display">Log
  Display</a></h2>
The main log display is fairly self explanatory. It shows a group of boxes
  connected by lines indicating the main trunk of the file development (on the
  left hand side) and any branches that the file has (which spread out to the
  right of the main trunk).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each box contains the version number, author of the version, and other
  information determined by the menu View -&gt; Revision Layout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Constructing the branch diagram from Subversion is inefficient, so the Log
  Browser counts the tags when doing a Subversion diagram and pops up a dialog
  giving you a chance to skip the tag step if there are too many tags (where
  &quot;many&quot; arbitrarily equals 10.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Version_Numbers"><a class="selflink" href="#Version_Numbers">Version
  Numbers</a></h2>
Once a file is loaded into the log browser, one or two version numbers may be
  selected. The primary version (Selection A) is selected by clicking the left
  mouse button on a version box in the main log display.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The secondary version (Selection B) is selected by clicking the right mouse
  button on a version box in the main log display.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Operations such as &quot;View&quot; and &quot;Annotate&quot; operate only on the
  primary version selected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Operations such as &quot;Diff&quot; and &quot;Merge Changes to Current&quot;
  require two versions to be selected.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Searching_the_Diagram"><a class="selflink" href="#Searching_the_Diagram">Searching
  the Diagram</a></h2>
You can search the canvas for tags, revisions, authors, and dates.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following special characters are used in the search pattern:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 * Matches any sequence of characters in string, including a null string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 ? Matches any single character in string.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<br/>
 [chars] Matches any character in the set given by chars. If a sequence of the
  form x-y appears in chars, then any character between x and y, inclusive, will
  match.

  <dd class="It-tag">This displays a window in which the file is shown with its

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Merge:</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">To use this button, select a branch version of the file,
      other than the branch you are currently on, as the primary version
      (Selection A). The changes made along the branch up to that version will
      be merged into the current version, and stored in the current directory.
      Optionally, select another version (Selection B) and the changes will be
      from that point rather than from the base of the branch. The version of
      the file in the current directory will be merged, but no commit will
      occur. Then you inspect the merged files, correct any conflicts which may
      occur, and commit when you are satisfied. Optionally, TkCVS will tag the
      version that the merge is from. It suggests a tag of the form
      &quot;mergefrom_&lt;rev&gt;_date.&quot; If you use this auto-tagging
      function, another dialog containing a suggested tag for the merged-to
      version will appear. It's suggested to leave the dialog up until you are
      finished, then copy-and-paste the suggested tag into the &quot;Tag&quot;
      dialog. It is always a good practice to tag when doing merges, and if you
      use tags of the suggested form, the Branch Browser can diagram them.
      (Auto-tagging is not implemented in Subversion because, despite the fact
      that tags are &quot;cheap,&quot; it's somewhat impractical to auto-tag
      single files. You can do the tagging manually, however.)</dd>

  View Options Menu</a></h2>
The View Menu allows you to control what you see in the branch diagram. You can
  choose how much information to show in the boxes, whether to show empty
  revisions, and whether to show tags. You can even control the size of the
  boxes. If you are using Subversion, you may wish to turn the display of tags
  off. If they aren't asked for they won't be read from the repository, which
  can save a lot of time.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Merge_Tool_for_CVS"><a class="selflink" href="#Merge_Tool_for_CVS">Merge
  Tool for CVS</a></h1>
The Merge Tool chooses a &quot;representative&quot; file in the current
  directory and diagrams the branch tags. It tries to pick the
  &quot;bushiest&quot; file, or failing that, the most-revised file. If you
  disagree with its choice, you can type the name of another file in the top
  entry and press Return to diagram that file instead.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The main purpose of this tool is to do merges (cvs update -j rev [-j rev]) on
  the whole directory. For merging one file at a time, you should use the Log
  Browser. You can only merge to the line (trunk or branch) that you are
  currently on. Select a branch to merge from by clicking on it. Then press
  either the &quot;Merge&quot; or &quot;Merge Changes&quot; button. The version
  of the file in the current directory will be over-written, but it will not be
  committed to the repository. You do that after you've reconciled conflicts and
  decided if it's what you really want.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Merge Branch to Current:</i></dt>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Module_Browser"><a class="selflink" href="#Module_Browser">Module
  Browser</a></h1>
Operations that are performed on the repository instead of in a checked-out
  working directory are done with the Module Browser. The most common of these
  operations is checking out or exporting from the repository. The Module
  Browser can be started from the command line (tkcvs -win module) or started
  from the main window by pressing the big button.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Subversion repositories can be browsed like a file tree, and that is what you
  will see in the Module Browser. CVS repositories aren't directly browsable,
  but if the CVSROOT/modules file is maintained appropriately, TkCVS can display
  the modules and infer tree structures if they are present. See the &quot;CVS
  Modules File&quot; section.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Using the module browser window, you can select a module to check out. When you
  check out a module, a new directory is created in the current working
  directory with the same name as the module.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Tagging_and_Branching_(cvs_rtag)"><a class="selflink" href="#Tagging_and_Branching_(cvs_rtag)">Tagging
  and Branching (cvs rtag)</a></h2>
You can tag particular versions of a module or file in the repository, with
  plain or branch tags, without having the module checked out.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Exporting"><a class="selflink" href="#Exporting">Exporting</a></h2>
Once a software release has been tagged, you can use a special type of checkout
  called an export. This allows you to cleanly check out files from the
  repository, without all of the administrivia that CVS needs to have while
  working on the files. It is useful for delivery of a software release to a
  customer.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Importing"><a class="selflink" href="#Importing">Importing</a></h2>
TkCVS contains a special dialog to allow users to import new files into the
  repository. In CVS, new modules can be assigned places within the repository,
  as well as descriptive names (so that other people know what they are for).
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the Module Browser displays a CVS repository, the first column is a tree
  showing the module codes and directory names of all of the items in the
  repository. The icon shows whether the item is a directory (which may contain
  other directories or modules), or whether it is a module (which may be checked
  out from TkCVS). It is possible for an item to be both a module and a
  directory. If it has a red ball on it, you can check it out. If it shows a
  plain folder icon, you have to open the folder to get to the items that you
  can check out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To select a module, click on it with the left mouse button. The right mouse
  button will perform a secondary selection, which is used only for Subversion
  diff and patch. To clear the selection, click on the item again or click in an
  empty area of the module column. There can only be one primary and one
  secondary selection.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Repository_Browser_Buttons"><a class="selflink" href="#Repository_Browser_Buttons">Repository

Before importing a new module, first check to make sure that you have write
  permission to the repository. Also you'll have to make sure the module name is
  not already in use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To import a module you first need a directory where the module is located. Make
  sure that there is nothing in this directory except the files that you want to
  import.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Press the big &quot;Repository Browser&quot; button in the top part of the tkcvs
  UI, or use CVS -&gt; Import WD into Repository from the menu bar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the module browser, press the Import button on the bottom, the one that shows
  a folder and an up arrow.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the dialog that pops up, fill in a descriptive title for the module. This
  will be what you see in the right side of the module browser.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OK the dialog. Several things happen now. The directory is imported, the
  CVSROOT/module file is updated, your original directory is saved as
  directory.orig, and the newly created module is checked out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When it finishes, you should find the original Working Directory Browser showing
  the files in the newly created, checked out module.

Importing a directory into Subversion is similar but not so complicated. You use
  the SVN -&gt; Import CWD into Repository menu. You need supply only the path
  in the repository where you want the directory to go. The repository must be
  prepared and the path must exist, however.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Importing_to_an_Existing_Module_(CVS)"><a class="selflink" href="#Importing_to_an_Existing_Module_(CVS)">Importing

Before importing to an existing module, first check to make sure that you have
  write permission to the repository.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To import to an existing module you first need a directory where the code is
  located. Make sure that there is nothing in this directory (including no CVS
  directory) except the files that you want to import.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Open up the Repository Browser by selecting File/Browse Modules from the menu
  bar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the Repository Browser, select File/Import To An Existing Module from the

  number of the code to be imported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OK the dialog. Several things happen now. The directory is imported, your
  original directory is saved as directory.orig, and the newly created module is
  checked out.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When it finishes, you will find the original Working Directory Browser showing
  the original code. If you press the &quot;Re-read the current directory&quot;

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Vendor_Merge_(CVS)"><a class="selflink" href="#Vendor_Merge_(CVS)">Vendor
  Merge (CVS)</a></h1>
Software development is sometimes based on source distribution from a vendor or
  third-party distributor. After building a local version of this distribution,
  merging or tracking the vendor's future release into the local version of the
  distribution can be done with the vendor merge command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The vendor merge command assumes that a separate module has already been defined
  for the vendor or third-party distribution with the use of the &quot;Import To
  A New Module&quot; and &quot;Import To An Existing Module&quot; commands. It
  also assumes that a separate module has already been defined for the local
  code for which the vendor merge operation is to be applied to.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Start from an empty directory and invoke tkcvs. Open up the Repository Browser
  by selecting File/Browse Modules from the menu bar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Checkout the module of the local code to be merged with changes from the vendor
  module. (Use the red icon with the down arrow)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the Repository Browser, after verifying that the Module entry box still has
  the name the module of the local code to which the vendor code is to be merged
  into, select File/Vendor Merge from the menu bar.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the Module Level Merge With Vendor Code window, press the Browse button to
  select the module to be used as the vendor module.
<div class="Pp"></div>
OK the dialog. All revisions from the vendor module will be shown in the two
  scroll lists. Fill in the From and To entry boxes by clicking in the
  appropriate scroll lists. Ok the dialog. Several things happens now. Several
  screens will appear showing the output from cvs commands for (1)checking out
  temp files, (2)cvs merge, and (3)cvs rdiff. Information in these screens will
  tell you what routines will have merge conflicts and what files are new or
  deleted. After perusing the files, close each screen. .TP <i>(In the
  preceeding dialog box, there was an option to save outputs from the merge and
  rdiff operations to files CVSmerge.out and CVSrdiff.out.)</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The checked out local code will now contain changes from a merge between two
  revisions of the vendor modules. This code will not be checked into the
  repository. You can do that after you've reconciled conflicts and decide if
  that is what you really want.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A detailed example on how to use the vendor merge operation is provided in the
  PDF file vendor5readme.pdf.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Configuration_Files"><a class="selflink" href="#Configuration_Files">Configuration
  Files</a></h1>
There are two configuration files for TkCVS. The first is stored in the
  directory in which the *.tcl files for TkCVS are installed. This is called
  tkcvs_def.tcl. You can put a file called site_def in that directory, too.
  That's a good place for site-specific things like tagcolours. Unlike
  tkcvs_def.tcl, it will not be overwritten when you install a newer version of
  TkCVS.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Values in the site configuration files can be over-ridden at the user level by
  placing a .tkcvs file in your home directory. Commands in either of these
  files should use Tcl syntax. In other words, to set a variable name, you
  should have the following command in your .tkcvs file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 set variablename value</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
for example:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 set cvscfg(editor) &quot;gvim&quot;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following variables are supported by TkCVS:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Startup"><a class="selflink" href="#Startup">Startup</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>cvscfg(startwindow)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Which window you want to see on startup. (workdir or
      module)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>cvscfg(cvsroot)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If set, it overrides the CVSROOT environment variable.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Subversion"><a class="selflink" href="#Subversion">Subversion</a></h2>
If your SVN repository has a structure similar to trunk, branches, and tags but
  with different names, you can tell TkCVS about it by setting variables in
  tkcvs_def.tcl:
<br/>
 set cvscfg(svn_trunkdir) &quot;elephants&quot;
<br/>
 set cvscfg(svn_branchdir) &quot;dogs&quot;
<br/>
 set cvscfg(svn_tagdir) &quot;ducklings&quot; The branch browser depends on the
  convention of having a trunk, branches, and tags structure to draw the
  diagram. These variables may give you a little more flexibility.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="GUI"><a class="selflink" href="#GUI">GUI</a></h2>
Most colors and fonts can be customized by using the options database. For
  example, you can add lines like these to your .tkcvs file:

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Environment_Variables"><a class="selflink" href="#Environment_Variables">Environment
  Variables</a></h1>
You should have the CVSROOT environment variable pointing to the location of
  your CVS repository before you run TkCVS. It will still allow you to work with
  different repositories within the same session.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you wish TkCVS to point to a Subversion repository by default, you can set
  the environment variable SVNROOT. This has no meaning to Subversion itself,
  but it will clue TkCVS if it's started in an un-versioned directory.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="User_Configurable_Menu_Extensions"><a class="selflink" href="#User_Configurable_Menu_Extensions">User
  Configurable Menu Extensions</a></h1>
It is possible to extend the TkCVS menu by inserting additional commands into
  the .tkcvs or tkcvs_def.tcl files. These extensions appear on an extra menu to
  the right of the TkCVS Options menu.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create new menu entries on the user-defined menu, set the following
  variables:
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="cvsmenu(command)"><a class="selflink" href="#cvsmenu(command)">cvsmenu(command)</a></h2>
Setting a variable with this name to a value like &quot;commandname&quot; causes
  the CVS command &quot;cvs commandname&quot; to be run when this menu option is
  selected. For example, the following line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 set cvsmenu(update_A) &quot;update -A&quot;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Causes a new menu option titled &quot;update_A&quot; to be added to the user
  defined menu that will run the command &quot;cvs update -A&quot; on the
  selected files when it is activated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
(This example command, for versions of CVS later than 1.3, will force an update
  to the head version of a file, ignoring any sticky tags or versions attached
  to the file).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="usermenu(command)"><a class="selflink" href="#usermenu(command)">usermenu(command)</a></h2>
Setting a variable with this name to a value like &quot;commandname&quot; causes
  the command &quot;commandname&quot; to be run when this menu option is
  selected. For example, the following line:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 set usermenu(view) &quot;cat&quot;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Causes a new menu option titled &quot;view&quot; to be added to the User defined
  menu that will run the command &quot;cat&quot; on the selected files when it
  is activated.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any user-defined commands will be passed a list of file names corresponding to
  the files selected on the directory listing on the main menu as arguments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output of the user defined commands will be displayed in a window when the
  command is finished.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CVS_Modules_File"><a class="selflink" href="#CVS_Modules_File">CVS
  Modules File</a></h1>
If you haven't put anything in your CVSROOT/modules file, please do so. See the
  &quot;Administrative Files&quot; section of the CVS manual. Then, you can add
  comments which TkCVS can use to title the modules and to display them in a
  tree structure.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The simplest use of TkCVS's &quot;#D&quot; directive is to display a meaningful
  title for the module:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D softproj Software Development
  Projects</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">softproj softproj</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A fancier use is to organize the modules into a tree which will mimic their
  directory nesting in the repository when they appear in the module browser.
  For example, suppose we have a directory called &quot;chocolate&quot; which is
  organized like this:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">chocolate/</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 truffle/</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 cocoa3/</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 biter/</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 sniffer/</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">
<br/>
 snuffler/</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To display its hierarchy, as well as make the deepest directories more
  accessible by giving them module names, we could put this in the modules file:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D	chocolate	Top Chocolate</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D	chocolate/truffle	Cocoa Level 2</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D	chocolate/truffle/cocoa3	Cocoa Level
  3</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D	sniffer	Chocolate Sniffer</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">sniffer	chocolate/truffle/cocoa3/sniffer</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D	snuff	Chocolate Snuffler</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">snuff	chocolate/truffle/cocoa3/snuffler</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">#D	biter	Chocolate Biter</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">biter	chocolate/truffle/cocoa3/biter</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When you are installing TkCVS, you may like to add these additional lines to the
  modules file (remember to check out the modules module from the repository,
  and then commit it again when you have finished the edits).
<div class="Pp"></div>
These extension lines commence with a &quot;#&quot; character, so CVS interprets
  them as comments. They can be safely left in the file whether you are using
  TkCVS or not.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;#M&quot; is equivalent to &quot;#D&quot;. The two had different functions
  in previous versions of TkCVS, but now both are parsed the same way.
