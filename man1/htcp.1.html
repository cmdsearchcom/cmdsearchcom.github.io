<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
htcp, htmv, htrm, htls, htll, htmkdir, htfind, htping - file
transfers and queries via HTTP/HTTPS/SiteCast</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
htcp, htmv [options] Source-URL[s] Destination-URL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htrm, htls, htll, htmkir, htfind
[options] Target-URL[s]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">htping [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
htcp is a client to fetch files or directory listings from
remote servers using HTTP or HTTPS, or to put or delete
files or directories onto remote servers using HTTPS. htcp
is <br>
similar to scp(1), but uses HTTP/HTTPS rather than ssh as
its transfer protocol. htcp can also use the HTCP protocol
to query HTTP(S) fileservers via SiteCast.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When talking to a fileserver
with HTTPS, htcp can run &quot;anonymously&quot;, with a
standard X.509 user certificate and key, or with a GSI
Proxy. This makes htcp very useful in Grid <br>
environments where many users have certificates and where
jobs and users have access to GSI proxies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">URLs <br>
htcp supports the file:, http: and https: URL schemes as
sources and destinations. If no scheme is given, the URL
scheme is assumed to be file: and relative to the current
direc&acirc; <br>
tory if not an absolute path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If multiple sources are given
during a copy, they will be used in turn and the destination
must be a directory (directories are indicated by a trailing
/) However, source and <br>
destination cannot both refer to remote servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v/--verbose <br>
Turn on debugging information. Used once, this option will
enable htcp&rsquo;s messages to stderr. Used twice, will
also enable the underlying libcurl messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete <br>
Instead of copying files, delete all the URLs given on the
command line. Calling the program as htrm has the same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list Instead of copying files,
output lists of files located in the URL-directories given
on the command line. Calling the program as htls has the
same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--long-list <br>
Instead of copying files, output long listings of files
located in the URL-directories given on the command line. If
available, the size in bytes and modification time of <br>
each file is given. Calling the program as htll has the same
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--mkdir <br>
Instead of copying files, attempt to create a directory on a
remote server with HTTP PUT. The server must support the
convention that PUT to a URL with a trailing slash <br>
means create a directory. No file body is sent. Calling the
program as htmkdir has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--move Move/rename files on a
single remote server, given the two, absolute URLs of the
remote file names. Server must support HTTP/WebDAV MOVE.
Calling the program as htmv has <br>
the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ping Query specified multicast
groups with the HTCP NOP (&quot;No Operation&quot;) code.
SiteCast enabled servers will respond immediately with a NOP
reply, and all of the responses <br>
will be listed, with the round trip time in milliseconds.
Any waiting times specified in the --groups option will be
ignored. Calling the program as htping has the same <br>
effect. (--groups must be used for this option to work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--find Query specified multicast
groups with the HTCP TST code. SiteCast enabled servers will
respond with TST replies if they have the files
corresponding to the given SiteCast <br>
target URL(s). All of the transfer URLs returned will be
listed. Waiting times specified in the --groups option will
be used to space out the multicast queries, but the <br>
program listens for responses continuously. Calling the
program as htfind has the same effect. (--groups must be
used for this option to work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--groups &lt;IP Groups&gt; <br>
IP multicast groups to use for SiteCast queries. IP Groups
is a comma separated list of groups, in the format:
nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn:port[:ttl[:seconds]] The IP number and port
<br>
must be specified. The IP time-to-live, ttl, controls how
many networks the multicast packets may pass through - the
default, 1, limits packets to the local network. Mul&acirc;
<br>
tiple groups may be specified, separated by commas. If
multiple groups are specified, then seconds is the time to
wait before making the next multicast - 1 second is the <br>
default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout &lt;seconds&gt; <br>
A request timeout used for multicast ping.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--anon Do not attempt to use
X.509 user certificates or GSI proxies to authenticate to
the remote HTTPS server. This means you are
&quot;anonymous&quot;, but the server&rsquo;s identity may
<br>
still be verified and the connection is still encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cert &lt;X.509 cert path&gt;
and --key &lt;X.509 key path&gt; <br>
Path to the PEM-encoded X.509 or GSI Proxy user certificate
and key to use for HTTPS connections, instead of
&quot;anonymous mode.&quot; If only one of --key or --cert
is given, <br>
then that will be tried for both. If neither is given, then
the following order of precedence is used: the file name
held by the variable X509_USER_PROXY; the file <br>
/tmp/x509up_uID (with Unix UID equal to ID); the file names
held by X509_USER_CERT / X509_USER_KEY; the files
~/.globus/usercert.pem and ~/.globus/userkey.pem (where ~/
is <br>
the home directory of the user.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--capath &lt;X.509 CA root certs
directory or file&gt; <br>
Path to the PEM-encoded CA root certificates to use when
verifying remote servers&rsquo; host certificates in HTTPS
connections. Ideally this should be a directory of hash.0
<br>
files as described in the OpenSSL verify(1) man page, but a
file may be used instead. If --capath is not given, the
value of the environment variable X509_CERT_DIR will be <br>
tried. If this is not valid, then
/etc/grid-security/certificates will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-verify <br>
Do not use CA root certificates to verify remote
servers&rsquo; host certificates. This is useful for testing
sites before their certificate is set up properly, but
leaves you <br>
vulnerable to &quot;man in the middle&quot; attacks by
hostile servers masquerading as your target.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--grid-http <br>
Try to use GridHTTP redirection for HTTPS URLs. Compatible
servers will perform authentication and authorization on the
HTTPS connection and then redirect to HTTP for the <br>
GET or PUT file transfer. htcp makes the HTTP request using
the GRID_AUTH_PASSCODE single-use passcode obtained via
HTTPS. The --grid-http option will be ignored for <br>
directory operations or HTTP URLs. If a redirected transfer
isn&rsquo;t possible, a normal HTTPS data transfer will be
attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sitecast <br>
Try to use SiteCast to locate remote files which are to be
copied (currently only for the fetching of remote files.) If
no location is found via SiteCast, then a direct <br>
request for the given URL is tried. (--groups must be used
for this option to work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--domain &lt;SiteCast domain&gt;
<br>
Try to use SiteCast to locate remote files which are to be
copied (currently only for the fetching of remote files) if
the domain component of the URL matches the SiteCast <br>
domain given. If no location is found via SiteCast, then a
direct request for the given URL is tried. (--groups must be
used for this option to work.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/tmp/x509up_uID <br>
Default GSI Proxy file for Unix UID equal to ID.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/etc/grid-security/certificates
<br>
Default location for trusted Certification Authority root
certificates to use when checking server certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/tmp/.ca-roots-XXXXXX <br>
Prior to 7.9.8, the underlying curl library did not support
the CA root certificates directory. If built with an old
version of libcurl, htcp will concatenate the cer&acirc;
<br>
tificates in the CA roots directory into a unique temporary
file and use that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
X509_CERT_DIR <br>
Holds directory to search for Certification Authority root
certificates when verifying server certificates. (Tried if
--capath is not given on the command line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X509_USER_PROXY <br>
Holds file name of a GSI Proxy to use as user certificate.
(Tried if --cert or --key are not given on the command
line.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY
<br>
Holds file name of X.509 user certificate and key. (Tried if
X509_USER_PROXY is not valid.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
0 is returned on complete success. Curl error codes are
returned when reported by the underlying curl library, and
CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR (22) is returned when the HTTP(S)
<br>
server returns a code outside the range 200-299. The manpage
libcurl-errors(3) lists all the curl error codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TO DO <br>
Recursive copying. Server-side wildcards. Parallel streams.
Better error recovery.</p>
