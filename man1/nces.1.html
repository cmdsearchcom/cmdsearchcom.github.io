<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nces performs gridpoint averages of variables across an
arbitrary number (an ensemble) of input files, with each
file receiving an equal weight in the average. Each variable
in <br>
the output-file will be the same size as the same variable
in any one of the in the input-files, and all input-files
must be the same size. Whereas ncra only performs averages
<br>
over the record dimension (e.g., time), and weights each
record in the record dimension evenly, nces averages entire
files, and weights each file evenly. All dimensions,
includ&acirc; <br>
ing the record dimension, are treated identically and
preserved in the output-file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file is the logical unit of
organization for the results of many scientific studies.
Often one wishes to generate a file which is the gridpoint
average of many separate <br>
files. This may be to reduce statistical noise by combining
the results of a large number of experiments, or it may
simply be a step in a procedure whose goal is to compute
<br>
anomalies from a mean state. In any case, when one desires
to generate a file whose properties are the mean of all the
input files, then nces is the operator to use. nces <br>
assumes coordinate variable are properties common to all of
the experiments and so does not average them across files.
Instead, nces copies the values of the coordinate
vari&acirc; <br>
ables from the first input file to the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Consider a model experiment which generated five
realizations of one year of data, say 1985. You can imagine
that the experimenter slightly perturbs the initial
conditions of <br>
the problem before generating each new solution. Assume each
file contains all twelve months (a seasonal cycle) of data
and we want to produce a single file containing the <br>
ensemble average (mean) seasonal cycle. Here the numeric
filename suffix denotes the experiment number (not the
month): <br>
nces 85_01.nc 85_02.nc 85_03.nc 85_04.nc 85_05.nc 85.nc <br>
nces 85_0[1-5].nc 85.nc <br>
nces -n 5,2,1 85_01.nc 85.nc <br>
These three commands produce identical answers. The output
file, 85.nc, is the same size as the inputs files. It
contains 12 months of data (which might or might not be
stored <br>
in the record dimension, depending on the input files), but
each value in the output file is the average of the five
values in the input files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the previous example, the
user could have obtained the ensemble average values in a
particular spatio-temporal region by adding a hyperslab
argument to the command, e.g., <br>
nces -d time,0,2 -d lat,-23.5,23.5 85_??.nc 85.nc <br>
In this case the output file would contain only three slices
of data in the time dimension. These three slices are the
average of the first three slices from the input files. <br>
Additionally, only data inside the tropics is included.</p>

The full documentation for NCO is maintained as a Texinfo
manual called the NCO Users Guide. Because NCO is
mathematical in nature, the documentation includes
TeX-intensive por&acirc; <br>
tions not viewable on character-based displays. Hence the
only complete and authoritative versions of the NCO Users
Guide are the PDF (recommended), DVI, and Postscript
versions <br>
at &lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.pdf&gt;,
&lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.dvi&gt;, and
&lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.ps&gt;, respectively. HTML and XML
versions are available at &lt;http://nco.sf.net/nco.html&gt;
