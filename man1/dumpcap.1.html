<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Dumpcap is a network traffic dump tool. It lets you capture
packet data from a live network and write the packets to a
file. Dumpcap&rsquo;s default capture file format is pcap-ng
<br>
format. When the -P option is specified, the output file is
written in the pcap format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Without any options set it will
use the libpcap/WinPcap library to capture traffic from the
first available network interface and writes the received
raw packet data, along with <br>
the packets&rsquo; time stamps into a pcap file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the -w option is not
specified, Dumpcap writes to a newly created pcap file with
a randomly chosen name. If the -w option is specified,
Dumpcap writes to the file specified <br>
by that option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Packet capturing is performed
with the pcap library. The capture filter syntax follows the
rules of the pcap library.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-a &lt;capture autostop condition&gt; <br>
Specify a criterion that specifies when Dumpcap is to stop
writing to a capture file. The criterion is of the form
test:value, where test is one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duration:value Stop writing to a
capture file after value seconds have elapsed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filesize:value Stop writing to a
capture file after it reaches a size of value kB. If this
option is used together with the -b option, dumpcap will
stop writing to the <br>
current capture file and switch to the next one if filesize
is reached. Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum
value of 2 GiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files:value Stop writing to
capture files after value number of files were written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b &lt;capture ring buffer
option&gt; <br>
Cause Dumpcap to run in &quot;multiple files&quot; mode. In
&quot;multiple files&quot; mode, Dumpcap will write to
several capture files. When the first capture file fills up,
Dumpcap will <br>
switch writing to the next file and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The created filenames are based
on the filename given with the -w option, the number of the
file and on the creation date and time, e.g.
outfile_00001_20050604120117.pcap, <br>
outfile_00002_20050604120523.pcap, ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With the files option it&rsquo;s
also possible to form a &quot;ring buffer&quot;. This will
fill up new files until the number of files specified, at
which point Dumpcap will discard the <br>
data in the first file and start writing to that file and so
on. If the files option is not set, new files filled up
until one of the capture stop conditions match (or until
<br>
the disk is full).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The criterion is of the form
key:value, where key is one of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">duration:value switch to the
next file after value seconds have elapsed, even if the
current file is not completely filled up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filesize:value switch to the
next file after it reaches a size of value kB. Note that the
filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 GiB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">files:value begin again with the
first file after value number of files were written (form a
ring buffer). This value must be less than 100000. Caution
should be used when <br>
using large numbers of files: some filesystems do not handle
many files in a single directory well. The files criterion
requires either duration or filesize to be specified <br>
to control when to go to the next file. It should be noted
that each -b parameter takes exactly one criterion; to
specify two criterion, each must be preceded by the -b <br>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example: -b filesize:1000 -b
files:5 results in a ring buffer of five files of size one
megabyte each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B &lt;capture buffer size&gt;
<br>
Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB). This is
used by the capture driver to buffer packet data until that
data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet <br>
drops while capturing, try to increase this size. Note that,
while Dumpcap attempts to set the buffer size to 2 MiB by
default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, <br>
the system or interface on which you&rsquo;re capturing
might silently limit the capture buffer size to a lower
value or raise it to a higher value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is available on UNIX
systems with libpcap 1.0.0 or later and on Windows. It is
not available on UNIX systems with earlier versions of
libpcap.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. If used before the first occurrence of the -i option,
it sets the default capture buffer size. If used after an -i
option, it sets the <br>
capture buffer size for the interface specified by the last
-i option occurring before this option. If the capture
buffer size is not set specifically, the default capture
<br>
buffer size is used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c &lt;capture packet count&gt;
<br>
Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing
live data.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C &lt;byte limit&gt; <br>
Limit the amount of memory in bytes used for storing
captured packets in memory while processing it. If used in
combination with the -N option, both limits will apply. <br>
Setting this limit will enable the usage of the separate
thread per interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Dump the code generated for
the capture filter in a human-readable form, and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D Print a list of the
interfaces on which Dumpcap can capture, and exit. For each
network interface, a number and an interface name, possibly
followed by a text description of <br>
the interface, is printed. The interface name or the number
can be supplied to the -i option to specify an interface on
which to capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This can be useful on systems
that don&rsquo;t have a command to list them (e.g., Windows
systems, or UNIX systems lacking ifconfig -a); the number
can be useful on Windows 2000 <br>
and later systems, where the interface name is a somewhat
complex string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;can
capture&quot; means that Dumpcap was able to open that
device to do a live capture. Depending on your system you
may need to run dumpcap from an account with <br>
special privileges (for example, as root) to be able to
capture network traffic. If &quot;dumpcap -D&quot; is not
run from such an account, it will not list any
interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f &lt;capture filter&gt; <br>
Set the capture filter expression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The entire filter expression
must be specified as a single argument (which means that if
it contains spaces, it must be quoted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. If used before the first occurrence of the -i option,
it sets the default capture filter expression. If used after
an -i option, it <br>
sets the capture filter expression for the interface
specified by the last -i option occurring before this
option. If the capture filter expression is not set
specifically, <br>
the default capture filter expression is used if
provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g This option causes the output
file(s) to be created with group-read permission (meaning
that the output file(s) can be read by other members of the
calling user&rsquo;s group).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print the version and options
and exits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;capture
interface&gt;|rpcap://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;capture
interface&gt;|TCP@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;|- <br>
Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for
live packet capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Network interface names should
match one of the names listed in &quot;dumpcap -D&quot;
(described above); a number, as reported by &quot;dumpcap
-D&quot;, can also be used. If you&rsquo;re using <br>
UNIX, &quot;netstat -i&quot; or &quot;ifconfig -a&quot;
might also work to list interface names, although not all
versions of UNIX support the -a option to ifconfig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no interface is specified,
Dumpcap searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first
non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback
interfaces, and choosing the <br>
first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback
interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all, Dumpcap
reports an error and doesn&rsquo;t start the capture.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pipe names should be either the
name of a FIFO (named pipe) or &lsquo;&lsquo;-&rsquo;&rsquo;
to read data from the standard input. Data read from pipes
must be in standard pcap format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. When capturing from multiple interfaces, the capture
file will be saved in pcap-ng format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: the Win32 version of
Dumpcap doesn&rsquo;t support capturing from pipes or
stdin!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I Put the interface in
&quot;monitor mode&quot;; this is supported only on IEEE
802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and supported only on some
operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that in monitor mode the
adapter might disassociate from the network with which
it&rsquo;s associated, so that you will not be able to use
any wireless networks with that <br>
adapter. This could prevent accessing files on a network
server, or resolving host names or network addresses, if you
are capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to <br>
another network with another adapter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. If used before the first occurrence of the -i option,
it enables the monitor mode for all interfaces. If used
after an -i option, it <br>
enables the monitor mode for the interface specified by the
last -i option occurring before this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L List the data link types
supported by the interface and exit. The reported link types
can be used for the -y option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M When used with -D, -L or -S,
print machine-readable output. The machine-readable output
is intended to be read by Wireshark and TShark; its format
is subject to change from <br>
release to release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Save files as pcap-ng. This
is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N &lt;packet limit&gt; <br>
Limit the number of packets used for storing captured
packets in memory while processing it. If used in
combination with the -C option, both limits will apply.
Setting this <br>
limit will enable the usage of the separate thread per
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Don&rsquo;t put the interface
into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in
promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence, -p cannot be
used to ensure that the only <br>
traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the
machine on which Dumpcap is running, broadcast traffic, and
multicast traffic to addresses received by that machine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. If used before the first occurrence of the -i option,
no interface will be put into the promiscuous mode. If used
after an -i option, <br>
the interface specified by the last -i option occurring
before this option will not be put into the promiscuous
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Save files as pcap instead of
the default pcap-ng. In situations that require pcap-ng,
such as capturing from multiple interfaces, this option will
be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q When capturing packets,
don&rsquo;t display the continuous count of packets captured
that is normally shown when saving a capture to a file;
instead, just display, at the end of <br>
the capture, a count of packets captured. On systems that
support the SIGINFO signal, such as various BSDs, you can
cause the current count to be displayed by typing your <br>
&quot;status&quot; character (typically control-T, although
it might be set to &quot;disabled&quot; by default on at
least some BSDs, so you&rsquo;d have to explicitly set it to
use it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s &lt;capture snaplen&gt; <br>
Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live
data. No more than snaplen bytes of each network packet will
be read into memory, or saved to disk. A value of 0 <br>
specifies a snapshot length of 65535, so that the full
packet is captured; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. If used before the first occurrence of the -i option,
it sets the default snapshot length. If used after an -i
option, it sets the <br>
snapshot length for the interface specified by the last -i
option occurring before this option. If the snapshot length
is not set specifically, the default snapshot length is <br>
used if provided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S Print statistics for each
interface once every second.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Use a separate thread per
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Print the version and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w &lt;outfile&gt; <br>
Write raw packet data to outfile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The usage of &quot;-&quot;
for stdout is not allowed here!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y &lt;capture link type&gt;
<br>
Set the data link type to use while capturing packets. The
values reported by -L are the values that can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can occur multiple
times. If used before the first occurrence of the -i option,
it sets the default capture link type. If used after an -i
option, it sets the <br>
capture link type for the interface specified by the last -i
option occurring before this option. If the capture link
type is not set specifically, the default capture link <br>
type is used if provided.</p>
