<p>FvwmClean(1) General Commands Manual FvwmClean(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
FvwmClean - the FVWM desktop clutter reduction module</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
FvwmClean is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
will work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The FvwmClean module performs actions on windows which have
not had the keyboard focus for a specific length of time.
This is intended to help alleviate the problem of leaving
<br>
programs running in unused portions of your desktop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FvwmClean reads the same .fvwmrc
file as fvwm reads when it starts up, and looks for lines
similar to &quot;*FvwmNoClutter 3600 Iconify&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COPYRIGHTS <br>
The FvwmClean program, and the concept for interfacing this
module to the Window Manager, are all original work by
Robert Nation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Copyright 1994, Robert Nation.
No guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or
implied in any way whatsoever. Use this program at your own
risk. Permission to use this <br>
program for any purpose is given, as long as the copyright
is kept intact.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INITIALIZATION <br>
During initialization, FvwmClean will eventually search a
configuration file which describes the time-outs and actions
to take. The configuration file is the same file that fvwm
<br>
used during initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the FvwmClean executable is
linked to another name, ie ln -s FvwmClean OtherClutter,
then another module called OtherClutter can be started, with
a completely different con&acirc; <br>
figuration than FvwmClean, simply by changing the keyword
FvwmClean to OtherClutter. This way multiple
clutter-reduction programs can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INVOCATION <br>
FvwmClean can be invoked by inserting the line &rsquo;Module
FvwmClean&rsquo; in the .fvwmrc file. This can be placed on
a line by itself, if FvwmClean is to be spawned during
fvwm&rsquo;s ini&acirc; <br>
tialization, or can be bound to a menu or mouse button or
keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search directory
specified in the ModulePath configuration option to attempt
to <br>
locate FvwmClean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION OPTIONS <br>
FvwmClean reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm reads when it
starts up, and looks for lines similar to &quot;*FvwmClean
3600 Iconify&quot;. The format of these lines is
&quot;*FvwmClean [time] <br>
[command]&quot;, where command is any fvwm built-in command,
and time is the time in seconds between when a window looses
focus and when the command is executed. At most 3 actions
can <br>
be specified.</p>
