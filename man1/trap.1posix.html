<p>TRAP(1POSIX) POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual
TRAP(1POSIX)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PROLOG <br>
This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s
Manual. The Linux implementation of this interface may
differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for
details of <br>
Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
trap &acirc; trap signals</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
trap n [condition...] <br>
trap [action condition...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
If the first operand is an unsigned decimal integer, the
shell shall treat all operands as conditions, and shall
reset each condition to the default value. Otherwise, if
there <br>
are operands, the first is treated as an action and the
remaining as conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If action is
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;, the shell shall reset each condition
to the default value. If action is null (&quot;&quot;), the
shell shall ignore each specified condition if it arises.
Otherwise, the <br>
argument action shall be read and executed by the shell when
one of the corresponding conditions arises. The action of
trap shall override a previous action (either default <br>
action or one explicitly set). The value of &quot;$?&quot;
after the trap action completes shall be the value it had
before trap was invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The condition can be EXIT, 0
(equivalent to EXIT), or a signal specified using a symbolic
name, without the SIG prefix, as listed in the tables of
signal names in the &lt;signal.h&gt; <br>
header defined in the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Chapter 13, Headers; for example, HUP,
INT, QUIT, TERM. Implementations may permit names with the
SIG prefix or <br>
ignore case in signal names as an extension. Setting a trap
for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP produces undefined results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The environment in which the
shell executes a trap on EXIT shall be identical to the
environment immediately after the last command executed
before the trap on EXIT was taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each time trap is invoked, the
action argument shall be processed in a manner equivalent
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">eval action</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Signals that were ignored on
entry to a non-interactive shell cannot be trapped or reset,
although no error need be reported when attempting to do so.
An interactive shell may <br>
reset or catch signals ignored on entry. Traps shall remain
in place for a given shell until explicitly changed with
another trap command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When a subshell is entered,
traps that are not being ignored shall be set to the default
actions, except in the case of a command substitution
containing only a single trap com&acirc; <br>
mand, when the traps need not be altered. Implementations
may check for this case using only lexical analysis; for
example, if &lsquo;trap&lsquo; and $( trap -- ) do not alter
the traps in <br>
the subshell, cases such as assigning var=trap and then
using $($var) may still alter them. This does not imply that
the trap command cannot be used within the subshell to set
<br>
new traps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trap command with no
operands shall write to standard output a list of commands
associated with each condition. If the command is executed
in a subshell, the implementation <br>
does not perform the optional check described above for a
command substitution containing only a single trap command,
and no trap commands with operands have been executed since
<br>
entry to the subshell, the list shall contain the commands
that were associated with each condition immediately before
the subshell environment was entered. Otherwise, the list
<br>
shall contain the commands currently associated with each
condition. The format shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;trap &acirc;&acirc; %s %s
...0, &lt;action&gt;, &lt;condition&gt; ...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shell shall format the
output, including the proper use of quoting, so that it is
suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that achieve
the same trapping results. For <br>
example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">save_traps=$(trap) <br>
... <br>
eval &quot;$save_traps&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">XSI-conformant systems also
allow numeric signal numbers for the conditions
corresponding to the following signal names:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 SIGHUP</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2 SIGINT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3 SIGQUIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 SIGABRT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9 SIGKILL</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">14 SIGALRM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">15 SIGTERM</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The trap special built-in shall
conform to the Base Definitions volume of
POSIX.1&acirc;2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
None.</p>

messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTENDED DESCRIPTION <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If the trap name or number is invalid, a non-zero exit
status shall be returned; otherwise, zero shall be returned.
For both interactive and non-interactive shells, invalid
sig&acirc; <br>
nal names or numbers shall not be considered a syntax error
and do not cause the shell to abort.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS <br>
Default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following sections are
informative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APPLICATION USAGE <br>
None.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Write out a list of all traps and actions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Set a trap so the logout utility
in the directory referred to by the HOME environment
variable executes when the shell terminates:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap
&rsquo;&quot;$HOME&quot;/logout&rsquo; EXIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap
&rsquo;&quot;$HOME&quot;/logout&rsquo; 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unset traps on INT, QUIT, TERM,
and EXIT:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &acirc; INT QUIT TERM
EXIT</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RATIONALE <br>
Implementations may permit lowercase signal names as an
extension. Implementations may also accept the names with
the SIG prefix; no known historical shell does so. The trap
and <br>
kill utilities in this volume of POSIX.1&acirc;2008 are now
consistent in their omission of the SIG prefix for signal
names. Some kill implementations do not allow the prefix,
and kill <br>
&acirc;l lists the signals without prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Trapping SIGKILL or SIGSTOP is
syntactically accepted by some historical implementations,
but it has no effect. Portable POSIX applications cannot
attempt to trap these signals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The output format is not
historical practice. Since the output of historical trap
commands is not portable (because numeric signal values are
not portable) and had to change to <br>
become so, an opportunity was taken to format the output in
a way that a shell script could use to save and then later
reuse a trap if it wanted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The KornShell uses an ERR trap
that is triggered whenever set &acirc;e would cause an exit.
This is allowable as an extension, but was not mandated, as
other shells have not used it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The text about the environment
for the EXIT trap invalidates the behavior of some
historical versions of interactive shells which, for
example, close the standard input before <br>
executing a trap on 0. For example, in some historical
interactive shell sessions the following trap on 0 would
always print &quot;&acirc;&acirc;&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &rsquo;read foo; echo
&quot;&acirc;$foo&acirc;&quot;&rsquo; 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &rsquo;eval &quot;
$cmd&quot;&rsquo; 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">causes the contents of the shell
variable cmd to be executed as a command when the shell
exits. Using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &rsquo;$cmd&rsquo; 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">does not work correctly if cmd
contains any special characters such as quoting or
redirections. Using:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">trap &quot; $cmd&quot; 0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">also works (the leading
&lt;space&gt; character protects against unlikely cases
where cmd is a decimal integer or begins with
&rsquo;&acirc;&rsquo;), but it expands the cmd variable when
the trap com&acirc; <br>
mand is executed, not when the exit action is executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FUTURE DIRECTIONS <br>
None.</p>
