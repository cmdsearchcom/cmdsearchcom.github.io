<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pen -u service_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
pen 80 www1:8000:10 www2:80:10 www3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here three servers cooperate in
a web server farm. Host www1 runs its web server on port
8000 and accepts a maximum of 10 simultaneous connections.
Host www2 runs on port 80 and <br>
accepts 10 connections. Finally, www3 runs its web server on
port 80 and allows an unlimited number of simultaneous
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Pen is a load balancer for udp and tcp based protocols such
as dns, http or smtp. It allows several servers to appear as
one to the outside and automatically detects servers that
<br>
are down and distributes clients among the available
servers. This gives high availability and scalable
performance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The load balancing algorithm
keeps track of clients and will try to send them back to the
server they visited the last time. The client table has a
number of slots (default 2048, <br>
settable through command-line arguments). When the table is
full, the least recently used one will be thrown out to make
room for the new one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is superior to a simple
round-robin algorithm, which sends a client that connects
repeatedly to different servers. Doing so breaks
applications that maintain state between <br>
connections in the server, including most modern web
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pen detects that a server
is unavailable, it scans for another starting with the
server after the most recently used one. That way we get
load balancing and &quot;fair&quot; failover <br>
for free.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Correctly configured, pen can
ensure that a server farm is always available, even when
individual servers are brought down for maintenance or
reconfiguration. The final single <br>
point of failure, pen itself, can be eliminated by running
pen on several servers, using vrrp to decide which is
active.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending pen a USR1 signal will
make it print some useful statistics on stderr, even if
debugging is disabled. If pen is running in the background
(i.e. without the -f option), <br>
syslog is used rather than stderr. If the -w option is used,
the statistics is saved in HTML format in the given
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending pen a HUP signal will
make it close and reopen the logfile, if logging is enabled,
and reload the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Rotate the log like this
(assuming pen.log is the name of the logfile):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mv pen.log pen.log.1 kill -HUP
&lsquo;cat &lt;pidfile&gt;&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;pidfile&gt; is the
file containing pen&rsquo;s process id, as written by the -p
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sending pen a TERM signal will
make it exit cleanly, closing the log file and all open
sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-C port|/path/to/socket <br>
Specifies a control port where the load balancer listens for
commands. See penctl.1 for a list of the commands available.
The protocol is unauthenticated and the adminis&acirc; <br>
trator is expected to restrict access using an access
control list (for connections over a network) or Unix file
permissions (for a Unix domain socket). Pen will normally
<br>
refuse to open the control port if running as root; see -u
option. If you still insist that you want to run pen as root
with a control port, use &quot;-u root&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F cfgfile <br>
Names a configuration file with commands in penctl format
(see penctl.1). The file is read after processing all
command line arguments, and also after receiving a HUP
sig&acirc; <br>
nal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H Adds X-Forwarded-For header
to http requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Use udp protocol support</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O command <br>
Allows most penctl commands to be used on the Pen command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P Use poll() for event
notification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W Use weight for server
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X Adds an exit command to the
control interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Used in conjunction with -dd
to get communication dumps in ascii rather than hexadecimal
format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b sec Servers that do not
respond are blacklisted, i.e. excluded from the server
selection algorithm, for the specified number of seconds
(default 30).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T sec Clients are tracked for
the specified number of seconds so they can be sent to the
same server as the last time (default 0 = never expire
clients).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c N Max number of clients
(default 2048).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Debugging (repeat -d for
more). The output goes to stderr if we are running in the
foreground (see -f) and to syslog (facility user, priority
debug) otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e host:port <br>
host:port specifies the emergency server to contact if all
regular servers become unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Stay in foreground.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Use a hash on the client IP
address for the initial server selection. This makes it more
predictable where clients will be connected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i service_name <br>
Windows only. Install pen as a service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j dir Run in a chroot
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l file <br>
Turn on logging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m multi_accept <br>
Accept up to multi_accept incoming connections at a
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p file <br>
Write the pid of the running daemon to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q backlog <br>
Allow the queue of pending incoming connections to grow up
to a maximum of backlog entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r Go straight into round-robin
server selection without looking up which server a client
used the last time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Stubborn server selection: if
the initial choice is unavailable, the client connection is
closed without trying another server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t sec Connect timeout in
seconds (default 5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u user <br>
Posix only. Run as a different user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u service_name <br>
Windows only. Uninstall the service.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x N Max number of simultaneous
connections (default 500).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w file <br>
File for status reports in HTML format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o option <br>
Use option in penctl format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E certfile <br>
Use the given certificate in PEM format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K keyfile <br>
Use the given key in PEM format (may be contained in
cert).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G cacertfile <br>
File containing the CA&rsquo;s certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A cacertdir <br>
Directory containing CA certificates in hashed format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z Use SSL compatibility
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R Require valid peer
certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-L protocol <br>
ssl23 (default), ssl3 or tls1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[host:]port OR /path/to/socket
<br>
The local address and port pen listens to. By default pen
listens to all local addresses. Pen can also use a Unix
domain socket as the local listening address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">h1:p1:soft:hard:weight:prio <br>
The address, port and maximum number of simultaneous
connections for a remote server. By default, the port is the
same as the local port, and the soft limit on the number
<br>
of connections is unlimited. The hard limit is used for
clients which have accessed the server before. The weight
and prio are used for the weight- and priority-based <br>
server selection algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
Pen runs in a single process, and opens two sockets for each
connection. Depending on kernel configuration, pen can run
out of file descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSL support is available if pen
was built with the --with-ssl option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GeoIP support is available if
pen was built with the --with-geoip option.</p>
