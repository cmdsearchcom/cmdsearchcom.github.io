<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogger - create archive log for performance metrics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmlogger [-c configfile] [-h host] [-K spec] [-l logfile]
[-L] [-m note] [-n pmnsfile] [-o] [-p pid] [-P] [-r] [-s
endsize] [-t interval] [-T endtime] [-u] [-U username] [-v
vol&acirc; <br>
size] [-V version] [-x fd] [-y] archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmlogger creates the archive logs of performance metric
values that may be &lsquo;&lsquo;played back&rsquo;&rsquo;
by other Performance Co-Pilot (see PCPIntro(1)) tools. These
logs form the basis of <br>
the VCR paradigm and retrospective performance analysis
services common to the PCP toolkit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mandatory argument archive
is the base name for the physical files that constitute an
archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -V option specifies the
version for the archive that is generated. By default a
version 2 archive is generated, and the only value currently
supported for version is 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unless directed to another host
by the -h option or when directly using PMDAs via the -o
option, pmlogger will contact the Performance Metrics
Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the <br>
local host and use that as the source of the metric values
to be logged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To support the required
flexibility and control over what is logged and when,
pmlogger maintains an independent two level logging state
for each instance of each performance met&acirc; <br>
ric. At the first (mandatory) level, logging is allowed to
be on (with an associated interval between samples), or off
or maybe. In the latter case, the second (advisory) level
<br>
logging is allowed to be on (with an associated interval
between samples), or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The mandatory level allows
universal specification that some metrics must be logged, or
must not be logged. The default state for all instances of
all metrics when pmlogger <br>
starts is mandatory maybe and advisory off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use pmlc(1) to interrogate and
change the logging state once pmlogger is running.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a metric&rsquo;s state is
mandatory (on or off) and a request is made to change it to
mandatory maybe, the new state is mandatory maybe and
advisory off. If a metric&rsquo;s state is <br>
already advisory (on or off) and a request is made to change
it to mandatory maybe, the current state is retained.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is not possible for pmlogger
to log specific instances of a metric and all instances of
the same metric concurrently. If specific instances are
being logged and a request to <br>
log all instances is made, then all instances of the metric
will be logged according to the new request, superseding any
prior logging request for the metric. A request to log <br>
all instances of a metric will supersede any previous
request to log all instances. A request to log specific
instances of a metric when all instances are already being
logged <br>
is refused. To do this one must turn off logging for all
instances of the metric first. In each case, the validity of
the request is checked first; for example a request to <br>
change a metric&rsquo;s logging state to advisory on when it
is currently mandatory off is never permitted (it is
necessary to change the state to mandatory maybe first).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optionally, each system running
pmcd(1) may also be configured to run a
&lsquo;&lsquo;primary&rsquo;&rsquo; pmlogger instance. This
pmlogger instance is launched by $PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger, and
is <br>
affected by the files $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control,
$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control.d (use chkconfig(8) or
similar platform-specific commands to activate or disable
the <br>
primary pmlogger instance), $PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmlogger
(environment variable settings for the primary pmlogger)
$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger.options (command line
options <br>
passed to the primary pmlogger) and
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default (the default
initial configuration file for the primary pmlogger).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The primary pmlogger instance is
identified by the -P option. There may be at most one
&lsquo;&lsquo;primary&rsquo;&rsquo; pmlogger instance on
each system. The primary pmlogger instance (if any) must
<br>
be running on the same host as the pmcd(1) to which it
connects (if any), so the -h and -P options are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Logging of some metrics is
possible even in the absence of a local pmcd(1), using the
&quot;local context&quot; mode of operation. This is
activated using the -o option, and causes pmlog&acirc; <br>
ger to make use of local DSO PMDAs instead of communicating
with pmcd(1). When operating using a local context, the -K
option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
<br>
made accessible. The spec argument conforms to the syntax
described in __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3). More than one -K option
may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When launched as a non-primary
instance, pmlogger will exit immediately if the
configuration file causes no metric logging to be scheduled.
The -L option overrides this behav&acirc; <br>
ior, and causes a non-primary pmlogger instance to
&lsquo;&lsquo;linger&rsquo;&rsquo;, presumably pending some
future dynamic re-configuration and state change via
pmlc(1). pmlogger will also linger <br>
without the -L option being used if all the metrics to be
logged are logged as once only metrics. When the once only
metrics have been logged, a warning message will be
generated <br>
stating that the event queue is empty and no more events
will be scheduled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default all diagnostics and
errors from pmlogger are written to the file pmlogger.log in
the directory where pmlogger is launched. The -l option may
be used to override the <br>
default behavior. If the log file cannot be created or is
not writable, output is written to standard error
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If specified, the -s option
instructs pmlogger to terminate after a certain size in
records, bytes or time units has been accumulated. If
endsize is an integer then endsize <br>
records will be written to the log. If endsize is an integer
suffixed by b or bytes then endsize bytes of the archive
data will be written out (note, however, that archive log
<br>
record boundaries will not be broken and so this limit may
be slightly surpassed). Other viable file size units
include: K, Kb, Kbyte, Kilobyte for kilobytes and M, Mb,
Mbyte, <br>
Megabyte for megabytes and G, Gb, Gbyte, Gigabyte for
gigabytes. These units may be optionally suffixed by an s
and may be of mixed case. Alternatively endsize may be an
inte&acirc; <br>
ger or a floating point number suffixed using a time unit as
described in PCPIntro(1) for the interval argument (to the
standard PCP -t command line option). <br>
Some examples of different formats: <br>
-s 100 <br>
-s 100bytes <br>
-s 100K <br>
-s 100Mb <br>
-s 10Gbyte <br>
-s 10mins <br>
-s 1.5hours <br>
The default is for pmlogger to run forever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -r option causes the size of
the physical record(s) for each group of metrics and the
expected contribution of the group to the size of the PCP
archive for one full day of <br>
collection to be reported in the log file. This information
is reported the first time each group is successfully
written to the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -U option specifies the user
account under which to run pmlogger. The default is the
current user account for interactive use. When run as a
daemon, the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; <br>
account is used in current versions of PCP, but in older
versions the superuser account (&quot;root&quot;) was used
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The log file is potentially a
multi-volume data set, and the -v option causes pmlogger to
start a new volume after a certain size in records, bytes,
or time units has been accu&acirc; <br>
mulated for the current volume. The format of this size
specification is identical to that of the -s option (see
above). The default is for pmlogger to create a single
volume <br>
log. Additional volume switches can also be forced
asynchronously by either using pmlc(1) or sending pmlogger a
SIGHUP signal (see below). Note, if a scheduled volume
switch is <br>
in operation due to the -v option, then its counters will be
reset after an asynchronous switch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Independent of any -v option,
each volume of an archive is limited to no more than 2^31
bytes, so pmlogger will automatically create a new volume
for the archive before this <br>
limit is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmlogger operates on
the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
however if the -n option is specified an alternative local
PMNS is loaded from the file pmns&acirc; <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Under normal circumstances,
pmlogger will run forever (except for a -s option or a
termination signal). The -T option may be used to limit the
execution time using the format of <br>
time as prescribed by PCPIntro(1). The time is interpreted
within the time zone of the PMCD server, unless the -y
option is given, within which case the time zone at this
logger <br>
host is used. <br>
Some examples of different formats: <br>
-T 10mins <br>
-T &rsquo;@ 11:30&rsquo; <br>
From this it can be seen that -T 10mins and -s 10mins
perform identical actions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, pmlogger runtime
may be limited to the lifetime of another process by using
the -p or --PID option to nominate the PID of the process of
interest. In this case <br>
the pmlogger will exit when the other process no longer
exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When pmlogger receives a SIGHUP
signal, the current volume of the log is closed, and a new
volume is opened. This mechanism (or the alternative
mechanism via pmlc(1)) may be <br>
used to manage the growth of the log files - once a log
volume is closed, that file may be archived without
ill-effect on the continued operation of pmlogger. See also
the -v <br>
option above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Historically the buffers for the
current log may be flushed to disk using the flush command
of pmlc(1), or by sending pmlogger a SIGUSR1 signal or by
using the -u option. The <br>
current version of pmlogger and the libpcp routines that
underpin pmlogger unconditionally use unbuffered writes and
a single fwrite(3) for each logical record written, and so
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;flushing&rsquo;&rsquo; does not force any
additional data to be written to the file system. The -u
option, the SIGUSR1 handling and the pmlc(1) flush command
are retained for backwards <br>
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When launched with the -x
option, pmlogger will accept asynchronous control requests
on the file descriptor fd. This option is only expected to
be used internally by PCP appli&acirc; <br>
cations that support &lsquo;&lsquo;live record
mode&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -m option allows the string
note to be appended to the map file for this instance of
pmlogger in the $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger directory. This is
currently used internally to <br>
document the file descriptor (fd) when the -x option is
used, or to indicate that this pmlogger instance was started
under the control of pmlogger_check(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX <br>
The configuration file may be specified with the -c option.
If it is not, configuration specifications are read from
standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If configfile does not exist,
then a search is made in the directory
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger for a file of the same name,
and if found that file is used, e.g. if config.mum&acirc;
<br>
ble does not exist in the current directory and the file
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.mumble does exist, then
-c config.mumble and -c
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/con&acirc; <br>
fig.mumble are equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The syntax for the configuration
file is as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Words are separated by white
space (space, tab or newline).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The symbol
&lsquo;&lsquo;#&rsquo;&rsquo; (hash) introduces a comment,
and all text up to the next newline is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Keywords (shown in bold
below) must appear literally (i.e. in lower case).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Each specification begins
with the optional keyword log, followed by one of the states
mandatory on, mandatory off, mandatory maybe, advisory on or
advisory off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. For the on states, a logging
interval must follow using the syntax
&lsquo;&lsquo;once&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;default&rsquo;&rsquo;, or &lsquo;&lsquo;every
N timeunits&rsquo;&rsquo;, or simply &lsquo;&lsquo;N
timeunits&rsquo;&rsquo; - N is an unsigned integer, <br>
and timeunits is one of the keywords msec, millisecond, sec,
second, min, minute, hour or the plural form of one of the
above. <br>
Internal limitations require the interval to be smaller than
(approximately) 74 hours. An interval value of zero is a
synonym for once. An interval of default means to use <br>
the default logging interval of 60 seconds; this default
value may be changed to interval with the -t command line
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The interval argument follows
the syntax described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest
form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this
case are seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. Following the state and
possible interval specifications comes a
&lsquo;&lsquo;{&rsquo;&rsquo;, followed by a list of one or
more metric specifications and a closing
&lsquo;&lsquo;}&rsquo;&rsquo;. The list is white space <br>
(or comma) separated. If there is only one metric
specification in the list, the braces are optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">7. A metric specification
consists of a metric name optionally followed by a set of
instance names. The metric name follows the standard PCP
naming conventions, see pmns(5), <br>
and if the metric name is a non-leaf node in the PMNS (see
pmns(5)), then pmlogger will recursively descend the PMNS
and apply the logging specification to all descendent <br>
metric names that are leaf nodes in the PMNS. The set of
instance names is a &lsquo;&lsquo;[&rsquo;&rsquo;, followed
by a list of one or more space (or comma) separated names,
numbers or strings, <br>
and a closing &lsquo;&lsquo;]&rsquo;&rsquo;. Elements in the
list that are numbers are assumed to be internal instance
identifiers, other elements are assumed to be external
instance identifiers - <br>
see pmGetInDom(3) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no instances are given, then
the logging specification is applied to all instances of the
associated metric.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8. There may be an arbitrary
number of logging specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">9. Following all of the logging
specifications, there may be an optional access control
section, introduced by the literal token [access].
Thereafter come access control rules <br>
that allow or disallow operations from particular hosts or
groups of hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The operations may be used to
interrogate or control a running pmlogger using pmlc(1) and
fall into the following classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enquire interrogate the status
of pmlogger and the metrics it is logging <br>
advisory Change advisory logging. <br>
mandatory Change mandatory logging. <br>
all All of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Access control rules are of the
form &lsquo;&lsquo;allow hostlist : operationlist
;&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;disallow hostlist :
operationlist ;&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The hostlist follows the syntax
and semantics for the access control mechanisms used by PMCD
and are fully documented in pmcd(1). An operationslist is a
comma separated <br>
list of the operations advisory, mandatory, enquire and
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A missing [access] section
allows all access and is equivalent to allow * : all;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The configuration (either from
standard input or configfile) is initially scanned by
pmcpp(1) with the options -rs and -I
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger. This extends the
configu&acirc; <br>
ration file syntax with include file processing (%include),
a common location to search for include files
($PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger), macro definitions (%define),
macro <br>
expansion (%name and %{name}) and conditional inclusion of
lines (%ifdef name ... %else ... %endif and %ifndef name ...
%else ... %endif).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
For each PCP utility, there is a sample pmlogger
configuration file that could be used to create an archive
log suitable for replaying with that tool (i.e. includes all
of the <br>
performance metrics used by the tool). For a tool named foo
this configuration file is located in
$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.foo.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following is a simple
default configuration file for a primary pmlogger instance,
and demonstrates most of the capabilities of the
configuration specification language.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">log mandatory on once {

automatically by either $PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger or one of the
pmlogger(1) monitoring scripts such as pmlog&acirc; <br>
ger_check(1)) <br>
all messages and diagnostics are directed here</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Normally pmlogger creates a socket to receive control
messages from pmlc(1) on the first available TCP/IP port
numbered 4330 or higher. The environment variable
PMLOGGER_PORT <br>
may be used to specify an alternative starting port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If set to the value 1, the
PMLOGGER_LOCAL environment variable will cause pmlogger to
run in a localhost-only mode of operation, where it binds
only to the loopback interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The PMLOGGER_MAXPENDING variable
can be set to indicate the maximum length to which the queue
of pending pmlc connections may grow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), pmdumplog(1), pmlc(1),
pmlogger_check(1), __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3), pcp.conf(5),
pcp.env(5), pmns(5) and chkconfig(8).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
The archive logs are sufficiently precious that pmlogger
will not truncate an existing physical file. A message of
the form <br>
__pmLogNewFile: &quot;foo.index&quot; already exists, not
over-written <br>
__pmLogCreate: File exists <br>
indicates this situation has arisen. You must explicitly
remove the files and launch pmlogger again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There may be at most one primary
pmlogger instance per monitored host; attempting to bend
this rule produces the error: <br>
pmlogger: there is already a primary pmlogger running</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Various other messages relating
to the creation and/or deletion of files in
$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger suggest a permission problem on this
directory, or some feral files have <br>
appeared therein.</p>
