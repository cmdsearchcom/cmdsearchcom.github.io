gnatelim - eliminate dead code from Ada programs

When you are working with a program which shares some set of Ada packages with
  other programs, it may happen, that your program uses only a part of
  subprogram defined in these packages, whereas the code created for unused
  subprograms increases the size of the executable your program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>gnatelim</b> is a utility tracking unused subprograms in an Ada program. Its
  output consists of a list of Eliminate pragmas marking all the subprograms
  that are declared, but never called in a given program. Eliminate is a
  GNAT-specific pragma. By ecompiling your program with these pragmas, you may
  decrease the size of its executable, because the compiler will not create the
  code for unused subprograms.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>gnatelim</b> is an ASIS application developed on top of the ASIS
  implementation for GNAT. It needs a set of tree files representing a program
  to analyze and the bind file for its main subprogram to be created in the
  current directory. For the current version, it is a the user's responsibility
  to maintain the consistency of the set of tree files processed by
  <b>gnatelim</b>, if the user also changes the sources of the Ada program to be
  processed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To produce a list of Eliminate pragmas, <b>gnatelim</b> has to do an extensive
  analysis and it may take some time. For example, to process itself,
  <b>gnatelim</b> takes 4 minutes of CPU time on a Pentium 200.

      option is set). By default (that is, if '-m' option is not set),
      <b>gnatelim</b> analyzes a set of units represented by a given set of tree
