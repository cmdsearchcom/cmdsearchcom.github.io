<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gnatelim - eliminate dead code from Ada programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gnatelim [OPTION]... name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
When you are working with a program which shares some set of
Ada packages with other programs, it may happen, that your
program uses only a part of subprogram defined in these <br>
packages, whereas the code created for unused subprograms
increases the size of the executable your program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnatelim is a utility tracking
unused subprograms in an Ada program. Its output consists of
a list of Eliminate pragmas marking all the subprograms that
are declared, but never <br>
called in a given program. Eliminate is a GNAT-specific
pragma. By ecompiling your program with these pragmas, you
may decrease the size of its executable, because the
compiler <br>
will not create the code for unused subprograms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gnatelim is an ASIS application
developed on top of the ASIS implementation for GNAT. It
needs a set of tree files representing a program to analyze
and the bind file for its <br>
main subprogram to be created in the current directory. For
the current version, it is a the user&rsquo;s responsibility
to maintain the consistency of the set of tree files
processed <br>
by gnatelim, if the user also changes the sources of the Ada
program to be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To produce a list of Eliminate
pragmas, gnatelim has to do an extensive analysis and it may
take some time. For example, to process itself, gnatelim
takes 4 minutes of CPU time <br>
on a Pentium 200.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-v verbose mode: gnatelim version information is printed (in
the form of Ada comments) in stdout; the names of the files
being processed are printed to standard-error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-vf Same as -v, but in addition
various debugging information and information reflecting
some details of the analysis done by gnatelim are printed to
standard-error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Process RTL components: by
default, gnatelim does not analyze the units which are the
components of the GNAT Run-Time Library (RTL), and it does
not generate Eliminate <br>
pragmas for subprograms declared in the RTL. If
&rsquo;-a&rsquo; option is set, RTL components are also
analyzed (except some units, which contains subprograms
implicitly called by <br>
the compiler).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Check missed units: if this
option is set, gnatelim checks that all the units which
(according to the bind file) has to be analyzed by gnatelim
are really represented by <br>
the set of tree files processed by gnatelim (depending on
whether or not &rsquo;-a&rsquo; option is set). By default
(that is, if &rsquo;-m&rsquo; option is not set), gnatelim
analyzes a set of <br>
units represented by a given set of tree files &quot;as
is&quot; (excluding library packages which require bodies,
but for which bodies are not available).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation about the ASIS
tools may be found in /usr/share/doc/asis-doc/ if the
asis-doc package is installed. The reference documentation
about ASIS is excluded due to <br>
license problems, but may be found in various formats at
http://libre.adacore.com/developers/documentation.</p>
