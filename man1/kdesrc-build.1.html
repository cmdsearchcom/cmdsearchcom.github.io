<p>KDESRC-BUILD(1) KDE User&rsquo;s Manual
KDESRC-BUILD(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kdesrc-build - Downloads, builds and installs KDE
software.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kdesrc-build [OPTIONS...] [Module name | Module set
name...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The kdesrc-build command is used in order to build KDE
software directly from its source repositories. It can
download from Subversion or Git repositories, interfaces
with the <br>
KDE project database, and supports controlling which options
are passed to make(1) and cmake(1). The operation of
kdesrc-build is driven by a configuration file, typically
<br>
~/.kdesrc-buildrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The module name or module set
name as given on the command line should be as those names
were defined in the configuration file (either in a module
definition or use-modules <br>
declaration, or in a module-set definition). In addition, it
can be the name of a KDE module listed in the KDE project
database (and you can precede the module name with + to <br>
force this).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdesrc-build is designed to be
able to be completely headless (however, see ENVIRONMENT),
and so typically ignores its input completely. Command
output is logged instead of being <br>
shown on the kdesrc-build output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules are built one after the
other. If a module fails to update then it is not built.
kdesrc-build will not abort just because of a module
failure, instead it will keep <br>
trying to update and build subsequent modules. By default,
kdesrc-build will commence building a module as soon as the
source code update is complete for that module, even if <br>
other updates are occurring concurrently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the end kdesrc-build will
show which modules failed to build, and where the logs were
kept for that build run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
NOTE: Some options have short forms, but the kdesrc-build
option parser does not support combining short options into
one at this point. (E.g. running kdesrc-build -pv would not
<br>
be the same as kdesrc-build --pretend --verbose).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Shows a brief synopsis and frequently-used command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pretend <br>
Operate in a &quot;dry run&quot; mode. No network accesses
are made, no log files are created, no modules are built,
and no other permanent changes to disk are made. One
important <br>
exception is that if you try to build a module that comes
from the KDE project database, and the database hasn&rsquo;t
been downloaded yet, the database will be downloaded since
<br>
the pretend-mode output may change significantly based on
the database results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--install <br>
Skips the update and build phase and immediately attempts to
install the modules given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--uninstall <br>
Skips the update and build phase and immediately attempts to
uninstall the modules given. NOTE: This is only supported
for buildsystems that supports the make uninstall <br>
command (e.g. KDE CMake-based).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-src <br>
Skips the source update phase. Other phases are included as
normal. --no-svn is a deprecated alias for this option and
will be removed in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-install <br>
Skips the install phase from the build. Other phases are
included as normal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-build <br>
Skips the build phase for the build. Internally the install
phase depends on the build phase completing so this is
effectively equivalent to --src-only, but the semantics may
<br>
change in the future (e.g. when test suites are moved into
their own phase).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-tests <br>
Disables running the test suite for CMake-based modules. To
be fully effective this requires re-running CMake, which can
be forced by using the --reconfigure or <br>
--refresh-build options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--src-only <br>
Only performs the source update phase, does not build or
install. --svn-only is a deprecated alias for this option
and will be removed in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-only <br>
Forces the build process to be performed without updating
source code first. In addition, installation is not
performed. (Testing is still performed if applicable, but
this <br>
will change in a future release)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--refresh-build <br>
Removes the build directory for a module before the build
phase starts. This has the desired side effect of forcing
kdesrc-build to re-configure the module and build it from
<br>
a &quot;pristine&quot; state with no existing temporary or
intermediate output files. Use this option if you have
problems getting a module to build but realize it will take
longer <br>
(possibly much longer) for the build to complete as a
result. When in doubt use this option for the entire
kdesrc-build run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--reconfigure <br>
Force CMake to be re-run, but without deleting the build
directory. Usually you actually want --refresh-build, but if
you are 100% sure your change to cmake-options will not <br>
invalidate your current intermediate output then this can
save some time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-system-only <br>
Interrupts the build process for each module built: The
build process consists of normal setup up to and including
running cmake or configure (as appropriate), but make is
<br>
not run and no installation is attempted. This is mostly
only useful to get things like configure --help and
cmake-gui to work. Normally you want --reconfigure or <br>
--refresh-build.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resume-from=foo <br>
Use this option to skip module processing until the module
foo is encountered. foo and all subsequent modules will be
processed normally as if they had been specified on the <br>
command line. If you use this option because of a build
failure you may want to consider using --no-src in addition
to skip the resultant source update phase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--resume-after=foo <br>
This is just like --resume-from, except that the module foo
is not included in the list of modules to consider. You
might use this if you&rsquo;ve manually built/installed foo
<br>
after fixing the build and just want to resume from
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-modules <br>
Forces ALL modules that follow this option to be excluded
from consideration by kdesrc-build. This might be useful if
you know you want to process all modules except for <br>
specific exceptions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--rc-file=foo <br>
Use the given file, foo, for the configuration instead of
~/.kdesrc-buildrc or ./kdesrc-buildrc. The file can be
empty, but must exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--prefix=foo <br>
Overrides the kdedir setting to be foo for this run. In
addition, implies --reconfigure. It does not actually
perform the action you would think it does (overriding the
<br>
prefix option to change where modules are installed),
although by default modules are installed to the kdedir
setting if prefix is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--nice=foo <br>
Changes the CPU priority given to kdesrc-build (and all
processes used by kdesrc-build e.g. make(1)). foo should be
an integer number between -20 and 19. Positive values <br>
are &quot;nicer&quot; to the rest of the system (i.e. lower
priority).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the possible
priorities available on your system may be different than
listed here, see nice(2) for more information. Note also
that this only changes CPU priority, <br>
often you want to change I/O priority on systems where that
is supported. There is no command-line option for I/O
priority adjustment, but there is a configuration file <br>
option: use-idle-io-priority (although like all options,
there is a generic way to set this from the command
line).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--run=foo <br>
Runs the program named by foo using kdesrc-build&rsquo;s
normal build environment. All command line arguments present
after this option are passed to foo as it is run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--color <br>
Enables &quot;colorful output&quot;. (Enabled by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-color <br>
Disables &quot;colorful output&quot;. This can be made
permanent by setting the colorful-output option to false (or
0) in your configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--async <br>
Have kdesrc-build start the build process for a module as
soon as the source code has finished downloading. Without
this option kdesrc-build performs all source updates at <br>
once and only then starts with the build process. This
option is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-async <br>
Disables asynchronous building of modules. See --async for a
more detailed description. Note that kdesrc-build&rsquo;s
output will be slightly different in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Increases the level of verbosity of kdesrc-build output
(which is already fairly verbose!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Makes kdesrc-build less noisy. Only important messages are
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--really-quiet <br>
Makes kdesrc-build even less noisy. Only warnings/errors are
shown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug <br>
This will fill your terminal with descriptions and debugging
output, usually unintelligible, describing what kdesrc-build
is doing (and thinks it should be doing). The flag <br>
is included since the output may sometimes prove useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force-build <br>
Normally when kdesrc-build notices that there is no source
update on a module which was previously successfully
installed, it does not attempt to build or install that <br>
module. You can pass this flag to disable that behavior and
always run make.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-snapshots <br>
Normally kdesrc-build supports using source repository
tarball snapshots to reduce load on KDE infrastructure for
git clones for some KDE modules. Passing this option <br>
disables this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--delete-my-patches <br>
This option must be passed to allow kdesrc-build to remove
conflicting source directories. Currently even this only
happens when trying to clone a git-based module if an <br>
existing source directory is present. Never specify this
option unless it is suggested by kdesrc-build, and only if
you don&rsquo;t mind the source directories that are
referenced <br>
being deleted and re-cloned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--foo=bar <br>
Any option not listed above is checked to see if it matches
the list of possible configuration file options. If so, the
configuration file option foo is temporarily set to <br>
bar for the duration of this run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--module,foo=bar <br>
Like above, but option foo is only set to bar for the module
module. This does not work for module sets yet, you must
repeat this for each module you want to be affected. (Of
<br>
course, you could simply edit your configuration
file...)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 <br>
Success</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1 <br>
Normally this means some part of the update, build or
install process failed, but is also used for any abnormal
program end not otherwise covered below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5 <br>
A signal was received that killed kdesrc-build, but it
attempted to perform normal closedown.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">8 <br>
Unknown option was passed on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">99 <br>
An exception was raised that forced kdesrc-build to abort
early.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME <br>
Used for tilde-expansion of file names, and is the default
base for the source, build, and installation
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PATH <br>
This environment variable controls the default search path
for executables. You can use the binpath configuration file
option to add to this variable (e.g. for running from <br>
cron(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LC_* <br>
Environment variables starting with LC_ control the locale
used by kdesrc-build. Although kdesrc-build is still not
localizable at this point, many of the commands it uses <br>
are. kdesrc-build normally sets LC_ALL=C for commands that
its must examine the output of but you can manually do this
as well. If setting LC_ALL=C fixes a kdesrc-build <br>
problem please submit a bug report.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SSH_AGENT_PID <br>
This environment variable is checked to see if ssh-agent(1)
is running, but only if kdesrc-build determines that you are
checking out a module that requires an SSH login (but <br>
you should know this as no module requires this by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KDESRC_BUILD_USE_TTY <br>
If set, this variable forces kdesrc-build not to close its
input while executing system processes. Normally
kdesrc-build closes stdin since the stdout and stderr for
its <br>
child processes are redirected and therefore the user would
never see an input prompt anyways.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KDESRC_BUILD_DUMP_CONTEXT <br>
If set, this variable prints out a description of its
&quot;build context&quot; just after reading options and
command line arguments and determining which modules to
build. You pretty <br>
much never want to set this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">others <br>
Many programs are used by kdesrc-build in the course of its
execution, including svn(1), git(1), make(1), and cmake(1).
Each of these programs may have their own response to <br>
environment variables being set. kdesrc-build will pass
environment variables that are set when it is run onto these
processes. You can ensure certain environment variables <br>
(e.g. CC or CXX) are set by using the set-env configuration
file option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.kdesrc-buildrc - Default global configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">./kdesrc-buildrc - If this file
(note there is no leading period (.) this time) is found in
the current directory when kdesrc-build is run, this file
will be used for the <br>
configuration instead of ~/.kdesrc-buildrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">~/.kdesrc-build-data -
kdesrc-build uses this file to store persistent data (such
as last CMake options used, last revision successfully
installed, etc.). It can be safely <br>
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
See http://bugs.kde.org/. Be sure to search against the
kdesrc-build product.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
$ kdesrc-build <br>
Downloads, builds and installs all modules listed in the
configuration file, in the order defined therein.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kdesrc-build --pretend <br>
Same as above, except no permanent actions are taken
(specifically no log files are created, downloads performed,
build processes run, etc.). EXCEPTION: If you are trying to
<br>
build a module defined in the KDE project database, and the
database has not been downloaded yet, kdesrc-build will
download the database since this can significantly affect
<br>
the final build order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kdesrc-build --no-src
--refresh-build kdebase <br>
Deletes the build directory for the kdebase module set
(--refresh-build) and then starts the build process again
without updating the source code in-between.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kdesrc-build --rc-file
/dev/null --pretend <br>
Forces kdesrc-build to read an empty configuration file and
simulate the resultant build process. This shows what would
happen by default with no configuration file, without <br>
an error message about a missing configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kdesrc-build
+kdebase/kde-baseapps <br>
Downloads, builds and installs the kde-baseapps module from
the KDE project database. Since the module name is preceded
by a + it is assumed to defined in the KDE project <br>
database even if this hasn&rsquo;t been specifically
configured in the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The kdebase/ portion forces
kdesrc-build to ignore any kde-baseapps modules that are not
children of the kdebase supermodule in the project database
(although it is contrived <br>
for this example).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ kdesrc-build --refresh-build
--cmake-options=&quot;-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug&quot; <br>
Downloads, builds and installs all modules defined in the
configuration file but overrides the cmake-options option to
have the value given on the command line for this run <br>
only. Any further kdesrc-build runs will use the
cmake-options given in the configuration file.</p>
