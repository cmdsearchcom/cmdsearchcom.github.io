kdesrc-build - Downloads, builds and installs KDE software.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<div class="Pp" style="margin-left: 13.00ex; text-indent: -13.00ex;"><b>kdesrc-build</b>
  [ <i>OPTIONS</i>...]
  [<i>Module&#x00A0;name&#x00A0;|&#x00A0;Module&#x00A0;set&#x00A0;name</i>...]</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>kdesrc-build</b> command is used in order to build KDE software directly
  from its source repositories. It can download from Subversion or Git
  repositories, interfaces with the KDE project database, and supports
  controlling which options are passed to <b>make</b>(1) and <b>cmake</b>(1).
  The operation of <b>kdesrc-build</b> is driven by a configuration file,
  typically ~/.kdesrc-buildrc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>module name</i> or <i>module set name</i> as given on the command line
  should be as those names were defined in the configuration file (either in a
  module definition or <b>use-modules</b> declaration, or in a <b>module-set</b>
  definition). In addition, it can be the name of a KDE module listed in the KDE
  project database (and you can precede the module name with + to force this).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>kdesrc-build</b> is designed to be able to be completely headless (however,
  see <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>), and so typically ignores its input completely.
  Command output is logged instead of being shown on the kdesrc-build output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Modules are built one after the other. If a module fails to update then it is
  not built. <b>kdesrc-build</b> will not abort just because of a module
  failure, instead it will keep trying to update and build subsequent modules.
  By default, <b>kdesrc-build</b> will commence building a module as soon as the
  source code update is complete for that module, even if other updates are
  occurring concurrently.
<div class="Pp"></div>
At the end <b>kdesrc-build</b> will show which modules failed to build, and
  where the logs were kept for that build run.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<b>NOTE</b>: Some options have short forms, but the <b>kdesrc-build</b> option
  parser does not support combining short options into one at this point. (E.g.
  running <b>kdesrc-build -pv</b> would not be the same as <b>kdesrc-build
  --pretend --verbose</b>).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-h, --help</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Shows a brief synopsis and frequently-used
  command line options.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-p, --pretend</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Operate in a &quot;dry run&quot; mode. No
  network accesses are made, no log files are created, no modules are built, and
  no other permanent changes to disk are made. One <i>important exception</i> is
  that if you try to build a module that comes from the KDE project database,
  and the database hasn't been downloaded yet, the database will be downloaded
  since the pretend-mode output may change significantly based on the database
  results.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--install</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Skips the update and build phase and
  immediately attempts to install the modules given.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--uninstall</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Skips the update and build phase and
  immediately attempts to uninstall the modules given. <b>NOTE</b>: This is only
  supported for buildsystems that supports the <b>make uninstall</b> command
  (e.g. KDE CMake-based).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-src</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Skips the source update phase. Other phases
  are included as normal. <b>--no-svn</b> is a deprecated alias for this option
  and will be removed in a future release.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-install</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Skips the install phase from the build. Other
  phases are included as normal.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-build</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Skips the build phase for the build.
  Internally the install phase depends on the build phase completing so this is
  effectively equivalent to <b>--src-only</b>, but the semantics may change in
  the future (e.g. when test suites are moved into their own phase).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-tests</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Disables running the test suite for
  CMake-based modules. To be fully effective this requires re-running CMake,
  which can be forced by using the <b>--reconfigure</b> or
  <b>--refresh-build</b> options.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--src-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Only performs the source update phase, does
  not build or install. <b>--svn-only</b> is a deprecated alias for this option
  and will be removed in a future release.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--build-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Forces the build process to be performed
  without updating source code first. In addition, installation is not
  performed. (Testing is still performed if applicable, but this will change in
  a future release)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--refresh-build</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Removes the build directory for a module
  before the build phase starts. This has the desired side effect of forcing
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> to re-configure the module and build it from a
  &quot;pristine&quot; state with no existing temporary or intermediate output
  files. Use this option if you have problems getting a module to build but
  realize it will take longer (possibly much longer) for the build to complete
  as a result. When in doubt use this option for the entire <b>kdesrc-build</b>
  run.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--reconfigure</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Force CMake to be re-run, but without deleting
  the build directory. Usually you actually want <b>--refresh-build</b>, but if
  you are 100% sure your change to <b>cmake-options</b> will not invalidate your
  current intermediate output then this can save some time.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--build-system-only</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Interrupts the build process for each module
  built: The build process consists of normal setup up to and including running
  <b>cmake</b> or <b>configure</b> (as appropriate), but <b>make</b> is not run
  and no installation is attempted. This is mostly only useful to get things
  like <b>configure --help</b> and <b>cmake-gui</b> to work. Normally you want
  <b>--reconfigure</b> or <b>--refresh-build</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--resume-from=</b><b></b><i>foo</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use this option to skip module processing
  until the module <i>foo</i> is encountered. <i>foo</i> and all subsequent
  modules will be processed normally as if they had been specified on the
  command line. If you use this option because of a build failure you may want
  to consider using <b>--no-src</b> in addition to skip the resultant source
  update phase.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--resume-after=</b><b></b><i>foo</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This is just like <b>--resume-from</b>, except
  that the module <i>foo</i> is <i>not</i> included in the list of modules to
  consider. You might use this if you've manually built/installed foo after
  fixing the build and just want to resume from there.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--ignore-modules</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Forces <b>ALL</b> modules that follow this
  option to be excluded from consideration by <b>kdesrc-build</b>. This might be
  useful if you know you want to process all modules except for specific
  exceptions.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--rc-file=</b><b></b><i>foo</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Use the given file, <i>foo</i>, for the
  configuration instead of ~/.kdesrc-buildrc or ./kdesrc-buildrc. The file can
  be empty, but must exist.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--prefix=</b><b></b><i>foo</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Overrides the <b>kdedir</b> setting to be
  <i>foo</i> for this run. In addition, implies <b>--reconfigure</b>. It <i>does
  not</i> actually perform the action you would think it does (overriding the
  <b>prefix</b> option to change where modules are installed), although by
  default modules are installed to the <b>kdedir</b> setting if <b>prefix</b> is
  not set.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--nice=</b><b></b><i>foo</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Changes the CPU priority given to
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> (and all processes used by <b>kdesrc-build</b> e.g.
  <b>make</b>(1)). <i>foo</i> should be an integer number between -20 and 19.
  Positive values are &quot;nicer&quot; to the rest of the system (i.e. lower
  priority).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that the possible priorities available on your system may be different than
  listed here, see <b>nice</b>(2) for more information. Note also that this only
  changes <i>CPU</i> priority, often you want to change <i>I/O</i> priority on
  systems where that is supported. There is no command-line option for I/O
  priority adjustment, but there is a configuration file option:
  <b>use-idle-io-priority</b> (although like all options, there is a generic way
  to set this from the command line).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--run=</b><b></b><i>foo</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Runs the program named by <i>foo</i> using
  <b>kdesrc-build</b>'s normal build environment. All command line arguments
  present after this option are passed to <i>foo</i> as it is run.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--color</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Enables &quot;colorful output&quot;. (Enabled
  by default).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-color</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Disables &quot;colorful output&quot;. This can
  be made permanent by setting the <b>colorful-output</b> option to false (or 0)
  in your configuration file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--async</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Have <b>kdesrc-build</b> start the build
  process for a module as soon as the source code has finished downloading.
  Without this option <b>kdesrc-build</b> performs all source updates at once
  and only then starts with the build process. This option is enabled by
  default.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-async</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Disables asynchronous building of modules. See
  <b>--async</b> for a more detailed description. Note that
  <b>kdesrc-build</b>'s output will be slightly different in this mode.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-v, --verbose</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Increases the level of verbosity of
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> output (which is already fairly verbose!)</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>-q, --quiet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Makes <b>kdesrc-build</b> less noisy. Only
  important messages are shown.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--really-quiet</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Makes <b>kdesrc-build</b> even less noisy.
  Only warnings/errors are shown.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--debug</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This will fill your terminal with descriptions
  and debugging output, usually unintelligible, describing what
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> is doing (and thinks it should be doing). The flag is
  included since the output may sometimes prove useful for debugging.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--force-build</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally when <b>kdesrc-build</b> notices that
  there is no source update on a module which was previously successfully
  installed, it does not attempt to build or install that module. You can pass
  this flag to disable that behavior and always run <b>make</b>.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--no-snapshots</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally <b>kdesrc-build</b> supports using
  source repository tarball snapshots to reduce load on KDE infrastructure for
  git clones for some KDE modules. Passing this option disables this
  feature.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--delete-my-patches</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This option must be passed to allow
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> to remove conflicting source directories. Currently even
  this only happens when trying to clone a git-based module if an existing
  source directory is present. Never specify this option unless it is suggested
  by <b>kdesrc-build</b>, and only if you don't mind the source directories that
  are referenced being deleted and re-cloned.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--</b><b></b><i>foo</i><b>=</b><b></b><i>bar</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Any option not listed above is checked to see
  if it matches the list of possible configuration file options. If so, the
  configuration file option <b>foo</b> is temporarily set to <b>bar</b> for the
  duration of this run.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>--</b><b></b><i>module</i><b>,</b><b></b><i>foo</i><b>=</b><b></b><i>bar</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Like above, but option <b>foo</b> is only set
  to <b>bar</b> for the module <b>module</b>. This does not work for module sets
  yet, you must repeat this for each module you want to be affected. (Of course,
  you could simply edit your configuration file...)</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
<b>0</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Success</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>1</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Normally this means some part of the update,
  build or install process failed, but is also used for any abnormal program end
  not otherwise covered below.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>5</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">A signal was received that killed
  <b>kdesrc-build</b>, but it attempted to perform normal closedown.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>8</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Unknown option was passed on the command
  line.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>99</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">An exception was raised that forced
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> to abort early.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="selflink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<b>HOME</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Used for tilde-expansion of file names, and is
  the default base for the source, build, and installation directories.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>PATH</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This environment variable controls the default
  search path for executables. You can use the <b>binpath</b> configuration file
  option to add to this variable (e.g. for running from <b>cron</b>(8)).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>LC_</b>*
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Environment variables starting with LC_
  control the locale used by <b>kdesrc-build</b>. Although <b>kdesrc-build</b>
  is still not localizable at this point, many of the commands it uses are.
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> normally sets <b>LC_ALL</b>=C for commands that its must
  examine the output of but you can manually do this as well. If setting
  <b>LC_ALL</b>=C fixes a <b>kdesrc-build</b> problem please submit a bug
  report.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>SSH_AGENT_PID</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">This environment variable is checked to see if
  <b>ssh-agent</b>(1) is running, but only if <b>kdesrc-build</b> determines
  that you are checking out a module that requires an SSH login (but you should
  know this as no module requires this by default).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>KDESRC_BUILD_USE_TTY</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If set, this variable forces
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> not to close its input while executing system processes.
  Normally <b>kdesrc-build</b> closes stdin since the stdout and stderr for its
  child processes are redirected and therefore the user would never see an input
  prompt anyways.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>KDESRC_BUILD_DUMP_CONTEXT</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">If set, this variable prints out a description
  of its &quot;build context&quot; just after reading options and command line
  arguments and determining which modules to build. You pretty much never want
  to set this.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
others
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Many programs are used by <b>kdesrc-build</b>
  in the course of its execution, including <b>svn</b>(1), <b>git</b>(1),
  <b>make</b>(1), and <b>cmake</b>(1). Each of these programs may have their own
  response to environment variables being set. <b>kdesrc-build</b> will pass
  environment variables that are set when it is run onto these processes. You
  can ensure certain environment variables (e.g. <b>CC</b> or <b>CXX</b>) are
  set by using the <b>set-env</b> configuration file option.</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
~/.kdesrc-buildrc - Default global configuration file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
./kdesrc-buildrc - If this file (note there is no leading period (.) this time)
  is found in the <b>current directory</b> when kdesrc-build is run, this file
  will be used for the configuration instead of ~/.kdesrc-buildrc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
~/.kdesrc-build-data - <b>kdesrc-build</b> uses this file to store persistent
  data (such as last CMake options used, last revision successfully installed,
  etc.). It can be safely deleted.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
See <b>http://bugs.kde.org/</b>. Be sure to search against the
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> product.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="selflink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
$ <b></b><b>kdesrc-build</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Downloads, builds and installs all modules
  listed in the configuration file, in the order defined therein.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ <b></b><b>kdesrc-build</b><b> </b><b></b><b>--pretend</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Same as above, except no permanent actions are
  taken (specifically no log files are created, downloads performed, build
  processes run, etc.). <b>EXCEPTION</b>: If you are trying to build a module
  defined in the KDE project database, and the database has not been downloaded
  yet, <b>kdesrc-build</b> will download the database since this can
  significantly affect the final build order.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ <b></b><b>kdesrc-build</b><b> </b><b></b><b>--no-src</b><b>
  </b><b></b><b>--refresh-build</b> <b> </b><b>kdebase</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Deletes the build directory for the
  <i>kdebase</i> module set ( <b>--refresh-build</b>) and then starts the build
  process again without updating the source code in-between.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ <b></b><b>kdesrc-build</b><b> </b><b></b><b>--rc-file</b><b>
  </b><b>/dev/null</b> <b> </b><b></b><b>--pretend</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Forces <b>kdesrc-build</b> to read an empty
  configuration file and simulate the resultant build process. This shows what
  would happen by default with no configuration file, without an error message
  about a missing configuration file.</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ <b></b><b>kdesrc-build</b><b> </b><b>+kdebase/kde-baseapps</b>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Downloads, builds and installs the
  kde-baseapps module from the KDE project database. Since the module name is
  preceded by a + it is assumed to defined in the KDE project database even if
  this hasn't been specifically configured in the configuration file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The kdebase/ portion forces <b>kdesrc-build</b> to ignore any kde-baseapps
  modules that are not children of the kdebase supermodule in the project
  database (although it is contrived for this example).</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
$ <b></b><b>kdesrc-build</b><b> </b><b></b><b>--refresh-build</b><b>
  </b><b></b><b>--cmake-options=</b><b></b><i>&quot;-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug&quot;</i>
<div style="margin-left: 4.00ex;">Downloads, builds and installs all modules
  defined in the configuration file but overrides the cmake-options option to
  have the value given on the command line for this run only. Any further
  <b>kdesrc-build</b> runs will use the cmake-options given in the configuration
  file.</div>
