<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
adt-run - test an installed binary package using the source
package&rsquo;s tests</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
adt-run options... --- virt-server [virt-server-arg...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
adt-run is the program for invoking the autopkgtest package
testing machinery.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">autopkgtest is a facility for
testing binary Debian or Click packages, as installed on a
system (such as a testbed system). The tests are those
supplied in the source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adt-run runs each test supplied
by a particular package and reports the results. It drives
the specified virtualisation regime as appropriate, and
parses the test description <br>
metadata, and arranges for data to be copied to and from the
testbed as required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
/usr/share/doc/autopkgtest/README.running-tests.rst.gz for
an introduction about how to use adt-run.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SPECIFYING TESTS <br>
Actions specify the source and binary packages to test, or
change what happens with package arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--source dsc <br>
Run tests from Debian source package dsc. By default the
package will also be built and the resulting binaries will
be used to satisfy test dependencies; to disable that, <br>
specify the -B/--no-built-binaries option before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ordering is significant:
each --source option should precede options whose
dependencies are to be satisfied by the binaries it
produces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--unbuilt-tree directory <br>
Specifies that tests from the unbuilt Debian source tree
directory should be run. This is very similar to specifying
--source except that a directory tree (which should <br>
be pristine) is supplied, instead of a source package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--built-tree directory <br>
Specifies that tests from the built Debian source tree
directory should be run. Note that all test dependencies are
then satisfied by archive packages, unless you explic&acirc;
<br>
itly specify locally built .debs with --binary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-source srcpkgname <br>
Downloads srcpkgname with apt-get source in the testbed and
run its tests. This is similar to specifying --source but
avoids copying the source from the host to the test&acirc;
<br>
bed. Possibly built binaries will not be used to satisfy
dependencies, as usually in this mode you want to test
binaries from a real archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--git-source URL [branchname]
<br>
Specifies that tests from the unbuilt Debian source tree
from git-cloning URL should be run. If branchname is given,
this branch will be checked out instead of the default <br>
(usually &quot;master&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is very similar to
specifying --unbuilt-tree after cloning, i. e. this is
commonly used with --no-built-binaries. The git package will
be installed if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binary deb <br>
Specifies that deb should be used for tests of all following
source packages. By default it will be used to satisfy
dependencies, both during building and testing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The ordering is significant, as
for --source. In particular, if a subsequent source package
will build a binary of the same name, that will be used from
then on, and deb <br>
will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--changes changes <br>
Specifies that the debs in the given .changes should be used
for tests of the source package in that .changes. Acts as if
you had specified the .debs and .dsc from a <br>
.changes file as explicit arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--click-source clicksrc <br>
Path to click source tree for subsequent --click
package.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--click clickpkg <br>
If clickpkg is a file (*.click), install given click package
into testbed. If it is a click name (like
&quot;com.example.myapp&quot;), assume it is already
installed in the testbed <br>
and read the manifest from it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run click package tests from the
preceding --click-source. If a click source directory is not
specified explicitly, it will be downloaded according to the
manifest&rsquo;s x- <br>
source entry. Currently the only supported schema is
vcs-bzr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">filename <br>
Bare filename arguments are processed as if --built-tree,
--source, --unbuilt-tree, --apt-source, --binary, --changes,
--click-source, or --click was specified; the nature <br>
of the argument is guessed from the form of the filename. In
the case of --built-tree, either the option must be
specified, or the filename must end in a slash; two <br>
slashes at the end are taken to mean --unbuilt-tree. If a
given directory has a &quot;click&quot; subdirectory, it is
interpreted as --click-source.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST OPTIONS <br>
Unless stated otherwise, these affect all subsequent test
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-B | --no-built-binaries <br>
All built binaries from subsequent --source or
--unbuilt-tree tests will not be built or ignored, and
dependencies are satisfied with packages from the archive.
Note that <br>
packages still get built if a test requires
build-needed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--built-binaries <br>
Subsequent --source or --unbuilt-tree tests will get built
and their dependencies be satisfied with the built binaries.
This is the default behaviour, so you only need <br>
this to revert a previously specified --no-built-binaries
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override-control=PATH <br>
Read the test metadata from PATH instead of
debian/tests/control (for Debian sources) or the Click
manifest for the following test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--testname=TEST <br>
Run only the given test name (from test control file) in the
following test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING OPTIONS <br>
If you don&rsquo;t specify any option, adt-run only writes
its output/results to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o dir | --output-dir=dir <br>
Specifies that test artifacts (stderr and stdout from the
tests, the log file, built binary packages etc.) should be
placed in the given directory. dir must not exist yet <br>
or be empty, otherwise adt-run will refuse to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l logfile | --log-file=logfile
<br>
Specifies that the trace log should be written to logfile
instead of to output-dir.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--summary=summary <br>
Specifies that a summary of the outcome should be written to
summary. The events in the summary are written to the log in
any case.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q | --quiet <br>
Do not send a copy of adt-run&rsquo;s trace logstream to
stderr. This option does not affect the copy sent to logfile
or output-dir. Note that without the trace logstream it <br>
can be very hard to diagnose problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST BED SETUP OPTIONS <br>
--setup-commands=commands <br>
Run commands after opening the testbed. This can be used e.
g. to enable additional apt sources, run apt-get update or
similar. If commands is an existing file name, the <br>
commands are read from that; otherwise it is a string with
the actual commands that gets run as-is. File names without
directory will be searched in both the current <br>
directory and in /usr/share/autopkgtest/setup-commands/ so
you do not need to give the full path for setup scripts
shipped with autopkgtest.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option can be specified
multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If --user is given or the test
bed provides a suggested-normal-user capability, the
$AUTOPKGTEST_NORMAL_USER environment variable will be set to
that user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the setup commands affect
anything in boot directories (like /boot or
/lib/systemd/system) and the testbed supports rebooting, the
testbed will be rebooted after the <br>
setup commands. This can be suppressed by creating a file
/run/autopkgtest_no_reboot.stamp.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-upgrade | -U <br>
Run apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade -y in the
testbed before running the tests.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--apt-pocket=pocket[=pkgname,src:srcname,...]
<br>
Add apt sources for release-pocket. This finds the first deb
line in /etc/apt/sources.list which does not already specify
a pocket and adds a deb and deb-src line with <br>
that pocket to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pocket.list. This
also calls apt-get update for the new pocket (but not for
anything else).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a package list is given after
=, set up apt pinning to use only those packages from
pocket. An entry &quot;src:srcname&quot; expands to all
binary packages built by that source. <br>
This can be used for minimizing dependencies taken from
pocket so that package updates in that pocket can be tested
independently from each other for better isolation. <br>
Attention: This does not currently resolve some situations
where dependencies of the given packages can only be
resolved in the given pocket. In that case the apt pinning
<br>
will be removed and package installation will be retried
with the entirety of pocket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--copy=HOSTPATH:TESTBEDPATH <br>
Copy file or directory from host into testbed after opening.
This happens before --setup-commands thus you can use these
files in the setup commands.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--env=VAR=value <br>
Set arbitrary environment variable in the build and test.
Can be specified multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USER/PRIVILEGE HANDLING OPTIONS
<br>
-u user | --user=user <br>
Run builds and tests as user on the testbed. This needs root
on the testbed; if root on the testbed is not available then
builds and tests run as whatever user is pro&acirc; <br>
vided.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gain-root=gain-root <br>
Prefixes debian/rules binary with gain-root. The default is
not to use anything, except that if --user is supplied or
root on the testbed is not available the default is <br>
fakeroot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEBUGGING OPTIONS <br>
--debug|-d <br>
Include additional debugging information in the trace log.
Each additional -d increases the debugging level; the
current maximum is -ddd. If you like to see what&rsquo;s
going <br>
on, -d or -dd is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell-fail|-s <br>
Run an interactive shell in the testbed after a failed
build, test, or dependency installation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shell <br>
Run an interactive shell in the testbed after every
test.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIMEOUT OPTIONS <br>
--timeout-which=seconds <br>
Use a different timeout for operations on or with the
testbed. There are five timeouts affected by five values of
which: short: supposedly short operations like setting <br>
up the testbed&rsquo;s apt and checking the state (default:
100s); install: installation of packages including
dependencies (default: 3,000s); test: test runs (default:
<br>
10,000s); copy: copy files/directories between host and
testbed (default: 300s); and build: builds (default:
100,000s). The value must be specified as an integer number
<br>
of seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--timeout-factor=double <br>
Multiply all of the default timeouts by the specified factor
(see --timeout-which above). Only the defaults are affected;
explicit timeout settings are used exactly as <br>
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOCALE OPTIONS <br>
--set-lang=langval <br>
When running commands on the testbed, sets the LANG
environment variable to langval. The default in adt-run is
to set it to C.UTF-8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER OPTIONS <br>
--no-auto-control <br>
Disable automatic test generation with autodep8, even if it
is installed. In that case, packages without tests will exit
with code 8 (&quot;No tests in this package&quot;) just like
<br>
without autodep8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--build-parallelN <br>
Set parallel=N DEB_BUILD_OPTION for building packages. By
default this is the number of available processors. This is
mostly useful in containers where you can restrict <br>
the available RAM, but not restrict the number of CPUs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h|--help <br>
Show command line help and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VIRTUALIZATION SERVER <br>
--- virt-server virt-server-arg... <br>
Specifies the virtualisation regime server, as a command and
arguments to invoke. virt-server must be an existing
autopkgtest virtualization server such as schroot or <br>
qemu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All the remaining arguments and
options after --- are passed to the virtualisation server
program. See the manpages of the individual servers for how
to use them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT FORMAT <br>
During a normal test run, one line is printed for each test.
This consists of a short string identifying the test, some
horizontal whitespace, and either PASS or FAIL reason or
<br>
SKIP reason where the pass/fail indication is separated by
any reason by some horizontal whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string to identify the test
consists of a short alphanumeric string invented by adt-run
to distinguish different command-line arguments, the argid,
followed by a hyphen and <br>
the test name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sometimes a SKIP will be
reported when the name of the test is not known or not
applicable: for example, when there are no tests in the
package, or a there is a test stanza which <br>
contains features not understood by this version of adt-run.
In this case * will appear where the name of the test should
be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If adt-run detects that
erroneous package(s) are involved, it will print the two
lines blame: blamed-thing... and badpkg: message. Here each
whitespace-separated blamed-thing <br>
is one of arg:argument (representing a pathname found in a
command line argument), dsc:package (a source package name),
deb:package (a binary package name) or possibly other <br>
strings to be determined. This indicates which arguments
and/or packages might have contributed to the problem; the
ones which were processed most recently and which are
there&acirc; <br>
fore most likely to be the cause of a problem are listed
last.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILES <br>
If you use lots of options or nontrivial virt server
arguments, you can put any part of the command line into a
text file, with one line per option. E. g. you can create a
file <br>
sid.cfg with contents like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s <br>
--output-dir=/tmp/testout <br>
--apt-upgrade <br>
--- <br>
schroot <br>
sid</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then run</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">adt-run foo_1_amd64.changes
@sid.cfg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The contents of the
configuration file will be expanded in-place as if you would
have given its contents on the command line. Please ensure
that you don&rsquo;t place spaces between <br>
short options and their values, they would become a part of
the argument value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
0 all tests passed <br>
2 at least one test skipped <br>
4 at least one test failed <br>
6 at least one test failed and at least one test skipped
<br>
8 no tests in this package <br>
12 erroneous package <br>
16 testbed failure <br>
20 other unexpected failures including bad usage</p>
