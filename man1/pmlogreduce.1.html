<p>PMLOGREDUCE(1) General Commands Manual
PMLOGREDUCE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogreduce - temporal reduction of Performance Co-Pilot
archives</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogreduce [-z] [-A align] [-S starttime]
[-s samples] [-T endtime] [-t interval] [-v volsamples] [-Z
timezone] input output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmlogreduce reads one set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
archives identified by input and creates a temporally
reduced PCP archive in output. input is a comma-separated
list of <br>
names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
the name of a directory containing one or more archives. The
data reduction involves statistical and temporal
reduc&acirc; <br>
tion of samples with an output sampling interval defined by
the -t option in the output archive (independent of the
sampling intervals in the input archives), and is further
con&acirc; <br>
trolled by other command line arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For some metrics, temporal data
reduction is not going to be helpful, so for metrics with
types PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE or PM_TYPE_EVENT, a warning is
issued if these metrics are found <br>
in input and they will be skipped and not appear in the
output archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE OPTIONS <br>
The command line options for pmlogreduce are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A align <br>
Specify a &lsquo;&lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rsquo; alignment of
the output sample times; refer to PCPIntro(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S starttime <br>
Define the start of a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved from the input archives; refer to PCPIntro(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s samples <br>
The argument samples defines the number of samples to be
written to output. If samples is 0 or -s is not specified,
pmlogreduce will sample until the end of the set of <br>
PCP archives, or the end of the time window as specified by
-T, whichever comes first. The -s option will override the
-T option if it occurs sooner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T endtime <br>
Define the termination of a time window to restrict the
samples retrieved from the input archives; refer to
PCPIntro(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v volsamples <br>
The output archive is potentially a multi-volume data set,
and the -v option causes pmlogreduce to start a new volume
after volsamples log records have been written to the <br>
output archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Independent of any -v option,
each volume of an archive is limited to no more than 2^31
bytes, so pmlogreduce will automatically create a new volume
for the archive before <br>
this limit is reached.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t interval <br>
Consecutive samples in the output archive will appear with a
time delta defined by interval; refer to PCPIntro(1). Note
the default value is 600 (seconds, i.e. 10 min&acirc; <br>
utes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Z timezone <br>
Use timezone when displaying the date and time, or
interpreting the -S and -T options. Timezone is in the
format of the environment variable TZ as described in
envi&acirc; <br>
ron(7).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Use the local timezone of the
host from the input archives when displaying the date and
time, or interpreting the -S and -T options. The default is
to initially use the <br>
timezone of the local host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATA REDUCTION <br>
The statistical and temporal reduction follows the following
rules:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Consecutive records from
input are read without interpolation, and at most one output
record is written for each interval, summarizing the
performance data over that period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. If the semantics of a metric
indicates it is instantaneous or discrete then output value
is computed as the arithmetic mean of the observations (if
any) over each interval.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If the semantics of a metric
indicates it is a counter then the following transformations
are applied: <br>
a) Metrics with 32-bit precision are promoted to 64-bit
precision. <br>
b) Any counter wrap (overflow) is noted, and appropriate
adjustment made in the value of the metric over each
interval. This will be correct in the case of a single
counter <br>
wrap, but will silently underestimate in the case where more
than one counter wrap occurs between consecutive
observations in the input archives, and silently
overesti&acirc; <br>
mate in the case where a counter is reset occurs between
consecutive observations in the input archives;
unfortunately these situations cannot be detected, but are
<br>
believed to be rare events for the sort of production
monitoring environments where pmlogreduce is most likely to
be deployed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. Any changes in instance
domains, and indeed all metadata, is preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. Any
&lsquo;&lsquo;mark&rsquo;&rsquo; records in the input
archives (as created by pmlogextract(1)) will be preserved
in the output archive, so periods where no data is available
are maintained, and <br>
data interpolation will not occur across these periods when
the output archive is subsequently processed with PCP
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
For each of the input and output archives, several physical
files are used. <br>
archive.meta <br>
metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
the archive log <br>
archive.0 initial volume of metrics values (subsequent
volumes have suffixes 1, 2, ...) - for input these files may
have been previously compressed with bzip2(1) or gzip(1) and
<br>
thus may have an additional .bz2 or .gz suffix. <br>
archive.index <br>
temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
files in the archive log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEE ALSO <br>
PCPIntro(1), pmdumplog(1), pmlc(1), pmlogextract(1),
pmlogger(1), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIAGNOSTICS <br>
All error conditions detected by pmlogreduce are reported on
stderr with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Should the input archives be
corrupted (this can happen if the pmlogger instance writing
the archive suddenly dies), then pmlogreduce will detect and
report the position of the <br>
corruption in the file, and any subsequent information from
the input archives will not be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If any error is detected,
pmlogreduce will exit with a non-zero status.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
The preamble metrics (pmcd.pmlogger.archive,
pmcd.pmlogger.host, and pmcd.pmlogger.port), which are
automatically recorded by pmlogger at the start of the
archive, may not be <br>
present in the archive output by pmlogreduce. These metrics
are only relevant while the archive is being created, and
have no significance once recording has finished.</p>
