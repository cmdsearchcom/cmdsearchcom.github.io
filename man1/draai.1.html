<p>draai(1) USER COMMANDS draai(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
draai - manage playlists and play audio files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
draai [option [option ...]] command [track [track ...] |
tracknumber [tracknumber ...]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Draai is a wrapper around mpc, making playing music from the
commandline more enjoyable. mpc is a client for MPD, the
Music Player Daemon. Using draai, one can play an audiofile
<br>
(ogg, mp3, flac, whatever your MPD offers), play all files
in a predefined playlist, view details on current, past and
future playing songs, skip to the next song, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GETTING STARTED <br>
Run &quot;draai init&quot; to get started using draai the
way the author likes it. Then, open another terminal window
and run e.g. $ draai listall | dr_permutate | draai add;
draai play to <br>
build a current playlist and start playing it. Other ways of
using draai are possible, see below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMANDS <br>
draai <br>
Play music: the files given as args and playlists passed via
--playlist. <br>
watch <br>
Run watch(1) on &quot;draai peek&quot;. <br>
init <br>
Start a bunch of X terminals setting up some draai jobs:
tail, logtail, watch, syslog, ... <br>
guestlist <br>
Reschedule listed tracknumbers as upcoming tracks. Last
arguments should be the positions of tracks to be put on the
guestlist, not filenames. <br>
unguestlist <br>
Reschedule listed tracknumbers to end of playlist. <br>
insert <br>
Add file(s) (given either as args or on stdin) to playlist
and schedule it as upcoming track. You probably want to have
&rsquo;draai insert&rsquo; read from a pipe fed by
&rsquo;draai search&rsquo;. <br>
move <br>
Move tracknumber to tracknumber given as last argument. <br>
zap <br>
Move tracknumber to position one and immediately start
playing it. Typically used to deal with radiostations in
playlist. <br>
search <br>
Search for substrings in all song tag types (artist, title,
comment, filename, ...). Similar to &rsquo;mpc search any
&lt;query&gt;&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll typically want to pipe
this commands output to <br>
e.g. &rsquo;draai insert&rsquo;. <br>
tail <br>
Print information about track when it starts playing,
similar to tail -f on a logfile. <br>
logtail <br>
Run tail(1) on system log file. <br>
list <br>
List current playlist. <br>
peek <br>
Show status of current song, and show upcoming $peek FIXME
tracks. <br>
play <br>
Play music. <br>
syslog <br>
Send raw information from tail to syslog. You likely want to
run &quot;draai syslog&quot; in the background. <br>
skip <br>
Skip this track, start playing the next one now. <br>
osjittisstil <br>
Run this if unwanted silence pops up during a playing
session (for now, it runs draai --sloppy skip). <br>
delete <br>
Delete track(s) from current playlist. Last arguments should
be _positions_ of tracks to be removed, not filename. If no
position is given, deletes upcoming track from playlist.
<br>
fastforward <br>
Seek forward in current track. <br>
crescendo <br>
Play louder. <br>
diminuendo <br>
Play softer. <br>
shuffle <br>
Shuffle the playlist. By default, this task is delegated to
dr_unsort(1). However, if draai runs in &quot;sloppy&quot;
or in &quot;native shuffle&quot; mode, then mpc native
shuffling is done (by <br>
calling &quot;mpc shuffle&quot;). Draai runs in
&quot;sloppy&quot; mode when the DR_SLOPPY environment
variable is set, or when the --sloppy option is passed.
Draai runs in &quot;native shuffle&quot; mode <br>
when the DR_SHUFFLE_NATIVE environment variable is set. <br>
listall <br>
List all files as served by music database. <br>
add <br>
Add file(s) (given either as args or on stdin) to playlist.
You probably want to have &rsquo;draai add&rsquo; read from
a pipe fed by e.g. &rsquo;draai listall&rsquo; or
&rsquo;draai search&rsquo;. <br>
quit <br>
quit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--debug (debug), -d <br>
Be very verbose. <br>
--playlist (with playlistfile), -p <br>
Playlist file; option can be supplied more than once. To be
used with command &quot;draai&quot;. <br>
--noshuffle (no shuffle), {-S} <br>
Do not shuffle tracks and leave random mode untouched
(default is: do shuffle and disable random mode). See also
the script dr_unsort. <br>
--raw (raw), -r <br>
Print raw stuff, suitable for postprocessing (if combined
with tail, peek or list). <br>
--sloppy (sloppy), -s <br>
Do not try hard to make everything sound smooth. If combined
with skip: risk a squeak on old hardware. <br>
--time (with timespec), -t <br>
If combined with commands quit or draai: time at which to
quit or start.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Schedule all tracks containing the string &rsquo;delia
gone&rsquo; in title, artist, comment or any other tag for
playing, after current song has finished: draai search
&rsquo;delia gone&rsquo; | draai <br>
insert.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
Run grep DR_ &lsquo;which draai&lsquo; to find out about
environment variables honored by draai. It honors: booleans:
DR_DEBUG and DR_SHUFFLE, DR_TIMESTAMP, DR_RAW and DR_SLOPPY
; strings: <br>
DR_WATCH ; integers: DR_CROSSFADE, DR_PEEK and DR_SEEK as
well as DR_FADEOUT_STEP, DR_FADEOUT_REPEAT, and
DR_FADEOUT_SLEEP and DR_VOLUME_STEP ; and some more strings:
DR_SYS&acirc; <br>
LOG_FILE, DR_SYSLOG_FACILITY and DR_SYSLOG_LEVEL . For now,
see the draai code for what it all means.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES, CONFIGURATION <br>
All configuration variables (see ENVIRONMENT) can be set in
~/.draai/rc. This rc-file is sourced as a shell script. If
you&rsquo;d like to set the syslog facility, set
syslog_facility <br>
(overruled by DR_SYSLOG_FACILITY). If you&rsquo;d like to
set the watch programma, set watch (overruled by
DR_WATCH).</p>
