<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
kube-controller-manager - Enforces kubernetes services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
kube-controller-manager [OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The Kubernetes controller manager is a daemon that embeds
the core control loops shipped with Kubernetes. In
applications of robotics and automation, a control loop is a
non-ter&acirc; <br>
minating loop that regulates the state of the system. In
Kubernetes, a controller is a control loop that watches the
shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes
<br>
changes attempting to move the current state towards the
desired state. Examples of controllers that ship with
Kubernetes today are the replication controller, endpoints
con&acirc; <br>
troller, namespace controller, and serviceaccounts
controller.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kube-controller-manager</p>

all interfaces) (default 0.0.0.0) <br>
--allocate-node-cidrs Should CIDRs for Pods be allocated and
set on the cloud provider. <br>
--attach-detach-reconcile-sync-period duration The
reconciler sync wait time between volume attach detach. This
duration must be larger than one second, and increasing this
value from the default may allow for volumes to be
mismatched with pods. (default 1m0s) <br>
--azure-container-registry-config string Path to the file
container Azure container registry configuration
information. <br>
--cloud-config string The path to the cloud provider
configuration file. Empty string for no configuration file.

cluster-scoped certificates (default
&quot;/etc/kubernetes/ca/ca.key&quot;) <br>
--concurrent-deployment-syncs int32 The number of deployment
objects that are allowed to sync concurrently. Larger number
= more responsive deployments, but more CPU (and network)
load (default 5) <br>
--concurrent-endpoint-syncs int32 The number of endpoint
syncing operations that will be done concurrently. Larger
number = faster endpoint updating, but more CPU (and
network) load (default 5) <br>

workers that are allowed to sync concurrently. (default 20)
<br>
--concurrent-namespace-syncs int32 The number of namespace
objects that are allowed to sync concurrently. Larger number
= more responsive namespace termination, but more CPU (and
network) load (default 2) <br>
--concurrent-replicaset-syncs int32 The number of replica
sets that are allowed to sync concurrently. Larger number =
more responsive replica management, but more CPU (and
network) load (default 5) <br>
--concurrent-resource-quota-syncs int32 The number of
resource quotas that are allowed to sync concurrently.
Larger number = more responsive quota management, but more
CPU (and network) load (default 5) <br>
--concurrent-service-syncs int32 The number of services that

responsive service management, but more CPU (and network)
load (default 1) <br>

service account token objects that are allowed to sync
concurrently. Larger number = more responsive token
generation, but more CPU (and network) load (default 5) <br>
--concurrent_rc_syncs int32 The number of replication
controllers that are allowed to sync concurrently. Larger
number = more responsive replica management, but more CPU
(and network) load (default 5) <br>

cache for daemonsets. Larger number = more responsive
daemonsets, but more MEM load. (default 1024) <br>
--deployment-controller-sync-period duration Period for
syncing the deployments. (default 30s) <br>
--disable-attach-detach-reconcile-sync Disable volume attach
detach reconciler sync. Disabling this may cause volumes to
be mismatched with pods. Use wisely. <br>

allows testing and development of provisioning features.
HostPath provisioning is not supported in any way,
won&rsquo;t work in a multi-node cluster, and should not be
used for anything other than testing or development.</p>
