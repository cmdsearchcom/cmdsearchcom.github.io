<p>GIT-RM(1) Git Manual GIT-RM(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
git-rm - Remove files from the working tree and from the
index</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
git rm [-f | --force] [-n] [-r] [--cached]
[--ignore-unmatch] [--quiet] [--] &lt;file&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and
the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your
working directory. (There is no option to remove a file only
<br>
from the working tree and yet keep it in the index; use
/bin/rm if you want to do that.) The files being removed
have to be identical to the tip of the branch, and no
updates to <br>
their contents can be staged in the index, though that
default behavior can be overridden with the -f option. When
--cached is given, the staged content has to match either
the <br>
tip of the branch or the file on disk, allowing the file to
be removed from just the index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
&lt;file&gt;... <br>
Files to remove. Fileglobs (e.g. *.c) can be given to remove
all matching files. If you want Git to expand file glob
characters, you may need to shell-escape them. A leading
<br>
directory name (e.g. dir to remove dir/file1 and dir/file2)
can be given to remove all files in the directory, and
recursively all sub-directories, but this requires the -r
<br>
option to be explicitly given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --force <br>
Override the up-to-date check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --dry-run <br>
Don&acirc;t actually remove any file(s). Instead, just show
if they exist in the index and would otherwise be removed by
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r <br>
Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is
given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-- <br>
This option can be used to separate command-line options
from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be
mistaken for command-line options).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--cached <br>
Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the
index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be
left alone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ignore-unmatch <br>
Exit with a zero status even if no files matched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
git rm normally outputs one line (in the form of an rm
command) for each file removed. This option suppresses that
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DISCUSSION <br>
The &lt;file&gt; list given to the command can be exact
pathnames, file glob patterns, or leading directory names.
The command removes only the paths that are known to Git.
Giving the <br>
name of a file that you have not told Git about does not
remove that file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File globbing matches across
directory boundaries. Thus, given two directories d and d2,
there is a difference between using git rm &rsquo;d*&rsquo;
and git rm &rsquo;d/*&rsquo;, as the former will also <br>
remove all of directory d2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOVING FILES THAT HAVE
DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILESYSTEM <br>
There is no option for git rm to remove from the index only
the paths that have disappeared from the filesystem.
However, depending on the use case, there are several ways
that <br>
can be done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &acirc;git commit
-a&acirc; <br>
If you intend that your next commit should record all
modifications of tracked files in the working tree and
record all removals of files that have been removed from the
working <br>
tree with rm (as opposed to git rm), use git commit -a, as
it will automatically notice and record all removals. You
can also have a similar effect without committing by using
<br>
git add -u.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &acirc;git add -A&acirc;
<br>
When accepting a new code drop for a vendor branch, you
probably want to record both the removal of paths and
additions of new paths as well as modifications of existing
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Typically you would first remove
all tracked files from the working tree using this
command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm
-f</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">and then untar the new code in
the working tree. Alternately you could rsync the changes
into the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After that, the easiest way to
record all removals, additions, and modifications in the
working tree is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git add -A</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See git-add(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other ways <br>
If all you really want to do is to remove from the index the
files that are no longer present in the working tree
(perhaps because your working tree is dirty so that you
cannot <br>
use git commit -a), use the following command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git diff --name-only
--diff-filter=D -z | xargs -0 git rm --cached</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Submodules <br>
Only submodules using a gitfile (which means they were
cloned with a Git version 1.7.8 or newer) will be removed
from the work tree, as their repository lives inside the
.git <br>
directory of the superproject. If a submodule (or one of
those nested inside it) still uses a .git directory, git rm
will fail - no matter if forced or not - to protect the <br>
submodule&acirc;s history.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A submodule is considered
up-to-date when the HEAD is the same as recorded in the
index, no tracked files are modified and no untracked files
that aren&acirc;t ignored are present in <br>
the submodules work tree. Ignored files are deemed
expendable and won&acirc;t stop a submodule&acirc;s work
tree from being removed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you only want to remove the
local checkout of a submodule from your work tree without
committing the removal, use git-submodule(1) deinit
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
git rm Documentation/txt <br>
Removes all *.txt files from the index that are under the
Documentation directory and any of its subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the asterisk * is
quoted from the shell in this example; this lets Git, and
not the shell, expand the pathnames of files and
subdirectories under the Documentation/ <br>
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">git rm -f git-*.sh <br>
Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk
(i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not
remove subdir/git-foo.sh.</p>
