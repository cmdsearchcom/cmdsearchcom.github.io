<p>SC_FILTERPOLICY(1) BSD General Commands Manual
SC_FILTERPOLICY(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
sc_filterpolicy &acirc; scamper driver to test systems for
congruent filtering policy</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
sc_filterpolicy [-D] [-a input-file] [-l log-file] [-o
output-file] [-O options] [-p scamper-port] [-t host-type]
[-T test] [-U scamper-unix]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc_filterpolicy [-r
data-file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The sc_filterpolicy utility provides the ability to connect
to a running scamper(1) instance and use that instance to
test systems for congruent filtering policy. The utility
<br>
tests each system specified in the input file by probing for
application reachability with ICMP, UDP, and TCP probes,
using both IPv4 and IPv6 where applicable. Each system in
the <br>
input file should have multiple IP addresses specified; the
driver probes each IP address on each system one at a time
to avoid causing the remote system to rate-limit responses.
<br>
sc_filterpolicy obtains speed by probing systems in
parallel, though it may appear to operate slowly because no
progress is reported until all addresses belonging to a
device have <br>
been tested one at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The applications supported by
sc_filterpolicy to test filtering policy are: <br>
- ICMP: test responsiveness to ICMP echo request packets. We
classify the IP address as responsive to ICMP echo requests
if it sends an ICMP echo reply. <br>
- NetBIOS: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to
port 139 (the NetBIOS port). We classify the IP address as
responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- MSSQL: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
1433 (the Microsoft SQL server default port). We classify
the IP address as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- FTP: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
21 (the default port for FTP control connections). We
classify the IP address as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK.
<br>
- SSH: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
22 (the default port for SSH). We classify the IP address as
responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- Telnet: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to
port 23 (the default port for telnet). We classify the IP
address as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- MySQL: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
3306 (the default port for MySQL). We classify the IP
address as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- RDP: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
3389 (the default port for RDP). We classify the IP address
as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- HTTPS: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
443 (the default port for HTTPS). We classify the IP address
as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- SMB: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
445 (the default port for SMB). We classify the IP address
as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- HTTP: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
80 (the default port for HTTP). We classify the IP address
as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- BGP: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
179 (the default port for BGP). We classify the IP address
as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK. <br>
- NTP: test responsiveness to UDP packets sent to port 123
(the default port for NTP) with an NTP version request
payload. We classify the IP address as responsive if it
sends <br>
a UDP response. <br>
- DNS: test responsiveness to UDP packets sent to port 53
(the default port for DNS) with a query for www.google.com.
We classify the IP address as responsive if it sends a UDP
<br>
response. <br>
- SNMP: test responsiveness to UDP packets sent to port 161
(the default port for SNMP) with a get for sysDescr via the
public community using the SNMPv2c protocol. We classify
<br>
the IP address as responsive if it sends a UDP response.
<br>
- VNC: test responsiveness to TCP SYN packets sent to port
5900 (the default port for VNC). We classify the IP address
as responsive if it sends a SYN/ACK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The options supported by
sc_filterpolicy are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-? prints a list of command line
options and a synopsis of each.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a input-file <br>
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a
sequence of systems to test. See the examples section for
input-file formatting examples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D with this option set,
sc_filterpolicy will detach and become a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l log-file <br>
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
sc_filterpolicy generated at run time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o output-file <br>
specifies the name of the file to be written. The output
file will use the warts(5) format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O options <br>
allows the behavior of sc_filterpolicy to be further
tailored. The current choices for this option are: <br>
- impatient: order the systems found in the input-file so
that those with the most addresses are probed first, so that
probing will complete as fast as possible. <br>
- incongruent: only report systems which are inferred to
have an incongruent filtering policy. <br>
- trace: probe the addresses found in the input-file using
traceroute, rather than ping. <br>
- tuples: signals that the input-file is formatted as
tuples, rather than rows. See the examples section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p scamper-port <br>
specifies the port on the local host where scamper(1) is
accepting control socket connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r data-file <br>
specifies the name of a previously collected filter policy
data file, in warts(5) format, to read and analyse.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t probe-class <br>
specifies the class of probes to send for each IP address in
the input file. The current choices for this option are:
<br>
- router: test ICMP, SSH, Telnet, HTTPS, HTTP, BGP, NTP,
DNS, and SNMP. <br>
- server: test ICMP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, MySQL, RDP, HTTPS,
SMB, HTTP, NTP, DNS, and SNMP. <br>
- all: test ICMP, NetBIOS, MSSQL, FTP, SSH, Telnet, MySQL,
RDP, HTTPS, SMB, VNC, HTTP, BGP, NTP, DNS, and SNMP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T test <br>
specifies adjustments to the test schedule from the
supported application types. Prefacing an application with +
causes the application type to be added to the test
sched&acirc; <br>
ule, and prefacing an application with - causes the
application type to be removed from the test schedule.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U scamper-unix <br>
specifies the unix domain socket on the local host where
scamper(1) is accepting control socket connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
sc_filterpolicy requires a scamper(1) instance listening on
a port or unix domain socket for commands in order to
collect data:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">scamper -P 31337</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will start a scamper(1) instance
listening on port 31337 on the loopback interface. To use
sc_filterpolicy to test the filtering policy of a set of
routers specified in a file <br>
named routers.txt and formatted as rows as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo.example.com 192.0.2.1
2001:DB8::1 <br>
bar.example.com 192.0.2.2 2001:DB8::2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the following command will test
these routers for responsiveness to ICMP, SSH, Telnet,
HTTPS, HTTP, BGP, NTP, DNS, and SNMP probes, recording raw
data into example-routers.warts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc_filterpolicy -p 31337 -a
routers.txt -t router -o example-routers.warts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Including the name of each
device in the input file is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following command will only
test the routers for responsiveness to SSH:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc_filterpolicy -p 31337 -a
routers.txt -T +ssh -o example-ssh.warts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use sc_filterpolicy to test
the filtering policy of a set of servers specified in a file
named servers.txt and formatted as tuples as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">db.example.com 192.0.2.3 <br>
db.example.com 2001::DB8::3 <br>
corp.example.com 192.0.2.4 <br>
corp.example.com 2001::DB8::4</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">the following command will test
these servers for responsiveness to ICMP, FTP, SSH, Telnet,
MySQL, RDP, HTTPS, SMB, HTTP, NTP, DNS, and SNMP probes,
recording raw data into exam&acirc; <br>
ple-servers.warts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc_filterpolicy -p 31337 -a
servers.txt -t server -o example-servers.warts -O tuples</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In an input file formatted as
tuples, the name (or an identifier) for each device is
mandatory, and is used to ensure only one probe is sent to
any one device at a time, and to <br>
collate responses from different addresses to the same
device for reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once raw data has been
collected, sc_filterpolicy can be used to analyse the
collected data. For the example-routers.warts file, the
following command dumps a summary of the data <br>
collected for each router:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc_filterpolicy -r
example-routers.warts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">: T <br>
: e H <br>
: I l T H S <br>
: C S n T T B N D N <br>
: M S e P T G T N M <br>
: P H t S P P P S P <br>
======================================== <br>
192.0.2.1 : O O O O O <br>
2001:DB8::1 : O O O O O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">192.0.2.2 : O X <br>
2001:DB8::2 : O O</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first router is responsive
(O) for ICMP, SSH, HTTP, DNS, and SNMP probes on all
addresses. The second router is responsive (O) to ICMP
probes on both addresses is unresponsive <br>
(X) to SSH on the IPv4 address, but is responsive (O) to SSH
on the IPv6 address and possibly represents a filtering
policy that is incongruent and requires attention. Note that
<br>
the empty cells in the table represent a router that was
unresponsive (X) to that protocol for all addresses tested;
the cells are left empty to allow the user to focus on open
and <br>
incongruent application services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sc_filterpolicy -O incongruent
-r example-routers.warts</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">will only show routers with an
incongruent filtering policy.</p>
