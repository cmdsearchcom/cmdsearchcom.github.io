pcre2test - a program for testing Perl-compatible regular expressions.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>pcre2test [options] [input file [output file]]</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>pcre2test</b> is a test program for the PCRE2 regular expression libraries,
  but it can also be used for experimenting with regular expressions. This
  document describes the features of the test program; for details of the
  regular expressions themselves, see the <b>pcre2pattern</b> documentation. For
  details of the PCRE2 library function calls and their options, see the
  <b>pcre2api</b> documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input for <b>pcre2test</b> is a sequence of regular expression patterns and
  subject strings to be matched. There are also command lines for setting
  defaults and controlling some special actions. The output shows the result of
  each match attempt. Modifiers on external or internal command lines, the
  patterns, and the subject lines specify PCRE2 function options, control how
  the subject is processed, and what output is produced.
<div class="Pp"></div>
As the original fairly simple PCRE library evolved, it acquired many different
  features, and as a result, the original <b>pcretest</b> program ended up with
  a lot of options in a messy, arcane syntax for testing all the features. The
  move to the new PCRE2 API provided an opportunity to re-implement the test
  program as <b>pcre2test</b>, with a cleaner modifier syntax. Nevertheless,
  there are still many obscure modifiers, some of which are specifically
  designed for use in conjunction with the test script and data files that are
  distributed as part of PCRE2. All the modifiers are documented here, some
  without much justification, but many of them are unlikely to be of use except
  when testing the libraries.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PCRE2's_8-BIT,_16-BIT_AND_32-BIT_LIBRARIES"><a class="selflink" href="#PCRE2's_8-BIT,_16-BIT_AND_32-BIT_LIBRARIES">PCRE2's
  8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES</a></h1>
Different versions of the PCRE2 library can be built to support character
  strings that are encoded in 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units. One, two, or
  all three of these libraries may be simultaneously installed. The
  <b>pcre2test</b> program can be used to test all the libraries. However, its
  own input and output are always in 8-bit format. When testing the 16-bit or
  32-bit libraries, patterns and subject strings are converted to 16-bit or
  32-bit format before being passed to the library functions. Results are
  converted back to 8-bit code units for output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the rest of this document, the names of library functions and structures are
  given in generic form, for example, <b>pcre_compile()</b>. The actual names
  used in the libraries have a suffix _8, _16, or _32, as appropriate.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="INPUT_ENCODING"><a class="selflink" href="#INPUT_ENCODING">INPUT
  ENCODING</a></h1>
Input to <b>pcre2test</b> is processed line by line, either by calling the C
  library's <b>fgets()</b> function, or via the <b>libreadline</b> library. In
  some Windows environments character 26 (hex 1A) causes an immediate end of
  file, and no further data is read, so this character should be avoided unless
  you really want that action.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input is processed using using C's string functions, so must not contain
  binary zeroes, even though in Unix-like environments, <b>fgets()</b> treats
  any bytes other than newline as data characters. An error is generated if a
  binary zero is encountered. Subject lines are processed for backslash escapes,
  which makes it possible to include any data value in strings that are passed
  to the library for matching. For patterns, there is a facility for specifying
  some or all of the 8-bit input characters as hexadecimal pairs, which makes it
  possible to include binary zeros.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Input_for_the_16-bit_and_32-bit_libraries"><a class="selflink" href="#Input_for_the_16-bit_and_32-bit_libraries">Input
  for the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries</a></h2>
When testing the 16-bit or 32-bit libraries, there is a need to be able to
  generate character code points greater than 255 in the strings that are passed
  to the library. For subject lines, backslash escapes can be used. In addition,
  when the <b>utf</b> modifier (see &quot;Setting compilation options&quot;
  below) is set, the pattern and any following subject lines are interpreted as
  UTF-8 strings and translated to UTF-16 or UTF-32 as appropriate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For non-UTF testing of wide characters, the <b>utf8_input</b> modifier can be
  used. This is mutually exclusive with <b>utf</b>, and is allowed only in
  16-bit or 32-bit mode. It causes the pattern and following subject lines to be
  treated as UTF-8 according to the original definition (RFC 2279), which allows
  for character values up to 0x7fffffff. Each character is placed in one 16-bit
  or 32-bit code unit (in the 16-bit case, values greater than 0xffff cause an
  error to occur).
<div class="Pp"></div>
UTF-8 is not capable of encoding values greater than 0x7fffffff, but such values
  can be handled by the 32-bit library. When testing this library in non-UTF
  mode with <b>utf8_input</b> set, if any character is preceded by the byte 0xff
  (which is an illegal byte in UTF-8) 0x80000000 is added to the character's
  value. This is the only way of passing such code points in a pattern string.
  For subject strings, using an escape sequence is preferable.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
If <b>pcre2test</b> is given two filename arguments, it reads from the first and
  writes to the second. If the first name is &quot;-&quot;, input is taken from
  the standard input. If <b>pcre2test</b> is given only one argument, it reads
  from that file and writes to stdout. Otherwise, it reads from stdin and writes
  to stdout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>pcre2test</b> is built, a configuration option can specify that it
  should be linked with the <b>libreadline</b> or <b>libedit</b> library. When
  this is done, if the input is from a terminal, it is read using the
  <b>readline()</b> function. This provides line-editing and history facilities.
  The output from the <b>-help</b> option states whether or not
  <b>readline()</b> will be used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The program handles any number of tests, each of which consists of a set of
  input lines. Each set starts with a regular expression pattern, followed by
  any number of subject lines to be matched against that pattern. In between
  sets of test data, command lines that begin with # may appear. This file
  format, with some restrictions, can also be processed by the
  <b>perltest.sh</b> script that is distributed with PCRE2 as a means of
  checking that the behaviour of PCRE2 and Perl is the same.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the input is a terminal, <b>pcre2test</b> prompts for each line of input,
  using &quot;re&gt;&quot; to prompt for regular expression patterns, and
  &quot;data&gt;&quot; to prompt for subject lines. Command lines starting with
  # can be entered only in response to the &quot;re&gt;&quot; prompt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each subject line is matched separately and independently. If you want to do
  multi-line matches, you have to use the \n escape sequence (or \r or \r\n,
  etc., depending on the newline setting) in a single line of input to encode
  the newline sequences. There is no limit on the length of subject lines; the
  input buffer is automatically extended if it is too small. There are
  replication features that makes it possible to generate long repetitive
  pattern or subject lines without having to supply them explicitly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An empty line or the end of the file signals the end of the subject lines for a
  test, at which point a new pattern or command line is expected if there is
  still input to be read.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="COMMAND_LINES"><a class="selflink" href="#COMMAND_LINES">COMMAND
  LINES</a></h1>
In between sets of test data, a line that begins with # is interpreted as a
  command line. If the first character is followed by white space or an
  exclamation mark, the line is treated as a comment, and ignored. Otherwise,
  the following commands are recognized:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #forbid_utf
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Subsequent patterns automatically have the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF and PCRE2_NEVER_UCP
  options set, which locks out the use of the PCRE2_UTF and PCRE2_UCP options
  and the use of (*UTF) and (*UCP) at the start of patterns. This command also
  forces an error if a subsequent pattern contains any occurrences of \P, \p, or
  \X, which are still supported when PCRE2_UTF is not set, but which require
  Unicode property support to be included in the library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is a trigger guard that is used in test files to ensure that UTF or Unicode
  property tests are not accidentally added to files that are used when Unicode
  support is not included in the library. Setting PCRE2_NEVER_UTF and
  PCRE2_NEVER_UCP as a default can also be obtained by the use of
  <b>#pattern</b>; the difference is that <b>#forbid_utf</b> cannot be unset,
  and the automatic options are not displayed in pattern information, to avoid
  cluttering up test output.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #load &lt;filename&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command is used to load a set of precompiled patterns from a file, as
  described in the section entitled &quot;Saving and restoring compiled
  patterns&quot; below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #newline_default [&lt;newline-list&gt;]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When PCRE2 is built, a default newline convention can be specified. This
  determines which characters and/or character pairs are recognized as
  indicating a newline in a pattern or subject string. The default can be
  overridden when a pattern is compiled. The standard test files contain tests
  of various newline conventions, but the majority of the tests expect a single
  linefeed to be recognized as a newline by default. Without special action the
  tests would fail when PCRE2 is compiled with either CR or CRLF as the default
  newline.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The #newline_default command specifies a list of newline types that are
  acceptable as the default. The types must be one of CR, LF, CRLF, ANYCRLF, or
  ANY (in upper or lower case), for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #newline_default LF Any anyCRLF
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the default newline is in the list, this command has no effect. Otherwise,
  except when testing the POSIX API, a <b>newline</b> modifier that specifies
  the first newline convention in the list (LF in the above example) is added to
  any pattern that does not already have a <b>newline</b> modifier. If the
  newline list is empty, the feature is turned off. This command is present in a
  number of the standard test input files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When the POSIX API is being tested there is no way to override the default
  newline convention, though it is possible to set the newline convention from
  within the pattern. A warning is given if the <b>posix</b> modifier is used
  when <b>#newline_default</b> would set a default for the non-POSIX API.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #pattern &lt;modifier-list&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command sets a default modifier list that applies to all subsequent
  patterns. Modifiers on a pattern can change these settings.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #perltest
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The appearance of this line causes all subsequent modifier settings to be
  checked for compatibility with the <b>perltest.sh</b> script, which is used to
  confirm that Perl gives the same results as PCRE2. Also, apart from comment
  lines, none of the other command lines are permitted, because they and many of
  the modifiers are specific to <b>pcre2test</b>, and should not be used in test
  files that are also processed by <b>perltest.sh</b>. The <b>#perltest</b>
  command helps detect tests that are accidentally put in the wrong file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #pop [&lt;modifiers&gt;]
<br/>
 #popcopy [&lt;modifiers&gt;]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These commands are used to manipulate the stack of compiled patterns, as
  described in the section entitled &quot;Saving and restoring compiled
  patterns&quot; below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #save &lt;filename&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command is used to save a set of compiled patterns to a file, as described
  in the section entitled &quot;Saving and restoring compiled patterns&quot;
  below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #subject &lt;modifier-list&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This command sets a default modifier list that applies to all subsequent subject
  lines. Modifiers on a subject line can change these settings.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MODIFIER_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#MODIFIER_SYNTAX">MODIFIER
  SYNTAX</a></h1>
Modifier lists are used with both pattern and subject lines. Items in a list are
  separated by commas followed by optional white space. Trailing whitespace in a
  modifier list is ignored. Some modifiers may be given for both patterns and
  subject lines, whereas others are valid only for one or the other. Each
  modifier has a long name, for example &quot;anchored&quot;, and some of them
  must be followed by an equals sign and a value, for example,
  &quot;offset=12&quot;. Values cannot contain comma characters, but may contain
  spaces. Modifiers that do not take values may be preceded by a minus sign to
  turn off a previous setting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A few of the more common modifiers can also be specified as single letters, for
  example &quot;i&quot; for &quot;caseless&quot;. In documentation, following
  the Perl convention, these are written with a slash (&quot;the /i
  modifier&quot;) for clarity. Abbreviated modifiers must all be concatenated in
  the first item of a modifier list. If the first item is not recognized as a
  long modifier name, it is interpreted as a sequence of these abbreviations.
  For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/ig,newline=cr,jit=3
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is a pattern line whose modifier list starts with two one-letter modifiers
  (/i and /g). The lower-case abbreviated modifiers are the same as used in
  Perl.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATTERN_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#PATTERN_SYNTAX">PATTERN
  SYNTAX</a></h1>
A pattern line must start with one of the following characters (common symbols,
  excluding pattern meta-characters):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 / ! &quot; ' ` - = _ : ; , % &amp; @ ~
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This is interpreted as the pattern's delimiter. A regular expression may be
  continued over several input lines, in which case the newline characters are
  included within it. It is possible to include the delimiter within the pattern
  by escaping it with a backslash, for example
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc\/def/
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you do this, the escape and the delimiter form part of the pattern, but since
  the delimiters are all non-alphanumeric, this does not affect its
  interpretation. If the terminating delimiter is immediately followed by a
  backslash, for example,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/\
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
then a backslash is added to the end of the pattern. This is done to provide a
  way of testing the error condition that arises if a pattern finishes with a
  backslash, because
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc\/
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
is interpreted as the first line of a pattern that starts with &quot;abc/&quot;,
  causing pcre2test to read the next line as a continuation of the regular
  expression.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pattern can be followed by a modifier list (details below).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUBJECT_LINE_SYNTAX"><a class="selflink" href="#SUBJECT_LINE_SYNTAX">SUBJECT
  LINE SYNTAX</a></h1>
Before each subject line is passed to <b>pcre2_match()</b> or
  <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>, leading and trailing white space is removed, and the
  line is scanned for backslash escapes. The following provide a means of
  encoding non-printing characters in a visible way:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>

<br/>
 \o{dd...} octal character (any number of octal digits}
<br/>
 \xhh hexadecimal byte (up to 2 hex digits)
<br/>
 \x{hh...} hexadecimal character (any number of hex digits)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The use of \x{hh...} is not dependent on the use of the <b>utf</b> modifier on
  the pattern. It is recognized always. There may be any number of hexadecimal
  digits inside the braces; invalid values provoke error messages.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that \xhh specifies one byte rather than one character in UTF-8 mode; this
  makes it possible to construct invalid UTF-8 sequences for testing purposes.
  On the other hand, \x{hh} is interpreted as a UTF-8 character in UTF-8 mode,
  generating more than one byte if the value is greater than 127. When testing
  the 8-bit library not in UTF-8 mode, \x{hh} generates one byte for values less
  than 256, and causes an error for greater values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In UTF-16 mode, all 4-digit \x{hhhh} values are accepted. This makes it possible
  to construct invalid UTF-16 sequences for testing purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In UTF-32 mode, all 4- to 8-digit \x{...} values are accepted. This makes it
  possible to construct invalid UTF-32 sequences for testing purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a special backslash sequence that specifies replication of one or more
  characters:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \[&lt;characters&gt;]{&lt;count&gt;}
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This makes it possible to test long strings without having to provide them as
  part of the file. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \[abc]{4}
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
is converted to &quot;abcabcabcabc&quot;. This feature does not support nesting.
  To include a closing square bracket in the characters, code it as \x5D.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A backslash followed by an equals sign marks the end of the subject string and
  the start of a modifier list. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 abc\=notbol,notempty
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the subject string is empty and \= is followed by whitespace, the line is
  treated as a comment line, and is not used for matching. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \= This is a comment.
<br/>
 abc\= This is an invalid modifier list.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A backslash followed by any other non-alphanumeric character just escapes that
  character. A backslash followed by anything else causes an error. However, if
  the very last character in the line is a backslash (and there is no modifier
  list), it is ignored. This gives a way of passing an empty line as data, since
  a real empty line terminates the data input.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PATTERN_MODIFIERS"><a class="selflink" href="#PATTERN_MODIFIERS">PATTERN
  MODIFIERS</a></h1>
There are several types of modifier that can appear in pattern lines. Except
  where noted below, they may also be used in <b>#pattern</b> commands. A
  pattern's modifier list can add to or override default modifiers that were set
  by a previous <b>#pattern</b> command.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_compilation_options"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_compilation_options">Setting

The following modifiers set options for <b>pcre2_compile()</b>. The most common
  ones have single-letter abbreviations. See <b>pcre2api</b> for a description
  of their effects.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As well as turning on the PCRE2_UTF option, the <b>utf</b> modifier causes all
  non-printing characters in output strings to be printed using the \x{hh...}
  notation. Otherwise, those less than 0x100 are output in hex without the curly
  brackets. Setting <b>utf</b> in 16-bit or 32-bit mode also causes pattern and
  subject strings to be translated to UTF-16 or UTF-32, respectively, before
  being passed to library functions.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_compilation_controls"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_compilation_controls">Setting

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The effects of these modifiers are described in the following sections.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Newline_and_\R_handling"><a class="selflink" href="#Newline_and_\R_handling">Newline
  and \R handling</a></h2>
The <b>bsr</b> modifier specifies what \R in a pattern should match. If it is
  set to &quot;anycrlf&quot;, \R matches CR, LF, or CRLF only. If it is set to
  &quot;unicode&quot;, \R matches any Unicode newline sequence. The default is
  specified when PCRE2 is built, with the default default being Unicode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>newline</b> modifier specifies which characters are to be interpreted as
  newlines, both in the pattern and in subject lines. The type must be one of
  CR, LF, CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY (in upper or lower case).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Information_about_a_pattern"><a class="selflink" href="#Information_about_a_pattern">Information
  about a pattern</a></h2>
The <b>debug</b> modifier is a shorthand for <b>info,fullbincode</b>, requesting
  all available information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>bincode</b> modifier causes a representation of the compiled code to be
  output after compilation. This information does not contain length and offset
  values, which ensures that the same output is generated for different internal
  link sizes and different code unit widths. By using <b>bincode</b>, the same
  regression tests can be used in different environments.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>fullbincode</b> modifier, by contrast, <i>does</i> include length and
  offset values. This is used in a few special tests that run only for specific
  code unit widths and link sizes, and is also useful for one-off tests.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>info</b> modifier requests information about the compiled pattern
  (whether it is anchored, has a fixed first character, and so on). The
  information is obtained from the <b>pcre2_pattern_info()</b> function. Here
  are some typical examples:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(?i)(^a|^b)/m,info
<br/>
 Capturing subpattern count = 1
<br/>
 Compile options: multiline
<br/>
 Overall options: caseless multiline
<br/>
 First code unit at start or follows newline
<br/>
 Subject length lower bound = 1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(?i)abc/info
<br/>
 Capturing subpattern count = 0
<br/>
 Compile options: &lt;none&gt;
<br/>
 Overall options: caseless
<br/>
 First code unit = 'a' (caseless)
<br/>
 Last code unit = 'c' (caseless)
<br/>
 Subject length lower bound = 3
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;Compile options&quot; are those specified by modifiers; &quot;overall
  options&quot; have added options that are taken or deduced from the pattern.
  If both sets of options are the same, just a single &quot;options&quot; line
  is output; if there are no options, the line is omitted. &quot;First code
  unit&quot; is where any match must start; if there is more than one they are
  listed as &quot;starting code units&quot;. &quot;Last code unit&quot; is the
  last literal code unit that must be present in any match. This is not
  necessarily the last character. These lines are omitted if no starting or
  ending code units are recorded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>callout_info</b> modifier requests information about all the callouts in
  the pattern. A list of them is output at the end of any other information that
  is requested. For each callout, either its number or string is given, followed
  by the item that follows it in the pattern.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Passing_a_NULL_context"><a class="selflink" href="#Passing_a_NULL_context">Passing
  a NULL context</a></h2>
Normally, <b>pcre2test</b> passes a context block to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>. If
  the <b>null_context</b> modifier is set, however, NULL is passed. This is for
  testing that <b>pcre2_compile()</b> behaves correctly in this case (it uses
  default values).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Specifying_the_pattern's_length"><a class="selflink" href="#Specifying_the_pattern's_length">Specifying
  the pattern's length</a></h2>
By default, patterns are passed to the compiling functions as zero-terminated
  strings. When using the POSIX wrapper API, there is no other option. However,
  when using PCRE2's native API, patterns can be passed by length instead of
  being zero-terminated. The <b>use_length</b> modifier causes this to happen.
  Using a length happens automatically (whether or not <b>use_length</b> is set)
  when <b>hex</b> is set, because patterns specified in hexadecimal may contain
  binary zeros.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Specifying_pattern_characters_in_hexadecimal"><a class="selflink" href="#Specifying_pattern_characters_in_hexadecimal">Specifying
  pattern characters in hexadecimal</a></h2>
The <b>hex</b> modifier specifies that the characters of the pattern, except for
  substrings enclosed in single or double quotes, are to be interpreted as pairs
  of hexadecimal digits. This feature is provided as a way of creating patterns
  that contain binary zeros and other non-printing characters. White space is
  permitted between pairs of digits. For example, this pattern contains three
  characters:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /ab 32 59/hex
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Parts of such a pattern are taken literally if quoted. This pattern contains
  nine characters, only two of which are specified in hexadecimal:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /ab &quot;literal&quot; 32/hex
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Either single or double quotes may be used. There is no way of including the
  delimiter within a substring. The <b>hex</b> and <b>expand</b> modifiers are
  mutually exclusive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The POSIX API cannot be used with patterns specified in hexadecimal because they
  may contain binary zeros, which conflicts with <b>regcomp()</b>'s requirement
  for a zero-terminated string. Such patterns are always passed to
  <b>pcre2_compile()</b> as a string with a length, not as zero-terminated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Specifying_wide_characters_in_16-bit_and_32-bit_modes"><a class="selflink" href="#Specifying_wide_characters_in_16-bit_and_32-bit_modes">Specifying
  wide characters in 16-bit and 32-bit modes</a></h2>
In 16-bit and 32-bit modes, all input is automatically treated as UTF-8 and
  translated to UTF-16 or UTF-32 when the <b>utf</b> modifier is set. For
  testing the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries in non-UTF mode, the <b>utf8_input</b>
  modifier can be used. It is mutually exclusive with <b>utf</b>. Input lines
  are interpreted as UTF-8 as a means of specifying wide characters. More
  details are given in &quot;Input encoding&quot; above.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Generating_long_repetitive_patterns"><a class="selflink" href="#Generating_long_repetitive_patterns">Generating
  long repetitive patterns</a></h2>
Some tests use long patterns that are very repetitive. Instead of creating a
  very long input line for such a pattern, you can use a special repetition
  feature, similar to the one described for subject lines above. If the
  <b>expand</b> modifier is present on a pattern, parts of the pattern that have
  the form
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 \[&lt;characters&gt;]{&lt;count&gt;}
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
are expanded before the pattern is passed to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>. For
  example, \[AB]{6000} is expanded to &quot;ABAB...&quot; 6000 times. This
  construction cannot be nested. An initial &quot;\[&quot; sequence is
  recognized only if &quot;]{&quot; followed by decimal digits and &quot;}&quot;
  is found later in the pattern. If not, the characters remain in the pattern
  unaltered. The <b>expand</b> and <b>hex</b> modifiers are mutually exclusive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If part of an expanded pattern looks like an expansion, but is really part of
  the actual pattern, unwanted expansion can be avoided by giving two values in
  the quantifier. For example, \[AB]{6000,6000} is not recognized as an
  expansion item.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>info</b> modifier is set on an expanded pattern, the result of the
  expansion is included in the information that is output.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="JIT_compilation"><a class="selflink" href="#JIT_compilation">JIT
  compilation</a></h2>
Just-in-time (JIT) compiling is a heavyweight optimization that can greatly
  speed up pattern matching. See the <b>pcre2jit</b> documentation for details.
  JIT compiling happens, optionally, after a pattern has been successfully
  compiled into an internal form. The JIT compiler converts this to optimized
  machine code. It needs to know whether the match-time options
  PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD and PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT are going to be used, because
  different code is generated for the different cases. See the <b>partial</b>
  modifier in &quot;Subject Modifiers&quot; below for details of how these
  options are specified for each match attempt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
JIT compilation is requested by the <b>/jit</b> pattern modifier, which may
  optionally be followed by an equals sign and a number in the range 0 to 7. The
  three bits that make up the number specify which of the three JIT operating
  modes are to be compiled:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 1 compile JIT code for non-partial matching
<br/>
 2 compile JIT code for soft partial matching
<br/>
 4 compile JIT code for hard partial matching
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The possible values for the <b>jit</b> modifier are therefore:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 0 disable JIT
<br/>
 1 normal matching only
<br/>
 2 soft partial matching only
<br/>
 3 normal and soft partial matching
<br/>
 4 hard partial matching only
<br/>
 6 soft and hard partial matching only
<br/>
 7 all three modes
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no number is given, 7 is assumed. The phrase &quot;partial matching&quot;
  means a call to <b>pcre2_match()</b> with either the PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT or the
  PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD option set. Note that such a call may return a complete
  match; the options enable the possibility of a partial match, but do not
  require it. Note also that if you request JIT compilation only for partial
  matching (for example, /jit=2) but do not set the <b>partial</b> modifier on a
  subject line, that match will not use JIT code because none was compiled for
  non-partial matching.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If JIT compilation is successful, the compiled JIT code will automatically be
  used when an appropriate type of match is run, except when incompatible
  run-time options are specified. For more details, see the <b>pcre2jit</b>
  documentation. See also the <b>jitstack</b> modifier below for a way of
  setting the size of the JIT stack.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>jitfast</b> modifier is specified, matching is done using the JIT
  &quot;fast path&quot; interface, <b>pcre2_jit_match()</b>, which skips some of
  the sanity checks that are done by <b>pcre2_match()</b>, and of course does
  not work when JIT is not supported. If <b>jitfast</b> is specified without
  <b>jit</b>, jit=7 is assumed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>jitverify</b> modifier is specified, information about the compiled
  pattern shows whether JIT compilation was or was not successful. If
  <b>jitverify</b> is specified without <b>jit</b>, jit=7 is assumed. If JIT
  compilation is successful when <b>jitverify</b> is set, the text
  &quot;(JIT)&quot; is added to the first output line after a match or non match
  when JIT-compiled code was actually used in the match.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_a_locale"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_a_locale">Setting
  a locale</a></h2>
The <b>locale</b> modifier must specify the name of a locale, for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /pattern/locale=fr_FR
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The given locale is set, <b>pcre2_maketables()</b> is called to build a set of
  character tables for the locale, and this is then passed to
  <b>pcre2_compile()</b> when compiling the regular expression. The same tables
  are used when matching the following subject lines. The <b>locale</b> modifier
  applies only to the pattern on which it appears, but can be given in a
  <b>#pattern</b> command if a default is needed. Setting a locale and alternate
  character tables are mutually exclusive.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Showing_pattern_memory"><a class="selflink" href="#Showing_pattern_memory">Showing
  pattern memory</a></h2>
The <b>memory</b> modifier causes the size in bytes of the memory used to hold
  the compiled pattern to be output. This does not include the size of the
  <b>pcre2_code</b> block; it is just the actual compiled data. If the pattern
  is subsequently passed to the JIT compiler, the size of the JIT compiled code
  is also output. Here is an example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /a(b)c/jit,memory
<br/>
 Memory allocation (code space): 21
<br/>
 Memory allocation (JIT code): 1910
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Limiting_nested_parentheses"><a class="selflink" href="#Limiting_nested_parentheses">Limiting
  nested parentheses</a></h2>
The <b>parens_nest_limit</b> modifier sets a limit on the depth of nested
  parentheses in a pattern. Breaching the limit causes a compilation error. The
  default for the library is set when PCRE2 is built, but <b>pcre2test</b> sets
  its own default of 220, which is required for running the standard test suite.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Limiting_the_pattern_length"><a class="selflink" href="#Limiting_the_pattern_length">Limiting
  the pattern length</a></h2>
The <b>max_pattern_length</b> modifier sets a limit, in code units, to the
  length of pattern that <b>pcre2_compile()</b> will accept. Breaching the limit
  causes a compilation error. The default is the largest number a PCRE2_SIZE
  variable can hold (essentially unlimited).
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_the_POSIX_wrapper_API"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_the_POSIX_wrapper_API">Using
  the POSIX wrapper API</a></h2>
The <b>/posix</b> and <b>posix_nosub</b> modifiers cause <b>pcre2test</b> to
  call PCRE2 via the POSIX wrapper API rather than its native API. When
  <b>posix_nosub</b> is used, the POSIX option REG_NOSUB is passed to
  <b>regcomp()</b>. The POSIX wrapper supports only the 8-bit library. Note that
  it does not imply POSIX matching semantics; for more detail see the
  <b>pcre2posix</b> documentation. The following pattern modifiers set options
  for the <b>regcomp()</b> function:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 caseless REG_ICASE
<br/>
 multiline REG_NEWLINE
<br/>
 dotall REG_DOTALL )
<br/>
 ungreedy REG_UNGREEDY ) These options are not part of
<br/>
 ucp REG_UCP ) the POSIX standard
<br/>
 utf REG_UTF8 )
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>regerror_buffsize</b> modifier specifies a size for the error buffer that
  is passed to <b>regerror()</b> in the event of a compilation error. For
  example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/posix,regerror_buffsize=20
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This provides a means of testing the behaviour of <b>regerror()</b> when the
  buffer is too small for the error message. If this modifier has not been set,
  a large buffer is used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>aftertext</b> and <b>allaftertext</b> subject modifiers work as described
  below. All other modifiers are either ignored, with a warning message, or
  cause an error.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Testing_the_stack_guard_feature"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_the_stack_guard_feature">Testing
  the stack guard feature</a></h2>
The <b>stackguard</b> modifier is used to test the use of
  <b>pcre2_set_compile_recursion_guard()</b>, a function that is provided to
  enable stack availability to be checked during compilation (see the
  <b>pcre2api</b> documentation for details). If the number specified by the
  modifier is greater than zero, <b>pcre2_set_compile_recursion_guard()</b> is
  called to set up callback from <b>pcre2_compile()</b> to a local function. The
  argument it receives is the current nesting parenthesis depth; if this is
  greater than the value given by the modifier, non-zero is returned, causing
  the compilation to be aborted.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Using_alternative_character_tables"><a class="selflink" href="#Using_alternative_character_tables">Using
  alternative character tables</a></h2>
The value specified for the <b>tables</b> modifier must be one of the digits 0,
  1, or 2. It causes a specific set of built-in character tables to be passed to
  <b>pcre2_compile()</b>. This is used in the PCRE2 tests to check behaviour
  with different character tables. The digit specifies the tables as follows:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 0 do not pass any special character tables
<br/>
 1 the default ASCII tables, as distributed in
<br/>
 pcre2_chartables.c.dist
<br/>
 2 a set of tables defining ISO 8859 characters
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In table 2, some characters whose codes are greater than 128 are identified as
  letters, digits, spaces, etc. Setting alternate character tables and a locale
  are mutually exclusive.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_certain_match_controls"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_certain_match_controls">Setting
  certain match controls</a></h2>
The following modifiers are really subject modifiers, and are described below.
  However, they may be included in a pattern's modifier list, in which case they
  are applied to every subject line that is processed with that pattern. They
  may not appear in <b>#pattern</b> commands. These modifiers do not affect the
  compilation process.

These modifiers may not appear in a <b>#pattern</b> command. If you want them as

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Saving_a_compiled_pattern"><a class="selflink" href="#Saving_a_compiled_pattern">Saving
  a compiled pattern</a></h2>
When a pattern with the <b>push</b> modifier is successfully compiled, it is
  pushed onto a stack of compiled patterns, and <b>pcre2test</b> expects the
  next line to contain a new pattern (or a command) instead of a subject line.
  This facility is used when saving compiled patterns to a file, as described in
  the section entitled &quot;Saving and restoring compiled patterns&quot; below.
  If <b>pushcopy</b> is used instead of <b>push</b>, a copy of the compiled
  pattern is stacked, leaving the original as current, ready to match the
  following input lines. This provides a way of testing the
  <b>pcre2_code_copy()</b> function. The <b>push</b> and <b>pushcopy </b>
  modifiers are incompatible with compilation modifiers such as <b>global</b>
  that act at match time. Any that are specified are ignored (for the stacked
  copy), with a warning message, except for <b>replace</b>, which causes an
  error. Note that <b>jitverify</b>, which is allowed, does not carry through to
  any subsequent matching that uses a stacked pattern.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SUBJECT_MODIFIERS"><a class="selflink" href="#SUBJECT_MODIFIERS">SUBJECT

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The partial matching modifiers are provided with abbreviations because they
  appear frequently in tests.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>posix</b> modifier was present on the pattern, causing the POSIX
  wrapper API to be used, the only option-setting modifiers that have any effect
  are <b>notbol</b>, <b>notempty</b>, and <b>noteol</b>, causing REG_NOTBOL,
  REG_NOTEMPTY, and REG_NOTEOL, respectively, to be passed to <b>regexec()</b>.
  The other modifiers are ignored, with a warning message.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is one additional modifier that can be used with the POSIX wrapper. It is
  ignored (with a warning) if used for non-POSIX matching.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 posix_startend=&lt;n&gt;[:&lt;m&gt;]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This causes the subject string to be passed to <b>regexec()</b> using the
  REG_STARTEND option, which uses offsets to restrict which part of the string
  is searched. If only one number is given, the end offset is passed as the end
  of the subject string. For more detail of REG_STARTEND, see the
  <b>pcre2posix</b> documentation.

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The effects of these modifiers are described in the following sections. When
  matching via the POSIX wrapper API, the <b>aftertext</b>, <b>allaftertext</b>,
  and <b>ovector</b> subject modifiers work as described below. All other
  modifiers are either ignored, with a warning message, or cause an error.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Showing_more_text"><a class="selflink" href="#Showing_more_text">Showing
  more text</a></h2>
The <b>aftertext</b> modifier requests that as well as outputting the part of
  the subject string that matched the entire pattern, <b>pcre2test</b> should in
  addition output the remainder of the subject string. This is useful for tests
  where the subject contains multiple copies of the same substring. The
  <b>allaftertext</b> modifier requests the same action for captured substrings
  as well as the main matched substring. In each case the remainder is output on
  the following line with a plus character following the capture number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>allusedtext</b> modifier requests that all the text that was consulted
  during a successful pattern match by the interpreter should be shown. This
  feature is not supported for JIT matching, and if requested with JIT it is
  ignored (with a warning message). Setting this modifier affects the output if
  there is a lookbehind at the start of a match, or a lookahead at the end, or
  if \K is used in the pattern. Characters that precede or follow the start and
  end of the actual match are indicated in the output by '&lt;' or '&gt;'
  characters underneath them. Here is an example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(?&lt;=pqr)abc(?=xyz)/
<br/>
 data&gt; 123pqrabcxyz456\=allusedtext
<br/>
 0: pqrabcxyz
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This shows that the matched string is &quot;abc&quot;, with the preceding and
  following strings &quot;pqr&quot; and &quot;xyz&quot; having been consulted
  during the match (when processing the assertions).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>startchar</b> modifier requests that the starting character for the match
  be indicated, if it is different to the start of the matched string. The only
  time when this occurs is when \K has been processed as part of the match. In
  this situation, the output for the matched string is displayed from the
  starting character instead of from the match point, with circumflex characters
  under the earlier characters. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /abc\Kxyz/
<br/>
 data&gt; abcxyz\=startchar
<br/>
 0: abcxyz
<br/>
 ^^^
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unlike <b>allusedtext</b>, the <b>startchar</b> modifier can be used with JIT.
  However, these two modifiers are mutually exclusive.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Showing_the_value_of_all_capture_groups"><a class="selflink" href="#Showing_the_value_of_all_capture_groups">Showing
  the value of all capture groups</a></h2>
The <b>allcaptures</b> modifier requests that the values of all potential
  captured parentheses be output after a match. By default, only those up to the
  highest one actually used in the match are output (corresponding to the return
  code from <b>pcre2_match()</b>). Groups that did not take part in the match
  are output as &quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot;. This modifier is not relevant for DFA
  matching (which does no capturing); it is ignored, with a warning message, if
  present.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Testing_callouts"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_callouts">Testing
  callouts</a></h2>
A callout function is supplied when <b>pcre2test</b> calls the library matching
  functions, unless <b>callout_none</b> is specified. If <b>callout_capture</b>
  is set, the current captured groups are output when a callout occurs. The
  default return from the callout function is zero, which allows matching to
  continue.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>callout_fail</b> modifier can be given one or two numbers. If there is
  only one number, 1 is returned instead of 0 (causing matching to backtrack)
  when a callout of that number is reached. If two numbers (&lt;n&gt;:&lt;m&gt;)
  are given, 1 is returned when callout &lt;n&gt; is reached and there have been
  at least &lt;m&gt; callouts. The <b>callout_error</b> modifier is similar,
  except that PCRE2_ERROR_CALLOUT is returned, causing the entire matching
  process to be aborted. If both these modifiers are set for the same callout
  number, <b>callout_error</b> takes precedence.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that callouts with string arguments are always given the number zero. See
  &quot;Callouts&quot; below for a description of the output when a callout it
  taken.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>callout_data</b> modifier can be given an unsigned or a negative number.
  This is set as the &quot;user data&quot; that is passed to the matching
  function, and passed back when the callout function is invoked. Any value
  other than zero is used as a return from <b>pcre2test</b>'s callout function.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Finding_all_matches_in_a_string"><a class="selflink" href="#Finding_all_matches_in_a_string">Finding
  all matches in a string</a></h2>
Searching for all possible matches within a subject can be requested by the
  <b>global</b> or <b>altglobal</b> modifier. After finding a match, the
  matching function is called again to search the remainder of the subject. The
  difference between <b>global</b> and <b>altglobal</b> is that the former uses
  the <i>start_offset</i> argument to <b>pcre2_match()</b> or
  <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> to start searching at a new point within the entire
  string (which is what Perl does), whereas the latter passes over a shortened
  subject. This makes a difference to the matching process if the pattern begins
  with a lookbehind assertion (including \b or \B).
<div class="Pp"></div>
If an empty string is matched, the next match is done with the
  PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART and PCRE2_ANCHORED flags set, in order to search for
  another, non-empty, match at the same point in the subject. If this match
  fails, the start offset is advanced, and the normal match is retried. This
  imitates the way Perl handles such cases when using the <b>/g</b> modifier or
  the <b>split()</b> function. Normally, the start offset is advanced by one
  character, but if the newline convention recognizes CRLF as a newline, and the
  current character is CR followed by LF, an advance of two characters occurs.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Testing_substring_extraction_functions"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_substring_extraction_functions">Testing
  substring extraction functions</a></h2>
The <b>copy</b> and <b>get</b> modifiers can be used to test the
  <b>pcre2_substring_copy_xxx()</b> and <b>pcre2_substring_get_xxx()</b>
  functions. They can be given more than once, and each can specify a group name
  or number, for example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 abcd\=copy=1,copy=3,get=G1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the <b>#subject</b> command is used to set default copy and/or get lists,
  these can be unset by specifying a negative number to cancel all numbered
  groups and an empty name to cancel all named groups.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>getall</b> modifier tests <b>pcre2_substring_list_get()</b>, which
  extracts all captured substrings.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the subject line is successfully matched, the substrings extracted by the
  convenience functions are output with C, G, or L after the string number
  instead of a colon. This is in addition to the normal full list. The string
  length (that is, the return from the extraction function) is given in
  parentheses after each substring, followed by the name when the extraction was
  by name.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Testing_the_substitution_function"><a class="selflink" href="#Testing_the_substitution_function">Testing
  the substitution function</a></h2>
If the <b>replace</b> modifier is set, the <b>pcre2_substitute()</b> function is
  called instead of one of the matching functions. Note that replacement strings
  cannot contain commas, because a comma signifies the end of a modifier. This
  is not thought to be an issue in a test program.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Unlike subject strings, <b>pcre2test</b> does not process replacement strings
  for escape sequences. In UTF mode, a replacement string is checked to see if
  it is a valid UTF-8 string. If so, it is correctly converted to a UTF string
  of the appropriate code unit width. If it is not a valid UTF-8 string, the
  individual code units are copied directly. This provides a means of passing an
  invalid UTF-8 string for testing purposes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The following modifiers set options (in additional to the normal match options)
  for <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 global PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_GLOBAL
<br/>
 substitute_extended PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_EXTENDED
<br/>
 substitute_overflow_length PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_OVERFLOW_LENGTH
<br/>
 substitute_unknown_unset PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_UNKNOWN_UNSET
<br/>
 substitute_unset_empty PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_UNSET_EMPTY
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
After a successful substitution, the modified string is output, preceded by the
  number of replacements. This may be zero if there were no matches. Here is a
  simple example of a substitution test:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/replace=xxx
<br/>
 =abc=abc=
<br/>
 1: =xxx=abc=
<br/>
 =abc=abc=\=global
<br/>
 2: =xxx=xxx=
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Subject and replacement strings should be kept relatively short (fewer than 256
  characters) for substitution tests, as fixed-size buffers are used. To make it
  easy to test for buffer overflow, if the replacement string starts with a
  number in square brackets, that number is passed to <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>
  as the size of the output buffer, with the replacement string starting at the
  next character. Here is an example that tests the edge case:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/
<br/>
 123abc123\=replace=[10]XYZ
<br/>
 1: 123XYZ123
<br/>
 123abc123\=replace=[9]XYZ
<br/>
 Failed: error -47: no more memory
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The default action of <b>pcre2_substitute()</b> is to return
  PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY when the output buffer is too small. However, if the
  PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_OVERFLOW_LENGTH option is set (by using the
  <b>substitute_overflow_length</b> modifier), <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>
  continues to go through the motions of matching and substituting, in order to
  compute the size of buffer that is required. When this happens,
  <b>pcre2test</b> shows the required buffer length (which includes space for
  the trailing zero) as part of the error message. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/substitute_overflow_length
<br/>
 123abc123\=replace=[9]XYZ
<br/>
 Failed: error -47: no more memory: 10 code units are needed
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A replacement string is ignored with POSIX and DFA matching. Specifying partial
  matching provokes an error return (&quot;bad option value&quot;) from
  <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_the_JIT_stack_size"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_the_JIT_stack_size">Setting
  the JIT stack size</a></h2>
The <b>jitstack</b> modifier provides a way of setting the maximum stack size
  that is used by the just-in-time optimization code. It is ignored if JIT
  optimization is not being used. The value is a number of kilobytes. Providing
  a stack that is larger than the default 32K is necessary only for very
  complicated patterns.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_match_and_recursion_limits"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_match_and_recursion_limits">Setting
  match and recursion limits</a></h2>
The <b>match_limit</b> and <b>recursion_limit</b> modifiers set the appropriate
  limits in the match context. These values are ignored when the
  <b>find_limits</b> modifier is specified.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Finding_minimum_limits"><a class="selflink" href="#Finding_minimum_limits">Finding
  minimum limits</a></h2>
If the <b>find_limits</b> modifier is present, <b>pcre2test</b> calls
  <b>pcre2_match()</b> several times, setting different values in the match
  context via <b>pcre2_set_match_limit()</b> and
  <b>pcre2_set_recursion_limit()</b> until it finds the minimum values for each
  parameter that allow <b>pcre2_match()</b> to complete without error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If JIT is being used, only the match limit is relevant. If DFA matching is being
  used, neither limit is relevant, and this modifier is ignored (with a warning
  message).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <i>match_limit</i> number is a measure of the amount of backtracking that
  takes place, and learning the minimum value can be instructive. For most
  simple matches, the number is quite small, but for patterns with very large
  numbers of matching possibilities, it can become large very quickly with
  increasing length of subject string. The <i>match_limit_recursion</i> number
  is a measure of how much stack (or, if PCRE2 is compiled with NO_RECURSE, how
  much heap) memory is needed to complete the match attempt.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Showing_MARK_names"><a class="selflink" href="#Showing_MARK_names">Showing
  MARK names</a></h2>
The <b>mark</b> modifier causes the names from backtracking control verbs that
  are returned from calls to <b>pcre2_match()</b> to be displayed. If a mark is
  returned for a match, non-match, or partial match, <b>pcre2test</b> shows it.
  For a match, it is on a line by itself, tagged with &quot;MK:&quot;.
  Otherwise, it is added to the non-match message.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Showing_memory_usage"><a class="selflink" href="#Showing_memory_usage">Showing
  memory usage</a></h2>
The <b>memory</b> modifier causes <b>pcre2test</b> to log all memory allocation
  and freeing calls that occur during a match operation.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_a_starting_offset"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_a_starting_offset">Setting
  a starting offset</a></h2>
The <b>offset</b> modifier sets an offset in the subject string at which
  matching starts. Its value is a number of code units, not characters.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_an_offset_limit"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_an_offset_limit">Setting
  an offset limit</a></h2>
The <b>offset_limit</b> modifier sets a limit for unanchored matches. If a match
  cannot be found starting at or before this offset in the subject, a &quot;no
  match&quot; return is given. The data value is a number of code units, not
  characters. When this modifier is used, the <b>use_offset_limit</b> modifier
  must have been set for the pattern; if not, an error is generated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Setting_the_size_of_the_output_vector"><a class="selflink" href="#Setting_the_size_of_the_output_vector">Setting
  the size of the output vector</a></h2>
The <b>ovector</b> modifier applies only to the subject line in which it
  appears, though of course it can also be used to set a default in a
  <b>#subject</b> command. It specifies the number of pairs of offsets that are
  available for storing matching information. The default is 15.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A value of zero is useful when testing the POSIX API because it causes
  <b>regexec()</b> to be called with a NULL capture vector. When not testing the
  POSIX API, a value of zero is used to cause
  <b>pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern()</b> to be called, in order to create
  a match block of exactly the right size for the pattern. (It is not possible
  to create a match block with a zero-length ovector; there is always at least
  one pair of offsets.)
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Passing_the_subject_as_zero-terminated"><a class="selflink" href="#Passing_the_subject_as_zero-terminated">Passing
  the subject as zero-terminated</a></h2>
By default, the subject string is passed to a native API matching function with
  its correct length. In order to test the facility for passing a
  zero-terminated string, the <b>zero_terminate</b> modifier is provided. It
  causes the length to be passed as PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED. (When matching via
  the POSIX interface, this modifier has no effect, as there is no facility for
  passing a length.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
When testing <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>, this modifier also has the effect of
  passing the replacement string as zero-terminated.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Passing_a_NULL_context"><a class="selflink" href="#Passing_a_NULL_context">Passing
  a NULL context</a></h2>
Normally, <b>pcre2test</b> passes a context block to <b>pcre2_match()</b>,
  <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> or <b>pcre2_jit_match()</b>. If the
  <b>null_context</b> modifier is set, however, NULL is passed. This is for
  testing that the matching functions behave correctly in this case (they use
  default values). This modifier cannot be used with the <b>find_limits</b>
  modifier or when testing the substitution function.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION">THE
  ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</a></h1>
By default, <b>pcre2test</b> uses the standard PCRE2 matching function,
  <b>pcre2_match()</b> to match each subject line. PCRE2 also supports an
  alternative matching function, <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>, which operates in a
  different way, and has some restrictions. The differences between the two
  functions are described in the <b>pcre2matching</b> documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If the <b>dfa</b> modifier is set, the alternative matching function is used.
  This function finds all possible matches at a given point in the subject. If,
  however, the <b>dfa_shortest</b> modifier is set, processing stops after the
  first match is found. This is always the shortest possible match.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FROM_pcre2test"><a class="selflink" href="#DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FROM_pcre2test">DEFAULT
  OUTPUT FROM pcre2test</a></h1>
This section describes the output when the normal matching function,
  <b>pcre2_match()</b>, is being used.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a match succeeds, <b>pcre2test</b> outputs the list of captured substrings,
  starting with number 0 for the string that matched the whole pattern.
  Otherwise, it outputs &quot;No match&quot; when the return is
  PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH, or &quot;Partial match:&quot; followed by the partially
  matching substring when the return is PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. (Note that this is
  the entire substring that was inspected during the partial match; it may
  include characters before the actual match start if a lookbehind assertion,
  \K, \b, or \B was involved.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
For any other return, <b>pcre2test</b> outputs the PCRE2 negative error number
  and a short descriptive phrase. If the error is a failed UTF string check, the
  code unit offset of the start of the failing character is also output. Here is
  an example of an interactive <b>pcre2test</b> run.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 $ pcre2test
<br/>
 PCRE2 version 9.00 2014-05-10

<br/>

<br/>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Unset capturing substrings that are not followed by one that is set are not
  shown by <b>pcre2test</b> unless the <b>allcaptures</b> modifier is specified.
  In the following example, there are two capturing substrings, but when the
  first data line is matched, the second, unset substring is not shown. An
  &quot;internal&quot; unset substring is shown as &quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot;, as
  for the second data line.

If the strings contain any non-printing characters, they are output as \xhh
  escapes if the value is less than 256 and UTF mode is not set. Otherwise they
  are output as \x{hh...} escapes. See below for the definition of non-printing
  characters. If the <b>aftertext</b> modifier is set, the output for substring
  0 is followed by the the rest of the subject string, identified by
  &quot;0+&quot; like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /cat/aftertext
<br/>
 data&gt; cataract
<br/>
 0: cat
<br/>
 0+ aract
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If global matching is requested, the results of successive matching attempts are
  output in sequence, like this:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /\Bi(\w\w)/g
<br/>
 data&gt; Mississippi
<br/>
 0: iss
<br/>
 1: ss
<br/>
 0: iss
<br/>
 1: ss
<br/>
 0: ipp
<br/>
 1: pp
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;No match&quot; is output only if the first match attempt fails. Here is an
  example of a failure message (the offset 4 that is specified by the
  <b>offset</b> modifier is past the end of the subject string):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /xyz/
<br/>
 data&gt; xyz\=offset=4
<br/>
 Error -24 (bad offset value)
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that whereas patterns can be continued over several lines (a plain
  &quot;&gt;&quot; prompt is used for continuations), subject lines may not.
  However newlines can be included in a subject by means of the \n escape (or
  \r, \r\n, etc., depending on the newline sequence setting).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OUTPUT_FROM_THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION"><a class="selflink" href="#OUTPUT_FROM_THE_ALTERNATIVE_MATCHING_FUNCTION">OUTPUT
  FROM THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING FUNCTION</a></h1>
When the alternative matching function, <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>, is used, the
  output consists of a list of all the matches that start at the first point in
  the subject where there is at least one match. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/
<br/>
 data&gt; yellow tangerine\=dfa
<br/>
 0: tangerine
<br/>
 1: tang
<br/>
 2: tan
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Using the normal matching function on this data finds only &quot;tang&quot;. The
  longest matching string is always given first (and numbered zero). After a
  PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL return, the output is &quot;Partial match:&quot;, followed
  by the partially matching substring. Note that this is the entire substring
  that was inspected during the partial match; it may include characters before
  the actual match start if a lookbehind assertion, \b, or \B was involved. (\K
  is not supported for DFA matching.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
If global matching is requested, the search for further matches resumes at the
  end of the longest match. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /(tang|tangerine|tan)/g
<br/>
 data&gt; yellow tangerine and tangy sultana\=dfa
<br/>
 0: tangerine
<br/>
 1: tang
<br/>
 2: tan
<br/>
 0: tang
<br/>
 1: tan
<br/>
 0: tan
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The alternative matching function does not support substring capture, so the
  modifiers that are concerned with captured substrings are not relevant.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESTARTING_AFTER_A_PARTIAL_MATCH"><a class="selflink" href="#RESTARTING_AFTER_A_PARTIAL_MATCH">RESTARTING
  AFTER A PARTIAL MATCH</a></h1>
When the alternative matching function has given the PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL return,
  indicating that the subject partially matched the pattern, you can restart the
  match with additional subject data by means of the <b>dfa_restart</b>
  modifier. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br/>
 data&gt; 23ja\=P,dfa
<br/>
 Partial match: 23ja
<br/>
 data&gt; n05\=dfa,dfa_restart
<br/>
 0: n05
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For further information about partial matching, see the <b>pcre2partial</b>
  documentation.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CALLOUTS"><a class="selflink" href="#CALLOUTS">CALLOUTS</a></h1>
If the pattern contains any callout requests, <b>pcre2test</b>'s callout
  function is called during matching unless <b>callout_none</b> is specified.
  This works with both matching functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The callout function in <b>pcre2test</b> returns zero (carry on matching) by
  default, but you can use a <b>callout_fail</b> modifier in a subject line (as
  described above) to change this and other parameters of the callout.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inserting callouts can be helpful when using <b>pcre2test</b> to check
  complicated regular expressions. For further information about callouts, see
  the <b>pcre2callout</b> documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The output for callouts with numerical arguments and those with string arguments
  is slightly different.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Callouts_with_numerical_arguments"><a class="selflink" href="#Callouts_with_numerical_arguments">Callouts
  with numerical arguments</a></h2>
By default, the callout function displays the callout number, the start and
  current positions in the subject text at the callout time, and the next
  pattern item to be tested. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 ---&gt;pqrabcdef
<br/>
 0 ^ ^ \d
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
This output indicates that callout number 0 occurred for a match attempt
  starting at the fourth character of the subject string, when the pointer was
  at the seventh character, and when the next pattern item was \d. Just one
  circumflex is output if the start and current positions are the same, or if
  the current position precedes the start position, which can happen if the
  callout is in a lookbehind assertion.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Callouts numbered 255 are assumed to be automatic callouts, inserted as a result
  of the <b>/auto_callout</b> pattern modifier. In this case, instead of showing
  the callout number, the offset in the pattern, preceded by a plus, is output.
  For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /\d?[A-E]\*/auto_callout
<br/>
 data&gt; E*
<br/>
 ---&gt;E*
<br/>
 +0 ^ \d?
<br/>
 +3 ^ [A-E]
<br/>
 +8 ^^ \*
<br/>
 +10 ^ ^
<br/>
 0: E*
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If a pattern contains (*MARK) items, an additional line is output whenever a
  change of latest mark is passed to the callout function. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /a(*MARK:X)bc/auto_callout
<br/>
 data&gt; abc
<br/>
 ---&gt;abc
<br/>
 +0 ^ a
<br/>
 +1 ^^ (*MARK:X)
<br/>
 +10 ^^ b
<br/>
 Latest Mark: X
<br/>
 +11 ^ ^ c
<br/>
 +12 ^ ^
<br/>
 0: abc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The mark changes between matching &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, but stays the
  same for the rest of the match, so nothing more is output. If, as a result of
  backtracking, the mark reverts to being unset, the text
  &quot;&lt;unset&gt;&quot; is output.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Callouts_with_string_arguments"><a class="selflink" href="#Callouts_with_string_arguments">Callouts
  with string arguments</a></h2>
The output for a callout with a string argument is similar, except that instead
  of outputting a callout number before the position indicators, the callout
  string and its offset in the pattern string are output before the reflection
  of the subject string, and the subject string is reflected for each callout.
  For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 re&gt; /^ab(?C'first')cd(?C&quot;second&quot;)ef/
<br/>
 data&gt; abcdefg
<br/>
 Callout (7): 'first'
<br/>
 ---&gt;abcdefg
<br/>
 ^ ^ c
<br/>
 Callout (20): &quot;second&quot;
<br/>
 ---&gt;abcdefg
<br/>
 ^ ^ e
<br/>
 0: abcdef
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="NON-PRINTING_CHARACTERS"><a class="selflink" href="#NON-PRINTING_CHARACTERS">NON-PRINTING
  CHARACTERS</a></h1>
When <b>pcre2test</b> is outputting text in the compiled version of a pattern,
  bytes other than 32-126 are always treated as non-printing characters and are
  therefore shown as hex escapes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When <b>pcre2test</b> is outputting text that is a matched part of a subject
  string, it behaves in the same way, unless a different locale has been set for
  the pattern (using the <b>locale</b> modifier). In this case, the
  <b>isprint()</b> function is used to distinguish printing and non-printing
  characters.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SAVING_AND_RESTORING_COMPILED_PATTERNS"><a class="selflink" href="#SAVING_AND_RESTORING_COMPILED_PATTERNS">SAVING
  AND RESTORING COMPILED PATTERNS</a></h1>
It is possible to save compiled patterns on disc or elsewhere, and reload them
  later, subject to a number of restrictions. JIT data cannot be saved. The host
  on which the patterns are reloaded must be running the same version of PCRE2,
  with the same code unit width, and must also have the same endianness, pointer
  width and PCRE2_SIZE type. Before compiled patterns can be saved they must be
  serialized, that is, converted to a stream of bytes. A single byte stream may
  contain any number of compiled patterns, but they must all use the same
  character tables. A single copy of the tables is included in the byte stream
  (its size is 1088 bytes).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The functions whose names begin with <b>pcre2_serialize_</b> are used for
  serializing and de-serializing. They are described in the
  <b>pcre2serialize</b> documentation. In this section we describe the features
  of <b>pcre2test</b> that can be used to test these functions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a pattern with <b>push</b> modifier is successfully compiled, it is pushed
  onto a stack of compiled patterns, and <b>pcre2test</b> expects the next line
  to contain a new pattern (or command) instead of a subject line. By contrast,
  the <b>pushcopy</b> modifier causes a copy of the compiled pattern to be
  stacked, leaving the original available for immediate matching. By using
  <b>push</b> and/or <b>pushcopy</b>, a number of patterns can be compiled and
  retained. These modifiers are incompatible with <b>posix</b>, and control
  modifiers that act at match time are ignored (with a message) for the stacked
  patterns. The <b>jitverify</b> modifier applies only at compile time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #save &lt;filename&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
causes all the stacked patterns to be serialized and the result written to the
  named file. Afterwards, all the stacked patterns are freed. The command
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #load &lt;filename&gt;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
reads the data in the file, and then arranges for it to be de-serialized, with
  the resulting compiled patterns added to the pattern stack. The pattern on the
  top of the stack can be retrieved by the #pop command, which must be followed
  by lines of subjects that are to be matched with the pattern, terminated as
  usual by an empty line or end of file. This command may be followed by a
  modifier list containing only control modifiers that act after a pattern has
  been compiled. In particular, <b>hex</b>, <b>posix</b>, <b>posix_nosub</b>,
  <b>push</b>, and <b>pushcopy</b> are not allowed, nor are any option-setting
  modifiers. The JIT modifiers are, however permitted. Here is an example that
  saves and reloads two patterns.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 /abc/push
<br/>
 /xyz/push
<br/>
 #save tempfile
<br/>
 #load tempfile
<br/>
 #pop info
<br/>
 xyz
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 #pop jit,bincode
<br/>
 abc
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If <b>jitverify</b> is used with #pop, it does not automatically imply
  <b>jit</b>, which is different behaviour from when it is used on a pattern.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The #popcopy command is analagous to the <b>pushcopy</b> modifier in that it
  makes current a copy of the topmost stack pattern, leaving the original still
  on the stack.
