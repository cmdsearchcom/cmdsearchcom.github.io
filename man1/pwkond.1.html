<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pwkond - peak word condensation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pwkond [OPTIONS] &lt;Name&gt; [&lt;Name&gt; ...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
After the irreducible constituents of a module, or a number
of modules, have been found with chop(1), this program can
be used:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; to calulate peak
words for the constituents,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; to condense the
module using the peak words,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; to transform the
generators on the constituents to the standard basis as
defined by the peak word kernel, and</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; to calculate a
basis reflecting the direct decomposition of the module, if
the module is semisimple.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By definition, a &quot;peak
word&quot; for the ith constituent is an algebra element
which has minimal nullity on the ith constituent and which
operates regularly (i.e., with nullity 0) on <br>
the other constituents. Also for identifying words (see
chop(1)), the nullity of a peak word on its constituent is
equal to the degree of the splitting field for that
con&acirc; <br>
stituent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When more than one module is
specified on the command line, the peak words found by
pwkond are &quot;global&quot;, i.e., each peak word selects
exactly one of the constituents of each mod&acirc; <br>
ule. Running pwkond successively on two modules does not
generally produce global peak words, since a peak word found
for module M may have a non-zero nullity on a different <br>
constituent that occurs in another module N but not in
M.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -e option can be used to
exclude certain words from the search. List is a list of
integers or ranges of integers, for example &quot;-e
57,82-112,289&quot;. Using -i, you can specify <br>
a list of words which will be tested first. This can
significantly reduce computation time if you already know
one or more peak words for a given module. The -n option
disables <br>
the condensation phase. If this option is used, the program
stops after the peak words have been found. If the -t option
is specified, pwkond transforms the generators of all <br>
irreducible constituents to the standard basis defined by
the peak word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each composition factor
there are several output files. If, for example, one
composition factor is X10a, pwkond will produce the
following files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X10a.std.1 and X10a.std.1 <br>
The operation of the generators on the constituent with
respect to the standard basis defined by the peak word.
These files are created only if the -t option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X10a.op <br>
Spin-up script for the standard basis. See zsb(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X10a.1k and X10a.2k <br>
The action of the generators on the condensed module.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X10a.np <br>
Condensed peak word. This is a nilpotent matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X10a.im <br>
Image of the peak word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">X10a.k Kernel of the peak
word.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The .cfinfo file is written each
time a peak word is found. So, if the program does not
terminate or dies unexpectedly the information about the
peak words found so far is not <br>
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the module is semisimple,
pwkond can calculate a basis that respects the decomposition
into irreducible constituents. With respect to this basis,
the generators are in block <br>
diagonal form, where the blocks occur in the order
determined by chop(1). All blocks corresponding to the same
constituent are equal, not only equivalent, and the blocks
occur <br>
in their &quot;natural&quot; order (as defined by chop(1)).
This is essential for the tensor condensation procedure (see
precond(1)). To calculate the semisimplicity basis, use the
-b <br>
option. The basis is written to Name.ssb. Using -b with a
module that is not semisimple produces undefined results.
Most probably, pwkond will stop with the error message
&quot;row <br>
index out of range&quot;, or it will write a singular matrix
to Name.ssb.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-Q Quiet, no messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Verbose, more messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T &lt;MaxTime&gt; <br>
Set CPU time limit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-G Produce output in GAP format.
This option implies -Q.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Find peak words only; do not
condense.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Use full polynomials in peak
word search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i &lt;List&gt; <br>
Words to try first; e.g., -i 100,20-35.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e &lt;List&gt; <br>
Exclude words from search; e.g., -e 3,20-99.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Transform generators into
standard basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Calculate a semisimplicity
basis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Compute kernel of peak
words.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS <br>
Internally, a peak word is represented by a pair (n,p) where
n is the canonical number of the word (see zmw(1)), and p is
a polynomial. The peak word represented by this pair is <br>
p(Wn), Wn being the nth word. Without -p, pwkond considers
only linear polynomials. If the -p option is used, pwkond
can find polynomials of any degree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Whenever a peak word is found,
the generalized condensation is calculated as follows: The
peakword is caculated as a matrix acting on V, which is then
repeatedly raised to higher <br>
powers until the nullity stabilizes. The stable nullity
equals the multiplicity k of the constituent times the
degree [E:F] of the splitting field extension. Having a
power w^N <br>
of the peakword with stable nullity, the condensation onto
its kernel, i.e., the projection of V onto V/w^N(V), is
determined in the same way as in the zqt(1) program.</p>
