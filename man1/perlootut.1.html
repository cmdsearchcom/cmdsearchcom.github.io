<p>PERLOOTUT(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERLOOTUT(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perlootut - Object-Oriented Programming in Perl Tutorial</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DATE <br>
This document was created in February, 2011.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document provides an introduction to object-oriented
programming in Perl. It begins with a brief overview of the
concepts behind object oriented design. Then it introduces
<br>
several different OO systems from CPAN
&lt;http://search.cpan.org&gt; which build on top of what
Perl provides.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, Perl&rsquo;s
built-in OO system is very minimal, leaving you to do most
of the work. This minimalism made a lot of sense in 1994,
but in the years since Perl 5.0 we&rsquo;ve seen <br>
a number of common patterns emerge in Perl OO. Fortunately,
Perl&rsquo;s flexibility has allowed a rich ecosystem of
Perl OO systems to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to know how Perl OO
works under the hood, the perlobj document explains the
nitty gritty details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This document assumes that you
already understand the basics of Perl syntax, variable
types, operators, and subroutine calls. If you don&rsquo;t
understand these concepts yet, please <br>
read perlintro first. You should also read the perlsyn,
perlop, and perlsub documents.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OBJECT-ORIENTED FUNDAMENTALS
<br>
Most object systems share a number of common concepts.
You&rsquo;ve probably heard terms like &quot;class&quot;,
&quot;object, &quot;method&quot;, and &quot;attribute&quot;
before. Understanding the concepts will make <br>
it much easier to read and write object-oriented code. If
you&rsquo;re already familiar with these terms, you should
still skim this section, since it explains each concept in
terms of <br>
Perl&rsquo;s OO implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s OO system is
class-based. Class-based OO is fairly common. It&rsquo;s
used by Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, and many other
languages. There are other object orientation paradigms <br>
as well. JavaScript is the most popular language to use
another paradigm. JavaScript&rsquo;s OO system is
prototype-based.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object <br>
An object is a data structure that bundles together data and
subroutines which operate on that data. An object&rsquo;s
data is called attributes, and its subroutines are called
<br>
methods. An object can be thought of as a noun (a person, a
web service, a computer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An object represents a single
discrete thing. For example, an object might represent a
file. The attributes for a file object might include its
path, content, and last <br>
modification time. If we created an object to represent
/etc/hostname on a machine named
&quot;foo.example.com&quot;, that object&rsquo;s path would
be &quot;/etc/hostname&quot;, its content would be <br>
&quot;foo0, and it&rsquo;s last modification time would be
1304974868 seconds since the beginning of the epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The methods associated with a
file might include &quot;rename()&quot; and
&quot;write()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl most objects are hashes,
but the OO systems we recommend keep you from having to
worry about this. In practice, it&rsquo;s best to consider
an object&rsquo;s internal data structure <br>
opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Class <br>
A class defines the behavior of a category of objects. A
class is a name for a category (like &quot;File&quot;), and
a class also defines the behavior of objects in that
category.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All objects belong to a specific
class. For example, our /etc/hostname object belongs to the
&quot;File&quot; class. When we want to create a specific
object, we start with its class, and <br>
construct or instantiate an object. A specific object is
often referred to as an instance of a class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl, any package can be a
class. The difference between a package which is a class and
one which isn&rsquo;t is based on how the package is used.
Here&rsquo;s our &quot;class declaration&quot; for <br>
the &quot;File&quot; class:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl, there is no special
keyword for constructing an object. However, most OO modules
on CPAN use a method named &quot;new()&quot; to construct a
new object:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $hostname = File-&gt;new(
<br>
path =&gt; &rsquo;/etc/hostname&rsquo;, <br>
content =&gt; &quot;foo0, <br>
last_mod_time =&gt; 1304974868, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Don&rsquo;t worry about that
&quot;-&gt;&quot; operator, it will be explained later.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blessing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As we said earlier, most Perl
objects are hashes, but an object can be an instance of any
Perl data type (scalar, array, etc.). Turning a plain data
structure into an object is <br>
done by blessing that data structure using Perl&rsquo;s
&quot;bless&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While we strongly suggest you
don&rsquo;t build your objects from scratch, you should know
the term bless. A blessed data structure (aka &quot;a
referent&quot;) is an object. We sometimes say <br>
that an object has been &quot;blessed into a
class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once a referent has been
blessed, the &quot;blessed&quot; function from the
Scalar::Util core module can tell us its class name. This
subroutine returns an object&rsquo;s class when passed an
<br>
object, and false otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use Scalar::Util
&rsquo;blessed&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print blessed($hash); # undef
<br>
print blessed($hostname); # File</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Constructor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A constructor creates a new
object. In Perl, a class&rsquo;s constructor is just another
method, unlike some other languages, which provide syntax
for constructors. Most Perl classes <br>
use &quot;new&quot; as the name for their constructor:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $file =
File-&gt;new(...);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Methods <br>
You already learned that a method is a subroutine that
operates on an object. You can think of a method as the
things that an object can do. If an object is a noun, then
methods <br>
are its verbs (save, print, open).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In Perl, methods are simply
subroutines that live in a class&rsquo;s package. Methods
are always written to receive the object as their first
argument:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;This file is at
&quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$file-&gt;print_info; <br>
# The file is at /etc/hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What makes a method special is
how it&rsquo;s called. The arrow operator
(&quot;-&gt;&quot;) tells Perl that we are calling a
method.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When we make a method call, Perl
arranges for the method&rsquo;s invocant to be passed as the
first argument. Invocant is a fancy name for the thing on
the left side of the arrow. The <br>
invocant can either be a class name or an object. We can
also pass additional arguments to the method:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
my $prefix = shift // &quot;This file is at &quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print $prefix, &quot;, &quot;,
$self-&gt;path, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$file-&gt;print_info(&quot;The
file is located at &quot;); <br>
# The file is located at /etc/hostname</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes <br>
Each class can define its attributes. When we instantiate an
object, we assign values to those attributes. For example,
every &quot;File&quot; object has a path. Attributes are
sometimes <br>
called properties.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl has no special syntax for
attributes. Under the hood, attributes are often stored as
keys in the object&rsquo;s underlying hash, but don&rsquo;t
worry about this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We recommend that you only
access attributes via accessor methods. These are methods
that can get or set the value of each attribute. We saw this
earlier in the &quot;print_info()&quot; <br>
example, which calls &quot;$self-&gt;path&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You might also see the terms
getter and setter. These are two types of accessors. A
getter gets the attribute&rsquo;s value, while a setter sets
it. Another term for a setter is <br>
mutator</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Attributes are typically defined
as read-only or read-write. Read-only attributes can only be
set when the object is first created, while read-write
attributes can be altered at <br>
any time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The value of an attribute may
itself be another object. For example, instead of returning
its last mod time as a number, the &quot;File&quot; class
could return a DateTime object <br>
representing that value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s possible to have a
class that does not expose any publicly settable attributes.
Not every class has attributes and methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polymorphism <br>
Polymorphism is a fancy way of saying that objects from two
different classes share an API. For example, we could have
&quot;File&quot; and &quot;WebPage&quot; classes which both
have a <br>
&quot;print_content()&quot; method. This method might
produce different output for each class, but they share a
common interface.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the two classes may differ
in many ways, when it comes to the
&quot;print_content()&quot; method, they are the same. This
means that we can try to call the
&quot;print_content()&quot; method <br>
on an object of either class, and we don&rsquo;t have to
know what class the object belongs to!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Polymorphism is one of the key
concepts of object-oriented design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inheritance <br>
Inheritance lets you create a specialized version of an
existing class. Inheritance lets the new class to reuse the
methods and attributes of another class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, we could create an
&quot;File::MP3&quot; class which inherits from
&quot;File&quot;. An &quot;File::MP3&quot; is-a more
specific type of &quot;File&quot;. All mp3 files are files,
but not all files are <br>
mp3 files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We often refer to inheritance
relationships as parent-child or
&quot;superclass/subclass&quot; relationships. Sometimes we
say that the child has an is-a relationship with its parent
<br>
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;File&quot; is a superclass
of &quot;File::MP3&quot;, and &quot;File::MP3&quot; is a
subclass of &quot;File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File::MP3;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use parent
&rsquo;File&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The parent module is one of
several ways that Perl lets you define inheritance
relationships.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl allows multiple
inheritance, which means that a class can inherit from
multiple parents. While this is possible, we strongly
recommend against it. Generally, you can use <br>
roles to do everything you can do with multiple inheritance,
but in a cleaner way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that there&rsquo;s nothing
wrong with defining multiple subclasses of a given class.
This is both common and safe. For example, we might define
&quot;File::MP3::FixedBitrate&quot; and <br>
&quot;File::MP3::VariableBitrate&quot; classes to
distinguish between different types of mp3 file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overriding methods and method
resolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Inheritance allows two classes
to share code. By default, every method in the parent class
is also available in the child. The child can explicitly
override a parent&rsquo;s method to <br>
provide its own implementation. For example, if we have an
&quot;File::MP3&quot; object, it has the
&quot;print_info()&quot; method from &quot;File&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $cage = File::MP3-&gt;new(
<br>
path =&gt; &rsquo;mp3s/My-Body-Is-a-Cage.mp3&rsquo;, <br>
content =&gt; $mp3_data, <br>
last_mod_time =&gt; 1304974868, <br>
title =&gt; &rsquo;My Body Is a Cage&rsquo;, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$cage-&gt;print_info; <br>
# The file is at mp3s/My-Body-Is-a-Cage.mp3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If we wanted to include the
mp3&rsquo;s title in the greeting, we could override the
method:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File::MP3;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use parent
&rsquo;File&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;This file is at
&quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;0; <br>
print &quot;Its title is &quot;, $self-&gt;title, &quot;0;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$cage-&gt;print_info; <br>
# The file is at mp3s/My-Body-Is-a-Cage.mp3 <br>
# Its title is My Body Is a Cage</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The process of determining what
method should be used is called method resolution. What Perl
does is look at the object&rsquo;s class first
(&quot;File::MP3&quot; in this case). If that class <br>
defines the method, then that class&rsquo;s version of the
method is called. If not, Perl looks at each parent class in
turn. For &quot;File::MP3&quot;, its only parent is
&quot;File&quot;. If &quot;File::MP3&quot; <br>
does not define the method, but &quot;File&quot; does, then
Perl calls the method in &quot;File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If &quot;File&quot; inherited
from &quot;DataSource&quot;, which inherited from
&quot;Thing&quot;, then Perl would keep looking &quot;up the
chain&quot; if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to explicitly
call a parent method from a child:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File::MP3;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use parent
&rsquo;File&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$self-&gt;SUPER::print_info();
<br>
print &quot;Its title is &quot;, $self-&gt;title, &quot;0;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;SUPER::&quot; bit
tells Perl to look for the &quot;print_info()&quot; in the
&quot;File::MP3&quot; class&rsquo;s inheritance chain. When
it finds the parent class that implements this method, the
method <br>
is called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We mentioned multiple
inheritance earlier. The main problem with multiple
inheritance is that it greatly complicates method
resolution. See perlobj for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encapsulation <br>
Encapsulation is the idea that an object is opaque. When
another developer uses your class, they don&rsquo;t need to
know how it is implemented, they just need to know what it
does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Encapsulation is important for
several reasons. First, it allows you to separate the public
API from the private implementation. This means you can
change that implementation <br>
without breaking the API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Second, when classes are well
encapsulated, they become easier to subclass. Ideally, a
subclass uses the same APIs to access object data that its
parent class uses. In reality, <br>
subclassing sometimes involves violating encapsulation, but
a good API can minimize the need to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We mentioned earlier that most
Perl objects are implemented as hashes under the hood. The
principle of encapsulation tells us that we should not rely
on this. Instead, we should <br>
use accessor methods to access the data in that hash. The
object systems that we recommend below all automate the
generation of accessor methods. If you use one of them, you
<br>
should never have to access the object as a hash
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Composition <br>
In object-oriented code, we often find that one object
references another object. This is called composition, or a
has-a relationship.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier, we mentioned that the
&quot;File&quot; class&rsquo;s &quot;last_mod_time&quot;
accessor could return a DateTime object. This is a perfect
example of composition. We could go even further, and <br>
make the &quot;path&quot; and &quot;content&quot; accessors
return objects as well. The &quot;File&quot; class would
then be composed of several other objects.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Roles <br>
Roles are something that a class does, rather than something
that it is. Roles are relatively new to Perl, but have
become rather popular. Roles are applied to classes.
Sometimes <br>
we say that classes consume roles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Roles are an alternative to
inheritance for providing polymorphism. Let&rsquo;s assume
we have two classes, &quot;Radio&quot; and
&quot;Computer&quot;. Both of these things have on/off
switches. We want <br>
to model that in our class definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We could have both classes
inherit from a common parent, like &quot;Machine&quot;, but
not all machines have on/off switches. We could create a
parent class called &quot;HasOnOffSwitch&quot;, but <br>
that is very artificial. Radios and computers are not
specializations of this parent. This parent is really a
rather ridiculous creation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is where roles come in. It
makes a lot of sense to create a &quot;HasOnOffSwitch&quot;
role and apply it to both classes. This role would define a
known API like providing &quot;turn_on()&quot; <br>
and &quot;turn_off()&quot; methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl does not have any built-in
way to express roles. In the past, people just bit the
bullet and used multiple inheritance. Nowadays, there are
several good choices on CPAN for <br>
using roles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When to Use OO <br>
Object Orientation is not the best solution to every
problem. In Perl Best Practices (copyright 2004, Published
by O&rsquo;Reilly Media, Inc.), Damian Conway provides a
list of <br>
criteria to use when deciding if OO is the right fit for
your problem:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The system being
designed is large, or is likely to become large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The data can be
aggregated into obvious structures, especially if
there&rsquo;s a large amount of data in each aggregate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The various
types of data aggregate form a natural hierarchy that
facilitates the use of inheritance and polymorphism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You have a piece
of data on which many different operations are applied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; You need to
perform the same general operations on related types of
data, but with slight variations depending on the specific
type of data the operations are applied to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; It&rsquo;s
likely you&rsquo;ll have to add new data types later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The typical
interactions between pieces of data are best represented by
operators.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
implementation of individual components of the system is
likely to change over time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The system
design is already object-oriented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Large numbers of
other programmers will be using your code modules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERL OO SYSTEMS <br>
As we mentioned before, Perl&rsquo;s built-in OO system is
very minimal, but also quite flexible. Over the years, many
people have developed systems which build on top of
Perl&rsquo;s built- <br>
in system to provide more features and convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We strongly recommend that you
use one of these systems. Even the most minimal of them
eliminates a lot of repetitive boilerplate. There&rsquo;s
really no good reason to write your <br>
classes from scratch in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are interested in the
guts underlying these systems, check out perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Moose <br>
Moose bills itself as a &quot;postmodern object system for
Perl 5&quot;. Don&rsquo;t be scared, the
&quot;postmodern&quot; label is a callback to Larry&rsquo;s
description of Perl as &quot;the first postmodern <br>
computer language&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; provides a
complete, modern OO system. Its biggest influence is the
Common Lisp Object System, but it also borrows ideas from
Smalltalk and several other languages. <br>
&quot;Moose&quot; was created by Stevan Little, and draws
heavily from his work on the Perl 6 OO design.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is our &quot;File&quot;
class using &quot;Moose&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File; <br>
use Moose;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has path =&gt; ( is =&gt;
&rsquo;ro&rsquo; ); <br>
has content =&gt; ( is =&gt; &rsquo;ro&rsquo; ); <br>
has last_mod_time =&gt; ( is =&gt; &rsquo;ro&rsquo; );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;This file is at
&quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; provides a
number of features:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Declarative
sugar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; provides a
layer of declarative &quot;sugar&quot; for defining classes.
That sugar is just a set of exported functions that make
declaring how your class works simpler and <br>
more palatable. This lets you describe what your class is,
rather than having to tell Perl how to implement your
class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;has()&quot; subroutine
declares an attribute, and &quot;Moose&quot; automatically
creates accessors for these attributes. It also takes care
of creating a &quot;new()&quot; method for you. This <br>
constructor knows about the attributes you declared, so you
can set them when creating a new &quot;File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Roles
built-in</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; lets you
define roles the same way you define classes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package HasOnOfSwitch; <br>
use Moose::Role;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has is_on =&gt; ( <br>
is =&gt; &rsquo;rw&rsquo;, <br>
isa =&gt; &rsquo;Bool&rsquo;, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub turn_on { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
$self-&gt;is_on(1); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub turn_off { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
$self-&gt;is_on(0); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A miniature type
system</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the example above, you can
see that we passed &quot;isa =&gt; &rsquo;Bool&rsquo;&quot;
to &quot;has()&quot; when creating our &quot;is_on&quot;
attribute. This tells &quot;Moose&quot; that this attribute
must be a boolean <br>
value. If we try to set it to an invalid value, our code
will throw an error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Full
introspection and manipulation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s built-in
introspection features are fairly minimal. &quot;Moose&quot;
builds on top of them and creates a full introspection layer
for your classes. This lets you ask questions <br>
like &quot;what methods does the File class implement?&quot;
It also lets you modify your classes programmatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Self-hosted and
extensible</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; describes
itself using its own introspection API. Besides being a cool
trick, this means that you can extend &quot;Moose&quot;
using &quot;Moose&quot; itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Rich
ecosystem</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a rich ecosystem of
&quot;Moose&quot; extensions on CPAN under the MooseX
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/search?query=MooseX&amp;mode=dist&gt;
namespace. In addition, many modules on CPAN <br>
already use &quot;Moose&quot;, providing you with lots of
examples to learn from.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many more
features</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; is a very
powerful tool, and we can&rsquo;t cover all of its features
here. We encourage you to learn more by reading the
&quot;Moose&quot; documentation, starting with Moose::Manual
<br>
&lt;http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Manual&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course, &quot;Moose&quot;
isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; can make your
code slower to load. &quot;Moose&quot; itself is not small,
and it does a lot of code generation when you define your
class. This code generation means that your <br>
runtime code is as fast as it can be, but you pay for this
when your modules are first loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This load time hit can be a
problem when startup speed is important, such as with a
command-line script or a &quot;plain vanilla&quot; CGI
script that must be loaded each time it is <br>
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before you panic, know that many
people do use &quot;Moose&quot; for command-line tools and
other startup-sensitive code. We encourage you to try
&quot;Moose&quot; out first before worrying about <br>
startup speed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; also has
several dependencies on other modules. Most of these are
small stand-alone modules, a number of which have been spun
off from &quot;Moose&quot;. &quot;Moose&quot; itself, and
some <br>
of its dependencies, require a compiler. If you need to
install your software on a system without a compiler, or if
having any dependencies is a problem, then &quot;Moose&quot;
may not be <br>
right for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Mouse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you try &quot;Moose&quot; and
find that one of these issues is preventing you from using
&quot;Moose&quot;, we encourage you to consider Mouse next.
&quot;Mouse&quot; implements a subset of
&quot;Moose&quot;&rsquo;s <br>
functionality in a simpler package. For all features that it
does implement, the end-user API is identical to
&quot;Moose&quot;, meaning you can switch from
&quot;Mouse&quot; to &quot;Moose&quot; quite <br>
easily.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Mouse&quot; does not
implement most of &quot;Moose&quot;&rsquo;s introspection
API, so it&rsquo;s often faster when loading your modules.
Additionally, all of its required dependencies ship with the
Perl <br>
core, and it can run without a compiler. If you do have a
compiler, &quot;Mouse&quot; will use it to compile some of
its code for a speed boost.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, it ships with a
&quot;Mouse::Tiny&quot; module that takes most of
&quot;Mouse&quot;&rsquo;s features and bundles them up in a
single module file. You can copy this module file into your
<br>
application&rsquo;s library directory for easy bundling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Moose&quot; authors
hope that one day &quot;Mouse&quot; can be made obsolete by
improving &quot;Moose&quot; enough, but for now it provides
a worthwhile alternative to &quot;Moose&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Class::Accessor <br>
Class::Accessor is the polar opposite of &quot;Moose&quot;.
It provides very few features, nor is it self-hosting.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is, however, very simple,
pure Perl, and it has no non-core dependencies. It also
provides a &quot;Moose-like&quot; API on demand for the
features it supports.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though it doesn&rsquo;t do
much, it is still preferable to writing your own classes
from scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s our
&quot;File&quot; class with &quot;Class::Accessor&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File; <br>
use Class::Accessor &rsquo;antlers&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">has path =&gt; ( is =&gt;
&rsquo;ro&rsquo; ); <br>
has content =&gt; ( is =&gt; &rsquo;ro&rsquo; ); <br>
has last_mod_time =&gt; ( is =&gt; &rsquo;ro&rsquo; );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;This file is at
&quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;antlers&quot; import
flag tells &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; that you want to
define your attributes using &quot;Moose&quot;-like syntax.
The only parameter that you can pass to &quot;has&quot; is
&quot;is&quot;. We <br>
recommend that you use this Moose-like syntax if you choose
&quot;Class::Accessor&quot; since it means you will have a
smoother upgrade path if you later decide to move to
&quot;Moose&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like &quot;Moose&quot;,
&quot;Class::Accessor&quot; generates accessor methods and a
constructor for your class.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Object::Tiny <br>
Finally, we have Object::Tiny. This module truly lives up to
its name. It has an incredibly minimal API and absolutely no
dependencies (core or not). Still, we think it&rsquo;s a lot
<br>
easier to use than writing your own OO code from
scratch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s our
&quot;File&quot; class once more:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package File; <br>
use Object::Tiny qw( path content last_mod_time );</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sub print_info { <br>
my $self = shift;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">print &quot;This file is at
&quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With &quot;Object::Tiny&quot;,
all accessors are read-only. It generates a constructor for
you, as well as the accessors you define.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Role::Tiny <br>
As we mentioned before, roles provide an alternative to
inheritance, but Perl does not have any built-in role
support. If you choose to use Moose, it comes with a
full-fledged <br>
role implementation. However, if you use one of our other
recommended OO modules, you can still use roles with
Role::Tiny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Role::Tiny&quot; provides
some of the same features as Moose&rsquo;s role system, but
in a much smaller package. Most notably, it doesn&rsquo;t
support any sort of attribute declaration, so you <br>
have to do that by hand. Still, it&rsquo;s useful, and works
well with &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; and
&quot;Object::Tiny&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OO System Summary <br>
Here&rsquo;s a brief recap of the options we covered:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Moose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Moose&quot; is the maximal
option. It has a lot of features, a big ecosystem, and a
thriving user base. We also covered Mouse briefly.
&quot;Mouse&quot; is &quot;Moose&quot; lite, and a
reasonable <br>
alternative when Moose doesn&rsquo;t work for your
application.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Class::Accessor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Class::Accessor&quot; does
a lot less than &quot;Moose&quot;, and is a nice alternative
if you find &quot;Moose&quot; overwhelming. It&rsquo;s been
around a long time and is well battle-tested. It also <br>
has a minimal &quot;Moose&quot; compatibility mode which
makes moving from &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; to
&quot;Moose&quot; easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Object::Tiny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Object::Tiny&quot; is the
absolute minimal option. It has no dependencies, and almost
no syntax to learn. It&rsquo;s a good option for a super
minimal environment and for throwing <br>
something together quickly without having to worry about
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Role::Tiny</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use &quot;Role::Tiny&quot; with
&quot;Class::Accessor&quot; or &quot;Object::Tiny&quot; if
you find yourself considering multiple inheritance. If you
go with &quot;Moose&quot;, it comes with its own role <br>
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other OO Systems <br>
There are literally dozens of other OO-related modules on
CPAN besides those covered here, and you&rsquo;re likely to
run across one or more of them if you work with other
people&rsquo;s <br>
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, plenty of code in
the wild does all of its OO &quot;by hand&quot;, using just
the Perl built-in OO features. If you need to maintain such
code, you should read perlobj to <br>
understand exactly how Perl&rsquo;s built-in OO works.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONCLUSION <br>
As we said before, Perl&rsquo;s minimal OO system has led to
a profusion of OO systems on CPAN. While you can still drop
down to the bare metal and write your classes by hand,
there&rsquo;s <br>
really no reason to do that with modern Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For small systems, Object::Tiny
and Class::Accessor both provide minimal object systems that
take care of basic boilerplate for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For bigger projects, Moose
provides a rich set of features that will let you focus on
implementing your business logic.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">We encourage you to play with
and evaluate Moose, Class::Accessor, and Object::Tiny to see
which OO system is right for you.</p>
