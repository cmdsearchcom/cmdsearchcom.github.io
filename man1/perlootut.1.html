perlootut - Object-Oriented Programming in Perl Tutorial
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DATE"><a class="selflink" href="#DATE">DATE</a></h1>
This document was created in February, 2011.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document provides an introduction to object-oriented programming in Perl.
  It begins with a brief overview of the concepts behind object oriented design.
  Then it introduces several different OO systems from CPAN
  &lt;http://search.cpan.org&gt; which build on top of what Perl provides.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, Perl's built-in OO system is very minimal, leaving you to do most of
  the work. This minimalism made a lot of sense in 1994, but in the years since
  Perl 5.0 we've seen a number of common patterns emerge in Perl OO.
  Fortunately, Perl's flexibility has allowed a rich ecosystem of Perl OO
  systems to flourish.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you want to know how Perl OO works under the hood, the perlobj document
  explains the nitty gritty details.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This document assumes that you already understand the basics of Perl syntax,
  variable types, operators, and subroutine calls. If you don't understand these
  concepts yet, please read perlintro first. You should also read the perlsyn,
  perlop, and perlsub documents.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OBJECT-ORIENTED_FUNDAMENTALS"><a class="selflink" href="#OBJECT-ORIENTED_FUNDAMENTALS">OBJECT-ORIENTED
  FUNDAMENTALS</a></h1>
Most object systems share a number of common concepts. You've probably heard
  terms like &quot;class&quot;, &quot;object, &quot;method&quot;, and
  &quot;attribute&quot; before. Understanding the concepts will make it much
  easier to read and write object-oriented code. If you're already familiar with
  these terms, you should still skim this section, since it explains each
  concept in terms of Perl's OO implementation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl's OO system is class-based. Class-based OO is fairly common. It's used by
  Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, and many other languages. There are other object
  orientation paradigms as well. JavaScript is the most popular language to use
  another paradigm. JavaScript's OO system is prototype-based.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Object"><a class="selflink" href="#Object">Object</a></h2>
An <b>object</b> is a data structure that bundles together data and subroutines
  which operate on that data. An object's data is called <b>attributes</b>, and
  its subroutines are called <b>methods</b>. An object can be thought of as a
  noun (a person, a web service, a computer).
<div class="Pp"></div>
An object represents a single discrete thing. For example, an object might
  represent a file. The attributes for a file object might include its path,
  content, and last modification time. If we created an object to represent
  <i>/etc/hostname</i> on a machine named &quot;foo.example.com&quot;, that
  object's path would be &quot;/etc/hostname&quot;, its content would be
  &quot;foo\n&quot;, and it's last modification time would be 1304974868 seconds
  since the beginning of the epoch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The methods associated with a file might include &quot;rename()&quot; and
  &quot;write()&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Perl most objects are hashes, but the OO systems we recommend keep you from
  having to worry about this. In practice, it's best to consider an object's
  internal data structure opaque.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Class"><a class="selflink" href="#Class">Class</a></h2>
A <b>class</b> defines the behavior of a category of objects. A class is a name
  for a category (like &quot;File&quot;), and a class also defines the behavior
  of objects in that category.
<div class="Pp"></div>
All objects belong to a specific class. For example, our <i>/etc/hostname</i>
  object belongs to the &quot;File&quot; class. When we want to create a
  specific object, we start with its class, and <b>construct</b> or
  <b>instantiate</b> an object. A specific object is often referred to as an
  <b>instance</b> of a class.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Perl, any package can be a class. The difference between a package which is a
  class and one which isn't is based on how the package is used. Here's our
  &quot;class declaration&quot; for the &quot;File&quot; class:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File;
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Perl, there is no special keyword for constructing an object. However, most
  OO modules on CPAN use a method named &quot;new()&quot; to construct a new
  object:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $hostname = File-&gt;new(
      path          =&gt; '/etc/hostname',
      content       =&gt; &quot;foo\n&quot;,
      last_mod_time =&gt; 1304974868,
  );
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
(Don't worry about that &quot;-&gt;&quot; operator, it will be explained later.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Blessing</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As we said earlier, most Perl objects are hashes, but an object can be an
  instance of any Perl data type (scalar, array, etc.). Turning a plain data
  structure into an object is done by <b>blessing</b> that data structure using
  Perl's &quot;bless&quot; function.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While we strongly suggest you don't build your objects from scratch, you should
  know the term <b>bless</b>. A <b>blessed</b> data structure (aka &quot;a
  referent&quot;) is an object. We sometimes say that an object has been
  &quot;blessed into a class&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Once a referent has been blessed, the &quot;blessed&quot; function from the
  Scalar::Util core module can tell us its class name. This subroutine returns
  an object's class when passed an object, and false otherwise.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  use Scalar::Util 'blessed';
  print blessed($hash);      # undef
  print blessed($hostname);  # File
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Constructor</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
A <b>constructor</b> creates a new object. In Perl, a class's constructor is
  just another method, unlike some other languages, which provide syntax for
  constructors. Most Perl classes use &quot;new&quot; as the name for their
  constructor:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $file = File-&gt;new(...);
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Methods"><a class="selflink" href="#Methods">Methods</a></h2>
You already learned that a <b>method</b> is a subroutine that operates on an
  object. You can think of a method as the things that an object can <i>do</i>.
  If an object is a noun, then methods are its verbs (save, print, open).
<div class="Pp"></div>
In Perl, methods are simply subroutines that live in a class's package. Methods
  are always written to receive the object as their first argument:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  sub print_info {
      my $self = shift;
      print &quot;This file is at &quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
  $file-&gt;print_info;
  # The file is at /etc/hostname
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
What makes a method special is <i>how it's called</i>. The arrow operator
  (&quot;-&gt;&quot;) tells Perl that we are calling a method.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When we make a method call, Perl arranges for the method's <b>invocant</b> to be
  passed as the first argument. <b>Invocant</b> is a fancy name for the thing on
  the left side of the arrow. The invocant can either be a class name or an
  object. We can also pass additional arguments to the method:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  sub print_info {
      my $self   = shift;
      my $prefix = shift // &quot;This file is at &quot;;
      print $prefix, &quot;, &quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
  $file-&gt;print_info(&quot;The file is located at &quot;);
  # The file is located at /etc/hostname
</pre>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Attributes"><a class="selflink" href="#Attributes">Attributes</a></h2>
Each class can define its <b>attributes</b>. When we instantiate an object, we
  assign values to those attributes. For example, every &quot;File&quot; object
  has a path. Attributes are sometimes called <b>properties</b>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl has no special syntax for attributes. Under the hood, attributes are often
  stored as keys in the object's underlying hash, but don't worry about this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We recommend that you only access attributes via <b>accessor</b> methods. These
  are methods that can get or set the value of each attribute. We saw this
  earlier in the &quot;print_info()&quot; example, which calls
  &quot;$self-&gt;path&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might also see the terms <b>getter</b> and <b>setter</b>. These are two
  types of accessors. A getter gets the attribute's value, while a setter sets
  it. Another term for a setter is <b>mutator</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Attributes are typically defined as read-only or read-write. Read-only
  attributes can only be set when the object is first created, while read-write
  attributes can be altered at any time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The value of an attribute may itself be another object. For example, instead of
  returning its last mod time as a number, the &quot;File&quot; class could
  return a DateTime object representing that value.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It's possible to have a class that does not expose any publicly settable
  attributes. Not every class has attributes and methods.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Polymorphism"><a class="selflink" href="#Polymorphism">Polymorphism</a></h2>
<b>Polymorphism</b> is a fancy way of saying that objects from two different
  classes share an API. For example, we could have &quot;File&quot; and
  &quot;WebPage&quot; classes which both have a &quot;print_content()&quot;
  method. This method might produce different output for each class, but they
  share a common interface.
<div class="Pp"></div>
While the two classes may differ in many ways, when it comes to the
  &quot;print_content()&quot; method, they are the same. This means that we can
  try to call the &quot;print_content()&quot; method on an object of either
  class, and <b>we don't have to know what class the object belongs to!</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Polymorphism is one of the key concepts of object-oriented design.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Inheritance"><a class="selflink" href="#Inheritance">Inheritance</a></h2>
<b>Inheritance</b> lets you create a specialized version of an existing class.
  Inheritance lets the new class to reuse the methods and attributes of another
  class.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, we could create an &quot;File::MP3&quot; class which
  <b>inherits</b> from &quot;File&quot;. An &quot;File::MP3&quot; <b>is-a</b>
  <i>more specific</i> type of &quot;File&quot;. All mp3 files are files, but
  not all files are mp3 files.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We often refer to inheritance relationships as <b>parent-child</b> or
  &quot;superclass/subclass&quot; relationships. Sometimes we say that the child
  has an <b>is-a</b> relationship with its parent class.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;File&quot; is a <b>superclass</b> of &quot;File::MP3&quot;, and
  &quot;File::MP3&quot; is a <b>subclass</b> of &quot;File&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File::MP3;
  use parent 'File';
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The parent module is one of several ways that Perl lets you define inheritance
  relationships.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl allows multiple inheritance, which means that a class can inherit from
  multiple parents. While this is possible, we strongly recommend against it.
  Generally, you can use <b>roles</b> to do everything you can do with multiple
  inheritance, but in a cleaner way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that there's nothing wrong with defining multiple subclasses of a given
  class. This is both common and safe. For example, we might define
  &quot;File::MP3::FixedBitrate&quot; and &quot;File::MP3::VariableBitrate&quot;
  classes to distinguish between different types of mp3 file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Overriding methods and method resolution</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inheritance allows two classes to share code. By default, every method in the
  parent class is also available in the child. The child can explicitly
  <b>override</b> a parent's method to provide its own implementation. For
  example, if we have an &quot;File::MP3&quot; object, it has the
  &quot;print_info()&quot; method from &quot;File&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  my $cage = File::MP3-&gt;new(
      path          =&gt; 'mp3s/My-Body-Is-a-Cage.mp3',
      content       =&gt; $mp3_data,
      last_mod_time =&gt; 1304974868,
      title         =&gt; 'My Body Is a Cage',
  );
  $cage-&gt;print_info;
  # The file is at mp3s/My-Body-Is-a-Cage.mp3
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If we wanted to include the mp3's title in the greeting, we could override the
  method:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File::MP3;
  use parent 'File';
  sub print_info {
      my $self = shift;
      print &quot;This file is at &quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;\n&quot;;
      print &quot;Its title is &quot;, $self-&gt;title, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
  $cage-&gt;print_info;
  # The file is at mp3s/My-Body-Is-a-Cage.mp3
  # Its title is My Body Is a Cage
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The process of determining what method should be used is called <b>method
  resolution</b>. What Perl does is look at the object's class first
  (&quot;File::MP3&quot; in this case). If that class defines the method, then
  that class's version of the method is called. If not, Perl looks at each
  parent class in turn. For &quot;File::MP3&quot;, its only parent is
  &quot;File&quot;. If &quot;File::MP3&quot; does not define the method, but
  &quot;File&quot; does, then Perl calls the method in &quot;File&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If &quot;File&quot; inherited from &quot;DataSource&quot;, which inherited from
  &quot;Thing&quot;, then Perl would keep looking &quot;up the chain&quot; if
  necessary.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is possible to explicitly call a parent method from a child:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File::MP3;
  use parent 'File';
  sub print_info {
      my $self = shift;
      $self-&gt;SUPER::print_info();
      print &quot;Its title is &quot;, $self-&gt;title, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;SUPER::&quot; bit tells Perl to look for the &quot;print_info()&quot;
  in the &quot;File::MP3&quot; class's inheritance chain. When it finds the
  parent class that implements this method, the method is called.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We mentioned multiple inheritance earlier. The main problem with multiple
  inheritance is that it greatly complicates method resolution. See perlobj for
  more details.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Encapsulation"><a class="selflink" href="#Encapsulation">Encapsulation</a></h2>
<b>Encapsulation</b> is the idea that an object is opaque. When another
  developer uses your class, they don't need to know <i>how</i> it is
  implemented, they just need to know <i>what</i> it does.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Encapsulation is important for several reasons. First, it allows you to separate
  the public API from the private implementation. This means you can change that
  implementation without breaking the API.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Second, when classes are well encapsulated, they become easier to subclass.
  Ideally, a subclass uses the same APIs to access object data that its parent
  class uses. In reality, subclassing sometimes involves violating
  encapsulation, but a good API can minimize the need to do this.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We mentioned earlier that most Perl objects are implemented as hashes under the
  hood. The principle of encapsulation tells us that we should not rely on this.
  Instead, we should use accessor methods to access the data in that hash. The
  object systems that we recommend below all automate the generation of accessor
  methods. If you use one of them, you should never have to access the object as
  a hash directly.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Composition"><a class="selflink" href="#Composition">Composition</a></h2>
In object-oriented code, we often find that one object references another
  object. This is called <b>composition</b>, or a <b>has-a</b> relationship.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Earlier, we mentioned that the &quot;File&quot; class's
  &quot;last_mod_time&quot; accessor could return a DateTime object. This is a
  perfect example of composition. We could go even further, and make the
  &quot;path&quot; and &quot;content&quot; accessors return objects as well. The
  &quot;File&quot; class would then be <b>composed</b> of several other objects.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Roles"><a class="selflink" href="#Roles">Roles</a></h2>
<b>Roles</b> are something that a class <i>does</i>, rather than something that
  it <i>is</i>. Roles are relatively new to Perl, but have become rather
  popular. Roles are <b>applied</b> to classes. Sometimes we say that classes
  <b>consume</b> roles.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Roles are an alternative to inheritance for providing polymorphism. Let's assume
  we have two classes, &quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Computer&quot;. Both of these
  things have on/off switches. We want to model that in our class definitions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We could have both classes inherit from a common parent, like
  &quot;Machine&quot;, but not all machines have on/off switches. We could
  create a parent class called &quot;HasOnOffSwitch&quot;, but that is very
  artificial. Radios and computers are not specializations of this parent. This
  parent is really a rather ridiculous creation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This is where roles come in. It makes a lot of sense to create a
  &quot;HasOnOffSwitch&quot; role and apply it to both classes. This role would
  define a known API like providing &quot;turn_on()&quot; and
  &quot;turn_off()&quot; methods.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Perl does not have any built-in way to express roles. In the past, people just
  bit the bullet and used multiple inheritance. Nowadays, there are several good
  choices on CPAN for using roles.

  OO SYSTEMS</a></h1>
As we mentioned before, Perl's built-in OO system is very minimal, but also
  quite flexible. Over the years, many people have developed systems which build
  on top of Perl's built-in system to provide more features and convenience.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We strongly recommend that you use one of these systems. Even the most minimal
  of them eliminates a lot of repetitive boilerplate. There's really no good
  reason to write your classes from scratch in Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are interested in the guts underlying these systems, check out perlobj.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Moose"><a class="selflink" href="#Moose">Moose</a></h2>
Moose bills itself as a &quot;postmodern object system for Perl 5&quot;. Don't
  be scared, the &quot;postmodern&quot; label is a callback to Larry's
  description of Perl as &quot;the first postmodern computer language&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Moose&quot; provides a complete, modern OO system. Its biggest influence
  is the Common Lisp Object System, but it also borrows ideas from Smalltalk and
  several other languages. &quot;Moose&quot; was created by Stevan Little, and
  draws heavily from his work on the Perl 6 OO design.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here is our &quot;File&quot; class using &quot;Moose&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File;
  use Moose;
  has path          =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro' );
  has content       =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro' );
  has last_mod_time =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro' );
  sub print_info {
      my $self = shift;
      print &quot;This file is at &quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Moose&quot; provides a number of features:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Declarative sugar
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;Moose&quot; provides a layer of declarative &quot;sugar&quot; for
      defining classes. That sugar is just a set of exported functions that make
      declaring how your class works simpler and more palatable. This lets you
      describe <i>what</i> your class is, rather than having to tell Perl
      <i>how</i> to implement your class.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;has()&quot; subroutine declares an attribute, and
      &quot;Moose&quot; automatically creates accessors for these attributes. It
      also takes care of creating a &quot;new()&quot; method for you. This
      constructor knows about the attributes you declared, so you can set them
      when creating a new &quot;File&quot;.</dd>

  package HasOnOfSwitch;
  use Moose::Role;
  has is_on =&gt; (

  );
  sub turn_on {

    Perl's built-in introspection features are fairly minimal. &quot;Moose&quot;
      builds on top of them and creates a full introspection layer for your
      classes. This lets you ask questions like &quot;what methods does the File
      class implement?&quot; It also lets you modify your classes
      programmatically.</dd>

    &quot;Moose&quot; describes itself using its own introspection API. Besides

    &quot;Moose&quot; is a very powerful tool, and we can't cover all of its

<div class="Pp"></div>
Of course, &quot;Moose&quot; isn't perfect.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Moose&quot; can make your code slower to load. &quot;Moose&quot; itself is
  not small, and it does a <i>lot</i> of code generation when you define your
  class. This code generation means that your runtime code is as fast as it can
  be, but you pay for this when your modules are first loaded.
<div class="Pp"></div>
This load time hit can be a problem when startup speed is important, such as
  with a command-line script or a &quot;plain vanilla&quot; CGI script that must
  be loaded each time it is executed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Before you panic, know that many people do use &quot;Moose&quot; for
  command-line tools and other startup-sensitive code. We encourage you to try
  &quot;Moose&quot; out first before worrying about startup speed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Moose&quot; also has several dependencies on other modules. Most of these
  are small stand-alone modules, a number of which have been spun off from
  &quot;Moose&quot;. &quot;Moose&quot; itself, and some of its dependencies,
  require a compiler. If you need to install your software on a system without a
  compiler, or if having <i>any</i> dependencies is a problem, then
  &quot;Moose&quot; may not be right for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Mouse</i>
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you try &quot;Moose&quot; and find that one of these issues is preventing you
  from using &quot;Moose&quot;, we encourage you to consider Mouse next.
  &quot;Mouse&quot; implements a subset of &quot;Moose&quot;'s functionality in
  a simpler package. For all features that it does implement, the end-user API
  is <i>identical</i> to &quot;Moose&quot;, meaning you can switch from
  &quot;Mouse&quot; to &quot;Moose&quot; quite easily.
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Mouse&quot; does not implement most of &quot;Moose&quot;'s introspection
  API, so it's often faster when loading your modules. Additionally, all of its
  <i>required</i> dependencies ship with the Perl core, and it can run without a
  compiler. If you do have a compiler, &quot;Mouse&quot; will use it to compile
  some of its code for a speed boost.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Finally, it ships with a &quot;Mouse::Tiny&quot; module that takes most of
  &quot;Mouse&quot;'s features and bundles them up in a single module file. You
  can copy this module file into your application's library directory for easy
  bundling.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;Moose&quot; authors hope that one day &quot;Mouse&quot; can be made
  obsolete by improving &quot;Moose&quot; enough, but for now it provides a
  worthwhile alternative to &quot;Moose&quot;.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Class::Accessor"><a class="selflink" href="#Class::Accessor">Class::Accessor</a></h2>
Class::Accessor is the polar opposite of &quot;Moose&quot;. It provides very few
  features, nor is it self-hosting.
<div class="Pp"></div>
It is, however, very simple, pure Perl, and it has no non-core dependencies. It
  also provides a &quot;Moose-like&quot; API on demand for the features it
  supports.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Even though it doesn't do much, it is still preferable to writing your own
  classes from scratch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's our &quot;File&quot; class with &quot;Class::Accessor&quot;:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File;
  use Class::Accessor 'antlers';
  has path          =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro' );
  has content       =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro' );
  has last_mod_time =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro' );
  sub print_info {
      my $self = shift;
      print &quot;This file is at &quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The &quot;antlers&quot; import flag tells &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; that you
  want to define your attributes using &quot;Moose&quot;-like syntax. The only
  parameter that you can pass to &quot;has&quot; is &quot;is&quot;. We recommend
  that you use this Moose-like syntax if you choose &quot;Class::Accessor&quot;
  since it means you will have a smoother upgrade path if you later decide to
  move to &quot;Moose&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like &quot;Moose&quot;, &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; generates accessor methods
  and a constructor for your class.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Object::Tiny"><a class="selflink" href="#Object::Tiny">Object::Tiny</a></h2>
Finally, we have Object::Tiny. This module truly lives up to its name. It has an
  incredibly minimal API and absolutely no dependencies (core or not). Still, we
  think it's a lot easier to use than writing your own OO code from scratch.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Here's our &quot;File&quot; class once more:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  package File;
  use Object::Tiny qw( path content last_mod_time );
  sub print_info {
      my $self = shift;
      print &quot;This file is at &quot;, $self-&gt;path, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
That's it!
<div class="Pp"></div>
With &quot;Object::Tiny&quot;, all accessors are read-only. It generates a
  constructor for you, as well as the accessors you define.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Role::Tiny"><a class="selflink" href="#Role::Tiny">Role::Tiny</a></h2>
As we mentioned before, roles provide an alternative to inheritance, but Perl
  does not have any built-in role support. If you choose to use Moose, it comes
  with a full-fledged role implementation. However, if you use one of our other
  recommended OO modules, you can still use roles with Role::Tiny
<div class="Pp"></div>
&quot;Role::Tiny&quot; provides some of the same features as Moose's role
  system, but in a much smaller package. Most notably, it doesn't support any
  sort of attribute declaration, so you have to do that by hand. Still, it's
  useful, and works well with &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; and
  &quot;Object::Tiny&quot;
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="OO_System_Summary"><a class="selflink" href="#OO_System_Summary">OO
  System Summary</a></h2>
Here's a brief recap of the options we covered:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Moose
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;Moose&quot; is the maximal option. It has a lot of features, a big
      ecosystem, and a thriving user base. We also covered Mouse briefly.
      &quot;Mouse&quot; is &quot;Moose&quot; lite, and a reasonable alternative
      when Moose doesn't work for your application.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Class::Accessor
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; does a lot less than &quot;Moose&quot;, and is a
      nice alternative if you find &quot;Moose&quot; overwhelming. It's been
      around a long time and is well battle-tested. It also has a minimal
      &quot;Moose&quot; compatibility mode which makes moving from
      &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; to &quot;Moose&quot; easy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Object::Tiny
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    &quot;Object::Tiny&quot; is the absolute minimal option. It has no
      dependencies, and almost no syntax to learn. It's a good option for a
      super minimal environment and for throwing something together quickly
      without having to worry about details.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Role::Tiny
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Use &quot;Role::Tiny&quot; with &quot;Class::Accessor&quot; or
      &quot;Object::Tiny&quot; if you find yourself considering multiple
      inheritance. If you go with &quot;Moose&quot;, it comes with its own role
      implementation.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Other_OO_Systems"><a class="selflink" href="#Other_OO_Systems">Other
  OO Systems</a></h2>
There are literally dozens of other OO-related modules on CPAN besides those
  covered here, and you're likely to run across one or more of them if you work
  with other people's code.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, plenty of code in the wild does all of its OO &quot;by hand&quot;,
  using just the Perl built-in OO features. If you need to maintain such code,
  you should read perlobj to understand exactly how Perl's built-in OO works.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONCLUSION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h1>
As we said before, Perl's minimal OO system has led to a profusion of OO systems
  on CPAN. While you can still drop down to the bare metal and write your
  classes by hand, there's really no reason to do that with modern Perl.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For small systems, Object::Tiny and Class::Accessor both provide minimal object
  systems that take care of basic boilerplate for you.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For bigger projects, Moose provides a rich set of features that will let you
  focus on implementing your business logic.
<div class="Pp"></div>
We encourage you to play with and evaluate Moose, Class::Accessor, and
  Object::Tiny to see which OO system is right for you.</div>
