<b>pmlogcheck</b> - checks for invalid data in a PCP archive
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="selflink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<b>pmlogcheck</b> [ <b>-lz</b>] [ <b>-n</b> <i>pmnsfile</i>] [ <b>-S</b>
  <i>start</i>] [ <b>-T</b> <i>finish</i>] [ <b>-Z</b> <i>timezone</i>]
  <i>archive</i>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>pmlogcheck</b> prints information about the nature of any invalid data which
  it detects in the files of a PCP archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The archive has the base name <i>archive</i> and must have been previously
  created using <b>pmlogger</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Normally <b>pmlogcheck</b> operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
  Space (<b>pmns</b>(5)), however if the <b>-n</b> option is specified an
  alternative namespace is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The command line options <b>-S</b> and <b>-T</b> can be used to specify a time
  window over which metrics should be checked in Pass 3 (see below). These
  options are common to many Performance Co-Pilot tools and are fully described
  in <b>PCPIntro</b>(1).
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b>-l</b> option prints the archive label, showing the log format version,
  the time and date for the start and (current) end of the archive, and the host
  from which the performance metrics values were collected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default, <b>pmlogcheck</b> reports the time of day according to the local
  timezone on the system where <b>pmlogcheck</b> is run. The <b>-Z</b> option
  changes the timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format of the environment
  variable <b>TZ</b> as described in <b>environ</b>(7). The <b>-z</b> option
  changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host that is the source of
  the performance metrics, as specified in the label record of the archive log.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The checking proceeds in a number of passes, each designed to validate
  progressively more complex semantic relationships between the information in a
  PCP archive.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Pass_0"><a class="selflink" href="#Pass_0">Pass
  0</a></h1>
Each physical file of the PCP archive is processed to ensure the label records
  are valid and consistent, and that each file contains an integral number of
  physical records with correct header and trailer fields.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Any errors at this stage are usually fatal. The PCP archive is probably damaged
  beyond repair, and no more passes of <b>pmlogcheck</b> are attempted.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Pass_1"><a class="selflink" href="#Pass_1">Pass
  1</a></h1>
Validates the integrity of the temporal index, usually
  <i>archive</i><b>.index</b> .
<div class="Pp"></div>
As the temporal index is (strictly speaking) optional, errors at this stage are
  handled by marking the index as bad and ignoring it for the remainder of the
  <b>pmlogcheck</b> passes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Permanent repair can be achieved by removing the temporal index file and then
  making a copy of the PCP archive using <b>pmlogrewrite</b>(1) or
  <b>pmlogextract</b>(1). This will create a new temporal index for the copied
  archive as a side-effect.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Pass_2"><a class="selflink" href="#Pass_2">Pass
  2</a></h1>
Validates the integrity of the metadata file, usually
  <i>archive</i><b>.meta</b>.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Pass_3"><a class="selflink" href="#Pass_3">Pass
  3</a></h1>
Validates the integrity of each of the log volumes of the PCP archive, usually
  <i>archive</i><b>.0</b>, <i>archive</i><b>.1</b>, etc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is some basic integrity checks to ensure the encoding of values for each
  metric remains consistent and the values are well formed across all the
  observations in the archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Also the timestamps for the observations are expected to be monotonically
  increasing as the archive is tranversed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Additional attention is given to counter metrics (<i>type</i> from
  <b>pmLookupDesc</b>(3) is <b>PM_SEM_COUNTER</b>) which are expected to have
  monotonically increasing values. If the values are not monotonic increasing
  this may suggest a counter wrap has happened or there has been some
  interruption or reset to the underlying source of the performance data that is
  no captured in the archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For each counter metric which has been detected as having wrapped at some point
  in the archive, <b>pmlogcheck</b> produces output describing the metric name
  (with instance identifiers where appropriate), the internal storage type for
  the metric, the value of the metric before the counter wrap (with its
  associated timestamp), and the value of the metric after the wrap (also with a
  timestamp).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pmlogcheck</b> produces two different timestamp formats, depending on the
  interval over which it is run. For an interval greater than 24 hours, the date
  is displayed in addition to the time at which the counter wrap occurred. If
  the extent of the data being checked is less than 24 hours, a more precise
  format is used (time is displayed with millisecond precision, but without the
  date).

Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the
  file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file
  <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these variables. The
  <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
  file, as described in <b>pcp.conf</b>(5).
