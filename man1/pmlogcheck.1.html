<p>PMLOGCHECK(1) General Commands Manual PMLOGCHECK(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
pmlogcheck - checks for invalid data in a PCP archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
pmlogcheck [-lz] [-n pmnsfile] [-S start] [-T finish] [-Z
timezone] archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
pmlogcheck prints information about the nature of any
invalid data which it detects in the files of a PCP
archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The archive has the base name
archive and must have been previously created using
pmlogger(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally pmlogcheck operates on
the default Performance Metrics Name Space (pmns(5)),
however if the -n option is specified an alternative
namespace is loaded from the file pmns&acirc; <br>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The command line options -S and
-T can be used to specify a time window over which metrics
should be checked in Pass 3 (see below). These options are
common to many Performance <br>
Co-Pilot tools and are fully described in PCPIntro(1).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -l option prints the archive
label, showing the log format version, the time and date for
the start and (current) end of the archive, and the host
from which the performance <br>
metrics values were collected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, pmlogcheck reports
the time of day according to the local timezone on the
system where pmlogcheck is run. The -Z option changes the
timezone to timezone in the for&acirc; <br>
mat of the environment variable TZ as described in
environ(7). The -z option changes the timezone to the local
timezone at the host that is the source of the performance
met&acirc; <br>
rics, as specified in the label record of the archive
log.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The checking proceeds in a
number of passes, each designed to validate progressively
more complex semantic relationships between the information
in a PCP archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass 0 <br>
Each physical file of the PCP archive is processed to ensure
the label records are valid and consistent, and that each
file contains an integral number of physical records with
<br>
correct header and trailer fields.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any errors at this stage are
usually fatal. The PCP archive is probably damaged beyond
repair, and no more passes of pmlogcheck are attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass 1 <br>
Validates the integrity of the temporal index, usually
archive.index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As the temporal index is
(strictly speaking) optional, errors at this stage are
handled by marking the index as bad and ignoring it for the
remainder of the pmlogcheck passes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Permanent repair can be achieved
by removing the temporal index file and then making a copy
of the PCP archive using pmlogrewrite(1) or pmlogextract(1).
This will create a new <br>
temporal index for the copied archive as a side-effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass 2 <br>
Validates the integrity of the metadata file, usually
archive.meta.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pass 3 <br>
Validates the integrity of each of the log volumes of the
PCP archive, usually archive.0, archive.1, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is some basic integrity
checks to ensure the encoding of values for each metric
remains consistent and the values are well formed across all
the observations in the ar&acirc; <br>
chive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also the timestamps for the
observations are expected to be monotonically increasing as
the archive is tranversed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additional attention is given to
counter metrics (type from pmLookupDesc(3) is
PM_SEM_COUNTER) which are expected to have monotonically
increasing values. If the values are not <br>
monotonic increasing this may suggest a counter wrap has
happened or there has been some interruption or reset to the
underlying source of the performance data that is no
cap&acirc; <br>
tured in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each counter metric which
has been detected as having wrapped at some point in the
archive, pmlogcheck produces output describing the metric
name (with instance identifiers <br>
where appropriate), the internal storage type for the
metric, the value of the metric before the counter wrap
(with its associated timestamp), and the value of the metric
after <br>
the wrap (also with a timestamp).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pmlogcheck produces two
different timestamp formats, depending on the interval over
which it is run. For an interval greater than 24 hours, the
date is displayed in addition to <br>
the time at which the counter wrap occurred. If the extent
of the data being checked is less than 24 hours, a more
precise format is used (time is displayed with millisecond
<br>
precision, but without the date).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/* <br>
default PMNS specification files <br>
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/hostname <br>
default directory for PCP archives containing performance
data collected from the host hostname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PCP ENVIRONMENT <br>
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On
each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local
<br>
values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be
used to specify an alternative configuration file, as
described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

self- explanatory.</p>
