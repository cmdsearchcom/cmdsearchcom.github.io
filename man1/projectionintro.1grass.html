<p style="margin-top: 1em">Projections and spatial
transformations in GRASS GIS <br>
Projection management in general <br>
A GRASS location is referenced with a single projection and
coordinate system (or unreferenced as XY location). When
creating a new location from an existing raster or vector
map <br>
using the tools available from the startup screen or the map
import commands, projection and coordinate system are
defined. To change the projection of maps, a new location
has <br>
to be created and the desired maps have to be reprojected
into it from the source location as explained below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster map projections <br>
Raster maps are backward projected in GRASS. This means that
the user has to run the raster projection command (r.proj)
in the target location and &quot;pull&quot; the map from the
source <br>
location. Both locations need to have a projection
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Raster map transformation <br>
To transform an unprojected map from a XY location into a
projected location (or another XY location), a forward
transformation is performed. The unreferenced map is
geocoded <br>
within the XY location by defining four corner points or by
seeking several ground control points (i.group, i.target,
g.gui.gcp) and then transformed into the target location
<br>
(i.rectify). Polynomial transformation of 1st, 2nd and 3rd
order are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A graphical user interface is
provided by wxGUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To simply translate a raster map
(without stretching or rotation), the r.region command can
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector map projections <br>
Vector maps are backward projected in GRASS. This means that
the user has to run the vector projection command (v.proj)
in the target location and &quot;pull&quot; the map from the
source <br>
location. Both locations need to have a projection
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Vector map transformation <br>
To transform an unprojected map (e.g. CAD map) into
projected coordinates, a forward transformation is
performed. The unreferenced map is imported into the
location with projec&acirc; <br>
tion and geocoded within this location by defining four
corner points or by seeking several ground control points.
These points are stored into an ASCII file and then
trans&acirc; <br>
formed within the same location (v.transform).
Alternatively, v.rectify rectifies a vector by computing a
coordinate transformation for each object in the vector
based on the <br>
control points.</p>
