<p>DELETEMAIL(1) General Commands Manual DELETEMAIL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
deletemail - remove old mail from server</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
deletemail [-nqsuv[v]] [-f file]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deletemail -h | -V</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
deletemail is a non-interactive tool for deleting mail which
is older than a configurable number of days from one or more
IMAP mailboxes. By default, mail which is not marked as <br>
seen on the server will not be deleted. Currently, the IMAP4
and IMAP4rev1 protocols are supported, optionally using
SSL/TLS for secure IMAP connections.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-f file <br>
Use file instead of $HOME/.deletemailrc for
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a short description of
all available options and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Mark messages as deleted on
the server, but don&rsquo;t expunge them (that is, omit the
IMAP CLOSE command). This might be useful in order to test
whether or not everything <br>
works as expected. However, please note that the
&acirc;deleted&acirc; flags will not be revoked by
deletemail, so these messages might be expunged by another
IMAP client accessing <br>
the mailbox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Quiet output, only error
messages are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Don&rsquo;t use unique
message IDs in IMAP commands. By default, deletemail will
use UIDs when issuing IMAP SEARCH or STORE commands, since
UIDs are safer in case multiple IMAP <br>
clients are accessing the mailbox at the same time. However,
there are IMAP servers which seem to have problems using
UIDs. Thus, if you encounter strange behaviour <br>
(like the server unexpectedly closing the connection), this
option might be helpful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Delete any message which is
older than the configured number of days, no matter whether
or not the message is marked as seen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print version information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[v] If the -v option is used,
all commands sent to the server and all server responses
will be printed to the standard error stream. If -v is
specified twice, (quite a lot <br>
of) additional debug output will be produced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION FILE <br>
By default, the configuration file $HOME/.deletemailrc will
be read. Each IMAP account on which deletemail should
operate is configured by using the keyword ACCOUNT, followed
by <br>
variable: value pairs specifying the account settings; one
variable: value pair per line. Apart from that, the keyword
GLOBAL, followed by variable: value pairs may optionally
<br>
be used for specifying default settings. If GLOBAL is used,
it must be declared prior to any ACCOUNT settings. The
default settings will only take effect if they are not
speci&acirc; <br>
fied for a given ACCOUNT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Configuration values may include
all ASCII characters. Empty lines and the rest of a line
after a &acirc;#&acirc; will be ignored. Whitespace and
&acirc;#&acirc; must be escaped using a backslash if <br>
the value is not quoted with single or double quotes. If the
value is quoted, the quote sign must be escaped using a
backslash. A literal backslash must always be escaped using
<br>
another backslash. If the last character of a configuration
line is a backslash, the following line will be appended
prior to parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Required Configuration Variables
<br>
The following configuration variables must be set, either by
specifying default settings using the keyword GLOBAL and/or
by specifying them for each ACCOUNT.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">days: &lt;integer&gt; <br>
The number of days that messages should stay on the server.
Messages which are not older than specified here will not be
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">host: &lt;string&gt; <br>
The IMAP server name or IP address.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pass: &lt;string&gt; <br>
The password for authentication on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">user: &lt;string&gt; <br>
The username for authentication on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Optional Configuration Variables
<br>
The following configuration variables may be set, either by
specifying default settings using the keyword GLOBAL and/or
by specifying them for one or more ACCOUNTs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">expunge: yes|no <br>
If set to no, messages will still be marked as deleted on
the server, but they won&rsquo;t be expunged by deletemail.
However, these messages might be expunged by another IMAP
<br>
client accessing the mailbox. This variable will be
overridden by the -n command line switch. Default: yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folder: &lt;string&gt;
[string...] <br>
The mailbox name. Multiple folders may be specified using a
space delimited list. Default: INBOX.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">port: &lt;integer&gt; <br>
The server port number. Default: 993 for SSL connections,
143 otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ssl: yes|no|starttls <br>
Specifies usage of SSL/TLS for secure IMAP connections. If
set to yes, SSL on connect will be used; if set to starttls,
the TLS connection will be initiated using START&acirc; <br>
TLS. In both cases, deletemail will exit with an error prior
to sending any login information if the server doesn&rsquo;t
support the respective mechanism. Default: no. This <br>
variable is only available if deletemail was built with SSL
support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">unseen: yes|no <br>
If set to yes, any message that is older than the configured
number of days will be deleted, no matter whether or not the
message is marked as seen. If set to no, mes&acirc; <br>
sages which are not marked as seen will never be deleted.
This variable will be overridden by the -u command line
switch. Default: no.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use_uid: yes|no <br>
If set to no, deletemail won&rsquo;t use unique message IDs
when talking to the IMAP server. See the -s command line
switch (which will override the use_uid setting) for
impli&acirc; <br>
cations. Default: yes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
Upon successful completion, deletemail returns 0. If any
sort of error is encountered, deletemail returns a value
other than 0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Configure deletemail via the file $HOME/.deletemailrc, which
could look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCOUNT # Toms INBOX on the ISPs
IMAP server <br>
host: imap.provider.com <br>
user: tom <br>
pass: h0lyPa55 <br>
days: 7 # delete mail if it&rsquo;s older than a week <br>
ssl: yes # use SSL for secure IMAP connections</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test your configuration by
creating verbose output and not expunging deleted messages
on the server:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">deletemail -nv</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Run deletemail once an hour (at
twenty past) by using a crontab(5) entry like the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">20 * * * *
/usr/local/bin/deletemail -q</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME If the configuration file is not specified on the
command line, $HOME/.deletemailrc will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.deletemailrc default
configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
For SSL connections, deletemail currently does not support
any mechanism to prevent &acirc;man in the middle&acirc;
attacks. Future releases will probably provide certificate
and key fin&acirc; <br>
gerprint checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Apart from that, on systems that
lack a useable random device (like /dev/urandom), deletemail
will try to collect some random data for seeding OpenSSLs
PRNG on it&rsquo;s own. How&acirc; <br>
ever, this is insecure. Please consider installing an
entropy gathering daemon like EGD or PRNGD if your system
doesn&rsquo;t provide a useable random device (the output of
deletemail <br>
-vv will tell you whether or not that&rsquo;s the case). See
the OpenSSL manual page RAND_egd(3) for information on where
to get and how to install an entropy gathering daemon so
that <br>
OpenSSL will use it automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The mailbox name may not include non-ASCII characters, since
they won&rsquo;t be encoded according to the IMAP standard
when talking to the server. IPv6 is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I&rsquo;m sure there are more
bugs, please let me know if you find them.</p>
