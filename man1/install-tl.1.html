<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
install-tl - TeX Live cross-platform installer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
install-tl [option]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install-tl-windows.bat
[option]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">install-tl-advanced.bat
[option]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This installer creates a runnable TeX Live installation from
various media, including over the network. The installer
works across all platforms supported by TeX Live. For <br>
information on initially downloading the TeX Live, see
&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/acquire.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The basic idea of TeX Live
installation is to choose one of the top-level schemes, each
of which is defined as a different set of collections and
packages, where a collection is <br>
a set of packages, and a package is what contains actual
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Within the installer, you can
choose a scheme, and further customize the set of
collections to install, but not the set of the packages. To
do that, use &quot;tlmgr&quot; (reference <br>
below) after the initial installation is completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is
&quot;scheme-full&quot;, to install everything, and this is
highly recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REFERENCES <br>
Post-installation configuration, package updates, and much
more, are handled through tlmgr(1), the TeX Live Manager
(&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The most up-to-date version of
this documentation is on the Internet at
&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For the full documentation of
TeX Live, see &lt;http://tug.org/texlive/doc&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
As usual, all options can be specified in any order, and
with either a leading &quot;-&quot; or &quot;--&quot;. An
argument value can be separated from its option by either a
space or &quot;=&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-gui [[=]module] <br>
If no module is given starts the &quot;perltk&quot; (see
below) GUI installer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If module is given loads the
given installer module. Currently the following modules are
supported:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;text&quot; The text mode
user interface (default on Unix systems). Same as the
&quot;-no-gui&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;wizard&quot; <br>
The wizard mode user interface (default on Windows), asking
only minimal questions before installing all of TeX
Live.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;perltk&quot; <br>
The expert GUI installer, providing access to more options.
Can also be invoked on Windows by running
&quot;install-tl-advanced.bat&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;perltk&quot; and
&quot;wizard&quot; modules, and thus also when calling with
a bare &quot;-gui&quot; (without module), requires the
Perl/Tk module
(&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/distro.html#perltk&gt;); <br>
if Perl/Tk is not available, installation continues in text
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-gui <br>
Use the text mode installer (default except on Windows).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-lang llcode <br>
By default, the GUI tries to deduce your language from the
environment (on Windows via the registry, on Unix via
&quot;LC_MESSAGES&quot;). If that fails you can select a
different <br>
language by giving this option with a language code (based
on ISO 639-1). Currently supported (but not necessarily
completely translated) are: English (en, default), Czech
<br>
(cs), German (de), French (fr), Italian (it), Japanese (ja),
Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR),
Russian (ru), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Serbian (sr),
<br>
Ukrainian (uk), Vietnamese (vi), simplified Chinese (zh_CN),
and traditional Chinese (zh_TW).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-repository url|path <br>
Specify the package repository to be used as the source of
the installation, either a local directory via
&quot;/path/to/directory&quot; or a &quot;file:/&quot; url,
or a network location via a <br>
&quot;http://&quot; or &quot;ftp://&quot; url. (No other
protocols are supported.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to pick a mirror
automatically, using
&lt;http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet&gt;; the
chosen mirror is used for the entire download. You can use
the <br>
special argument &quot;ctan&quot; as an abbreviation for
this. See &lt;http://ctan.org&gt; for more about CTAN and
its mirrors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the repository is on the
network, trailing &quot;/&quot; characters and/or trailing
&quot;/tlpkg&quot; and &quot;/archive&quot; components are
ignored. For example, you could choose a particular CTAN
<br>
mirror with something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-repository
http://ctan.example.org/its/ctan/dir/systems/texlive/tlnet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of course a real hostname and
its particular top-level CTAN path have to be specified. The
list of CTAN mirrors is available at
&lt;http://ctan.org/mirrors&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the repository is local, the
installation type (compressed or live) is automatically
determined, by checking for the presence of a
&quot;archive&quot; directory relative to the <br>
root. Compressed is preferred if both are available, since
it is faster. Here&rsquo;s an example of using a local
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-repository
/local/TL/repository</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After installation is complete,
you can use that installation as the repository for another
installation. If you chose to install less than the full
scheme containing all <br>
packages, the list of available schemes will be adjusted
accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For backward compatibility and
convenience, &quot;--location&quot; and &quot;--repo&quot;
are accepted as aliases for this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-select-repository <br>
This option allows manual selection of a mirror from the
current list of active CTAN mirrors. This option is
supported in all installer modes (text, wizard, perltk), and
<br>
will also offer to install from local media if available, or
from a repository specified on the command line (see above).
It&rsquo;s useful when the (default) automatic <br>
redirection does not choose a good host for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-all-options <br>
Normally options not relevant to the current platform are
not shown (i.e., when running on Unix, Windows-specific
options are omitted). Giving this command line option <br>
allows configuring settings in the final
&quot;texlive.tlpdb&quot; that do not have any immediate
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-custom-bin path <br>
If you have built your own set of TeX Live binaries (perhaps
because your platform was not supported by TeX Live out of
the box), this option allows you to specify the path <br>
to a directory where the binaries for the current system are
present. The installation will continue as usual, but at the
end all files from path are copied over to <br>
&quot;bin/custom/&quot; under your installation directory
and this &quot;bin/custom/&quot; directory is what will be
added to the path for the post-install actions. (By the way,
for information <br>
on building TeX Live, see
&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/build.html&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-debug-translation <br>
In GUI mode, this switch makes &quot;tlmgr&quot; report any
missing, or more likely untranslated, messages to standard
error. Helpful for translators to see what remains to be
done.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-force-platform platform <br>
Instead of auto-detecting the current platform, use
platform. Binaries for this platform must be present and
they must actually be runnable, or installation will fail.
<br>
&quot;-force-arch&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-help, --help, -? <br>
Display this help and exit (on the web via
&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html&gt;).
Sometimes the &quot;perldoc&quot; and/or &quot;PAGER&quot;
programs on the system have problems, <br>
possibly resulting in control characters being literally
output. This can&rsquo;t always be detected, but you can set
the &quot;NOPERLDOC&quot; environment variable and
&quot;perldoc&quot; will not <br>
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-in-place <br>
This is a quick-and-dirty installation option in case you
already have an rsync or svn checkout of TeX Live. It will
use the checkout as-is and will just do the necessary <br>
post-install. Be warned that the file
&quot;tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb&quot; may be rewritten, that
removal has to be done manually, and that the only realistic
way to maintain this <br>
installation is to redo it from time to time. This option is
not available via the installer interfaces. USE AT YOUR OWN
RISK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-logfile file <br>
Write both all messages (informational, debugging, warnings)
to file, in addition to standard output or standard
error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If this option is not given, the
installer will create a log file in the root of the writable
installation tree, for example,
&quot;/usr/local/texlive/YYYY/install-tl.log&quot; for the
<br>
YYYY release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-cls <br>
(only for text mode installer) do not clear the screen when
entering a new menu (for debugging purposes).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-non-admin <br>
For Windows only: configure for the current user, not for
all users.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-persistent-downloads <br>
-no-persistent-downloads <br>
For network installs, activating this option makes the
installer try to set up a persistent connection using the
&quot;Net::LWP&quot; Perl module. This opens only one
connection <br>
between your computer and the server per session and reuses
it, instead of initiating a new download for each package,
which typically yields a significant speed-up.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is turned on by
default, and the installation program will fall back to
using &quot;wget&quot; if this is not possible. To disable
usage of LWP and persistent connections, <br>
use &quot;-no-persistent-downloads&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no-verify-downloads <br>
By default, if a GnuPG &quot;gpg&quot; binary is found in
PATH, downloads are verified against a cryptographic
signature. This option disables such verification. The full
description <br>
is in the Crytographic Verification section of the
&quot;tlmgr&quot; documentation, e.g.,
&lt;http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#CRYPTOGRAPHIC-VERIFICATION&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-portable <br>
Install for portable use, e.g., on a USB stick. Also
selectable from within the perltk and text installers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-print-platform <br>
Print the TeX Live identifier for the detected platform
(hardware/operating system) combination to standard output,
and exit. &quot;-print-arch&quot; is a synonym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-profile profile <br>
Load the file profile and do the installation with no user
interaction, that is, a batch (unattended) install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A profile file contains all the
values needed to perform an installation. After a normal
installation has finished, a profile for that exact
installation is written to the <br>
file DEST/tlpkg/texlive.profile. That file can be given as
the argument to &quot;-profile&quot; to redo the exact same
installation on a different system, for example.
Alternatively, <br>
you can use a custom profile, most easily created by
starting from a generated one and changing values, or an
empty file, which will take all the defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Normally a profile has to
specify the value 1 for each collection to be installed,
even if the scheme is specified. This follows from the logic
of the installer in that you <br>
can first select a scheme and then change the collections
being installed. But for convenience there is an exception
to this within profiles: If the profile contains a <br>
variable for &quot;selected_scheme&quot; and no collection
variables at all are defined in the profile, then the
collections which the specified scheme requires are
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Thus, a line
&quot;selected_scheme scheme-medium&quot; together with the
definitions of the installation directories
(&quot;TEXDIR&quot;, &quot;TEXMFHOME&quot;,
&quot;TEXMFLOCAL&quot;, &quot;TEXMFSYSCONFIG&quot;, <br>
&quot;TEXMFSYSVAR&quot;) suffices to install the medium
scheme with all default options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Omit normal informational
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-scheme scheme <br>
Schemes are the highest level of package grouping in TeX
Live; the default is to use the &quot;full&quot; scheme,
which includes everything. This option overrides that
default. You <br>
can change the scheme again before the actual installation
with the usual menu. The scheme argument may optionally have
a prefix &quot;scheme-&quot;. The list of supported scheme
<br>
names depends on what your package repository provides; see
the interactive menu list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Include verbose debugging
messages; repeat for maximum debugging, as in &quot;-v
-v&quot;. (Further repeats are accepted but ignored.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version, --version <br>
Output version information and exit. If &quot;-v&quot; has
also been given the revisions of the used modules are
reported, too.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
For ease in scripting and debugging, &quot;install-tl&quot;
will look for the following environment variables. They are
not of interest in normal user installations.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_ENV_NOCHECK&quot;
<br>
Omit the check for environment variables containing the
string &quot;tex&quot;. People developing TeX-related
software are likely to have many such variables.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_NO_CONTEXT_CACHE&quot;
<br>
Omit creating the ConTeXt cache. This is useful for
redistributors.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX&quot;
<br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR&quot; <br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFCONFIG&quot; <br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFHOME&quot; <br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFLOCAL&quot; <br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSCONFIG&quot; <br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFSYSVAR&quot; <br>
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXMFVAR&quot; <br>
Specify the respective directories.
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_PREFIX&quot; defaults to
&quot;/usr/local/texlive&quot;, while
&quot;TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR&quot; defaults to the release
directory within that <br>
prefix, e.g., &quot;/usr/local/texlive/2014&quot;. All the
defaults can be seen by running the installer interactively
and then typing &quot;D&quot; for the directory menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;NOPERLDOC&quot; <br>
Don&rsquo;t try to run the &quot;--help&quot; message
through &quot;perldoc&quot;.</p>
