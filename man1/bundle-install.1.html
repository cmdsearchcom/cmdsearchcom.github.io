<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Install the gems specified in your Gemfile(5). If this is
the first time you run bundle install (and a Gemfile.lock
does not exist), bundler will fetch all remote sources, <br>
resolve dependencies and install all needed gems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a Gemfile.lock does exist,
and you have not updated your Gemfile(5), bundler will fetch
all remote sources, but use the dependencies specified in
the Gemfile.lock instead of <br>
resolving dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a Gemfile.lock does exist,
and you have updated your Gemfile(5), bundler will use the
dependencies in the Gemfile.lock for all gems that you did
not update, but will <br>
re-resolve the dependencies of gems that you did update. You
can find more information about this update process below
under CONSERVATIVE UPDATING.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
--gemfile=&lt;gemfile&gt; <br>
The location of the Gemfile(5) that bundler should use. This
defaults to a gemfile in the current working directory. In
general, bundler will assume that the location of <br>
the Gemfile(5) is also the project root, and will look for
the Gemfile.lock and vendor/cache relative to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--path=&lt;path&gt; <br>
The location to install the gems in the bundle to. This
defaults to Rubygems&Acirc;&acute; gem home, which is also
the default location where gem install installs gems. This
means <br>
that, by default, gems installed without a --path setting
will show up in gem list. This setting is a remembered
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--system <br>
Installs the gems in the bundle to the system location. This
overrides any previous remembered use of --path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without=&lt;list&gt; <br>
A space-separated list of groups to skip installing. This is
a remembered option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--local <br>
Do not attempt to connect to rubygems.org, instead using
just the gems already present in Rubygems&Acirc;&acute;
cache or in vendor/cache. Note that if a more appropriate
platform-spe&acirc; <br>
cific gem exists on rubygems.org, it will not be found.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deployment <br>
Switches bundler&Acirc;&acute;s defaults into deployment
mode. Do not use this flag on development machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binstubs[=&lt;directory&gt;]
<br>
Create a directory (defaults to bin) containing an
executable that runs in the context of the bundle. For
instance, if the rails gem comes with a rails executable,
this <br>
flag will create a bin/rails executable that ensures that
all dependencies used come from the bundled gems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--shebang ruby-install-name <br>
Uses the ruby executable (usually ruby) provided to execute
the scripts created with --binstubs. For instance, if you
use --binstubs with --shebang jruby, all executables <br>
will be created to use jruby instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--standalone[=&lt;list&gt;] <br>
Make a bundle that can work without Ruby Gems or Bundler at
runtime. It takes a space separated list of groups to
install. It creates a bundle directory and installs the <br>
bundle there. It also generates a bundle/bundler/setup.rb
file to replace Bundler&Acirc;&acute;s own setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--trust-policy=[&lt;policy&gt;]
<br>
Apply the Rubygems security policy named policy, where
policy is one of HighSecurity, MediumSecurity, LowSecurity,
AlmostNoSecurity, or NoSecurity. For more detail, see <br>
the Rubygems signing documentation, linked below in SEE
ALSO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--jobs=[&lt;size&gt;] <br>
Install gems parallely by starting size number of parallel
workers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--retry[&lt;tries] <br>
Retries failed network or git requests tries times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-cache <br>
Do not update the cache in vendor/cache with the newly
bundled gems. This does not remove any existing cached gems,
only stops the newly bundled gems from being cached <br>
during the install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--quiet <br>
Do not print progress information to stdout. Instead,
communicate the success of the install operation via exit
status code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--clean <br>
Run bundle clean automatically after install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--full-index <br>
Use the rubygems modern index instead of the API
endpoint.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-prune <br>
Don&Acirc;&acute;t remove stale gems from the cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPLOYMENT MODE <br>
Bundler&Acirc;&acute;s defaults are optimized for
development. To switch to defaults optimized for deployment,
use the --deployment flag. Do not activate deployment mode
on development <br>
machines, as it will cause in an error when the Gemfile is
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. A Gemfile.lock is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To ensure that the same versions
of the gems you developed with and tested with are also used
in deployments, a Gemfile.lock is required.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is mainly to ensure that
you remember to check your Gemfile.lock into version
control.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. The Gemfile.lock must be up
to date</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In development, you can modify
your Gemfile(5) and re-run bundle install to conservatively
update your Gemfile.lock snapshot.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In deployment, your Gemfile.lock
should be up-to-date with changes made in your
Gemfile(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Gems are installed to
vendor/bundle not your default system location</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In development,
it&Acirc;&acute;s convenient to share the gems used in your
application with other applications and other scripts run on
the system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In deployment, isolation is a
more important default. In addition, the user deploying the
application may not have permission to install gems to the
system, or the web server <br>
may not have permission to read them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a result, bundle install
--deployment installs gems to the vendor/bundle directory in
the application. This may be overridden using the --path
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SUDO USAGE <br>
By default, bundler installs gems to the same location as
gem install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In some cases, that location may
not be writable by your Unix user. In that case, bundler
will stage everything in a temporary directory, then ask you
for your sudo password in <br>
order to copy the gems into their system location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">From your perspective, this is
identical to installing them gems directly into the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should never use sudo bundle
install. This is because several other steps in bundle
install must be performed as the current user:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Updating your
Gemfile.lock</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Updating your
vendor/cache, if necessary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Checking out
private git repositories using your user&Acirc;&acute;s SSH
keys</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Of these three, the first two
could theoretically be performed by chowning the resulting
files to $SUDO_USER. The third, however, can only be
performed by actually invoking the <br>
git command as the current user. Therefore, git gems are
downloaded and installed into ~/.bundle rather than
$GEM_HOME or $BUNDLE_PATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a result, you should run
bundle install as the current user, and bundler will ask for
your password if it is needed to put the gems into their
final location.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLING GROUPS <br>
By default, bundle install will install all gems in all
groups in your Gemfile(5), except those declared for a
different platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, you can explicitly tell
bundler to skip installing certain groups with the --without
option. This option takes a space-separated list of
groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While the --without option will
skip installing the gems in the specified groups, it will
still download those gems and use them to resolve the
dependencies of every gem in your <br>
Gemfile(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is so that installing a
different set of groups on another machine (such as a
production server) will not change the gems and versions
that you have already developed and <br>
tested against.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bundler offers a rock-solid
guarantee that the third-party code you are running in
development and testing is also the third-party code you are
running in production. You can <br>
choose to exclude some of that code in different
environments, but you will never be caught flat-footed by
different versions of third-party code being used in
different environ&acirc; <br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a simple illustration,
consider the following Gemfile(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source
&quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gem &quot;sinatra&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">group :production do <br>
gem &quot;rack-perftools-profiler&quot; <br>
end</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, sinatra depends on
any version of Rack (&gt;= 1.0, while
rack-perftools-profiler depends on 1.x (~&gt; 1.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you run bundle install
--without production in development, we look at the
dependencies of rack-perftools-profiler as well. That way,
you do not spend all your time develop&acirc; <br>
ing against Rack 2.0, using new APIs unavailable in Rack
1.x, only to have bundler switch to Rack 1.2 when the
production group is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This should not cause any
problems in practice, because we do not attempt to install
the gems in the excluded groups, and only evaluate as part
of the dependency resolution <br>
process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This also means that you cannot
include different versions of the same gem in different
groups, because doing so would result in different sets of
dependencies used in develop&acirc; <br>
ment and production. Because of the vagaries of the
dependency resolution process, this usually affects more
than just the gems you list in your Gemfile(5), and can
(surpris&acirc; <br>
ingly) radically change the gems you are using.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMEMBERED OPTIONS <br>
Some options (marked above in the OPTIONS section) are
remembered between calls to bundle install, and by the
Bundler runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance, if you run bundle
install --without test, a subsequent call to bundle install
that does not include a --without flag will remember your
previous choice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition, a call to
Bundler.setup will not attempt to make the gems in those
groups available on the Ruby load path, as they were not
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The settings that are remembered
are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--deployment <br>
At runtime, this remembered setting will also result in
Bundler raising an exception if the Gemfile.lock is out of
date.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--path Subsequent calls to
bundle install will install gems to the directory originally
passed to --path. The Bundler runtime will look for gems in
that location. You can revert <br>
this option by running bundle install --system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--binstubs <br>
Bundler will update the executables every subsequent call to
bundle install.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--without <br>
As described above, Bundler will skip the gems specified by
--without in subsequent calls to bundle install. The Bundler
runtime will also not try to make the gems in the <br>
skipped groups available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">THE GEMFILE.LOCK <br>
When you run bundle install, Bundler will persist the full
names and versions of all gems that you used (including
dependencies of the gems specified in the Gemfile(5)) into a
<br>
file called Gemfile.lock.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bundler uses this file in all
subsequent calls to bundle install, which guarantees that
you always use the same exact code, even as your application
moves across machines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because of the way dependency
resolution works, even a seemingly small change (for
instance, an update to a point-release of a dependency of a
gem in your Gemfile(5)) can result <br>
in radically different gems being needed to satisfy all
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As a result, you SHOULD check
your Gemfile.lock into version control. If you do not, every
machine that checks out your repository (including your
production server) will resolve <br>
all dependencies again, which will result in different
versions of third-party code being used if any of the gems
in the Gemfile(5) or any of their dependencies have been
<br>
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONSERVATIVE UPDATING <br>
When you make a change to the Gemfile(5) and then run bundle
install, Bundler will update only the gems that you
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In other words, if a gem that
you did not modify worked before you called bundle install,
it will continue to use the exact same versions of all
dependencies as it used before <br>
the update.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Let&Acirc;&acute;s take a look
at an example. Here&Acirc;&acute;s your original
Gemfile(5):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source
&quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gem &quot;actionpack&quot;,
&quot;2.3.8&quot; <br>
gem &quot;activemerchant&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In this case, both actionpack
and activemerchant depend on activesupport. The actionpack
gem depends on activesupport 2.3.8 and rack ~&gt; 1.1.0,
while the activemerchant gem <br>
depends on activesupport &gt;= 2.3.2, braintree &gt;= 2.0.0,
and builder &gt;= 2.0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When the dependencies are first
resolved, Bundler will select activesupport 2.3.8, which
satisfies the requirements of both gems in your
Gemfile(5).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Next, you modify your Gemfile(5)
to:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source
&quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">gem &quot;actionpack&quot;,
&quot;3.0.0.rc&quot; <br>
gem &quot;activemerchant&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actionpack 3.0.0.rc gem has
a number of new dependencies, and updates the activesupport
dependency to = 3.0.0.rc and the rack dependency to ~&gt;
1.2.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you run bundle install,
Bundler notices that you changed the actionpack gem, but not
the activemerchant gem. It evaluates the gems currently
being used to satisfy its <br>
requirements:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">activesupport 2.3.8 <br>
also used to satisfy a dependency in activemerchant, which
is not being updated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rack ~&gt; 1.1.0 <br>
not currently being used to satisfy another dependency</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Because you did not explicitly
ask to update activemerchant, you would not expect it to
suddenly stop working after updating actionpack. However,
satisfying the new activesupport <br>
3.0.0.rc dependency of actionpack requires updating one of
its dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Even though activemerchant
declares a very loose dependency that theoretically matches
activesupport 3.0.0.rc, bundler treats gems in your
Gemfile(5) that have not changed as an <br>
atomic unit together with their dependencies. In this case,
the activemerchant dependency is treated as activemerchant
1.7.1 + activesupport 2.3.8, so bundle install will report
<br>
that it cannot update actionpack.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To explicitly update actionpack,
including its dependencies which other gems in the
Gemfile(5) still depend on, run bundle update actionpack
(see bundle update(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Summary: In general, after
making a change to the Gemfile(5) , you should first try to
run bundle install, which will guarantee that no other gems
in the Gemfile(5) are impacted <br>
by the change. If that does not work, run bundle update(1)
bundle-update.1.html.</p>
