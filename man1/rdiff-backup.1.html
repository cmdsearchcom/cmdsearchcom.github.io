<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>rdiff-backup</b> is a script, written in <b>python</b>(1) that backs up one
  directory to another. The target directory ends up a copy (mirror) of the
  source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory
  of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.
  The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental
  backup. rdiff-backup also preserves symlinks, special files, hardlinks,
  permissions, uid/gid ownership, and modification times.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>rdiff-backup</b> can also operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a
  pipe, like <b>rsync</b>(1). Thus you can use ssh and rdiff-backup to securely
  back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be
  transmitted. Using the default settings, rdiff-backup requires that the remote
  system accept ssh connections, and that <b>rdiff-backup</b> is installed in
  the user's PATH on the remote system. For information on other options, see
  the section on <b>REMOTE OPERATION.</b>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Note that you <b>should not write to the mirror directory</b> except with
  rdiff-backup. Many of the increments are stored as reverse diffs, so if you
  delete or modify a file, you may lose the ability to restore previous versions
  of that file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, this man page is intended more as a precise description of the behavior
  and syntax of rdiff-backup. New users may want to check out the examples.html
  file included in the rdiff-backup distribution.

    rdiff-backup cannot remove-older-than and back up or restore in a single
      session. In order to both backup a directory and remove old files in it,
      you must run rdiff-backup twice.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    By default, rdiff-backup will only delete information from one session at a

    Note that snapshots of deleted files are covered by this operation. Thus if
      you deleted a file two weeks ago, backed up immediately afterwards, and
      then ran rdiff-backup with --remove-older-than 10D today, no trace of that

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="RESTORING"><a class="selflink" href="#RESTORING">RESTORING</a></h1>
There are two ways to tell rdiff-backup to restore a file or directory. Firstly,
  you can run rdiff-backup on a mirror file and use the <b>-r</b> or
  <b>--restore-as-of</b> options. Secondly, you can run it on an increment file.
<div class="Pp"></div>
For example, suppose in the past you have run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup /usr /usr.backup</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
to back up the /usr directory into the /usr.backup directory, and now want a
  copy of the /usr/local directory the way it was 3 days ago placed at
  /usr/local.old.
<div class="Pp"></div>
One way to do this is to run:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup -r 3D /usr.backup/local
  /usr/local.old</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where above the &quot;3D&quot; means 3 days (for other ways to specify the time,
  see the <b>TIME FORMATS</b> section). The /usr.backup/local directory was
  selected, because that is the directory containing the current version of
  /usr/local.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Note that the option to <b>--restore-as-of</b> always specifies an exact time.
  (So &quot;3D&quot; refers to the instant 72 hours before the present.) If
  there was no backup made at that time, rdiff-backup restores the state
  recorded for the previous backup. For instance, in the above case, if
  &quot;3D&quot; is used, and there are only backups from 2 days and 4 days ago,
  /usr/local as it was 4 days ago will be restored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The second way to restore files involves finding the corresponding increment
  file. It would be in the /backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr directory,
  and its name would be something like
  &quot;local.2002-11-09T12:43:53-04:00.dir&quot; where the time indicates it is
  from 3 days ago. Note that the increment files all end in &quot;.diff&quot;,
  &quot;.snapshot&quot;, &quot;.dir&quot;, or &quot;.missing&quot;, where
  &quot;.missing&quot; just means that the file didn't exist at that time
  (finally, some of these may be gzip-compressed, and have an extra
  &quot;.gz&quot; to indicate this). Then running:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup
  /backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr/local.&lt;time&gt;.dir
  /usr/local.old</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would also restore the file as desired.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you are not sure exactly which version of a file you need, it is probably
  easiest to either restore from the increments files as described immediately
  above, or to see which increments are available with -l/--list-increments, and
  then specify exact times into -r/--restore-as-of.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="TIME_FORMATS"><a class="selflink" href="#TIME_FORMATS">TIME
  FORMATS</a></h1>
rdiff-backup uses time strings in two places. Firstly, all of the increment
  files rdiff-backup creates will have the time in their filenames in the w3
  datetime format as described in a w3 note at
  http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime. Basically they look like
  &quot;2001-07-15T04:09:38-07:00&quot;, which means what it looks like. The
  &quot;-07:00&quot; section means the time zone is 7 hours behind UTC.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Secondly, the <b>-r</b><i>,</i><b> --restore-as-of</b><i>, and
  </i><b>--remove-older-than</b> options take a time string, which can be given
  in any of several formats:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">1.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the string &quot;now&quot; (refers to the current
    time)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">2.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">a sequences of digits, like &quot;123456890&quot;
      (indicating the time in seconds after the epoch)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">3.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A string like &quot;2002-01-25T07:00:00+02:00&quot; in
      datetime format</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">4.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">An interval, which is a number followed by one of the
      characters s, m, h, D, W, M, or Y (indicating seconds, minutes, hours,
      days, weeks, months, or years respectively), or a series of such pairs. In
      this case the string refers to the time that preceded the current time by
      the length of the interval. For instance, &quot;1h78m&quot; indicates the
      time that was one hour and 78 minutes ago. The calendar here is
      unsophisticated: a month is always 30 days, a year is always 365 days, and
      a day is always 86400 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">5.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A date format of the form YYYY/MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD,
      MM/DD/YYYY, or MM-DD-YYYY, which indicates midnight on the day in
      question, relative to the current timezone settings. For instance,
      &quot;2002/3/5&quot;, &quot;03-05-2002&quot;, and &quot;2002-3-05&quot;
      all mean March 5th, 2002.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">6.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">A backup session specification which is a non-negative
      integer followed by 'B'. For instance, '0B' specifies the time of the
      current mirror, and '3B' specifies the time of the 3rd newest increment.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="REMOTE_OPERATION"><a class="selflink" href="#REMOTE_OPERATION">REMOTE
  OPERATION</a></h1>
In order to access remote files, rdiff-backup opens up a pipe to a copy of
  rdiff-backup running on the remote machine. Thus rdiff-backup must be
  installed on both ends. To open this pipe, rdiff-backup first splits the
  filename into host_info::pathname. It then substitutes host_info into the
  remote schema, and runs the resulting command, reading its input and output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The default remote schema is 'ssh -C %s rdiff-backup --server' where host_info
  is substituted for '%s'. So if the host_info is user@host.net, then
  rdiff-backup runs 'ssh user@host.net rdiff-backup --server'. Using
  --remote-schema, rdiff-backup can invoke an arbitrary command in order to open
  up a remote pipe. For instance,
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup --remote-schema 'cd /usr; %s' foo
  'rdiff-backup --server'::bar</div>
is basically equivalent to (but slower than)
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup foo /usr/bar</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Concerning quoting, if for some reason you need to put two consecutive colons in
  the host_info section of a host_info::pathname argument, or in the pathname of
  a local file, you can quote one of them by prepending a backslash. So in
  'a\::b::c', host_info is 'a::b' and the pathname is 'c'. Similarly, if you
  want to refer to a local file whose filename contains two consecutive colons,
  like 'strange::file', you'll have to quote one of the colons as in
  'strange\::file'. Because the backslash is a quote character in these
  circumstances, it too must be quoted to get a literal backslash, so
  'foo\::\\bar' evaluates to 'foo::\bar'. To make things more complicated,
  because the backslash is also a common shell quoting character, you may need
  to type in '\\\\' at the shell prompt to get a literal backslash (if it makes
  you feel better, I had to type in 8 backslashes to get that in this man
  page...). And finally, to include a literal % in the string specified by
  --remote-schema, quote it with another %, as in %%.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Although ssh itself may be secure, using rdiff-backup in the default way
  presents some security risks. For instance if the server is run as root, then
  an attacker who compromised the client could then use rdiff-backup to
  overwrite arbitrary server files by &quot;backing up&quot; over them. Such a
  setup can be made more secure by using the sshd configuration option
  <b>command=&quot;rdiff-backup --server&quot;</b> possibly along with the
  <b>--restrict*</b> options to rdiff-backup. For more information, see the web
  page, the wiki, and the entries for the <b>--restrict*</b> options on this man
  page.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FILE_SELECTION"><a class="selflink" href="#FILE_SELECTION">FILE
  SELECTION</a></h1>
<b>rdiff-backup</b> has a number of file selection options. When rdiff-backup is
  run, it searches through the given source directory and backs up all the files
  matching the specified options. This selection system may appear complicated,
  but it is supposed to be flexible and easy-to-use. If you just want to learn
  the basics, first look at the selection examples in the examples.html file
  included in the package, or on the web at
  <i>http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/examples.html</i>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<b>rdiff-backup</b>'s selection system was originally inspired by
  <b>rsync</b>(1), but there are many differences. (For instance, trailing
  backslashes have no special significance.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The file selection system comprises a number of file selection conditions, which
  are set using one of the following command line options: <b>--exclude</b>,
  <b>--exclude-filelist</b>, <b>--exclude-device-files</b>,
  <b>--exclude-fifos</b>, <b>--exclude-sockets</b>,
  <b>--exclude-symbolic-links</b>, <b>--exclude-globbing-filelist</b>,
  <b>--exclude-globbing-filelist-stdin</b>, <b>--exclude-filelist-stdin</b>,
  <b>--exclude-regexp</b>, <b>--exclude-special-files</b>, <b>--include</b>,
  <b>--include-filelist</b>, <b>--include-globbing-filelist</b>,
  <b>--include-globbing-filelist-stdin</b>, <b>--include-filelist-stdin</b>, and
  <b>--include-regexp</b>. Each file selection condition either matches or
  doesn't match a given file. A given file is excluded by the file selection
  system exactly when the first matching file selection condition specifies that
  the file be excluded; otherwise the file is included. When backing up, if a
  file is excluded, rdiff-backup acts as if that file does not exist in the
  source directory. When restoring, an excluded file is considered not to exist
  in either the source or target directories.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For instance,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup --include /usr --exclude /usr
  /usr /backup</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
is exactly the same as
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup /usr /backup</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
because the include and exclude directives match exactly the same files, and the
  <b>--include</b> comes first, giving it precedence. Similarly,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">rdiff-backup --include /usr/local/bin
  --exclude /usr/local /usr /backup</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would backup the /usr/local/bin directory (and its contents), but not
  /usr/local/doc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>include</b>, <b>exclude</b>, <b>include-globbing-filelist</b>, and
  <b>exclude-globbing-filelist</b> options accept <i>extended shell globbing
  patterns</i>. These patterns can contain the special patterns <b>*</b>,
  <b>**</b>, <b>?</b>, and <b>[...]</b>. As in a normal shell, <b>*</b> can be
  expanded to any string of characters not containing &quot;/&quot;, <b>?</b>
  expands to any character except &quot;/&quot;, and <b>[...]</b> expands to a
  single character of those characters specified (ranges are acceptable). The
  new special pattern, <b>**</b>, expands to any string of characters whether or
  not it contains &quot;/&quot;. Furthermore, if the pattern starts with
  &quot;ignorecase:&quot; (case insensitive), then this prefix will be removed
  and any character in the string can be replaced with an upper- or lowercase
  version of itself.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you need to match filenames which contain the above globbing characters, they
  may be escaped using a backslash &quot;\&quot;. The backslash will only escape
  the character following it so for <b>**</b> you will need to use
  &quot;\*\*&quot; to avoid escaping it to the <b>*</b> globbing character.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Remember that you may need to quote these characters when typing them into a
  shell, so the shell does not interpret the globbing patterns before
  rdiff-backup sees them.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>--exclude </b><i>pattern</i> option matches a file iff:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>pattern</i> can be expanded into the file's filename,
    or</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the file is inside a directory matched by the option.</dd>
</dl>
Conversely, <b>--include </b><i>pattern</i> matches a file iff:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"><i>pattern</i> can be expanded into the file's
    filename,</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the file is inside a directory matched by the option,
    or</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">the file is a directory which contains a file matched by
      the option.</dd>
</dl>
For example,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>--exclude</b> /usr/local</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
matches /usr/local, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape. It is the same
  as --exclude /usr/local --exclude '/usr/local/**'.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>--include</b> /usr/local</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
specifies that /usr, /usr/local, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape
  (but not /usr/doc) all be backed up. Thus you don't have to worry about
  including parent directories to make sure that included subdirectories have
  somewhere to go. Finally,
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;"><b>--include</b>
  ignorecase:'/usr/[a-z0-9]foo/*/**.py'</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
would match a file like /usR/5fOO/hello/there/world.py. If it did match
  anything, it would also match /usr. If there is no existing file that the
  given pattern can be expanded into, the option will not match /usr.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>--include-filelist</b>, <b>--exclude-filelist</b>,
  <b>--include-filelist-stdin</b>, and <b>--exclude-filelist-stdin</b> options
  also introduce file selection conditions. They direct rdiff-backup to read in
  a file, each line of which is a file specification, and to include or exclude
  the matching files. Lines are separated by newlines or nulls, depending on
  whether the --null-separator switch was given. Each line in a filelist is
  interpreted similarly to the way <i>extended shell patterns</i> are, with a
  few exceptions:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Globbing patterns like <b>*</b>, <b>**</b>, <b>?</b>, and
      <b>[...]</b> are not expanded.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Include patterns do not match files in a directory that is
      included. So /usr/local in an include file will not match
    /usr/local/doc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Lines starting with &quot;+ &quot; are interpreted as
      include directives, even if found in a filelist referenced by
      <b>--exclude-filelist</b>. Similarly, lines starting with &quot;- &quot;
      exclude files even if they are found within an include filelist.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
For example, if the file &quot;list.txt&quot; contains the lines:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">/usr/local</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">- /usr/local/doc</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">/usr/local/bin</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">+ /var</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">- /var
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
then &quot;--include-filelist list.txt&quot; would include /usr, /usr/local, and
  /usr/local/bin. It would exclude /usr/local/doc, /usr/local/doc/python, etc.
  It neither excludes nor includes /usr/local/man, leaving the fate of this
  directory to the next specification condition. Finally, it is undefined what
  happens with /var. A single file list should not contain conflicting file
  specifications.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The <b>--include-globbing-filelist</b> and <b>--exclude-globbing-filelist</b>
  options also specify filelists, but each line in the filelist will be
  interpreted as a globbing pattern the way <b>--include</b> and
  <b>--exclude</b> options are interpreted (although &quot;+ &quot; and &quot;-
  &quot; prefixing is still allowed). For instance, if the file
  &quot;globbing-list.txt&quot; contains the lines:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">dir/foo</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">+ dir/bar</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">- **
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
</div>
Then &quot;--include-globbing-filelist globbing-list.txt&quot; would be exactly
  the same as specifying &quot;--include dir/foo --include dir/bar --exclude
  **&quot; on the command line.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Finally, the <b>--include-regexp</b> and <b>--exclude-regexp</b> allow files to
  be included and excluded if their filenames match a python regular expression.
  Regular expression syntax is too complicated to explain here, but is covered
  in Python's library reference. Unlike the <b>--include</b> and
  <b>--exclude</b> options, the regular expression options don't match files
  containing or contained in matched files. So for instance
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">--include '[0-9]{7}(?!foo)'</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
matches any files whose full pathnames contain 7 consecutive digits which aren't
  followed by 'foo'. However, it wouldn't match /home even if /home/ben/1234567
  existed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USERS_AND_GROUPS"><a class="selflink" href="#USERS_AND_GROUPS">USERS
  AND GROUPS</a></h1>
There can be complications preserving ownership across systems. For instance the
  username that owns a file on the source system may not exist on the
  destination. Here is how rdiff-backup maps ownership on the source to the
  destination (or vice-versa, in the case of restoring):
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>1.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If the --preserve-numerical-ids option is given, the remote
      files will always have the same uid and gid, both for ownership and ACL
      entries. This may cause unames and gnames to change.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>2.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Otherwise, attempt to preserve the user and group names for
      ownership and in ACLs. This may result in files having different uids and
      gids across systems.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>3.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">If a name cannot be preserved (e.g. because the username
      does not exist), preserve the original id, but only in cases of user and
      group ownership. For ACLs, omit any entry that has a bad user or group
      name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>4.</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The <b>--user-mapping-file</b> and
      <b>--group-mapping-file</b> options override this behavior. If either of
      these options is given, the policy described in 2 and 3 above will be
      followed, but with the mapped user and group instead of the original. If
      you specify both <b>--preserve-numerical-ids</b> and one of the mapping
      options, the behavior is undefined.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
  </dd>
</dl>
The user and group mapping files both have the same form:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">old_name_or_id1:new_name_or_id1</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">old_name_or_id2:new_name_or_id2</div>
<div style="margin-left: 5.00ex;">&lt;etc&gt;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each line should contain a name or id, followed by a colon &quot;:&quot;,
  followed by another name or id. If a name or id is not listed, they are
  treated in the default way described above.

When restoring, the above behavior is also followed, but note that the original
  source user/group information will be the input, not the already mapped
  user/group information present in the backup repository. For instance, suppose
  you have mapped all the files owned by <i>alice</i> in the source so that they
  are owned by <i>ben</i> in the repository, and now you want to restore, making
  sure the files owned originally by <i>alice</i> are still owned by
  <i>alice</i>. In this case there is no need to use any of the mapping options.
  However, if you wanted to restore the files so that the files originally owned
  by <i>alice</i> on the source are now owned by <i>ben</i>, you would have to
  use the mapping options, even though you just want the unames of the
  repository's files preserved in the restored files.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="STATISTICS"><a class="selflink" href="#STATISTICS">STATISTICS</a></h1>
Every session rdiff-backup saves various statistics into two files, the session
  statistics file at rdiff-backup-data/session_statistics.&lt;time&gt;.data and
  the directory statistics file at
  rdiff-backup-data/directory_statistics.&lt;time&gt;.data. They are both text
  files and contain similar information: how many files changed, how many were
  deleted, the total size of increment files created, etc. However, the session
  statistics file is intended to be very readable and only describes the session
  as a whole. The directory statistics file is more compact (and slightly less
  readable) but describes every directory backed up. It also may be compressed
  to save space.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Statistics-related options include <b>--print-statistics</b> and
  <b>--null-separator</b>.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Also, rdiff-backup will save various messages to the log file, which is
  rdiff-backup-data/backup.log for backup sessions and
  rdiff-backup-data/restore.log for restore sessions. Generally what is written
  to this file will coincide with the messages displayed to stdout or stderr,
  although this can be changed with the <b>--terminal-verbosity</b> option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The log file is not compressed and can become quite large if rdiff-backup is run
  with high verbosity.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="selflink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
If rdiff-backup finishes successfully, the exit status will be 0. If there is an
  unrecoverable (critical) error, it will be non-zero (usually 1, but don't
  depend on this specific value). When setting up rdiff-backup to run
  automatically (as from <b>cron</b>(8) or similar) it is probably a good idea
  to check the exit code.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
The gzip library in versions 2.2 and earlier of python (but fixed in 2.3a1) has
  trouble producing files over 2GB in length. This bug will prevent rdiff-backup
  from producing large compressed increments (snapshots or diffs). A workaround
  is to disable compression for large uncompressable files.
