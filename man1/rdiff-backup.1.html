<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
rdiff-backup is a script, written in python(1) that backs up
one directory to another. The target directory ends up a
copy (mirror) of the source directory, but extra reverse
<br>
diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target
directory, so you can still recover files lost some time
ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror
and <br>
an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves symlinks,
special files, hardlinks, permissions, uid/gid ownership,
and modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup can also operate in
a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync(1).
Thus you can use ssh and rdiff-backup to securely back a
hard drive up to a remote <br>
location, and only the differences will be transmitted.
Using the default settings, rdiff-backup requires that the
remote system accept ssh connections, and that rdiff-backup
is <br>
installed in the user&rsquo;s PATH on the remote system. For
information on other options, see the section on REMOTE
OPERATION.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that you should not write
to the mirror directory except with rdiff-backup. Many of
the increments are stored as reverse diffs, so if you delete
or modify a file, you may <br>
lose the ability to restore previous versions of that
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, this man page is
intended more as a precise description of the behavior and
syntax of rdiff-backup. New users may want to check out the
examples.html file included in <br>
the rdiff-backup distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-b, --backup-mode <br>
Force backup mode even if first argument appears to be an
increment or mirror file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--calculate-average <br>
Enter calculate average mode. The arguments should be a
number of statistics files. rdiff-backup will print the
average of the listed statistics files and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--carbonfile <br>
Enable backup of MacOS X carbonfile information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-destination-dir <br>
If an rdiff-backup session fails, running rdiff-backup with
this option on the destination dir will undo the failed
directory. This happens automatically if you attempt <br>
to back up to a directory and the last backup failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compare <br>
This is equivalent to &rsquo;--compare-at-time
now&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compare-at-time time <br>
Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time.
This can be useful to see how archived data differs from
current data, or to check that a backup is current. <br>
This only compares metadata, in the same way rdiff-backup
decides whether a file has changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compare-full <br>
This is equivalent to &rsquo;--compare-full-at-time
now&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compare-full-at-time time <br>
Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time.
To compare regular files, the repository data will be copied
in its entirety to the source side and compared <br>
byte by byte. This is the slowest but most complete compare
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compare-hash <br>
This is equivalent to &rsquo;--compare-hash-at-time
now&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--compare-hash-at-time time <br>
Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time.
Regular files will be compared by computing their SHA1
digest on the source side and comparing it to the digest
<br>
recorded in the metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--create-full-path <br>
Normally only the final directory of the destination path
will be created if it does not exist. With this option, all
missing directories on the destination path will be <br>
created. Use this option with care: if there is a typo in
the remote path, the remote filesystem could fill up very
quickly (by creating a duplicate backup tree). For this <br>
reason this option is primarily aimed at scripts which
automate backups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--current-time seconds <br>
This option is useful mainly for testing. If set,
rdiff-backup will use it for the current time instead of
consulting the clock. The argument is the number of seconds
<br>
since the epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude shell_pattern <br>
Exclude the file or files matched by shell_pattern. If a
directory is matched, then files under that directory will
also be matched. See the FILE SELECTION section for <br>
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-device-files <br>
Exclude all device files. This can be useful for
security/permissions reasons or if rdiff-backup is not
handling device files correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-fifos <br>
Exclude all fifo files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-filelist filename <br>
Excludes the files listed in filename. If filename is
handwritten you probably want --exclude-globbing-filelist
instead. See the FILE SELECTION section for more
informa&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-filelist-stdin <br>
Like --exclude-filelist, but the list of files will be read
from standard input. See the FILE SELECTION section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-globbing-filelist
filename <br>
Like --exclude-filelist but each line of the filelist will
be interpreted according to the same rules as --include and
--exclude.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-globbing-filelist-stdin
<br>
Like --exclude-globbing-filelist, but the list of files will
be read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-other-filesystems <br>
Exclude files on file systems (identified by device number)
other than the file system the root of the source directory
is on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-regexp regexp <br>
Exclude files matching the given regexp. Unlike the
--exclude option, this option does not match files in a
directory it matches. See the FILE SELECTION section for
more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-special-files <br>
Exclude all device files, fifo files, socket files, and
symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-sockets <br>
Exclude all socket files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-symbolic-links <br>
Exclude all symbolic links. This option is automatically
enabled if the backup source is running on native Windows to
avoid backing-up NTFS reparse points.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude-if-present filename
<br>
Exclude directories if filename is present. This option
needs to come before any other include or exclude
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--force <br>
Authorize a more drastic modification of a directory than
usual (for instance, when overwriting of a destination path,
or when removing multiple sessions with --remove- <br>
older-than). rdiff-backup will generally tell you if it
needs this. WARNING: You can cause data loss if you mis-use
this option. Furthermore, do NOT use this option <br>
when doing a restore, as it will DELETE FILES, unless you
absolutely know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--group-mapping-file filename
<br>
Map group names and ids according the the group mapping file
filename. See the USERS AND GROUPS section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include shell_pattern <br>
Similar to --exclude but include matched files instead.
Unlike --exclude, this option will also match parent
directories of matched files (although not necessarily their
<br>
contents). See the FILE SELECTION section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-filelist filename <br>
Like --exclude-filelist, but include the listed files
instead. If filename is handwritten you probably want
--include-globbing-filelist instead. See the FILE SELECTION
<br>
section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-filelist-stdin <br>
Like --include-filelist, but read the list of included files
from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-globbing-filelist
filename <br>
Like --include-filelist but each line of the filelist will
be interpreted according to the same rules as --include and
--exclude.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-globbing-filelist-stdin
<br>
Like --include-globbing-filelist, but the list of files will
be read from standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-regexp regexp <br>
Include files matching the regular expression regexp. Only
files explicitly matched by regexp will be included by this
option. See the FILE SELECTION section for more <br>
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-special-files <br>
Include all device files, fifo files, socket files, and
symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include-symbolic-links <br>
Include all symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-at-time time <br>
List the files in the archive that were present at the given
time. If a directory in the archive is specified, list only
the files under that directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-changed-since time <br>
List the files that have changed in the destination
directory since the given time. See TIME FORMATS for the
format of time. If a directory in the archive is specified,
<br>
list only the files under that directory. This option does
not read the source directory; it is used to compare the
contents of two different rdiff-backup sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --list-increments <br>
List the number and date of partial incremental backups
contained in the specified destination directory. No backup
or restore will take place if this option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--list-increment-sizes <br>
List the total size of all the increment and mirror files by
time. This may be helpful in deciding how many increments to
keep, and when to --remove-older-than. Specify&acirc; <br>
ing a subdirectory is allowable; then only the sizes of the
mirror and increments pertaining to that subdirectory will
be listed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--max-file-size size <br>
Exclude files that are larger than the given size in
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--min-file-size size <br>
Exclude files that are smaller than the given size in
bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--never-drop-acls <br>
Exit with error instead of dropping acls or acl entries.
Normally this may happen (with a warning) because the
destination does not support them or because the relevant
<br>
user/group names do not exist on the destination side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-acls <br>
No Access Control Lists - disable backup of ACLs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-carbonfile <br>
Disable backup of MacOS X carbonfile information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-compare-inode <br>
This option prevents rdiff-backup from flagging a hardlinked
file as changed when its device number and/or inode changes.
This option is useful in situations where the <br>
source filesystem lacks persistent device and/or inode
numbering. For example, network filesystems may have
mount-to-mount differences in their device number (but
possi&acirc; <br>
bly stable inode numbers); USB/1394 devices may come up at
different device numbers each remount (but would generally
have same inode number); and there are filesystems <br>
which don&rsquo;t even have the same inode numbers from use
to use. Without the option rdiff-backup may generate
unnecessary numbers of tiny diff files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-compression <br>
Disable the default gzip compression of most of the
.snapshot and .diff increment files stored in the
rdiff-backup-data directory. A backup volume can contain
compressed <br>
and uncompressed increments, so using this option
inconsistently is fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-compression-regexp regexp
<br>
Do not compress increments based on files whose filenames
match regexp. The default includes many common audiovisual
and archive files, and may be found in Globals.py.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-eas <br>
No Extended Attributes support - disable backup of EAs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-file-statistics <br>
This will disable writing to the file_statistics file in the
rdiff-backup-data directory. rdiff-backup will run slightly
quicker and take up a bit less space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-hard-links <br>
Don&rsquo;t replicate hard links on destination side. If
many hard-linked files are present, this option can
drastically decrease memory usage. This option is enabled by
<br>
default if the backup source or restore destination is
running on native Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--null-separator <br>
Use nulls ( ) instead of newlines (0 as line separators,
which may help when dealing with filenames containing
newlines. This affects the expected format of the files <br>
specified by the --{include|exclude}-filelist[-stdin]
switches as well as the format of the directory statistics
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--parsable-output <br>
If set, rdiff-backup&rsquo;s output will be tailored for
easy parsing by computers, instead of convenience for
humans. Currently this only applies when listing increments
using <br>
the -l or --list-increments switches, where the time will be
given in seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--override-chars-to-quote <br>
If the filesystem to which we are backing up is not
case-sensitive, automatic &rsquo;quoting&rsquo; of
characters occurs. For example, a file
&rsquo;Developer.doc&rsquo; will be converted into <br>
&rsquo;;068eveloper.doc&rsquo;. To override this behavior,
you need to specify this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--preserve-numerical-ids <br>
If set, rdiff-backup will preserve uids/gids instead of
trying to preserve unames and gnames. See the USERS AND
GROUPS section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--print-statistics <br>
If set, summary statistics will be printed after a
successful backup. If not set, this information will still
be available from the session statistics file. See the
STA&acirc; <br>
TISTICS section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --restore-as-of restore_time
<br>
Restore the specified directory as it was as of
restore_time. See the TIME FORMATS section for more
information on the format of restore_time, and see the
RESTORING sec&acirc; <br>
tion for more information on restoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-cmd cmd <br>
Deprecated. Please use --remote-schema instead</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-schema schema <br>
Specify an alternate method of connecting to a remote
computer. This is necessary to get rdiff-backup not to use
ssh for remote backups, or if, for instance, rdiff-backup
<br>
is not in the PATH on the remote side. See the REMOTE
OPERATION section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remote-tempdir path <br>
Adds the --tempdir option with argument path when invoking
remote instances of rdiff-backup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--remove-older-than time_spec
<br>
Remove the incremental backup information in the destination
directory that has been around longer than the given time.
time_spec can be either an absolute time, like <br>
&quot;2002-01-04&quot;, or a time interval. The time
interval is an integer followed by the character s, m, h, D,
W, M, or Y, indicating seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
<br>
months, or years respectively, or a number of these
concatenated. For example, 32m means 32 minutes, and
3W2D10h7s means 3 weeks, 2 days, 10 hours, and 7 seconds. In
<br>
this context, a month means 30 days, a year is 365 days, and
a day is always 86400 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup cannot
remove-older-than and back up or restore in a single
session. In order to both backup a directory and remove old
files in it, you must run rdiff- <br>
backup twice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, rdiff-backup will
only delete information from one session at a time. To
remove two or more sessions at the same time, supply the
--force option (rdiff-backup <br>
will tell you if --force is required).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that snapshots of deleted
files are covered by this operation. Thus if you deleted a
file two weeks ago, backed up immediately afterwards, and
then ran rdiff-backup <br>
with --remove-older-than 10D today, no trace of that file
would remain. Finally, file selection options such as
--include and --exclude don&rsquo;t affect
--remove-older-than.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict path <br>
Require that all file access be inside the given path. This
switch, and the following two, are intended to be used with
the --server switch to provide a bit more protec&acirc; <br>
tion when doing automated remote backups. They are not
intended as your only line of defense so please don&rsquo;t
do something silly like allow public access to an rdiff-
<br>
backup server run with --restrict-read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict-read-only path <br>
Like --restrict, but also reject all write requests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--restrict-update-only path <br>
Like --restrict, but only allow writes as part of an
incremental backup. Requests for other types of writes (for
instance, deleting path) will be rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--server <br>
Enter server mode (not to be invoked directly, but instead
used by another rdiff-backup process on a remote
computer).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ssh-no-compression <br>
When running ssh, do not use the -C option to enable
compression. --ssh-no-compression is ignored if you specify
a new schema using --remote-schema.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--tempdir path <br>
Sets the directory that rdiff-backup uses for temporary
files to the given path. The environment variables TMPDIR,
TEMP, and TMP can also be used to set the temporary <br>
files directory. See the documentation of the Python
tempfile module for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--terminal-verbosity [0-9] <br>
Select which messages will be displayed to the terminal. If
missing the level defaults to the verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--test-server <br>
Test for the presence of a compatible rdiff-backup server as
specified in the following host::filename argument(s). The
filename section will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--user-mapping-file filename
<br>
Map user names and ids according to the user mapping file
filename. See the USERS AND GROUPS section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v[0-9], --verbosity [0-9] <br>
Specify verbosity level (0 is totally silent, 3 is the
default, and 9 is noisiest). This determines how much is
written to the log file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify <br>
This is short for --verify-at-time now</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify-at-time now <br>
Check all the data in the repository at the given time by
computing the SHA1 hash of all the regular files and
comparing them with the hashes stored in the metadata
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Print the current version and exit</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESTORING <br>
There are two ways to tell rdiff-backup to restore a file or
directory. Firstly, you can run rdiff-backup on a mirror
file and use the -r or --restore-as-of options. Secondly,
<br>
you can run it on an increment file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, suppose in the past
you have run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup /usr
/usr.backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to back up the /usr directory
into the /usr.backup directory, and now want a copy of the
/usr/local directory the way it was 3 days ago placed at
/usr/local.old.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">One way to do this is to
run:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup -r 3D
/usr.backup/local /usr/local.old</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where above the &quot;3D&quot;
means 3 days (for other ways to specify the time, see the
TIME FORMATS section). The /usr.backup/local directory was
selected, because that is the directory <br>
containing the current version of /usr/local.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the option to
--restore-as-of always specifies an exact time. (So
&quot;3D&quot; refers to the instant 72 hours before the
present.) If there was no backup made at that time, <br>
rdiff-backup restores the state recorded for the previous
backup. For instance, in the above case, if &quot;3D&quot;
is used, and there are only backups from 2 days and 4 days
ago, <br>
/usr/local as it was 4 days ago will be restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The second way to restore files
involves finding the corresponding increment file. It would
be in the /backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr
directory, and its name would be <br>
something like
&quot;local.2002-11-09T12:43:53-04:00.dir&quot; where the
time indicates it is from 3 days ago. Note that the
increment files all end in &quot;.diff&quot;,
&quot;.snapshot&quot;, &quot;.dir&quot;, or <br>
&quot;.missing&quot;, where &quot;.missing&quot; just means
that the file didn&rsquo;t exist at that time (finally, some
of these may be gzip-compressed, and have an extra
&quot;.gz&quot; to indicate this). Then <br>
running:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup
/backup/rdiff-backup-data/increments/usr/local.&lt;time&gt;.dir
/usr/local.old</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would also restore the file as
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are not sure exactly
which version of a file you need, it is probably easiest to
either restore from the increments files as described
immediately above, or to see which <br>
increments are available with -l/--list-increments, and then
specify exact times into -r/--restore-as-of.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIME FORMATS <br>
rdiff-backup uses time strings in two places. Firstly, all
of the increment files rdiff-backup creates will have the
time in their filenames in the w3 datetime format as <br>
described in a w3 note at
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime. Basically they look like
&quot;2001-07-15T04:09:38-07:00&quot;, which means what it
looks like. The &quot;-07:00&quot; section means <br>
the time zone is 7 hours behind UTC.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Secondly, the -r,
--restore-as-of, and --remove-older-than options take a time
string, which can be given in any of several formats:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. the string &quot;now&quot;
(refers to the current time)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. a sequences of digits, like
&quot;123456890&quot; (indicating the time in seconds after
the epoch)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. A string like
&quot;2002-01-25T07:00:00+02:00&quot; in datetime format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. An interval, which is a
number followed by one of the characters s, m, h, D, W, M,
or Y (indicating seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
months, or years respectively), <br>
or a series of such pairs. In this case the string refers to
the time that preceded the current time by the length of the
interval. For instance, &quot;1h78m&quot; indicates the <br>
time that was one hour and 78 minutes ago. The calendar here
is unsophisticated: a month is always 30 days, a year is
always 365 days, and a day is always 86400 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">5. A date format of the form
YYYY/MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, or MM-DD-YYYY, which
indicates midnight on the day in question, relative to the
current timezone settings. <br>
For instance, &quot;2002/3/5&quot;, &quot;03-05-2002&quot;,
and &quot;2002-3-05&quot; all mean March 5th, 2002.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6. A backup session
specification which is a non-negative integer followed by
&rsquo;B&rsquo;. For instance, &rsquo;0B&rsquo; specifies
the time of the current mirror, and &rsquo;3B&rsquo;
specifies the time <br>
of the 3rd newest increment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REMOTE OPERATION <br>
In order to access remote files, rdiff-backup opens up a
pipe to a copy of rdiff-backup running on the remote
machine. Thus rdiff-backup must be installed on both ends.
To open <br>
this pipe, rdiff-backup first splits the filename into
host_info::pathname. It then substitutes host_info into the
remote schema, and runs the resulting command, reading its
<br>
input and output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default remote schema is
&rsquo;ssh -C %s rdiff-backup --server&rsquo; where
host_info is substituted for &rsquo;%s&rsquo;. So if the
host_info is user@host.net, then rdiff-backup runs
&rsquo;ssh <br>
user@host.net rdiff-backup --server&rsquo;. Using
--remote-schema, rdiff-backup can invoke an arbitrary
command in order to open up a remote pipe. For instance,
<br>
rdiff-backup --remote-schema &rsquo;cd /usr; %s&rsquo; foo
&rsquo;rdiff-backup --server&rsquo;::bar <br>
is basically equivalent to (but slower than) <br>
rdiff-backup foo /usr/bar</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Concerning quoting, if for some
reason you need to put two consecutive colons in the
host_info section of a host_info::pathname argument, or in
the pathname of a local file, you <br>
can quote one of them by prepending a backslash. So in
&rsquo;a :b::c&rsquo;, host_info is &rsquo;a::b&rsquo; and
the pathname is &rsquo;c&rsquo;. Similarly, if you want to
refer to a local file whose filename <br>
contains two consecutive colons, like
&rsquo;strange::file&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll have to quote one
of the colons as in &rsquo;strange:file&rsquo;. Because the
backslash is a quote character in these circum&acirc; <br>
stances, it too must be quoted to get a literal backslash, r
&rsquo; . so &rsquo;foo:\bar&rsquo; evaluates to
&rsquo;foo::Tke things more complicated, o m because the
backslash is also a common <br>
shell quoting character, you may need to type in
&rsquo;\\&rsquo; at the shell prompt to get a literal
backslash (if it makes you feel better, I had to type in 8
backslashes to get that in <br>
this man page...). And finally, to include a literal % in
the string specified by --remote-schema, quote it with
another %, as in %%.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Although ssh itself may be
secure, using rdiff-backup in the default way presents some
security risks. For instance if the server is run as root,
then an attacker who compro&acirc; <br>
mised the client could then use rdiff-backup to overwrite
arbitrary server files by &quot;backing up&quot; over them.
Such a setup can be made more secure by using the sshd
configuration <br>
option command=&quot;rdiff-backup --server&quot; possibly
along with the --restrict* options to rdiff-backup. For more
information, see the web page, the wiki, and the entries for
the <br>
--restrict* options on this man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILE SELECTION <br>
rdiff-backup has a number of file selection options. When
rdiff-backup is run, it searches through the given source
directory and backs up all the files matching the specified
<br>
options. This selection system may appear complicated, but
it is supposed to be flexible and easy-to-use. If you just
want to learn the basics, first look at the selection <br>
examples in the examples.html file included in the package,
or on the web at
http://rdiff-backup.nongnu.org/examples.html</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup&rsquo;s selection
system was originally inspired by rsync(1), but there are
many differences. (For instance, trailing backslashes have
no special significance.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file selection system
comprises a number of file selection conditions, which are
set using one of the following command line options:
--exclude, --exclude-filelist, <br>
--exclude-device-files, --exclude-fifos, --exclude-sockets,
--exclude-symbolic-links, --exclude-globbing-filelist,
--exclude-globbing-filelist-stdin, --exclude-filelist-stdin,
<br>
--exclude-regexp, --exclude-special-files, --include,
--include-filelist, --include-globbing-filelist,
--include-globbing-filelist-stdin, --include-filelist-stdin,
and --include- <br>
regexp. Each file selection condition either matches or
doesn&rsquo;t match a given file. A given file is excluded
by the file selection system exactly when the first matching
file <br>
selection condition specifies that the file be excluded;
otherwise the file is included. When backing up, if a file
is excluded, rdiff-backup acts as if that file does not
exist <br>
in the source directory. When restoring, an excluded file is
considered not to exist in either the source or target
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instance,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup --include /usr
--exclude /usr /usr /backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">is exactly the same as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup /usr /backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because the include and exclude
directives match exactly the same files, and the --include
comes first, giving it precedence. Similarly,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rdiff-backup --include
/usr/local/bin --exclude /usr/local /usr /backup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would backup the /usr/local/bin
directory (and its contents), but not /usr/local/doc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The include, exclude,
include-globbing-filelist, and exclude-globbing-filelist
options accept extended shell globbing patterns. These
patterns can contain the special patterns <br>
*, **, ?, and [...]. As in a normal shell, * can be expanded
to any string of characters not containing &quot;/&quot;, ?
expands to any character except &quot;/&quot;, and [...]
expands to a sin&acirc; <br>
gle character of those characters specified (ranges are
acceptable). The new special pattern, **, expands to any
string of characters whether or not it contains
&quot;/&quot;. Further&acirc; <br>
more, if the pattern starts with &quot;ignorecase:&quot;
(case insensitive), then this prefix will be removed and any
character in the string can be replaced with an upper- or
lowercase <br>
version of itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you need to match filenames
which contain the above globbing characters, they may be
escaped using a backslash &quot; <br>
so for ** you will need to use &quot;to avoid escaping it to
the * globbing character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Remember that you may need to
quote these characters when typing them into a shell, so the
shell does not interpret the globbing patterns before
rdiff-backup sees them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --exclude pattern option
matches a file iff:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. pattern can be expanded into
the file&rsquo;s filename, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. the file is inside a
directory matched by the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Conversely, --include pattern
matches a file iff:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. pattern can be expanded into
the file&rsquo;s filename,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. the file is inside a
directory matched by the option, or</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. the file is a directory which
contains a file matched by the option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--exclude /usr/local</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">matches /usr/local,
/usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape. It is the same
as --exclude /usr/local --exclude
&rsquo;/usr/local/**&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include /usr/local</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifies that /usr, /usr/local,
/usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape (but not
/usr/doc) all be backed up. Thus you don&rsquo;t have to
worry about including parent directories <br>
to make sure that included subdirectories have somewhere to
go. Finally,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include
ignorecase:&rsquo;/usr/[a-z0-9]foo/*/**.py&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">would match a file like
/usR/5fOO/hello/there/world.py. If it did match anything, it
would also match /usr. If there is no existing file that the
given pattern can be expanded <br>
into, the option will not match /usr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --include-filelist,
--exclude-filelist, --include-filelist-stdin, and
--exclude-filelist-stdin options also introduce file
selection conditions. They direct rdiff-backup to <br>
read in a file, each line of which is a file specification,
and to include or exclude the matching files. Lines are
separated by newlines or nulls, depending on whether the
<br>
--null-separator switch was given. Each line in a filelist
is interpreted similarly to the way extended shell patterns
are, with a few exceptions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. Globbing patterns like *, **,
?, and [...] are not expanded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Include patterns do not match
files in a directory that is included. So /usr/local in an
include file will not match /usr/local/doc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. Lines starting with &quot;+
&quot; are interpreted as include directives, even if found
in a filelist referenced by --exclude-filelist. Similarly,
lines starting with &quot;- &quot; exclude <br>
files even if they are found within an include filelist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, if the file
&quot;list.txt&quot; contains the lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">/usr/local <br>
- /usr/local/doc <br>
/usr/local/bin <br>
+ /var <br>
- /var</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">then &quot;--include-filelist
list.txt&quot; would include /usr, /usr/local, and
/usr/local/bin. It would exclude /usr/local/doc,
/usr/local/doc/python, etc. It neither excludes nor <br>
includes /usr/local/man, leaving the fate of this directory
to the next specification condition. Finally, it is
undefined what happens with /var. A single file list should
not <br>
contain conflicting file specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The --include-globbing-filelist
and --exclude-globbing-filelist options also specify
filelists, but each line in the filelist will be interpreted
as a globbing pattern the way <br>
--include and --exclude options are interpreted (although
&quot;+ &quot; and &quot;- &quot; prefixing is still
allowed). For instance, if the file
&quot;globbing-list.txt&quot; contains the lines:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">dir/foo <br>
+ dir/bar <br>
- **</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Then
&quot;--include-globbing-filelist globbing-list.txt&quot;
would be exactly the same as specifying &quot;--include
dir/foo --include dir/bar --exclude **&quot; on the command
line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, the --include-regexp
and --exclude-regexp allow files to be included and excluded
if their filenames match a python regular expression.
Regular expression syntax is too <br>
complicated to explain here, but is covered in
Python&rsquo;s library reference. Unlike the --include and
--exclude options, the regular expression options
don&rsquo;t match files contain&acirc; <br>
ing or contained in matched files. So for instance</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--include
&rsquo;[0-9]{7}(?!foo)&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">matches any files whose full
pathnames contain 7 consecutive digits which aren&rsquo;t
followed by &rsquo;foo&rsquo;. However, it wouldn&rsquo;t
match /home even if /home/ben/1234567 existed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USERS AND GROUPS <br>
There can be complications preserving ownership across
systems. For instance the username that owns a file on the
source system may not exist on the destination. Here is how
<br>
rdiff-backup maps ownership on the source to the destination
(or vice-versa, in the case of restoring):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">1. If the
--preserve-numerical-ids option is given, the remote files
will always have the same uid and gid, both for ownership
and ACL entries. This may cause unames and <br>
gnames to change.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">2. Otherwise, attempt to
preserve the user and group names for ownership and in ACLs.
This may result in files having different uids and gids
across systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">3. If a name cannot be preserved
(e.g. because the username does not exist), preserve the
original id, but only in cases of user and group ownership.
For ACLs, omit any <br>
entry that has a bad user or group name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4. The --user-mapping-file and
--group-mapping-file options override this behavior. If
either of these options is given, the policy described in 2
and 3 above will be fol&acirc; <br>
lowed, but with the mapped user and group instead of the
original. If you specify both --preserve-numerical-ids and
one of the mapping options, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user and group mapping files
both have the same form:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">old_name_or_id1:new_name_or_id1
<br>
old_name_or_id2:new_name_or_id2 <br>
&lt;etc&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each line should contain a name
or id, followed by a colon &quot;:&quot;, followed by
another name or id. If a name or id is not listed, they are
treated in the default way described <br>
above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When restoring, the above
behavior is also followed, but note that the original source
user/group information will be the input, not the already
mapped user/group information <br>
present in the backup repository. For instance, suppose you
have mapped all the files owned by alice in the source so
that they are owned by ben in the repository, and now you
<br>
want to restore, making sure the files owned originally by
alice are still owned by alice. In this case there is no
need to use any of the mapping options. However, if you <br>
wanted to restore the files so that the files originally
owned by alice on the source are now owned by ben, you would
have to use the mapping options, even though you just want
<br>
the unames of the repository&rsquo;s files preserved in the
restored files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STATISTICS <br>
Every session rdiff-backup saves various statistics into two
files, the session statistics file at
rdiff-backup-data/session_statistics.&lt;time&gt;.data and
the directory statistics <br>
file at
rdiff-backup-data/directory_statistics.&lt;time&gt;.data.
They are both text files and contain similar information:
how many files changed, how many were deleted, the total
<br>
size of increment files created, etc. However, the session
statistics file is intended to be very readable and only
describes the session as a whole. The directory statistics
<br>
file is more compact (and slightly less readable) but
describes every directory backed up. It also may be
compressed to save space.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Statistics-related options
include --print-statistics and --null-separator.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Also, rdiff-backup will save
various messages to the log file, which is
rdiff-backup-data/backup.log for backup sessions and
rdiff-backup-data/restore.log for restore sessions. <br>
Generally what is written to this file will coincide with
the messages displayed to stdout or stderr, although this
can be changed with the --terminal-verbosity option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The log file is not compressed
and can become quite large if rdiff-backup is run with high
verbosity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
If rdiff-backup finishes successfully, the exit status will
be 0. If there is an unrecoverable (critical) error, it will
be non-zero (usually 1, but don&rsquo;t depend on this
spe&acirc; <br>
cific value). When setting up rdiff-backup to run
automatically (as from cron(8) or similar) it is probably a
good idea to check the exit code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The gzip library in versions 2.2 and earlier of python (but
fixed in 2.3a1) has trouble producing files over 2GB in
length. This bug will prevent rdiff-backup from producing
<br>
large compressed increments (snapshots or diffs). A
workaround is to disable compression for large
uncompressable files.</p>
