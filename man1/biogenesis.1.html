This program imitates the evolutionary processes that happens on unicellular
  organism populations in nature. It has been tried to create an example of the
  elemental bacterial processes, simplifying them a lot and presenting them in a
  visual and comprehensible manner. Although it is not scientifically exact,
  regular mechanisms on bacterial evolution and life can be observed and it can
  be interesting as a didactic approximation to concepts like mutation,
  evolution or photosynthesis. It is also a good entertainment.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The organisms that will populate this world are not representations of natural
  unicellular organisms, but an abstraction has been used to be able to look
  more clearly at their virtual life. These organisms are formed by segments of
  different colors and lengths. The organism's segments color and length
  establish its properties, so that we can know what can an organism do only by
  looking at it on the screen. Moreover, these segments' configuration is a
  representation in the world of its genetic code, which its descendants will
  inherit in an identical form, with the exception of random mutations that can
  happen in each generation.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Organisms that obtain beneficial mutations will be the most successful ones, on
  the reproductive point of view, and will create a large number of descendants
  that will propagate its genes and its mutation in the future. However, those
  that suffer from a less appropriate mutation will not take a long time to die
  without being able to extend their species' lives longer than their own lives.

This program has a high CPU consumption. You need to set a few parameters in
  order to adapt it to your hardware.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These are the parameters that you should configure. Remember that you can do
  this by selecting the <b>Parameters</b> option under the <b>World</b> menu.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 * <b>OpenGL</b>: The use of the OpenGL libraries greatly increases program's
  speed. This option is deselected by default because it doesn't work on all
  hardware and drivers combinations. You should try to enable it and restart the
  program. If it crashes or doesn't work, OpenGL will be disabled next time you
  run it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 * <b>Disable fbobject</b>: Due to a bug in some graphic drivers, it may be
  necessary to activate this option for the OpenGL to work. If the first time
  that you try to activate them they don't work, try to activate them with this
  option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 * <b>Time per frame</b>: This parameter controls the speed that the program
  will try to reach. If it is consuming a lot of CPU you should raise it, and if
  it is not and you want the process to execute faster, you should lower it.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>
 * <b>Initial carbon dioxide</b>: The CO2 is the limiting factor to life
  expansion. More CO2 means more organisms will populate the world, and more CPU
  needed to calculate their moves and draw them. If you change this parameter,
  it may be a good idea to change the world size accordingly to keep the same
  CO2 concentration.
