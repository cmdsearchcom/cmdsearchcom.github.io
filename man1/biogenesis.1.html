<p>BIOGENESIS(1) Biogenesis BIOGENESIS(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
biogenesis - Biogenesis, an artificial life program focused
on evolution</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
biogenesis [RANDOM_SEED]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program imitates the evolutionary processes that
happens on unicellular organism populations in nature. It
has been tried to create an example of the elemental
bacterial <br>
processes, simplifying them a lot and presenting them in a
visual and comprehensible manner. Although it is not
scientifically exact, regular mechanisms on bacterial
evolution <br>
and life can be observed and it can be interesting as a
didactic approximation to concepts like mutation, evolution
or photosynthesis. It is also a good entertainment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The organisms that will populate
this world are not representations of natural unicellular
organisms, but an abstraction has been used to be able to
look more clearly at their <br>
virtual life. These organisms are formed by segments of
different colors and lengths. The organism&rsquo;s segments
color and length establish its properties, so that we can
know what <br>
can an organism do only by looking at it on the screen.
Moreover, these segments&rsquo; configuration is a
representation in the world of its genetic code, which its
descendants will <br>
inherit in an identical form, with the exception of random
mutations that can happen in each generation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Organisms that obtain beneficial
mutations will be the most successful ones, on the
reproductive point of view, and will create a large number
of descendants that will propagate <br>
its genes and its mutation in the future. However, those
that suffer from a less appropriate mutation will not take a
long time to die without being able to extend their
species&rsquo; <br>
lives longer than their own lives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
RANDOM_SEED <br>
This number determines the sequence of the random numbers
that will be generated. This way it is possible to recreate
several times the same scenario if the same number is <br>
introduced.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PERFORMANCE <br>
This program has a high CPU consumption. You need to set a
few parameters in order to adapt it to your hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are the parameters that
you should configure. Remember that you can do this by
selecting the Parameters option under the World menu.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* OpenGL: The use of the OpenGL
libraries greatly increases program&rsquo;s speed. This
option is deselected by default because it doesn&rsquo;t
work on all hardware and drivers combina&acirc; <br>
tions. You should try to enable it and restart the program.
If it crashes or doesn&rsquo;t work, OpenGL will be disabled
next time you run it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Disable fbobject: Due to a bug
in some graphic drivers, it may be necessary to activate
this option for the OpenGL to work. If the first time that
you try to activate them <br>
they don&rsquo;t work, try to activate them with this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Time per frame: This parameter
controls the speed that the program will try to reach. If it
is consuming a lot of CPU you should raise it, and if it is
not and you want the <br>
process to execute faster, you should lower it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Initial carbon dioxide: The
CO2 is the limiting factor to life expansion. More CO2 means
more organisms will populate the world, and more CPU needed
to calculate their moves <br>
and draw them. If you change this parameter, it may be a
good idea to change the world size accordingly to keep the
same CO2 concentration.</p>
