<p>MKVINFO(1) User Commands MKVINFO(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mkvinfo - Print information about elements in Matroska(TM)
files</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mkvinfo [options] {source-filename}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This program lists all elements contained in a Matroska(TM).
The output can be limited to a list of tracks in the file
including information about the codecs used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gui <br>
Start the GUI. This option is only available if mkvinfo was
compiled with GUI support.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c, --checksums <br>
Calculates and display the Adler32 checksum for each frame.
Useful for debugging only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --summary <br>
Only show a terse summary of what mkvinfo(1) finds and not
each element.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --track-info <br>
Show statistics for each track in verbose mode. Also sets
verbosity to 1 if it was at level 0 before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --hexdump <br>
Show the first 16 bytes of each frame as a hex dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --full-hexdump <br>
Show all bytes of each frame as a hex dump.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z, --size <br>
Show the size of each element including its header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--command-line-charset
character-set <br>
Sets the character set to convert strings given on the
command line from. It defaults to the character set given by
system&rsquo;s current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--output-charset character-set
<br>
Sets the character set to which strings are converted that
are to be output. It defaults to the character set given by
system&rsquo;s current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r, --redirect-output file-name
<br>
Writes all messages to the file file-name instead of to the
console. While this can be done easily with output
redirection there are cases in which this option is needed:
<br>
when the terminal reinterprets the output before writing it
to a file. The character set set with --output-charset is
honored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--ui-language code <br>
Forces the translations for the language code to be used
(e.g. &rsquo;de_DE&rsquo; for the German translations).
Entering &rsquo;list&rsquo; as the code will cause the
program to output a list of <br>
available translations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--debug topic <br>
Turn on debugging for a specific feature. This option is
only useful for developers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--engage feature <br>
Turn on experimental features. A list of available features
can be requested with mkvinfo --engage list. These features
are not meant to be used in normal situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--gui-mode <br>
Turns on GUI mode. In this mode specially-formatted lines
may be output that can tell a controlling GUI what&rsquo;s
happening. These messages follow the format
&rsquo;#GUI#message&rsquo;. The <br>
message may be followed by key/value pairs as in
&rsquo;#GUI#message#key1=value1#key2=value2...&rsquo;.
Neither the messages nor the keys are ever translated and
always output in <br>
English.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This switch has nothing to do
with the --gui parameter which causes mkvinfo to display its
own GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Be more verbose. See the section about verbosity levels for
a description which information will be output at which
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Show usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Show version information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--check-for-updates <br>
Checks online for new releases by downloading the URL
http://mkvtoolnix-releases.bunkus.org/latest-release.xml.
Four lines will be output in key=value style: the URL from
<br>
where the information was retrieved (key version_check_url),
the currently running version (key running_version), the
latest release&rsquo;s version (key available_version) and
the <br>
download URL (key download_url).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Afterwards the program exists
with an exit code of 0 if no newer release is available,
with 1 if a newer release is available and with 2 if an
error occured (e.g. if the <br>
update information could not be retrieved).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option is only available if
the program was built with support for libcurl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@options-file.json <br>
Reads additional command line arguments from the file
options-file. For a full explanation on the supported
formats for such files see the section called &quot;Option
files&quot; in <br>
the mkvmerge(1) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VERBOSITY LEVELS <br>
The -v option can be used to increase mkvinfo(1)&rsquo;s
verbosity level and print more information about the current
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At level 0 mkvinfo(1) will print
only the track headers it finds and their types. mkvinfo(1)
will exit as soon as the headers are parsed completely (more
technical: as soon as <br>
the first cluster is encountered). In this level the seek
head entries and the cues will not be displayed -- even if
they&rsquo;re located in front of the track information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At level 1 mkvinfo(1) will also
print all Matroska(TM) elements encountered for the complete
file but the seek head entries and the cue entries. If the
summary mode is enabled <br>
then mkvinfo(1) will output the frame position as well.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At level 2 mkvinfo(1) will also
print the seek head entries, the cue entries and the file
position at which each Matroska(TM) element can be found
at.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At level 3 and above mkvinfo(1)
will print some information that is not directly connected
to a Matroska(TM) element. All other elements only print
stuff about the elements that <br>
were just found. Level 3 adds meta information to ease
debugging (read: it&rsquo;s intended for developers only).
All lines written by level 3 are enclosed in square brackets
to make <br>
filtering them out easy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEXT FILES AND CHARACTER SET
CONVERSIONS <br>
For an in-depth discussion about how all tools in the
MKVToolNix suite handle character set conversions,
input/output encoding, command line encoding and console
encoding please <br>
see the identically-named section in the mkvmerge(1) man
page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT CODES <br>
mkvinfo(1) exits with one of three exit codes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 0 -- This exit
codes means that the run has completed successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 1 -- In this
case mkvinfo(1) has output at least one warning, but the run
did continue. A warning is prefixed with the text
&rsquo;Warning:&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 2 -- This exit
code is used after an error occurred. mkvinfo(1) aborts
right after outputting the error message. Error messages
range from wrong command line arguments over <br>
read/write errors to broken files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ESCAPING SPECIAL CHARS IN TEXT
<br>
There are a few places in which special characters in text
must or should be escaped. The rules for escaping are
simple: each character that needs escaping is replaced with
a <br>
backslash followed by another character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The rules are: &rsquo; &rsquo;
(a space) becomes &rsquo; &rsquo;&quot;&rsquo; (double
quotes) becomes &rsquo;2&rsquo;, &rsquo;:&rsquo; becomes
&rsquo; ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
mkvinfo(1) uses the default variables that determine the
system&rsquo;s locale (e.g. LANG and the LC_* family).
Additional variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKVINFO_DEBUG, MKVTOOLNIX_DEBUG
and its short form MTX_DEBUG <br>
The content is treated as if it had been passed via the
--debug option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKVINFO_ENGAGE,
MKVTOOLNIX_ENGAGE and its short form MTX_ENGAGE <br>
The content is treated as if it had been passed via the
--engage option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MKVINFO_OPTIONS,
MKVTOOLNIX_OPTIONS and its short form MTX_OPTIONS <br>
The content is split on white space. The resulting partial
strings are treated as if it had been passed as command line
options. If you need to pass special characters (e.g. <br>
spaces) then you have to escape them (see the section about
escaping special characters in text).</p>
