<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccache-swig - a fast compiler cache</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccache-swig [OPTION]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccache-swig &lt;compiler&gt;
[COMPILER OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&lt;compiler&gt; [COMPILER
OPTIONS]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ccache-swig is a compiler cache. It speeds up re-compilation
of C/C++/SWIG code by caching previous compiles and
detecting when the same compile is being done again.
ccache-swig <br>
is ccache plus support for SWIG. ccache and ccache-swig are
used interchangeably in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS SUMMARY <br>
Here is a summary of the options to ccache-swig.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s show statistics summary <br>
-z zero statistics <br>
-c run a cache cleanup <br>
-C clear the cache completely <br>
-F &lt;n&gt; set maximum files in cache <br>
-M &lt;n&gt; set maximum size of cache (use G, M or K) <br>
-h this help page <br>
-V print version number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
These options only apply when you invoke ccache as
&quot;ccache-swig&quot;. When invoked as a compiler none of
these options apply. In that case your normal compiler
options apply and you <br>
should refer to your compilers documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h Print a options summary
page</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Print the current statistics
summary for the cache. The statistics are stored spread
across the subdirectories of the cache. Using
&quot;ccache-swig -s&quot; adds up the statistics <br>
across all subdirectories and prints the totals.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Zero the cache
statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V Print the ccache version
number</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Clean the cache and
re-calculate the cache file count and size totals. Normally
the -c option should not be necessary as ccache keeps the
cache below the specified limits <br>
at runtime and keeps statistics up to date on each compile.
This option is mostly useful if you manually modify the
cache contents or believe that the cache size statis&acirc;
<br>
tics may be inaccurate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C Clear the entire cache,
removing all cached files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F &lt;maxfiles&gt; <br>
This sets the maximum number of files allowed in the cache.
The value is stored inside the cache directory and applies
to all future compiles. Due to the way the value is <br>
stored the actual value used is always rounded down to the
nearest multiple of 16.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M &lt;maxsize&gt; <br>
This sets the maximum cache size. You can specify a value in
gigabytes, megabytes or kilobytes by appending a G, M or K
to the value. The default is gigabytes. The actual <br>
value stored is rounded down to the nearest multiple of 16
kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INSTALLATION <br>
There are two ways to use ccache. You can either prefix your
compile commands with &quot;ccache-swig&quot; or you can
create a symbolic link between ccache-swig and the names of
your com&acirc; <br>
pilers. The first method is most convenient if you just want
to try out ccache or wish to use it for some specific
projects. The second method is most useful for when you wish
to <br>
use ccache for all your compiles.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To install for usage by the
first method just copy ccache-swig to somewhere in your
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To install for the second method
do something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/
<br>
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/gcc <br>
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/g++ <br>
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/cc <br>
ln -s /usr/local/bin/ccache-swig /usr/local/bin/swig</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will work as long as
/usr/local/bin comes before the path to gcc (which is
usually in /usr/bin). After installing you may wish to run
&quot;which gcc&quot; to make sure that the cor&acirc; <br>
rect link is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note! Do not use a hard link,
use a symbolic link. A hardlink will cause
&quot;interesting&quot; problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXTRA OPTIONS <br>
When run as a compiler front end ccache usually just takes
the same command line options as the compiler you are using.
The only exception to this is the option
&acirc;--ccache-skip&acirc;. <br>
That option can be used to tell ccache that the next option
is definitely not a input filename, and should be passed
along to the compiler as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The reason this can be important
is that ccache does need to parse the command line and
determine what is an input filename and what is a compiler
option, as it needs the input <br>
filename to determine the name of the resulting object file
(among other things). The heuristic ccache uses in this
parse is that any string on the command line that exists as
a <br>
file is treated as an input file name (usually a C file). By
using --ccache-skip you can force an option to not be
treated as an input file name and instead be passed along to
<br>
the compiler as a command line option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
ccache uses a number of environment variables to control
operation. In most cases you won&acirc;t need any of these
as the defaults will be fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_DIR <br>
the CCACHE_DIR environment variable specifies where ccache
will keep its cached compiler output. The default is
&quot;$HOME/.ccache&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_TEMPDIR <br>
the CCACHE_TEMPDIR environment variable specifies where
ccache will put temporary files. The default is the same as
CCACHE_DIR. Note that the CCACHE_TEMPDIR path must be <br>
on the same filesystem as the CCACHE_DIR path, so that
renames of files between the two directories can work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_LOGFILE <br>
If you set the CCACHE_LOGFILE environment variable then
ccache will write some log information on cache hits and
misses in that file. This is useful for tracking down <br>
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_VERBOSE <br>
If you set the CCACHE_VERBOSE environment variable then
ccache will display on stdout all the compiler invocations
that it makes. This can useful for debugging unexpected <br>
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_PATH <br>
You can optionally set CCACHE_PATH to a colon separated path
where ccache will look for the real compilers. If you
don&acirc;t do this then ccache will look for the first
exe&acirc; <br>
cutable matching the compiler name in the normal PATH that
isn&acirc;t a symbolic link to ccache itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_CC <br>
You can optionally set CCACHE_CC to force the name of the
compiler to use. If you don&acirc;t do this then ccache
works it out from the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_PREFIX <br>
This option adds a prefix to the command line that ccache
runs when invoking the compiler. Also see the section below
on using ccache with distcc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_DISABLE <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_DISABLE then
ccache will just call the real compiler, bypassing the cache
completely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_READONLY <br>
the CCACHE_READONLY environment variable tells ccache to
attempt to use existing cached object files, but not to try
to add anything new to the cache. If you are using <br>
this because your CCACHE_DIR is read-only, then you may find
that you also need to set CCACHE_TEMPDIR as otherwise ccache
will fail to create the temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_CPP2 <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_CPP2 then ccache
will not use the optimisation of avoiding the 2nd call to
the pre-processor by compiling the pre-processed out&acirc;
<br>
put that was used for finding the hash in the case of a
cache miss. This is primarily a debugging option, although
it is possible that some unusual compilers will have <br>
problems with the intermediate filename extensions used in
this optimisation, in which case this option could allow
ccache to be used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS then
there is no compression used on files that go into the
cache. However, this setting has no effect on how files <br>
are retrieved from the cache, compressed results will still
be usable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_NOSTATS <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_NOSTATS then
ccache will not update the statistics files on each
compile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_NLEVELS <br>
The environment variable CCACHE_NLEVELS allows you to choose
the number of levels of hash in the cache directory. The
default is 2. The minimum is 1 and the maximum is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_HARDLINK <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_HARDLINK then
ccache will attempt to use hard links from the cache
directory when creating the compiler output rather than
using <br>
a file copy. Using hard links is faster, but can confuse
programs like &acirc;make&acirc; that rely on modification
times. Hard links are never made for compressed cache
files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_RECACHE <br>
This forces ccache to not use any cached results, even if it
finds them. New results are still cached, but existing cache
entries are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_UMASK <br>
This sets the umask for ccache and all child processes (such
as the compiler). This is mostly useful when you wish to
share your cache with other users. Note that this <br>
also affects the file permissions set on the object files
created from your compilations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_HASHDIR <br>
This tells ccache to hash the current working directory when
calculating the hash that is used to distinguish two
compiles. This prevents a problem with the storage of the
<br>
current working directory in the debug info of a object
file, which can lead ccache to give a cached object file
that has the working directory in the debug info set <br>
incorrectly. This option is off by default as the incorrect
setting of this debug info rarely causes problems. If you
strike problems with gdb not using the correct direc&acirc;
<br>
tory then enable this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_UNIFY <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_UNIFY then ccache
will use the C/C++ unifier when hashing the pre-processor
output if -g is not used in the compile. The unifier <br>
is slower than a normal hash, so setting this environment
variable loses a little bit of speed, but it means that
ccache can take advantage of not recompiling when the <br>
changes to the source code consist of reformatting only.
Note that using CCACHE_UNIFY changes the hash, so cached
compiles with CCACHE_UNIFY set cannot be used when <br>
CCACHE_UNIFY is not set and vice versa. The reason the
unifier is off by default is that it can give incorrect line
number information in compiler warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_EXTENSION <br>
Normally ccache tries to automatically determine the
extension to use for intermediate C pre-processor files
based on the type of file being compiled. Unfortunately this
<br>
sometimes doesn&acirc;t work, for example when using the aCC
compiler on HP-UX. On systems like this you can use the
CCACHE_EXTENSION option to override the default. On HP-UX
<br>
set this environment variable to &quot;i&quot; if you use
the aCC compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_STRIPC <br>
If you set the environment variable CCACHE_STRIPC then
ccache will strip the -c option when invoking the
preprocessor. This option is primarily for the Sun Workshop
C++ <br>
compiler as without this option an unwarranted warning is
displayed: CC: Warning: &quot;-E&quot; redefines product
from &quot;object&quot; to &quot;source (stdout)&quot; when
-E and -c is used <br>
together.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_SWIG <br>
When using SWIG as the compiler and it does not have
&acirc;swig&acirc; in the executable name, then the
CCACHE_SWIG environment variable needs to be set in order
for ccache to work <br>
correctly with SWIG. The use of CCACHE_CPP2 is also
recommended for SWIG due to some preprocessor quirks,
however, use of CCACHE_CPP2 can often be skipped -- check
your <br>
generated code with and without this option set. Known
problems are using preprocessor directives within %inline
blocks and the use of &acirc;#pragma SWIG&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CACHE SIZE MANAGEMENT <br>
By default ccache has a one gigabyte limit on the cache size
and no maximum number of files. You can set a different
limit using the &quot;ccache -M&quot; and &quot;ccache
-F&quot; options, which <br>
set the size and number of files limits.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When these limits are reached
ccache will reduce the cache to 20% below the numbers you
specified in order to avoid doing the cache clean operation
too often.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CACHE COMPRESSION <br>
By default on most platforms ccache will compress all files
it puts into the cache using the zlib compression. While
this involves a negligible performance slowdown, it
signifi&acirc; <br>
cantly increases the number of files that fit in the cache.
You can turn off compression setting the CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HOW IT WORKS <br>
The basic idea is to detect when you are compiling exactly
the same code a 2nd time and use the previously compiled
output. You detect that it is the same code by forming a
hash <br>
of:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o the pre-processor output from
running the compiler with -E</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o the command line options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o the real compilers size and
modification time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o any stderr output generated by
the compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These are hashed using md4 (a
strong hash) and a cache file is formed based on that hash
result. When the same compilation is done a second time
ccache is able to supply the cor&acirc; <br>
rect compiler output (including all warnings etc) from the
cache.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccache has been carefully
written to always produce exactly the same compiler output
that you would get without the cache. If you ever discover a
case where ccache changes the <br>
output of your compiler then please let me know.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USING CCACHE WITH DISTCC <br>
distcc is a very useful program for distributing compilation
across a range of compiler servers. It is often useful to
combine distcc with ccache, so that compiles that are done
<br>
are sped up by distcc, but that ccache avoids the compile
completely where possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use distcc with ccache I
recommend using the CCACHE_PREFIX option. You just need to
set the environment variable CCACHE_PREFIX to
&acirc;distcc&acirc; and ccache will prefix the command <br>
line used with the compiler with the command
&acirc;distcc&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SHARING A CACHE <br>
A group of developers can increase the cache hit rate by
sharing a cache directory. The hard links however cause
unwanted side effects, as all links to a cached file share
the <br>
file&acirc;s modification timestamp. This results in false
dependencies to be triggered by timestamp-based build
systems whenever another user links to an existing file.
Typically, <br>
users will see that their libraries and binaries are
relinked without reason. To share a cache without side
effects, the following conditions need to be met:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Use the same CCACHE_DIR
environment variable setting</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Unset the CCACHE_HARDLINK
environment variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Make sure everyone sets the
CCACHE_UMASK environment variable to 002, this ensures that
cached files are accessible to everyone in the group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Make sure that all users have
write permission in the entire cache directory (and that you
trust all users of the shared cache).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Make sure that the setgid bit
is set on all directories in the cache. This tells the
filesystem to inherit group ownership for new directories.
The command &quot;chmod g+s <br>
&lsquo;find $CCACHE_DIR -type d&lsquo;&quot; might be useful
for this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o Set CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS for all
users, if there are users with versions of ccache that do
not support compression.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
ccache was inspired by the compilercache shell script script
written by Erik Thiele and I would like to thank him for an
excellent piece of work. See
http://www.erikyyy.de/com&acirc; <br>
pilercache/ for the Erik&acirc;s scripts. ccache-swig is a
port of the original ccache with support added for use with
SWIG.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I wrote ccache because I wanted
to get a bit more speed out of a compiler cache and I wanted
to remove some of the limitations of the shell-script
version.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DIFFERENCES FROM COMPILERCACHE
<br>
The biggest differences between Erik&acirc;s compilercache
script and ccache are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache is written in C, which
makes it a bit faster (calling out to external programs is
mostly what slowed down the scripts).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache can automatically find
the real compiler</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache keeps statistics on
hits/misses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache can do automatic cache
management</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache can cache compiler
output that includes warnings. In many cases this gives
ccache a much higher cache hit rate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache can handle a much wider
ranger of compiler options</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">o ccache avoids a double call to
cpp on a cache miss</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CREDITS <br>
