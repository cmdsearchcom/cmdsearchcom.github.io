      system.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-d, --disable-tray-icon</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disable the system tray icon. May be needed for system
      trays not compliant with the Freedesktop.org system tray
    specification.</dd>

  <dd class="It-tag">Displays this help.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-i, --icon-theme &lt;Icon Theme Name&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use a specific icon theme from your system. The Icon Theme
      name is optional and if specified CMST will try to use icons from that
      theme. If no name is provided and if a system wide icon theme is defined
      (via your DE) it will be used. If the icon theme cannot be found CMST will
      fallback to using internal built in icons.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-n, --disable-vpn</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Disable VPN support. This will disable (grey out) the VPN
      tab and the VPN editor button. More importantly it will also bypass
      setting up a DBUS connection to connman-vpn. If Connman is compiled
      without VPN support this option should be supplied.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-v, --version</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Displays version information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>-w, --wait-time &lt;seconds&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the wait time in seconds before starting the system
      tray icon (default is 0 seconds). If CMST is started and tries to create a
      tray icon before the system tray itself is created a dialog will be
      displayed explaining that. This sometimes happens when the program is
      started automatically. If you know the tray will exist once the system is
      up you may specify a wait time and CMST will wait that number of seconds
      before trying to create the tray icon. This is to give the window manager
      or panel time to create the tray before we try to place the icon
    there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--counter-update-kb &lt;KB&gt; [Experimental]</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the amount of data in KB that must be transmitted
      before the counters update (default is 1024 KB). Connman will accept this
      entry, but according to a comment in the Connman code the actual feature
      still needs to be implemented.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--counter-update-rate &lt;seconds&gt;

  <dd class="It-tag">Specify the frequency in seconds between counter updates
      (default is 10 seconds).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--fake-transparency &lt;RRGGBB&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">On some systems the system tray icon background, which is
      transparent, will display as white or black. This seems to be an issue
      between QT, system tray implementations, compositing, and perhaps certain
      graphics cards. To work around it we've implemented a fake transparency
      for tray icons. To use it specify the system tray background color with
      this option. If the background color is provided CMST will convert the
      tray icon image to have the specified background color. Color is a hex
      number in the format: RRGGBB.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>--use-xfce</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Use code specific for XFCE. As of 2014.11.24 there seems to
      be a problem with QT5.3 and the XFCE system tray. There is code in the
      program to try and work around this issue. If the bug gets fixed in QT5.4
      (or later) this option will remain so that user start up scripts and
      commands do not break, but it will be a no operation place holder.</dd>

  LINE STABILITY</a></h1>
Command line options marked <i>[Experimental]</i> refer to some option in
  Connman that is currently flagged experimental. These options should not be
  assumed to be fixed and could change at any time. Other command line options
  may be assumed to be fixed and should be safe to use in startup scripts.

  INFO</a></h1>
The GUI contains one main dialog with separate tab pages. Program help is mainly
  provided through a &quot;What's This&quot; interface. The &quot;What's
  This&quot; button in the lower left corner will allow you to enter
  &quot;What's This&quot; mode, click the button and then click the GUI feature,
  or control that you are interested in. A right mouse click on a GUI feature or
  control will also enter &quot;What's This&quot; mode.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Status Tab</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The status tab displays information about the global
      properties, found technologies, and services. Checkbox at the top right
      will allow you to put everything in &quot;offline&quot; mode. To toggle a
      technology on or off click the entry under the Powered column</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Details Tab</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The details tab will display detailed setup and connection
      information about a service. Select the service you wish to investigate in
      the combo box at the top.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Wireless Tab</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Wireless tab will display information, connect,
      disconnect, and edit certain properties of wireless services.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>VPN Tab</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The VNP tab will display information, connect and
      disconnect already provisioned VPN services.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Counters Tab</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The Counters tab will display information about the Connect
      time, the Transmit (TX) and Receiving (RX) counters for the service
      currently in the &quot;online&quot; state. The counters are set to fairly
      course intervals to minimize system usage. Currently these interval
      settings are hard coded into the program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><i>Preferences Tab</i></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">The preferences tab will allow you to change some aspects
      of the GUI.</dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="selflink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
For typical networks and access points, even hidden ones, Connman will find and
  automatically configure the network for you. If Connman needs information, for
  instance a passphrase, CMST registers an agent and this agent will prompt you
  for the needed information. For most cases this &quot;just works&quot;,
  however there are options for fine tuning the automatic configuration or
  creating provisioning files.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Profile Editor</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">There are a variety of connection settings that may be used
      to override the automatic settings. An editor is provided to access these
      settings via the <b>Configuration</b> button in the lower right corner of
      the <i>Details</i> tab. One common use is to define a static IP address
      for the connection. Hidden or provisioned (see below) services cannot be
      edited.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>802.1x Encrypted Networks (Eduroam and similar)</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">Certain types encrypted networks require a config
      (provisioning) file to be created before you first connect. As of
      2014.10.30 CMST has a provisioning editor built in, but it is considered
      an advanced control and by default it is hidden. To enable the control
      check the <b>Advanced Controls</b> box on the <i>Provisioning</i> tab. The
      button to open the editor will appear in the lower left corner of the
      dialog. With this editor you may create, open, edit, delete and save
      config files to /var/lib/connman. The menu at the top may be used to enter
      some information automatically, and many of the input fields are validated
      as you enter text into them. There are also predefined template files that
      may be used to seed the editing area. All of this can be bypassed if you
      wish and you may cut and paste or type into the editor directly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag"><b>Creating and Editing VPN Connections</b></dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">As of 2016.01.26 CMST has a VPN provisioning editor built
      in, but it is considered an advanced control and by default it is hidden.
      To enable the control check the <b>Advanced Controls</b> box on the
      <i>Provisioning</i> tab. The button to open the editor will appear in the
      lower left corner of the dialog. With this editor you may create, open,
      edit, delete and save config files to /var/lib/connman-vpn. The menu at
      the top may be used to enter some information automatically, and many of
      the input fields are validated as you enter text into them. The first item
      under each menu heading (Provider xxx) will start a junior wizard to walk
      you through entering all the mandatory information for each connection
      type. For OpenVPN the second menu item (Import Configuration) will import
      an OpenVPN .opvn file. The import will extract and save keys and
      certificates and will place the proper provisioning entries into the
      editor window.</dd>

For the tray icon to display is it required that the system tray be compliant
  with the Freedesktop.org systemtray specification.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The tray icon is known to not work in the DWM system tray which appears to be a
  noncompliant tray.
