<p>CMST(1) General Commands Manual CMST(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
CMST - Connman System Tray</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
Usage: cmst [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
A QT5 based GUI front end for the Connman network daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-c, --disable-counters [Experimental] <br>
Disable the counters. May be used to minimize load on your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --disable-tray-icon <br>
Disable the system tray icon. May be needed for system trays
not compliant with the Freedesktop.org system tray
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Displays this help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --icon-theme &lt;Icon Theme
Name&gt; <br>
Use a specific icon theme from your system. The Icon Theme
name is optional and if specified CMST will try to use icons
from that theme. If no name is provided and if a <br>
system wide icon theme is defined (via your DE) it will be
used. If the icon theme cannot be found CMST will fallback
to using internal built in icons.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --log-input-request <br>
Log the Connman inputRequest for debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --minimized <br>
Start the GUI minimized in the system tray.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --disable-vpn <br>
Disable VPN support. This will disable (grey out) the VPN
tab and the VPN editor button. More importantly it will also
bypass setting up a DBUS connection to connman- <br>
vpn. If Connman is compiled without VPN support this option
should be supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version <br>
Displays version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w, --wait-time &lt;seconds&gt;
<br>
Specify the wait time in seconds before starting the system
tray icon (default is 0 seconds). If CMST is started and
tries to create a tray icon before the system tray <br>
itself is created a dialog will be displayed explaining
that. This sometimes happens when the program is started
automatically. If you know the tray will exist once the <br>
system is up you may specify a wait time and CMST will wait
that number of seconds before trying to create the tray
icon. This is to give the window manager or panel time <br>
to create the tray before we try to place the icon
there.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--counter-update-kb &lt;KB&gt;
[Experimental] <br>
Specify the amount of data in KB that must be transmitted
before the counters update (default is 1024 KB). Connman
will accept this entry, but according to a comment in <br>
the Connman code the actual feature still needs to be
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--counter-update-rate
&lt;seconds&gt; [Experimental] <br>
Specify the frequency in seconds between counter updates
(default is 10 seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--fake-transparency
&lt;RRGGBB&gt; <br>
On some systems the system tray icon background, which is
transparent, will display as white or black. This seems to
be an issue between QT, system tray implementations, <br>
compositing, and perhaps certain graphics cards. To work
around it we&rsquo;ve implemented a fake transparency for
tray icons. To use it specify the system tray background
<br>
color with this option. If the background color is provided
CMST will convert the tray icon image to have the specified
background color. Color is a hex number in the <br>
format: RRGGBB.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-xfce <br>
Use code specific for XFCE. As of 2014.11.24 there seems to
be a problem with QT5.3 and the XFCE system tray. There is
code in the program to try and work around this <br>
issue. If the bug gets fixed in QT5.4 (or later) this option
will remain so that user start up scripts and commands do
not break, but it will be a no operation place <br>
holder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--use-mate <br>
Use code specific for MATE. As of 2014.11.24 there seems to
be a problem with QT5.3 and the XFCE system tray. There is
code in the program to try and work around this <br>
issue. If the bug gets fixed in QT5.4 (or later) this option
will remain so that user start up scripts and commands do
not break, but it will be a no operation place <br>
holder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COMMAND LINE STABILITY <br>
Command line options marked [Experimental] refer to some
option in Connman that is currently flagged experimental.
These options should not be assumed to be fixed and could
<br>
change at any time. Other command line options may be
assumed to be fixed and should be safe to use in startup
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GUI INFO <br>
The GUI contains one main dialog with separate tab pages.
Program help is mainly provided through a &quot;What&rsquo;s
This&quot; interface. The &quot;What&rsquo;s This&quot;
button in the lower left corner <br>
will allow you to enter &quot;What&rsquo;s This&quot; mode,
click the button and then click the GUI feature, or control
that you are interested in. A right mouse click on a GUI
feature or con&acirc; <br>
trol will also enter &quot;What&rsquo;s This&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Status Tab <br>
The status tab displays information about the global
properties, found technologies, and services. Checkbox at
the top right will allow you to put everything in
&quot;offline&quot; <br>
mode. To toggle a technology on or off click the entry under
the Powered column</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Details Tab <br>
The details tab will display detailed setup and connection
information about a service. Select the service you wish to
investigate in the combo box at the top.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Wireless Tab <br>
The Wireless tab will display information, connect,
disconnect, and edit certain properties of wireless
services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">VPN Tab <br>
The VNP tab will display information, connect and disconnect
already provisioned VPN services.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Counters Tab <br>
The Counters tab will display information about the Connect
time, the Transmit (TX) and Receiving (RX) counters for the
service currently in the &quot;online&quot; state. The
coun&acirc; <br>
ters are set to fairly course intervals to minimize system
usage. Currently these interval settings are hard coded into
the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Preferences Tab <br>
The preferences tab will allow you to change some aspects of
the GUI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION <br>
For typical networks and access points, even hidden ones,
Connman will find and automatically configure the network
for you. If Connman needs information, for instance a <br>
passphrase, CMST registers an agent and this agent will
prompt you for the needed information. For most cases this
&quot;just works&quot;, however there are options for fine
tuning the <br>
automatic configuration or creating provisioning files.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Profile Editor <br>
There are a variety of connection settings that may be used
to override the automatic settings. An editor is provided to
access these settings via the Configuration but&acirc; <br>
ton in the lower right corner of the Details tab. One common
use is to define a static IP address for the connection.
Hidden or provisioned (see below) services cannot <br>
be edited.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">802.1x Encrypted Networks
(Eduroam and similar) <br>
Certain types encrypted networks require a config
(provisioning) file to be created before you first connect.
As of 2014.10.30 CMST has a provisioning editor built in,
<br>
but it is considered an advanced control and by default it
is hidden. To enable the control check the Advanced Controls
box on the Provisioning tab. The button to open <br>
the editor will appear in the lower left corner of the
dialog. With this editor you may create, open, edit, delete
and save config files to /var/lib/connman. The menu at <br>
the top may be used to enter some information automatically,
and many of the input fields are validated as you enter text
into them. There are also predefined template <br>
files that may be used to seed the editing area. All of this
can be bypassed if you wish and you may cut and paste or
type into the editor directly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating and Editing VPN
Connections <br>
As of 2016.01.26 CMST has a VPN provisioning editor built
in, but it is considered an advanced control and by default
it is hidden. To enable the control check the <br>
Advanced Controls box on the Provisioning tab. The button to
open the editor will appear in the lower left corner of the
dialog. With this editor you may create, open, <br>
edit, delete and save config files to /var/lib/connman-vpn.
The menu at the top may be used to enter some information
automatically, and many of the input fields are val&acirc;
<br>
idated as you enter text into them. The first item under
each menu heading (Provider xxx) will start a junior wizard
to walk you through entering all the mandatory infor&acirc;
<br>
mation for each connection type. For OpenVPN the second menu
item (Import Configuration) will import an OpenVPN .opvn
file. The import will extract and save keys and <br>
certificates and will place the proper provisioning entries
into the editor window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
For the tray icon to display is it required that the system
tray be compliant with the Freedesktop.org systemtray
specification.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The tray icon is known to not
work in the DWM system tray which appears to be a
noncompliant tray.</p>
