<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ccr - The post-quantum cryptography encryption and signing
tool</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ccr [OPTION]...</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ccr (short of Codecrypt) is a general purpose
encryption/decryption signing/verification tool that uses
only quantum-computer-resistant algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">General options: <br>
-h, --help <br>
Show a simple help with option listing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --version <br>
Display only version information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --test <br>
This option exists as a convenience for hackers - in this
case, ccr initializes itself, calls a test() function from
source file src/main.cpp (that is meant to be filled <br>
by testing stuff beforehand) and terminates. In distribution
packages, it will probably do nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-R, --in &lt;file&gt; <br>
Redirect standard input to be read from file instead from
stdin. You can still specify &quot;-&quot; to force reading
from stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o, --out &lt;file&gt; <br>
Redirect standard output to be written to file. You can
specify &quot;-&quot; to force writing to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E, --err &lt;file&gt; <br>
Redirect the standard error output to file. You can specify
&quot;-&quot; to force writing to stderr. Error output does
not carry any data, but provides useful error messages and
<br>
metadata about what is happening, e.g. the identity of
message signer or details about why decryption or
verification fails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --armor <br>
Where expecting input or output of data in codecrypt
communication format, use ascii-armoring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Codecrypt otherwise usually
generates raw binary data, that are very hard to pass
through e-mail or similar text communication channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-y, --yes <br>
Assume the user knows what he is doing, and answer
&quot;yes&quot; to all questions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions: <br>
-s, --sign <br>
Produce a signed message from input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verify <br>
Take a signed message from input, verify whether the
signature is valid, and output message content if the
verification succeeded.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e, --encrypt <br>
Produce an encrypted message from input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --decrypt <br>
Decrypt the message from input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that the actions for
signature/encryption and decryption/verification can be
easily combined into one command, simply by specifying both
options usually as &quot;-se&quot; or &quot;-dv&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Action options: <br>
-r, --recipient &lt;keyspec&gt; <br>
Specify that the message for encryption should be encrypted
so that only the owner of a private key paired with public
key specified by keyspec can decrypt it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u, --user &lt;keyspec&gt; <br>
Specify a private key to use for signing the message.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C, --cleartext <br>
When working with signatures, produce/expect a cleartext
signature. The basic property of cleartext signature is that
the message it contains is easily readable by users, <br>
therefore it is a very popular method to e.g. sign
e-mails.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b, --detach-sign &lt;file&gt;
<br>
On signing, produce a detached signature and save it to
file. When verifying, read the detached signature from file.
Note that files that is being signed or verified must <br>
be put into program&rsquo;s input (potentially using
&quot;-R&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --symmetric &lt;file&gt;
<br>
Use symmetric cryptography.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When doing &quot;sign&quot; or
&quot;verify&quot; operation, do not sign asymmetrically,
but instead generate file with cryptographic hashes that can
later be used to verify if the contents <br>
of input was changed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When doing &quot;generate&quot;,
&quot;encrypt&quot; or &quot;decrypt&quot; operation, do not
encrypt asymmetrically, but instead generate or use a file
with a key for specified symmetric cipher. Use <br>
&quot;-g help&quot; to see available symmetric primitives.
For symmetric encryption to work, at least one stream cipher
(marked with C) and at least one hash function (marked with
<br>
H, used to protect against malleability) separated by comma
need to be selected. Additionally, user can specify
&quot;longblock&quot; or &quot;shortblock&quot; keyword to
manipulate size of <br>
internal encryption block structure (longer blocks consume
more RAM, but the ciphertext doesn&rsquo;t grow very much);
or the &quot;longkey&quot; flag which creates larger
symmetric key <br>
to provide more key material to the ciphers (which can help
to protect against low-quality random numbers, but is
generally unnecessary and even considered to be a bad <br>
practice). It is also possible to combine more stream
ciphers and hash functions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Purpose of the --symmetric
option is that symmetric cryptography is a lot faster than
asymmetric, and symmetric primitives usually work also on
very large files and data <br>
streams, as they don&rsquo;t need to be fully copied into
allocated memory for this purpose. Thus, if working with a
large file, process it symmetrically first, then <br>
sign/encrypt the (tiny) symmetric file asymmetrically and
send it along with the (possibly encrypted) large file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Key management: <br>
In Codecrypt, each public key has a KeyID, which is
basically a hash of its representation that is used to
identify the key globally. Each public key is stored along
with a key <br>
name, which is a convenience tool for users who can store
arbitrary information about e.g. what is the key meant for
or who it belongs to. Public keys also have an algorithm
<br>
identifier to specify how to work with them, and sometimes
also attached a private key to form a secret
&quot;keypair&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keys can be specified using
several methods:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using KeyID -- the key
specification starts with @ and continues with several first
characters of the KeyID that identify a single key with that
prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using a name -- key
specification consists of a string, a key is then matched if
its name contains the specified string. Matching is
case-insensitive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gen-key &lt;algorithm&gt;
<br>
Generate a keypair for usage with specified algorithm. Use
&quot;-g help&quot; to get list of all algorithms available.
Listing also contains flags &quot;S&quot; and &quot;E&quot;,
meaning that algo&acirc; <br>
rithm can be used for signatures or encryption, or
&quot;H&quot; and &quot;C&quot; for usage with symmetric
hashes and ciphers. In asymmetric case (where the algorithm
names are long) the <br>
supplied algorithm name does not need to be a full name, but
must match only one available algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-N, --name &lt;keyname&gt; <br>
Specify that affected keys (those being imported, generated,
exported or renamed) should be newly renamed to keyname.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --filter &lt;keyspec&gt;
<br>
When listing, importing or exporting keys, only process keys
that match keyspec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k, --list <br>
List available public keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --list-secret <br>
List available private keys (in keypairs).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --import <br>
Import public keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --import-secret <br>
Import private keypairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --no-action <br>
On import, do not really import the keys, but only print
what keys and names will be imported. This is useful for
preventing accepting unwanted private or public keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f, --fingerprint <br>
When printing keys, format full KeyIDs. Note that full
KeyIDs can be used in similar way as fingerprints known from
other crypto tools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --export <br>
Export public keys in keyring format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-P, --export-secret <br>
Export private keys. (Do this carefully!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x, --delete &lt;keyspec&gt;
<br>
Remove matching keys from public keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-X, --delete-secret
&lt;keyspec&gt; <br>
Remove matching keys from private keypairs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m, --rename &lt;keyspec&gt;
<br>
Rename matching public keys. Use &quot;-N&quot; to specify a
new name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M, --rename-secret
&lt;keyspec&gt; <br>
Rename matching private keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
Codecrypt stores user data in a directory specified by
environment variable CCR_DIR, which defaults to
&quot;$HOME/.ccr&quot;. It contains the files
&quot;pubkeys&quot; and &quot;secrets&quot; which are
sen&acirc; <br>
code keyring representations of user&rsquo;s public and
private keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Backups of user data (i.e. for
each file the last state that was loaded successfully) are,
on each change, written to files &quot;pubkeys~&quot; and
&quot;secrets~&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When Codecrypt is running, it
locks the .ccr directory using a lockfile &quot;lock&quot;
and applying flock(2) to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RETURN VALUE <br>
ccr returns exit status 0 if there was no error and all
cryptography went fine, or 1 on generic errors. If the error
was that a missing hash algorithm or a public or private key
<br>
was needed to complete the operation, 2 is returned. If
signature or hash verification fails (e.g. the signature is
bad or likely forged), the program returns 3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ALGORITHMS <br>
Program offers several &quot;algorithms&quot; that can be
used for signatures and encryption. Use &quot;ccr -g
help&quot; to get a list of supported algorithms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FMTSeq-named schemes are the
Merkle-tree signature algorithms. The name
FMTSEQxxx-HASH1-HASH2 means, that the scheme provides attack
complexity (&quot;bit security&quot;) around 2^xxx, <br>
HASH1 is used as a message digest algorithm, and HASH2 is
used for construction of Merkle tree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">McEliece-based encryption
schemes are formed from McEliece trapdoor running on
quasi-dyadic Goppa codes (the MCEQD- algorithms) and on
quasi-cyclis medium-density parity-check <br>
(QCMDPC- ones) with Fujisaki-Okamoto encryption padding for
CCA2. Algorithm name MCEQDxxxFO-HASH-CIPHER means that the
trapdoor is designed to provide attack complexity around
<br>
2^xxx, and HASH and CIPHER are the hash and symmetric cipher
functions that are used in Fujisaki-Okamoto padding
scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As of November 2015, users are
advised to deploy the 2^128-secure variants of the
algorithms -- running 2^128 operations would require around
10^22 years of CPU time (of a pretty <br>
fast CPU), which is considered more than sufficient for any
reasonable setup and using stronger algorithms seems just
completely unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that using stronger
algorithm variants does not come with any serious
performance drawback and protects the user from non-fatal
attacks that decrease the security of the <br>
scheme only by a small amount -- compare getting an attack
speedup of 2^20 on a scheme with 2^80 bit security (which is
fatal) with getting the same speedup on a scheme with <br>
2^128 security (where the resulting 2^108 is still
strong).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For comparison with existing
schemes, 2^128 security level is very roughly equivalent to
that of classical RSA with 3072bit modulus (which is,
accordingly to the best results <br>
available in June 2013 for general public, reported to
provide roughly 2^112 attack complexity).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For another comparison, a very
good idea about the unbelievably insane amount of energy
that is actually needed for brute-forcing 2^256 operations
can be obtained from Wikipedia, <br>
which estimates the size of whole observable universe (!) to
around 2^270 atoms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All algorithms are believed to
be resistant to quantum-computer-specific attacks, except
for the generic case of Grover search which (in a very
idealized case and very roughly) <br>
halves the bit security (although the attack remains
exponential). Users who are aware of large quantum computers
being built are advised to use 2^192 or 2^256 bit security
<br>
keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WARNINGS AND CAVEATS <br>
General advice <br>
Codecrypt does not do much to prevent damage from mistakes
of the user. Be especially careful when managing your
keyring, be aware that some operations can rename or delete
more <br>
keys at once. Used cryptography is relatively new, therefore
be sure to verify current state of cryptanalysis before you
put your data at risk.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Current state of cryptanalysis
<br>
In a fashion similar to aforementioned &lsquo;new
cryptography&rsquo;, the original algebraic variant of
quasi-dyadic McEliece that is still in codecrypt (MCEQD*
algorithms, kept for compat&acirc; <br>
ibility purposes) has been broken by an algebraic attack.
Security is greatly reduced. Use the QC-MDPC variant which
dodges similar attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Large files <br>
Codecrypt is not very good for working directly with large
files. Because of the message format and code clarity, whole
input files and messages are usually loaded into memory <br>
before getting signed/encrypted. Fixing the problem requires
some deep structural changes in Codecrypt that would break
most of the achieved internal simplicity, therefore the <br>
fix is probably not going to happen. You can easily
workaround the whole problem using symmetric ciphers (for
encryption of large files) or hashfiles (for signatures of
large <br>
files). See the --symmetric option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FMTSeq signatures <br>
FMTSeq signatures are constructed from one-time signature
scheme, for this reason the private key changes after each
signature, basically by increasing some counter. IF THE
PRI&acirc; <br>
VATE KEY IS USED MORE THAN ONCE TO SIGN WITH THE SAME
COUNTER AND THE SIGNATURES GET PUBLISHED, SECURITY OF THE
SCHEME IS SEVERELY DAMAGED. Never use the same key on two
places <br>
at once. If you backup the private keys, be sure to backup
it everytime after a signature is made.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If something goes wrong and you
really need to use the key that has been, for example,
recovered from a backup, you can still &quot;skip&quot; the
counter by producing and discarding some <br>
dummy signatures (ccr -s &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null). If
you plan to do that for some real purpose, for your own
safety be sure to understand inner workings of FMTSeq,
especially how <br>
the Diffie-Lamport signature scheme degrades after
publishing more than one signature.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FMTSeq can only produce a
limited amount of signatures (but still a pretty large
number). When the remaining signature count starts to get
low, Codecrypt will print warning mes&acirc; <br>
sages. In that case, users are advised to generate and
certify new keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Working with keys <br>
Try to always use the &quot;-n&quot; option before you
actually import keys -- blind import of keys can bring
serious inconsistencies into your key naming scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In a distant universe after much
computation, KeyIDs can collide. If you find someone who has
a colliding KeyID, kiss him and generate another key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Troubleshooting/FAQ <br>
Q: I can&rsquo;t read/verify messages from versions 1.3.1
and older!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: KeyID algorithm changed after
that version. If you want, you can manually rewrite the
message sencode envelopes to contain new recipient/signer
KeyIDs and new message identi&acirc; <br>
ficators, things should work perfectly after that.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I can&rsquo;t read/verify
messages from versions 1.7.4 and older!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: There was a mistake with no
security implications in Cubehash implementation. Same
advice as in previous case applies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: Some signatures from version
1.5 and older fail to verify!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: There was a slight mistake in
padding of messages shorter than signature hash function
size (64 bytes in the 256-bit-secure signature types) with
no security implications. It <br>
was decided not to provide backward compatibility for this
minor use-case. If you really need to verify such
signatures, edit the msg_pad function in src/algos_sig.h so
that the <br>
&lsquo;load_key()&rsquo; function is called on empty vector
instead of &lsquo;out&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: My Cubehash-based FMTSeq key
produces invalid signatures after version 1.7.5!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Cubehash was corrected to
obey standards in 1.7.5. It is possible to generate a new
public key that would work with your private key, but the
general advice is just to gener&acirc; <br>
ate a new key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: I want to sign/encrypt a
large file but it took all my RAM and takes ages!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: Use --symmetric option. See
the &lsquo;CAVEATS&rsquo; section for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Q: How much &lsquo;broken&rsquo;
is the original quasi-dyadic McEliece?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A: The private key of proposed
dyadic variant by Misoczki and Barreto can be derived from
the public key with standard computer equipment pretty
quickly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLE <br>
Following commands roughly demonstrate command line usage of
ccr:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ccr -g help <br>
