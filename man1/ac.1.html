<p>AC(1) General Commands Manual AC(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
ac - print statistics about users&rsquo; connect time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
ac [ -d | --daily-totals ] [ -y | --print-year ] <br>
[ -p | --individual-totals ] [ people ] <br>
[ -f | --file filename ] [ -a | --all-days ] <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
ac prints out a report of connect time (in hours) based on
the logins/logouts in the current wtmp file. A total is also
printed out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The accounting file wtmp is
maintained by init(8) and login(1). Neither ac nor login
creates the wtmp if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, no accounting is
done. To begin accounting, create <br>
the file with a length of zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The wtmp file can get
really big, really fast. You might want to trim it every
once and a while.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNU ac works nearly the same u*x
ac, though it&rsquo;s a little smarter in several ways. You
should therefore expect differences in the output of GNU ac
and the output of ac&rsquo;s on oth&acirc; <br>
er systems. Use the command info accounting to get
additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-d, --daily-totals <br>
Print totals for each day rather than just one big total at
the end. The output looks like this: <br>
Jul 3 total 1.17 <br>
Jul 4 total 2.10 <br>
Jul 5 total 8.23 <br>
Jul 6 total 2.10 <br>
Jul 7 total 0.30 <br>
-p, --individual-totals <br>
Print time totals for each user in addition to the usual
everything-lumped-into-one value. It looks like: <br>
bob 8.06 <br>
goff 0.60 <br>
maley 7.37 <br>
root 0.12 <br>
total 16.15 <br>
people Print out the sum total of the connect time used by
all of the users included in people. Note that people is a
space separated list of valid user names; wildcards are not
<br>
allowed. <br>
-f, --file filename <br>
Read from the file filename instead of the system&rsquo;s
wtmp file. <br>
--complain <br>
When the wtmp file has a problem (a time-warp, missing
record, or whatever), print out an appropriate error. <br>
--reboots <br>
Reboot records are NOT written at the time of a reboot, but
when the system restarts; therefore, it is impossible to
know exactly when the reboot occurred. Users may have <br>
been logged into the system at the time of the reboot, and
many ac&rsquo;s automatically count the time between the
login and the reboot record against the user (even though
all <br>
of that time shouldn&rsquo;t be, perhaps, if the system is
down for a long time, for instance). If you want to count
this time, include the flag. *For vanilla ac
compatibili&acirc; <br>
ty, include this flag.* <br>
--supplants <br>
Sometimes, a logout record is not written for a specific
terminal, so the time that the last user accrued cannot be
calculated. If you want to include the time from the <br>
user&rsquo;s login to the next login on the terminal (though
probably incorrect), include this you want to include the
time from the user&rsquo;s login to the next login on the
termi&acirc; <br>
nal (though probably incorrect), include this flag. *For
vanilla ac compatibility, include this flag.* <br>
--timewarps <br>
Sometimes, entries in a wtmp file will suddenly jump back
into the past without a clock change record occurring. It is
impossible to know how long a user was logged in <br>
when this occurs. If you want to count the time between the
login and the time warp against the user, include this flag.
*For vanilla ac compatibility, include this <br>
flag.* <br>
--compatibility <br>
This is shorthand for typing out the three above options.
<br>
-a, --all-days <br>
If we&rsquo;re printing daily totals, print a record for
every day instead of skipping intervening days where there
is no login activity. Without this flag, time accrued during
<br>
those intervening days gets listed under the next day where
there is login activity. <br>
--tw-leniency num <br>
Set the time warp leniency to num seconds. Records in wtmp
files might be slightly out of order (most notably when two
logins occur within a one-second period - the sec&acirc;
<br>
ond one gets written first). By default, this value is set
to 60. If the program notices this problem, time is not
assigned to users unless the --timewarps flag is used. <br>
--tw-suspicious num <br>
Set the time warp suspicious value to num seconds. If two
records in the wtmp file are farther than this number of
seconds apart, there is a problem with the wtmp file <br>
(or your machine hasn&rsquo;t been used in a year). If the
program notices this problem, time is not assigned to users
unless the --timewarps flag is used. <br>
-y, --print-year <br>
Print year when displaying dates. <br>
-z, --print-zeros <br>
If a total for any category (save the grand total) is zero,
print it. The default is to suppress printing. <br>
--debug <br>
Print verbose internal information. <br>
-V, --version <br>
Print the version number of ac to standard output and quit.
<br>
-h, --help <br>
Prints the usage string and default locations of system
files to standard output and exits. FILES <br>
wtmp <br>
The system wide login record file. See wtmp(5) for further
details. AUTHOR <br>
