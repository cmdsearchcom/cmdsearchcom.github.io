<p>PERL5120DELTA(1) Perl Programmers Reference Guide
PERL5120DELTA(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
perl5120delta - what is new for perl v5.12.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
This document describes differences between the 5.10.0
release and the 5.12.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Many of the bug fixes in 5.12.0
are already included in the 5.10.1 maintenance release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can see the list of those
changes in the 5.10.1 release notes (perl5101delta).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Core Enhancements <br>
New &quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; syntax <br>
This new syntax allows a module author to set the $VERSION
of a namespace when the namespace is declared with
&rsquo;package&rsquo;. It eliminates the need for &quot;our
$VERSION = ...&quot; and <br>
similar constructs. E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">package Foo::Bar 1.23; <br>
# $Foo::Bar::VERSION == 1.23</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are several advantages to
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $VERSION is
parsed in exactly the same way as &quot;use NAME
VERSION&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $VERSION is set
at compile time</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; $VERSION is a
version object that provides proper overloading of
comparison operators so comparing $VERSION to decimal (1.23)
or dotted-decimal (v1.2.3) version numbers works <br>
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Eliminates
&quot;$VERSION = ...&quot; and &quot;eval $VERSION&quot;
clutter</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As it requires
VERSION to be a numeric literal or v-string literal, it can
be statically parsed by toolchain modules without
&quot;eval&quot; the way MM-&gt;parse_version does for <br>
&quot;$VERSION = ...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It does not break old code with
only &quot;package NAME&quot;, but code that uses
&quot;package NAME VERSION&quot; will need to be restricted
to perl 5.12.0 or newer This is analogous to the change <br>
to &quot;open&quot; from two-args to three-args. Users
requiring the latest Perl will benefit, and perhaps after
several years, it will become a standard practice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, &quot;package NAME
VERSION&quot; requires a new, &rsquo;strict&rsquo; version
number format. See &quot;Version number formats&quot; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;...&quot; operator
<br>
A new operator, &quot;...&quot;, nicknamed the Yada Yada
operator, has been added. It is intended to mark placeholder
code that is not yet implemented. See &quot;Yada Yada
Operator&quot; in <br>
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Implicit strictures <br>
Using the &quot;use VERSION&quot; syntax with a version
number greater or equal to 5.11.0 will lexically enable
strictures just like &quot;use strict&quot; would do (in
addition to enabling <br>
features.) The following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use 5.12.0;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">means:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">use strict; <br>
use feature &rsquo;:5.12&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode improvements <br>
Perl 5.12 comes with Unicode 5.2, the latest version
available to us at the time of release. This version of
Unicode was released in October 2009. See <br>
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.2.0&gt; for
further details about what&rsquo;s changed in this version
of the standard. See perlunicode for instructions on
installing and using <br>
other versions of Unicode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, Perl&rsquo;s
developers have significantly improved Perl&rsquo;s Unicode
implementation. For full details, see &quot;Unicode
overhaul&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Y2038 compliance <br>
Perl&rsquo;s core time-related functions are now Y2038
compliant. (It may not mean much to you, but your kids will
love it!)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qr overloading <br>
It is now possible to overload the &quot;qr//&quot;
operator, that is, conversion to regexp, like it was already
possible to overload conversion to boolean, string or number
of objects. It <br>
is invoked when an object appears on the right hand side of
the &quot;=~&quot; operator or when it is interpolated into
a regexp. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pluggable keywords <br>
Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser
to define new kinds of keyword-headed expression and
compound statement. The syntax following the keyword is
defined <br>
entirely by the extension. This allow a completely non-Perl
sublanguage to be parsed inline, with the correct ops
cleanly generated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism.
The Perl core source distribution also includes a new module
XS::APItest::KeywordRPN, which implements reverse Polish
<br>
notation arithmetic via pluggable keywords. This module is
mainly used for test purposes, and is not normally
installed, but also serves as an example of how to use the
new <br>
mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s developers consider
this feature to be experimental. We may remove it or change
it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">APIs for more internals <br>
The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system
now have C APIs available to XS extensions. These are
necessary to support proper use of pluggable keywords, but
have <br>
other uses too. The new APIs are experimental, and only
cover a small proportion of what would be necessary to take
full advantage of the core&rsquo;s facilities in these
areas. It is <br>
intended that the Perl 5.13 development cycle will see the
addition of a full range of clean, supported interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s developers consider
this feature to be experimental. We may remove it or change
it in a backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Overridable function lookup <br>
Where an extension module hooks the creation of rv2cv ops to
modify the subroutine lookup process, this now works
correctly for bareword subroutine calls. This means that
<br>
prototypes on subroutines referenced this way will be
processed correctly. (Previously bareword subroutine names
were initially looked up, for parsing purposes, by an
unhookable <br>
mechanism, so extensions could only properly influence
subroutine names that appeared with an &quot;&amp;&quot;
sigil.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A proper interface for pluggable
Method Resolution Orders <br>
As of Perl 5.12.0 there is a new interface for plugging and
using method resolution orders other than the default linear
depth first search. The C3 method resolution order added
<br>
in 5.10.0 has been re-implemented as a plugin, without
changing its Perl-space interface. See perlmroapi for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;xperimental regex escape
<br>
Perl now supports &quot; a new regex escape which you can
think of as the inverse of &quot;0. It will match any
character that is not a newline, independently from the
presence or <br>
absence of the single line match modifier &quot;/s&quot;. It
is not usable within a character class. &quot;&quot; means
to match 3 non-newlines; &quot;}&quot; means to match at
least 5. &quot;AME}&quot; <br>
still means the character or sequence named
&quot;NAME&quot;, but &quot;NAME&quot; no longer can be
things like 3, or &quot;5,&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This will break a custom
charnames translator which allows numbers for character
names, as &quot;&quot; will now mean to match 3 non-newline
characters, and not the character whose <br>
name is 3. (No name defined by the Unicode standard is a
number, so only custom translators might be affected.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s developers are
somewhat concerned about possible user confusion with the
existing &quot; construct which matches characters
by their Unicode name. Consequently, this <br>
feature is experimental. We may remove it or change it in a
backwards-incompatible way in Perl 5.14.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DTrace support <br>
Perl now has some support for DTrace. See &quot;DTrace
support&quot; in INSTALL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Support for
&quot;configure_requires&quot; in CPAN module metadata <br>
Both &quot;CPAN&quot; and &quot;CPANPLUS&quot; now support
the &quot;configure_requires&quot; keyword in the META.yml
metadata file included in most recent CPAN distributions.
This allows distribution <br>
authors to specify configuration prerequisites that must be
installed before running Makefile.PL or Build.PL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">See the documentation for
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; or &quot;Module::Build&quot;
for more on how to specify &quot;configure_requires&quot;
when creating a distribution for CPAN.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;each&quot;,
&quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot; are now more flexible
<br>
The &quot;each&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;, &quot;values&quot;
function can now operate on arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;when&quot; as a statement
modifier <br>
&quot;when&quot; is now allowed to be used as a statement
modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$, flexibility <br>
The variable $, may now be tied.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">// in when clauses <br>
// now behaves like || in when clauses</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Enabling warnings from your
shell environment <br>
You can now set &quot;-W&quot; from the &quot;PERL5OPT&quot;
environment variable</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;delete local&quot; <br>
&quot;delete local&quot; now allows you to locally delete a
hash entry.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New support for Abstract
namespace sockets <br>
Abstract namespace sockets are Linux-specific socket type
that live in AF_UNIX family, slightly abusing it to be able
to use arbitrary character arrays as addresses: They start
<br>
with nul byte and are not terminated by nul byte, but with
the length passed to the socket() system call.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">32-bit limit on substr arguments
removed <br>
The 32-bit limit on &quot;substr&quot; arguments has now
been removed. The full range of the system&rsquo;s signed
and unsigned integers is now available for the
&quot;pos&quot; and &quot;len&quot; arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Potentially Incompatible Changes
<br>
Deprecations warn by default <br>
Over the years, Perl&rsquo;s developers have deprecated a
number of language features for a variety of reasons. Perl
now defaults to issuing a warning if a deprecated language
feature <br>
is used. Many of the deprecations Perl now warns you about
have been deprecated for many years. You can find a list of
what was deprecated in a given release of Perl in the <br>
&quot;perl5xxdelta.pod&quot; file for that release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To disable this feature in a
given lexical scope, you should use &quot;no warnings
&rsquo;deprecated&rsquo;;&quot; For information about which
language features are deprecated and explanations of <br>
various deprecation warnings, please see perldiag. See
&quot;Deprecations&quot; below for the list of features and
modules Perl&rsquo;s developers have deprecated as part of
this release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version number formats <br>
Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into
&quot;strict&quot; and &quot;lax&quot; rules. &quot;package
NAME VERSION&quot; takes a strict version number.
&quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot; and the version <br>
object constructors take lax version numbers. Providing an
invalid version will result in a fatal error. The version
argument in &quot;use NAME VERSION&quot; is first parsed as
a numeric <br>
literal or v-string and then passed to
&quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot; (and must then pass the
&quot;lax&quot; format test).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These formats are documented
fully in the version module. To a first approximation, a
&quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal
number (integer or decimal-fraction) without <br>
exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string with a
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; character and at least three
components. A &quot;lax&quot; version number allows
v-strings with fewer than three <br>
components or without a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;. Under
&quot;lax&quot; rules, both decimal and dotted-decimal
versions may have a trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component
separated by an underscore character after <br>
a fractional or dotted-decimal component.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version module adds
&quot;version::is_strict&quot; and
&quot;version::is_lax&quot; functions to check a scalar
against these rules.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">@INC reorganization <br>
In @INC, &quot;ARCHLIB&quot; and &quot;PRIVLIB&quot; now
occur after after the current version&rsquo;s
&quot;site_perl&quot; and &quot;vendor_perl&quot;. Modules
installed into &quot;site_perl&quot; and
&quot;vendor_perl&quot; will now be <br>
loaded in preference to those installed in
&quot;ARCHLIB&quot; and &quot;PRIVLIB&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGEXPs are now first class <br>
Internally, Perl now treats compiled regular expressions
(such as those created with &quot;qr//&quot;) as first class
entities. Perl modules which serialize, deserialize or
otherwise have <br>
deep interaction with Perl&rsquo;s internal data structures
need to be updated for this change. Most affected CPAN
modules have already been updated as of this writing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Switch statement changes <br>
The &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; switch statement
handles complex statements better than Perl 5.10.0 did
(These enhancements are also available in 5.10.1 and
subsequent 5.10 releases.) There <br>
are two new cases where &quot;when&quot; now interprets its
argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be used
in a smart match:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">flip-flop operators <br>
The &quot;..&quot; and &quot;...&quot; flip-flop operators
are now evaluated in boolean context, following their usual
semantics; see &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that, as in perl 5.10.0,
&quot;when (1..10)&quot; will not work to test whether a
given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should use
&quot;when ([1..10])&quot; instead (note the <br>
array reference).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">However, contrary to 5.10.0,
evaluating the flip-flop operators in boolean context
ensures it can now be useful in a &quot;when()&quot;,
notably for implementing bistable conditions, <br>
like in:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
<br>
# do something <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">defined-or operator <br>
A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as
in &quot;when (expr1 // expr2)&quot;, will be treated as
boolean if the first expression is boolean. (This just
extends the <br>
existing rule that applies to the regular or operator, as in
&quot;when (expr1 || expr2)&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart match changes <br>
Since Perl 5.10.0, Perl&rsquo;s developers have made a
number of changes to the smart match operator. These, of
course, also alter the behaviour of the switch statements
where smart <br>
matching is implicitly used. These changes were also made
for the 5.10.1 release, and will remain in subsequent 5.10
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to type-based
dispatch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The smart match operator
&quot;~~&quot; is no longer commutative. The behaviour of a
smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right
hand argument. Moreover, its semantics have <br>
been adjusted for greater consistency or usefulness in
several cases. While the general backwards compatibility is
maintained, several changes must be noted:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Code references
with an empty prototype are no longer treated specially.
They are passed an argument like the other code references
(even if they choose to ignore it).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;%hash ~~
sub {}&quot; and &quot;@array ~~ sub {}&quot; now test that
the subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash
(or element of the array), instead of passing the whole <br>
hash or array as a reference to the subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Due to the
commutativity breakage, code references are no longer
treated specially when appearing on the left of the
&quot;~~&quot; operator, but like any vulgar scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;undef ~~
%hash&quot; is always false (since &quot;undef&quot;
can&rsquo;t be a key in a hash). No implicit conversion to
&quot;&quot; is done (as was the case in perl 5.10.0).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;$scalar ~~
@array&quot; now always distributes the smart match across
the elements of the array. It&rsquo;s true if one element in
@array verifies &quot;$scalar ~~ $element&quot;. This is a
<br>
generalization of the old behaviour that tested whether the
array contained the scalar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The full dispatch table for the
smart match operator is given in &quot;Smart matching in
detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Smart match and overloading</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">According to the rule of
dispatch based on the rightmost argument type, when an
object overloading &quot;~~&quot; appears on the right side
of the operator, the overload routine will <br>
always be called (with a 3rd argument set to a true value,
see overload.) However, when the object will appear on the
left, the overload routine will be called only when the <br>
rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way,
distributivity of smart match across arrays is not broken,
as well as the other behaviours with complex types
(coderefs, hashes, <br>
regexes). Thus, writers of overloading routines for smart
match mostly need to worry only with comparing against a
scalar, and possibly with stringification overloading; the
<br>
other common cases will be automatically handled
consistently.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;~~&quot; will now refuse
to work on objects that do not overload it (in order to
avoid relying on the object&rsquo;s underlying structure).
(However, if the object overloads the <br>
stringification or the numification operators, and if
overload fallback is active, it will be used instead, as
usual.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Other potentially incompatible
changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The definitions of a number of Unicode
properties have changed to match those of the current
Unicode standard. These are listed above under &quot;Unicode
overhaul&quot;. This change <br>
may break code that expects the old definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The boolkeys op
has moved to the group of hash ops. This breaks binary
compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Filehandles are
now always blessed into &quot;IO::File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The previous behaviour was to
bless Filehandles into FileHandle (an empty proxy class) if
it was loaded into memory and otherwise to bless them into
&quot;IO::Handle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The semantics of
&quot;use feature :5.10*&quot; have changed slightly. See
&quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s
developers now use git, rather than Perforce. This should be
a purely internal change only relevant to people actively
working on the core. However, you may see <br>
minor difference in perl as a consequence of the change. For
example in some of details of the output of &quot;perl
-V&quot;. See perlrepository for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As part of the
&quot;Test::Harness&quot; 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the
experimental &quot;Test::Harness::Straps&quot; module has
been removed. See &quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot; for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As part of the
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; upgrade, the
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes&quot; and
&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish&quot; modules have been
removed from this distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Module::CoreList&quot; no longer contains the
%:patchlevel hash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;length
undef&quot; now returns undef.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Unsupported
private C API functions are now declared &quot;static&quot;
to prevent leakage to Perl&rsquo;s public API.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To support the
bootstrapping process, miniperl no longer builds with UTF-8
support in the regexp engine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This allows a build to complete
with PERL_UNICODE set and a UTF-8 locale. Without this
there&rsquo;s a bootstrapping problem, as miniperl
can&rsquo;t load the UTF-8 components of the <br>
regexp engine, because they&rsquo;re not yet built.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; miniperl&rsquo;s
@INC is now restricted to just &quot;-I...&quot;, the split
of $ENV{PERL5LIB}, and &quot;&quot;.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A space or a
newline is now required after a &quot;#line XXX&quot;
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Tied filehandles
now have an additional method EOF which provides the EOF
type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; To better match
all other flow control statements, &quot;foreach&quot; may
no longer be used as an attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s
command-line switch &quot;-P&quot;, which was deprecated in
version 5.10.0, has now been removed. The CPAN module
&quot;Filter::cpp&quot; can be used as an alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecations <br>
From time to time, Perl&rsquo;s developers find it necessary
to deprecate features or modules we&rsquo;ve previously
shipped as part of the core distribution. We are well aware
of the pain <br>
and frustration that a backwards-incompatible change to Perl
can cause for developers building or maintaining software in
Perl. You can be sure that when we deprecate a <br>
functionality or syntax, it isn&rsquo;t a choice we make
lightly. Sometimes, we choose to deprecate functionality or
syntax because it was found to be poorly designed or
implemented. <br>
Sometimes, this is because they&rsquo;re holding back other
features or causing performance problems. Sometimes, the
reasons are more complex. Wherever possible, we try to keep
<br>
deprecated functionality available to developers in its
previous form for at least one major release. So long as a
deprecated feature isn&rsquo;t actively disrupting our
ability to <br>
maintain and extend Perl, we&rsquo;ll try to leave it in
place as long as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following items are now
deprecated:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">suidperl <br>
&quot;suidperl&quot; is no longer part of Perl. It used to
provide a mechanism to emulate setuid permission bits on
systems that don&rsquo;t support it properly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of &quot;:=&quot; to mean an
empty attribute list <br>
An accident of Perl&rsquo;s parser meant that these
constructions were all equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $pi := 4; <br>
my $pi : = 4; <br>
my $pi : = 4;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">with the &quot;:&quot; being
treated as the start of an attribute list, which ends before
the &quot;=&quot;. As whitespace is not significant here,
all are parsed as an empty attribute list, <br>
hence all the above are equivalent to, and better written
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">my $pi = 4;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">because no attribute processing
is done for an empty list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As is, this meant that
&quot;:=&quot; cannot be used as a new token, without
silently changing the meaning of existing code. Hence that
particular form is now deprecated, and will <br>
become a syntax error. If it is absolutely necessary to have
empty attribute lists (for example, because of a code
generator) then avoid the warning by adding a space before
<br>
the &quot;=&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot;
<br>
The method &quot;UNIVERSAL-&gt;import()&quot; is now
deprecated. Attempting to pass import arguments to a
&quot;use UNIVERSAL&quot; statement will result in a
deprecation warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump
into a construct <br>
Using &quot;goto&quot; to jump from an outer scope into an
inner scope is now deprecated. This rare use case was
causing problems in the implementation of scopes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Custom character names in ame}
that don&rsquo;t look like names <br>
In &quot;ame}&quot;, name can be just about anything. The
standard Unicode names have a very limited domain, but a
custom name translator could create names that are, for
example, <br>
made up entirely of punctuation symbols. It is now
deprecated to make names that don&rsquo;t begin with an
alphabetic character, and aren&rsquo;t alphanumeric or
contain other than a <br>
very few other characters, namely spaces, dashes,
parentheses and colons. Because of the added meaning of
&quot;ee &quot;&quot;xperimental regex escape&quot;), names
that look like <br>
curly brace -enclosed quantifiers won&rsquo;t work. For
example, &quot;4}&quot; now means to match 3 to 4
non-newlines; before a custom name &quot;3,4&quot; could
have been created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated Modules <br>
The following modules will be removed from the core
distribution in a future release, and should be installed
from CPAN instead. Distributions on CPAN which require these
<br>
should add them to their prerequisites. The core versions of
these modules warnings will issue a deprecation warning.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you ship a packaged version
of Perl, either alone or as part of a larger system, then
you should carefully consider the repercussions of core
module deprecations. You may <br>
want to consider shipping your default build of Perl with
packages for some or all deprecated modules which install
into &quot;vendor&quot; or &quot;site&quot; perl library
directories. This <br>
will inhibit the deprecation warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you may want to
consider patching lib/deprecate.pm to provide deprecation
warnings specific to your packaging system or distribution
of Perl, consistent with <br>
how your packaging system or distribution manages a staged
transition from a release where the installation of a single
package provides the given functionality, to a later <br>
release where the system administrator needs to know to
install multiple packages to get that same
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can silence these
deprecation warnings by installing the modules in question
from CPAN. To install the latest version of all of them,
just install <br>
&quot;Task::Deprecations::5_12&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Class::ISA <br>

Perl&rsquo;s new &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; feature
a suitable replacement. See &quot;Switch statements&quot; in
perlsyn for more information.</p>

and it will be removed in a future release. Although listed
as part of <br>
the API, it was never documented, and only ever used in
toke.c, and prior to 5.10, regcomp.c. In core, it has been
replaced by a static function.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Numerous Perl 4-era libraries

all now deprecated. Earlier, Perl&rsquo;s developers
intended to remove these libraries from Perl&rsquo;s core
for the 5.14.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">During final testing before the
release of 5.12.0, several developers discovered current
production code using these ancient libraries, some inside
the Perl core itself. <br>
Accordingly, the pumpking granted them a stay of execution.
They will begin to warn about their deprecation in the
5.14.0 release and will be removed in the 5.16.0
release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unicode overhaul <br>
Perl&rsquo;s developers have made a concerted effort to
update Perl to be in sync with the latest Unicode standard.
Changes for this include:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl can now handle every
Unicode character property. New documentation, perluniprops,
lists all available non-Unihan character properties. By
default, perl does not expose <br>
Unihan, deprecated or Unicode-internal properties. See below
for more details on these; there is also a section in the
pod listing them, and explaining why they are not
exposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now fully supports the
Unicode compound-style of using &quot;=&quot; and
&quot;:&quot; in writing regular expressions:
&quot;{property=value}&quot; and
&quot;{property:value}&quot; (both of which mean the same
<br>
thing).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now fully supports the
Unicode loose matching rules for text between the braces in
&quot;{...}&quot; constructs. In addition, Perl allows
underscores between digits of numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl now accepts all the
Unicode-defined synonyms for properties and property
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;qr/ <br>
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/&gt;). Anything
matched previously and that made sense will continue to be
accepted. Additionally:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;CR
LF&quot; sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;ZWJ&quot;
and &quot;ZWNJ&quot; characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot; <br>
isolation, and &quot;ZWSP&quot;. And this is the part where
&quot; <br>
used to that don&rsquo;t make sense. Formerly, for example,
you could have the nonsensical case of an accented LF.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, this change should be
transparent for the non-affected languages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{...}&quot; matches using
the Canonical_Combining_Class property were completely
broken in previous releases of Perl. They should now work
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Before Perl 5.12, the Unicode
&quot;Decomposition_Type=Compat&quot; property and a Perl
extension had the same name, which led to neither matching
all the correct values (with more than <br>
100 mistakes in one, and several thousand in the other). The
Perl extension has now been renamed to be
&quot;Decomposition_Type=Noncanonical&quot; (short:
&quot;dt=noncanon&quot;). It has the same <br>
meaning as was previously intended, namely the union of all
the non-canonical Decomposition types, with Unicode
&quot;Compat&quot; being just one of those.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{Decomposition_Type=Canonical}&quot;
now includes the Hangul syllables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{Uppercase}&quot; and
&quot;{Lowercase}&quot; now work as the Unicode standard
says they should. This means they each match a few more
characters than they used to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{Cntrl}&quot; now matches
the same characters as &quot;{Control}&quot;. This means it
no longer will match Private Use (gc=co), Surrogates
(gc=cs), nor Format (gc=cf) code points. The <br>
Format code points represent the biggest possible problem.
All but 36 of them are either officially deprecated or
strongly discouraged from being used. Of those 36, likely
the <br>
most widely used are the soft hyphen (U+00AD), and BOM,
ZWSP, ZWNJ, WJ, and similar characters, plus bidirectional
controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{Alpha}&quot; now matches
the same characters as &quot;{Alphabetic}&quot;. Before
5.12, Perl&rsquo;s definition definition included a number
of things that aren&rsquo;t really alpha (all marks) while
<br>
omitting many that were. The definitions of
&quot;{Alnum}&quot; and &quot;{Word}&quot; depend on
Alpha&rsquo;s definition and have changed accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{Word}&quot; no longer
incorrectly matches non-word characters such as
fractions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{Print}&quot; no longer
matches the line control characters: Tab, LF, CR, FF, VT,
and NEL. This brings it in line with standards and the
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;{XDigit}&quot; now matches
the same characters as &quot;{Hex_Digit}&quot;. This means
that in addition to the characters it currently matches,
&quot;[A-Fa-f0-9]&quot;, it will also match the 22 <br>
fullwidth equivalents, for example U+FF10: FULLWIDTH DIGIT
ZERO.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Numeric type property has
been extended to include the Unihan characters.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a new Perl extension,
the &rsquo;Present_In&rsquo;, or simply &rsquo;In&rsquo;,
property. This is an extension of the Unicode Age property,
but &quot;{In=5.0}&quot; matches any code point whose usage
<br>
has been determined as of Unicode version 5.0. The
&quot;{Age=5.0}&quot; only matches code points added in
precisely version 5.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of properties now have
the correct values for unassigned code points. The affected
properties are Bidi_Class, East_Asian_Width, Joining_Type,
Decomposition_Type, <br>
Hangul_Syllable_Type, Numeric_Type, and Line_Break.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The
Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, ID_Continue, and ID_Start
properties are now up to date with current Unicode
definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Earlier versions of Perl
erroneously exposed certain properties that are supposed to
be Unicode internal-only. Use of these in regular
expressions will now generate, if enabled, <br>
a deprecation warning message. The properties are:
Other_Alphabetic, Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point,
Other_Grapheme_Extend, Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start,
<br>
Other_Lowercase, Other_Math, and Other_Uppercase.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is now possible to change
which Unicode properties Perl understands on a
per-installation basis. As mentioned above, certain
properties are turned off by default. These <br>
include all the Unihan properties (which should be
accessible via the CPAN module Unicode::Unihan) and any
deprecated or Unicode internal-only property that Perl has
never <br>
exposed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated files in the
&quot;lib/unicore/To&quot; directory are now more clearly
marked as being stable, directly usable by applications. New
hash entries in them give the format of <br>
the normal entries, which allows for easier machine parsing.
Perl can generate files in this directory for any property,
though most are suppressed. You can find instructions <br>
for changing which are written in perluniprops.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Modules and Pragmata <br>
New Modules and Pragmata <br>
&quot;autodie&quot; <br>
&quot;autodie&quot; is a new lexically-scoped alternative
for the &quot;Fatal&quot; module. The bundled version is
2.06_01. Note that in this release, using a string eval when
&quot;autodie&quot; is in <br>
effect can cause the autodie behaviour to leak into the
surrounding scope. See &quot;BUGS&quot; in autodie for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Version 2.06_01 has been added
to the Perl core.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Compress::Raw::Bzip2&quot;

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;charnames&quot; <br>
&quot;charnames&quot; now contains the Unicode

some extra &quot;haracter names that formerly wouldn&rsquo;t

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Upgraded from version 1.17 to
1.19.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;feature&quot; <br>
In &quot;feature&quot;, the meaning of the &quot;:5.10&quot;
and &quot;:5.10.X&quot; feature bundles has changed
slightly. The last component, if any (i.e. &quot;X&quot;) is
simply ignored. This is predicated on <br>
the assumption that new features will not, in general, be
added to maintenance releases. So &quot;:5.10&quot; and
&quot;:5.10.X&quot; have identical effect. This is a change
to the behaviour <br>
documented for 5.10.0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;feature&quot; now includes
the &quot;unicode_strings&quot; feature:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;mro&quot; <br>
&quot;mro&quot; is now implemented as an XS extension. The
documented interface has not changed. Code relying on the
implementation detail that some &quot;mro::&quot; methods
happened to be <br>
available at all times gets to &quot;keep both

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deprecated Modules and Pragmata
<br>
See &quot;Deprecated Modules&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Documentation <br>
New Documentation <br>
&Acirc;&middot; perlhaiku contains instructions on how to
build perl for the Haiku platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlmroapi
describes the new interface for pluggable Method Resolution
Orders.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlperf, by
Richard Foley, provides an introduction to the use of
performance and optimization techniques which can be used
with particular reference to perl programs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlrepository
describes how to access the perl source using the git
version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlpolicy
extends the &quot;Social contract about contributed
modules&quot; into the beginnings of a document on Perl
porting policies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes to Existing
Documentation <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The various large Changes* files (which
listed every change made to perl over the last 18 years)
have been removed, and replaced by a small file, also called
Changes, which <br>
just explains how that same information may be extracted
from the git version control system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Porting/patching.pod has been deleted, as it mainly
described interacting with the old Perforce-based
repository, which is now obsolete. Information still
relevant has been <br>
moved to perlrepository.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The syntax
&quot;unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK&quot; is now documented
as valid, as is the syntax &quot;unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif
(EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK&quot;, although actually using
the <br>
latter may not be the best idea for the readability of your
source code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documented -X
overloading.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documented that
&quot;when()&quot; treats specially most of the filetest
operators</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Documented
&quot;when&quot; as a syntax modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Eliminated
&quot;Old Perl threads tutorial&quot;, which described 5005
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pod/perlthrtut.pod is the same
material reworked for ithreads.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Correct previous
documentation: v-strings are not deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With version objects, we need
them to use MODULE VERSION syntax. This patch removes the
deprecation notice.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Security contact
information is now part of perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A significant
fraction of the core documentation has been updated to
clarify the behavior of Perl&rsquo;s Unicode handling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Much of the remaining core
documentation has been reviewed and edited for clarity,
consistent use of language, and to fix the spelling of Tom
Christiansen&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The Pod
specification (perlpodspec) has been updated to bring the
specification in line with modern usage already supported by
most Pod systems. A parameter string may now <br>
follow the format name in a &quot;begin/end&quot; region.
Links to URIs with a text description are now allowed. The
usage of &quot;L&lt;&quot;section&quot;&gt;&quot; has been
marked as deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; if.pm has been
documented in &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc as a means to get
conditional loading of modules despite the implicit BEGIN
block around &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
documentation for $1 in perlvar.pod has been clarified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;+code
point}&quot; is now documented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Selected Performance
Enhancements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; A new internal cache means that
&quot;isa()&quot; will often be faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
implementation of &quot;C3&quot; Method Resolution Order has
been optimised - linearisation for classes with single
inheritance is 40% faster. Performance for multiple
inheritance <br>
is unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under &quot;use
locale&quot;, the locale-relevant information is now cached
on read-only values, such as the list returned by &quot;keys
%hash&quot;. This makes operations such as &quot;sort keys
<br>
%hash&quot; in the scope of &quot;use locale&quot; much
faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Empty
&quot;DESTROY&quot; methods are no longer called.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_sv_utf8_upgrade()&quot; is now faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;keys&quot;
on empty hash is now faster.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;if
(%foo)&quot; has been optimized to be faster than &quot;if
(keys %foo)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The string
repetition operator (&quot;$str x $num&quot;) is now several
times faster when $str has length one or $num is large.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Reversing an
array to itself (as in &quot;@a = reverse @a&quot;) in void
context now happens in-place and is several orders of
magnitude faster than it used to be. It will also <br>
preserve non-existent elements whenever possible, i.e. for
non magical arrays or tied arrays with &quot;EXISTS&quot;
and &quot;DELETE&quot; methods.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Installation and Configuration
Improvements <br>
&Acirc;&middot; perlapi, perlintern, perlmodlib and perltoc
are now all generated at build time, rather than being
shipped as part of the release.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; If
&quot;vendorlib&quot; and &quot;vendorarch&quot; are the
same, then they are only added to @INC once.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
$Config{usedevel} and the C-level &quot;PERL_USE_DEVEL&quot;
are now defined if perl is built with
&quot;-Dusedevel&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure will
enable use of &quot;-fstack-protector&quot;, to provide
protection against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler
supports it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Configure will
now determine the correct prototypes for re-entrant
functions and for &quot;gconvert&quot; if you are using a
C++ compiler rather than a C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Unix, if you
build from a tree containing a git repository, the
configuration process will note the commit hash you have
checked out, for display in the output of &quot;perl <br>
-v&quot; and &quot;perl -V&quot;. Unpushed local commits are
automatically added to the list of local patches displayed
by &quot;perl -V&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now
supports SystemTap&rsquo;s &quot;dtrace&quot; compatibility
layer and an issue with linking &quot;miniperl&quot; has
been fixed in the process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perldoc now uses
&quot;less -R&quot; instead of &quot;less&quot; for improved
behaviour in the face of &quot;groff&quot;&rsquo;s new usage
of ANSI escape codes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;perl
-V&quot; now reports use of the compile-time options
&quot;USE_PERL_ATOF&quot; and
&quot;USE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_PERLIO&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; As part of the
flattening of ext, all extensions on all platforms are built
by make_ext.pl. This replaces the Unix-specific
ext/util/make_ext, VMS-specific make_ext.com and <br>
Win32-specific win32/buildext.pl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Internal Changes <br>
Each release of Perl sees numerous internal changes which
shouldn&rsquo;t affect day to day usage but may still be
notable for developers working with Perl&rsquo;s source
code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The J.R.R.
Tolkien quotes at the head of C source file have been
checked and proper citations added, thanks to a patch from
Tom Christiansen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The internal
structure of the dual-life modules traditionally found in
the lib/ and ext/ directories in the perl source has changed
significantly. Where possible, dual-lifed <br>
modules have been extracted from lib/ and ext/.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Dual-lifed modules maintained by
Perl&rsquo;s developers as part of the Perl core now live in
dist/. Dual-lifed modules maintained primarily on CPAN now
live in cpan/. When <br>
reporting a bug in a module located under cpan/, please send
your bug report directly to the module&rsquo;s bug tracker
or author, rather than Perl&rsquo;s bug tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;
now compiles better, always forces UTF-8 internal
representation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s developers have
fixed several problems with the recognition of
&quot; constructs. As part of this, perl will store
any scalar or regex containing &quot;ame}&quot; or <br>
&quot;+code point}&quot; in its definition in UTF-8 format.
(This was true previously for all occurrences of
&quot;ame}&quot; that did not use a custom translator, but
now it&rsquo;s always <br>
true.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
Perl_magic_setmglob now knows about globs, fixing RT
#71254.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;SVt_RV&quot; no longer exists. RVs are now stored in
IVs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_vcroak()&quot; now accepts a null first argument.
In addition, a full audit was made of the &quot;not
NULL&quot; compiler annotations, and those for several other
internal functions <br>
were corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; New macros
&quot;dSAVEDERRNO&quot;, &quot;dSAVE_ERRNO&quot;,
&quot;SAVE_ERRNO&quot;, &quot;RESTORE_ERRNO&quot; have been
added to formalise the temporary saving of the
&quot;errno&quot; variable.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_sv_insert_flags&quot; has been added to augment
&quot;Perl_sv_insert&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_newSV_type(type)&quot; has been added, equivalent
to &quot;Perl_newSV()&quot; followed by
&quot;Perl_sv_upgrade(type)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_newSVpvn_flags()&quot; has been added, equivalent
to &quot;Perl_newSVpvn()&quot; and then performing the
action relevant to the flag.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Two flag bits are currently
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot; will call &quot;SvUTF8_on()&quot; for
you. (Note that this does not convert an sequence of ISO
8859-1 characters to UTF-8). A wrapper,
&quot;newSVpvn_utf8()&quot; is available for <br>
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;SVs_TEMP&quot; now calls &quot;Perl_sv_2mortal()&quot;
on the new SV.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also a wrapper that
takes constant strings, &quot;newSVpvs_flags()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The function
&quot;Perl_croak_xs_usage&quot; has been added as a wrapper
to &quot;Perl_croak&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now exports
the functions &quot;PerlIO_find_layer&quot; and
&quot;PerlIO_list_alloc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;PL_na&quot; has been exterminated from the core code,
replaced by local STRLEN temporaries, or
&quot;*_nolen()&quot; calls. Either approach is faster than
&quot;PL_na&quot;, which is a pointer <br>
dereference into the interpreter structure under ithreads,
and a global variable otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_mg_free()&quot; used to leave freed memory
accessible via &quot;SvMAGIC()&quot; on the scalar. It now
updates the linked list to remove each piece of magic as it
is freed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under ithreads,
the regex in &quot;PL_reg_curpm&quot; is now reference
counted. This eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to
cope with it not being reference counted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Perl_mg_magical()&quot; would sometimes incorrectly
turn on &quot;SvRMAGICAL()&quot;. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The public IV
and NV flags are now not set if the string value has
trailing &quot;garbage&quot;. This behaviour is consistent
with not setting the public IV or NV flags if the value is
<br>
out of range for the type.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Uses of
&quot;Nullav&quot;, &quot;Nullcv&quot;, &quot;Nullhv&quot;,
&quot;Nullop&quot;, &quot;Nullsv&quot; etc have been
replaced by &quot;NULL&quot; in the core code, and
non-dual-life modules, as &quot;NULL&quot; is clearer to
those <br>
unfamiliar with the core code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A macro
MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on (non-pedantic) gcc
will not cast away &quot;const&quot;, returning a &quot;void
*&quot;. Macros &quot;MUTABLE_SV(av)&quot;,
&quot;MUTABLE_SV(cv)&quot; etc build on <br>
this, casting to &quot;AV *&quot; etc without casting away
&quot;const&quot;. This allows proper compile-time auditing
of &quot;const&quot; correctness in the core, and helped
picked up some errors (now <br>
fixed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Macros
&quot;mPUSHs()&quot; and &quot;mXPUSHs()&quot; have been
added, for pushing SVs on the stack and mortalizing
them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of the
private structure &quot;mro_meta&quot; has changed slightly.
Nothing outside the core should be accessing this directly
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new tool,
Porting/expand-macro.pl has been added, that allows you to
view how a C preprocessor macro would be expanded when
compiled. This is handy when trying to decode <br>
the macro hell that is the perl guts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Testing <br>
Testing improvements <br>
Parallel tests <br>
The core distribution can now run its regression tests in
parallel on Unix-like platforms. Instead of running
&quot;make test&quot;, set &quot;TEST_JOBS&quot; in your
environment to the number <br>
of tests to run in parallel, and run &quot;make
test_harness&quot;. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done
as</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness #
Run 3 tests in parallel</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">An environment variable is used,
rather than parallel make itself, because TAP::Harness needs
to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test
scripts itself, and there <br>
is no standard interface to &quot;make&quot; utilities to
interact with their job schedulers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that currently some test
scripts may fail when run in parallel (most notably
&quot;ext/IO/t/io_dir.t&quot;). If necessary run just the
failing scripts again sequentially and see <br>
if the failures go away.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test harness flexibility <br>
It&rsquo;s now possible to override &quot;PERL5OPT&quot; and
friends in t/TEST</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Test watchdog <br>
Several tests that have the potential to hang forever if
they fail now incorporate a &quot;watchdog&quot;
functionality that will kill them after a timeout, which
helps ensure that <br>
&quot;make test&quot; and &quot;make test_harness&quot; run
to completion automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Tests <br>
Perl&rsquo;s developers have added a number of new tests to
the core. In addition to the items listed below, many
modules updated from CPAN incorporate new tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Significant
cleanups to core tests to ensure that language and
interpreter features are not used before they&rsquo;re
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;make
test_porting&quot; now runs a number of important pre-commit
checks which might be of use to anyone working on the Perl
core.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/porting/podcheck.t automatically checks the
well-formedness of POD found in all .pl, .pm and .pod files
in the MANIFEST, other than in dual-lifed modules which are
<br>
primarily maintained outside the Perl core.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/porting/manifest.t now tests that all files listed in
MANIFEST are present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/op/while_readdir.t tests that a bare readdir in while loop
sets $_.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/comp/retainedlines.t checks that the debugger can retain
source lines from &quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/io/perlio_fail.t checks that bad layers fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/io/perlio_leaks.t checks that PerlIO layers are not
leaking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
t/io/perlio_open.t checks that certain special forms of open
work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; t/io/perlio.t
includes general PerlIO tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; t/io/pvbm.t

New Diagnostics <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This new warning is issued when
one attempts to mark a subroutine as lvalue after it has

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now warns
you if &quot;++&quot; or &quot;--&quot; are unable to change

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The rules on

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changed Diagnostics <br>
A number of existing diagnostic messages have been improved
or corrected:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A new warning
category &quot;illegalproto&quot; allows finer-grained
control of warnings around function prototypes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The two warnings:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;Illegal character in
prototype for %s : %s&quot; <br>
&quot;Prototype after &rsquo;%c&rsquo; for %s : %s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">have been moved from the
&quot;syntax&quot; top-level warnings category into a new
first-level category, &quot;illegalproto&quot;. These two
warnings are currently the only ones emitted during <br>
parsing of an invalid/illegal prototype, so one can now
use</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">no warnings
&rsquo;illegalproto&rsquo;;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">to suppress only those, but not
other syntax-related warnings. Warnings where prototypes are
changed, ignored, or not met are still in the
&quot;prototype&quot; category as before.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Deep
recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is now possible to change the
depth threshold for this warning from the default of 100, by
recompiling the perl binary, setting the C pre-processor
macro <br>
&quot;PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN&quot; to the desired value.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Illegal
character in prototype&quot; warning is now more precise
when reporting illegal characters after _</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; mro merging
error messages are now very similar to those produced by
Algorithm::C3.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Amelioration of
the error message &quot;Unrecognized character %s in column
%d&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes the error message to
&quot;Unrecognized character %s; marked by &lt;-- HERE after
%s&lt;-- HERE near column %d&quot;. This should make it a
little simpler to spot and correct the <br>
suspicious character.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now
explicitly points to $. when it causes an uninitialized
warning for ranges in scalar context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;split&quot; now warns when called in void context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;printf&quot;-style functions called with too few
arguments will now issue the warning &quot;Missing argument
in %s&quot; [perl #71000]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now
properly returns a syntax error instead of segfaulting if
&quot;each&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;, or &quot;values&quot; is
used without an argument.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;tell()&quot; now fails properly if called without an
argument and when no previous file was read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;tell()&quot; now returns
&quot;-1&quot;, and sets errno to &quot;EBADF&quot;, thus
restoring the 5.8.x behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;overload&quot; no longer implicitly unsets fallback on
repeated &rsquo;use overload&rsquo; lines.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
POSIX::strftime() can now handle Unicode characters in the
format string.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;syntax&quot; category was removed from 5 warnings that
should only be in &quot;deprecated&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Three fatal
&quot;pack&quot;/&quot;unpack&quot; error messages have been
normalized to &quot;panic: %s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Unicode
character is illegal&quot; has been rephrased to be more
accurate</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It now reads &quot;Unicode
non-character is illegal in interchange&quot; and the
perldiag documentation has been expanded a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Currently, all
but the first of the several characters that the
&quot;charnames&quot; handler may return are discarded when
used in a regular expression pattern bracketed character
<br>
class. If this happens then the warning &quot;Using just the
first character returned by in character class&quot; will be
issued.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The warning
&quot;Missing right brace on or unescaped left brace after
Assuming the latter&quot; will be issued if Perl encounters
a &quot; but doesn&rsquo;t find a matching &quot;}&quot;. In
<br>
this case Perl doesn&rsquo;t know if it was mistakenly
omitted, or if &quot;match non-newline&quot; followed by
&quot;match a &quot;{&quot;&quot; was desired. It assumes
the latter because that is actually a <br>
valid interpretation as written, unlike the other case. If
you meant the former, you need to add the matching right
brace. If you did mean the latter, you can silence this <br>
warning by writing instead &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;gmtime&quot; and &quot;localtime&quot; called with
numbers smaller than they can reliably handle will now issue
the warnings &quot;gmtime(%.0f) too small&quot; and
&quot;localtime(%.0f) too small&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following diagnostic
messages have been removed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;Runaway
format&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;Can&rsquo;t locate package %s for the parents of

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In general this warning it only
got produced in conjunction with other warnings, and
removing it allowed an ISA lookup optimisation to be
added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;v-string
in use/require is non-portable&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Utility Changes <br>
&Acirc;&middot; h2ph now looks in &quot;include-fixed&quot;
too, which is a recent addition to gcc&rsquo;s search
path.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; h2xs no longer
incorrectly treats enum values like macros. It also now
handles C++ style comments (&quot;//&quot;) properly in
enums.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perl5db.pl now
supports &quot;LVALUE&quot; subroutines. Additionally, the
debugger now correctly handles proxy constant subroutines,
and subroutine stubs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlbug now uses
%Module::CoreList::bug_tracker to print out upstream bug
tracker URLs. If a user identifies a particular module as
the topic of their bug report and we&rsquo;re <br>
able to divine the URL for its upstream bug tracker, perlbug
now provide a message to the user explaining that the core
copies the CPAN version directly, and provide the URL <br>
for reporting the bug directly to the upstream author.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">perlbug no longer reports
&quot;Message sent&quot; when it hasn&rsquo;t actually sent
the message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perlthanks is a
new utility for sending non-bug-reports to the authors and
maintainers of Perl. Getting nothing but bug reports can
become a bit demoralising. If Perl 5.12 <br>

the developers smile.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl&rsquo;s

&quot;match()&quot; operator in list context. Additionally,
a2p no longer generates code that uses the $[ variable.</p>

&Acirc;&middot; U+0FFFF is now a legal character in regular
expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; pp_qr now always
returns a new regexp SV. Resolves RT #69852.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Instead of returning a(nother)
reference to the (pre-compiled) regexp in the optree, use
reg_temp_copy() to create a copy of it, and return a
reference to that. This resolves <br>
issues about Regexp::DESTROY not being called in a timely
fashion (the original bug tracked by RT #69852), as well as
bugs related to blessing regexps, and of assigning to <br>
regexps, as described in correspondence added to the
ticket.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It transpires that we also need
to undo the SvPVX() sharing when ithreads cloning a Regexp
SV, because mother_re is set to NULL, instead of a cloned
copy of the mother_re. <br>
This change might fix bugs with regexps and threads in
certain other situations, but as yet neither tests nor bug
reports have indicated any problems, so it might not <br>
actually be an edge case that it&rsquo;s possible to
reach.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several
compilation errors and segfaults when perl was built with
&quot;-Dmad&quot; were fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Fixes for lexer

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-I&quot;

documented, and as does &quot;-I&quot; when specified on the
command-line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;kill&quot;
is now fatal when called on non-numeric process identifiers.
Previously, an &quot;undef&quot; process identifier would be
interpreted as a request to kill process 0, which <br>
would terminate the current process group on POSIX systems.
Since process identifiers are always integers, killing a
non-numeric process is now fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; 5.10.0
inadvertently disabled an optimisation, which caused a
measurable performance drop in list assignment, such as is

values for untainted arguments [RT #59998].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;-i&quot;.suffix command-line switch now recreates the

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the XS API,
various hash functions, when passed a pre-computed hash
where the key is UTF-8, might result in an incorrect

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various bugs in
the new-to 5.10.0 mro code, triggered by manipulating @ISA,
have been found and fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Bitwise
operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g.
&quot;$x=; $x |= &quot;foo&quot;&quot; [RT #54956].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Patterns

my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8); <br>
$utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i; # failed in 5.10.0</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Within
UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where &quot;use

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The block form

erroneously treated like string &quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0, the
two characters &quot;[~&quot; were sometimes parsed as the
smart match operator (&quot;~~&quot;) [RT #63854].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0, the
&quot;*&quot; quantifier in patterns was sometimes treated
as &quot;{0,32767}&quot; [RT #60034, #60464]. For example,
this match would fail:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;

64 bit OS [RT #63924].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot; to exit a
&quot;given&quot; block no longer produces a spurious
warning like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Exiting given via last at foo.pl
line 123</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Assigning a
format to a glob could corrupt the format; e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format
now bad</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Attempting to
coerce a typeglob to a string or number could cause an
assertion failure. The correct error message is now
generated, &quot;Can&rsquo;t coerce GLOB to $type&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Under &quot;use
filetest &rsquo;access&rsquo;&quot;, &quot;-x&quot; was
using the wrong access mode. This has been fixed [RT
#49003].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;length&quot; on a tied scalar that returned a Unicode
value would not be correct the first time. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using an array
&quot;tie&quot; inside in array &quot;tie&quot; could SEGV.
This has been fixed. [RT #51636]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A race condition
inside &quot;PerlIOStdio_close()&quot; has been identified
and fixed. This used to cause various threading issues,
including SEGVs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In
&quot;unpack&quot;, the use of &quot;()&quot; groups in
scalar context was internally placing a list on the
interpreter&rsquo;s stack, which manifested in various ways,
including SEGVs. This is now <br>
fixed [RT #50256].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Magic was called
twice in &quot;substr&quot;, &quot;$x&quot;, &quot;tie $x,
$m&quot; and &quot;chop&quot;. These have all been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A 5.10.0
optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the
implicit loop of &quot;s///ge&quot; has been reverted, as it
turned out to be the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly <br>
unrelated parts of the interpreter [commit
ef0d4e17921ee3de].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The line numbers
for warnings inside &quot;elsif&quot; are now correct.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;..&quot; operator now works correctly with ranges
whose ends are at or close to the values of the smallest and
largest integers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;binmode
STDIN, &rsquo;:raw&rsquo;&quot; could lead to segmentation
faults on some platforms. This has been fixed [RT
#54828].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; An off-by-one
error meant that &quot;index $str, ...&quot; was effectively
being executed as &quot;index &quot;$str &quot;, ...&quot;.
This has been fixed [RT #53746].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various leaks
associated with named captures in regexes have been fixed
[RT #57024].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; A weak reference
to a hash would leak. This was affecting &quot;DBI&quot; [RT
#56908].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Using (?|) in a
regex could cause a segfault [RT #59734].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Use of a UTF-8
&quot;tr//&quot; within a closure could cause a segfault [RT
#61520].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Calling
&quot;Perl_sv_chop()&quot; or otherwise upgrading an SV
could result in an unaligned 64-bit access on the SPARC
architecture [RT #60574].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the 5.10.0
release, &quot;inc_version_list&quot; would incorrectly list
&quot;5.10.*&quot; after &quot;5.8.*&quot;; this affected
the @INC search order [RT #67628].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0,
&quot;pack &quot;a*&quot;, $tainted_value&quot; returned a
non-tainted value [RT #52552].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0,
&quot;printf&quot; and &quot;sprintf&quot; could produce the
fatal error &quot;panic: utf8_mg_pos_cache_update&quot; when
printing UTF-8 strings [RT #62666].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the 5.10.0
release, a dynamically created &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; method
might be missed (method cache issue) [RT #60220,60232].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In the 5.10.0
release, a combination of &quot;use feature&quot; and
&quot;//ee&quot; could cause a memory leak [RT #63110].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-C&quot;
on the shebang (&quot;#!&quot;) line is once more permitted
if it is also specified on the command line. &quot;-C&quot;
on the shebang line used to be a silent no-op if it was not
also on <br>
the command line, so perl 5.10.0 disallowed it, which broke
some scripts. Now perl checks whether it is also on the
command line and only dies if it is not [RT #67880].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; In 5.10.0,
certain types of re-entrant regular expression could crash,
or cause the following assertion failure [RT #60508]:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Assertion rx-&gt;sublen &gt;= (s
- rx-&gt;subbeg) + i failed</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now
includes previously missing files from the Unicode Character
Database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Perl now honors
&quot;TMPDIR&quot; when opening an anonymous temporary
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Platform Specific Changes <br>
Perl is incredibly portable. In general, if a platform has a
C compiler, someone has ported Perl to it (or will soon).
We&rsquo;re happy to announce that Perl 5.12 includes
support <br>
for several new platforms. At the same time, it&rsquo;s time
to bid farewell to some (very) old friends.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">New Platforms <br>
Haiku <br>
Perl&rsquo;s developers have merged patches from
Haiku&rsquo;s maintainers. Perl should now build on
Haiku.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MirOS BSD <br>
Perl should now build on MirOS BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Discontinued Platforms <br>
Domain/OS <br>
MiNT <br>
Tenon MachTen</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Updated Platforms <br>
AIX <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Removed libbsd for AIX 5L and 6.1. Only
&quot;flock()&quot; was used from libbsd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Removed libgdbm
for AIX 5L and 6.1 if libgdbm &lt; 1.8.3-5 is installed. The
libgdbm is delivered as an optional package with the AIX
Toolbox. Unfortunately the versions <br>
below 1.8.3-5 are broken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Hints changes
mean that AIX 4.2 should work again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cygwin <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Perl now supports IPv6 on Cygwin 1.7 and
newer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; On Cygwin we now
strip the last number from the DLL. This has been the
behaviour in the cygwin.com build for years. The hints files
have been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Darwin (Mac OS X) <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Skip testing the be_BY.CP1131 locale on
Darwin 10 (Mac OS X 10.6), as it&rsquo;s still buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Correct
infelicities in the regexp used to identify buggy locales on
Darwin 8 and 9 (Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DragonFly BSD <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Fix thread library selection [perl
#69686]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FreeBSD <br>
&Acirc;&middot; The hints files now identify the correct
threading libraries on FreeBSD 7 and later.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Irix <br>
&Acirc;&middot; We now work around a bizarre preprocessor
bug in the Irix 6.5 compiler: &quot;cc -E -&quot;
unfortunately goes into K&amp;R mode, but &quot;cc -E
file.c&quot; doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NetBSD <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Hints now supports versions 5.*.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OpenVMS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; &quot;-UDEBUGGING&quot; is now the default
on VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like it has been everywhere else
for ages and ages. Also make command-line selection of
-UDEBUGGING and -DDEBUGGING work in configure.com; before
the only way to turn it <br>
off was by saying no in answer to the interactive
question.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The default pipe
buffer size on VMS has been updated to 8192 on 64-bit
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Reads from the
in-memory temporary files of &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; used
to fail if $/ was set to a numeric reference (to indicate
record-style reads). This is now fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; VMS now supports
&quot;getgrgid&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Many
improvements and cleanups have been made to the VMS file
name handling and conversion code.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Enabling the
&quot;PERL_VMS_POSIX_EXIT&quot; logical name now encodes a
POSIX exit status in a VMS condition value for better
interaction with GNV&rsquo;s bash shell and other utilities
<br>
that depend on POSIX exit values. See &quot;$?&quot; in
perlvms for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;File::Copy&quot; now detects Unix compatibility mode
on VMS.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stratus VOS <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Various changes from Stratus have been
merged in.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Symbian <br>
&Acirc;&middot; There is now support for Symbian S60 3.2 SDK
and S60 5.0 SDK.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Windows <br>
&Acirc;&middot; Perl 5.12 supports Windows 2000 and later.
The supporting code for legacy versions of Windows is still
included, but will be removed during the next development
cycle.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Initial support
for building Perl with MinGW-w64 is now available.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; perl.exe now
includes a manifest resource to specify the
&quot;trustInfo&quot; settings for Windows Vista and later.
Without this setting Windows would treat perl.exe as a
legacy <br>
application and apply various heuristics like redirecting
access to protected file system areas (like the
&quot;Program Files&quot; folder) to the users
&quot;VirtualStore&quot; instead of <br>
generating a proper &quot;permission denied&quot; error.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The manifest resource also
requests the Microsoft Common-Controls version 6.0 (themed
controls introduced in Windows XP). Check out the
Win32::VisualStyles module on <br>
CPAN to switch back to old style unthemed controls for
legacy applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;-t&quot; filetest operator now only returns true if
the filehandle is connected to a console window. In previous
versions of Perl it would return true for all character <br>
mode devices, including NUL and LPT1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The
&quot;-p&quot; filetest operator now works correctly, and
the Fcntl::S_IFIFO constant is defined when Perl is compiled
with Microsoft Visual C. In previous Perl versions
&quot;-p&quot; <br>
always returned a false value, and the Fcntl::S_IFIFO
constant was not defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This bug is specific to
Microsoft Visual C and never affected Perl binaries built
with MinGW.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; The socket error
codes are now more widely supported: The POSIX module will
define the symbolic names, like POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK, and
stringification of socket error codes <br>
in $! works as well now;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">C:&gt;perl -MPOSIX -E
&quot;$!=POSIX::EWOULDBLOCK; say $!&quot; <br>
A non-blocking socket operation could not be completed
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; flock() will now
set sensible error codes in $!. Previous Perl versions
copied the value of $^E into $!, which caused much
confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; select() now
supports all empty &quot;fd_set&quot;s more correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; &rsquo;.o&rsquo;
and &rsquo;..o&rsquo; were treated differently than
&rsquo;./foo&rsquo; and &rsquo;../foo&rsquo; by
&quot;do&quot; and &quot;require&quot; [RT #63492].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Improved message
window handling means that &quot;alarm&quot; and
&quot;kill&quot; messages will no longer be dropped under
race conditions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Various bits of
Perl&rsquo;s build infrastructure are no longer converted to
win32 line endings at release time. If this hurts you,
please report the problem with the perlbug <br>
program included with perl.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Known Problems <br>
This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are
regressions from either 5.10.x or 5.8.x.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some CPANPLUS
tests may fail if there is a functioning file
../../cpanp-run-perl outside your build directory. The
failure shouldn&rsquo;t imply there&rsquo;s a problem with
the actual <br>
functional software. The bug is already fixed in [RT #74188]
and is scheduled for inclusion in perl-v5.12.1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
&quot;List::Util::first&quot; misbehaves in the presence of
a lexical $_ (typically introduced by &quot;my $_&quot; or
implicitly by &quot;given&quot;). The variable which gets
set for each iteration is <br>
the package variable $_, not the lexical $_ [RT #67694].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A similar issue may occur in
other modules that provide functions which take a block as
their first argument, like</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">foo { ... $_ ...} list</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Some regexes may
run much more slowly when run in a child thread compared
with the thread the pattern was compiled into [RT
#55600].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Things like
&quot;&quot;ATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF}&quot; =~ /ATIN SMALL
LETTER F}+/&quot; will appear to hang as they get into a
very long running loop [RT #72998].</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Several porters
have reported mysterious crashes when Perl&rsquo;s entire
test suite is run after a build on certain Windows 2000
systems. When run by hand, the individual tests <br>
reportedly work fine.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Errata <br>
&Acirc;&middot; This one is actually a change introduced in
5.10.0, but it was missed from that release&rsquo;s
perldelta, so it is mentioned here instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A bugfix related to the handling
of the &quot;/m&quot; modifier and &quot;qr&quot; resulted
in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># matches in 5.8.x,
doesn&rsquo;t match in 5.10.0 <br>
$re = qr/^bar/; &quot;foo0ar&quot; =~ /$re/m;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Acknowledgements <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is woefully incomplete as
it&rsquo;s automatically generated from version control
history. In particular, it doesn&rsquo;t include the names

special thanks for their brilliant and substantive ongoing
contributions. Nicholas personally authored <br>
over 30% of the patches since 5.10.0. Rafael comes in second
