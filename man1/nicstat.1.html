Manual nicstat(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
nicstat, enicstat - print network traffic statistics</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
nicstat [-hvnsxpztualkMU] [-iinterface] [-Sint:mbps[fd|hd]]
[interval [count]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">enicstat &lt;same options &amp;
operands&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
nicstat prints out network statistics for all network cards
(NICs), including packets, kilobytes per second, average
packet sizes and more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-h Display brief usage information (help).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v Display nicstat version (and
additional fields when combined with &rsquo;-l&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n Show statistics for non-local
(i.e. non-loopback) interfaces only.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Display summary output - just
the amount of data received (read) and transmitted
(written).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Display extended output. See
OUTPUT section for details.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-U Display separate read and
write utilization statistics. This affects the default,
extended (-x) and all (-a) format outputs. For the default
format the &quot;Sat&quot; statistic <br>
is dropped to fit the output in 80 columns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-M Display interface throughput
statistics in Mbps (megabits per second), instead of the
default KB/s (kilobytes per second).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE - interface statistics are
reported to operating systems in bytes. nicstat does not
know if Ethernet or other hardware overheads are included in
the statistic on <br>
each platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Display output in parseable
format. This outputs one line per interface, in the
following formats (which correspond to the default, -x, -t
and -u options; respec&acirc; <br>
tively):</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">time:In:rKB/s:wKB/s:rPk/s:wPk/s:%Util:Sat
<br>

time:In:rKB/s:wKB/s:rPk/s:wPk/s:%Util:Sat:IErr:OErr:Coll:NoCP:Defer
time:TCP:InKB:OutKB:InSeg:OutSeg:Reset:AttF:%ReTX:InConn:OutCon:Drops
time:UDP:InDG:OutDG:InErr:OutErr</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where time is the number of
seconds since midnight, Jan 1 1970 (UST) and the other
fields are as described in the OUTPUT section below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTE - throughput statistics are
always in KB/s (kilbytes per second) for parseable formats,
even if the &quot;-M&quot; flag has been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Skip interfaces for which
there was zero traffic for the sample period.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Show TCP statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Show UDP statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Equvalent to &rsquo;-x -t
-u&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l Just list interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-iinterface[,interface...] <br>
Show statistics for only the interface(s) listed. Multiple
interfaces can be listed, separated by commas (,).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Sint:speed[fd|hd] <br>
(Linux only). Specify the speed (and optionally duplex mode)
of one or more interfaces. The given speed(s) are in
megabits/second. The duplex mode will default to <br>
&quot;full&quot; unless a suffix beginning with
&quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot; is specified. Speed and
duplex mode are obtained automatically on Solaris using the
&quot;ifspeed&quot; and &quot;link_duplex&quot; kstat <br>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k (Solaris only). Search for
active network interfaces by looking for kstat
&quot;link_state&quot; statistics with a value of 1. This is
only of value on systems running Solaris <br>
10 (or early releases of Solaris 11 Express), with Exclusive
IP Zones, where the interfaces given to an Exclusive IP Zone
are not otherwise visible. If you are running <br>
Solaris 9 (or earlier), or Solaris 11 (or later) you do not
need this option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPERANDS <br>
interval Specifies the number of seconds between
samples.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">count Specifies the number of
times that the statistics are repeated. If no count is
specified, nicstat will repeat statistics indefinitely.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OUTPUT <br>
The fields of nicstat&rsquo;s display are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Time The time corresponding to
the end of the sample shown, in HH:MM:SS format (24-hour
clock).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Int The interface name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rKB/s, InKB <br>
Kilobytes/second read (received).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wKB/s, OutKB <br>
Kilobytes/second written (transmitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rMbps, RdMbps <br>
Megabits/second read (received).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wMbps, WrMbps <br>
Megabits/second written (transmitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rPk/s, InSeg, InDG <br>
Packets (TCP Segments, UDP Datagrams)/second read
(received).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wPk/s, OutSeg, OutDG <br>
Packets (TCP Segments, UDP Datagrams)/second written
(transmitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">rAvs Average size of packets
read (received).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">wAvs Average size of packets
written (transmitted).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%Util Percentage utilization of
the interface. For full-duplex interfaces, this is the
greater of rKB/s or wKB/s as a percentage of the interface
speed. For half-duplex <br>
interfaces, rKB/s and wKB/s are summed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%rUtil, %wUtil <br>
Percentage utilization for bytes read and written,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sat Saturation. This the number
of errors/second seen for the interface - an indicator the
interface may be approaching saturation. This statistic is
combined from a num&acirc; <br>
ber of kernel statistics. It is recommended to use the
&rsquo;-x&rsquo; option to see more individual statistics
(those mentioned below) when attempting to diagnose a
network <br>
issue.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IErr Packets received that could
not be processed because they contained errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OErr Packets that were not
successfully transmitted because of errors</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Coll Ethernet collisions during
transmit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NoCP No-can-puts. This is when
an incoming packet can not be put to the process reading the
socket. This suggests the local process is unable to process
incoming packets <br>
in a timely manner.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defer Defer Transmits. Packets
without collisions where first transmit attempt was delayed
because the medium was busy.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Reset tcpEstabResets. The number
of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to
the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or the
CLOSE-WAIT state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">AttF tcpAttemptFails - The
number of times that TCP connections have made a direct
transition to the CLOSED state from either the SYN-SENT
state or the SYN-RCVD state, plus <br>
the number of times TCP connections have made a direct
transition to the LISTEN state from the SYN-RCVD state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%ReTX Percentage of TCP segments
retransmitted - that is, the number of TCP segments
transmitted containing one or more previously transmitted
octets.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">InConn tcpPassiveOpens - The
number of times that TCP connections have made a direct
transition to the SYN-RCVD state from the LISTEN state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OutCon tcpActiveOpens - The
number of times that TCP connections have made a direct
transition to the SYN-SENT state from the CLOSED state.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Drops tcpHalfOpenDrop +
tcpListenDrop + tcpListenDropQ0.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tcpListenDrop and
tcpListenDropQ0 - Number of connections dropped from the
completed connection queue and incomplete connection queue,
respectively. tcpHalfOpenDrops - Number of <br>
connections dropped after the initial SYN packet was
received.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The first set of statistics
printed are averages since system boot. If no interval
operand is specified, or a count value of &quot;1&quot; is
specified, this will be the only sample <br>
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
Print average statistics from boot time to now only:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ nicstat</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print statistics for all
interfaces, every 3 seconds:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ nicstat 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print statistics for all
interfaces, every 5 seconds, finishing after 10 samples:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ nicstat 5 10</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print statistics every 3
seconds, only for interfaces &quot;hme0&quot; and
&quot;hme1&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ nicstat -i hme0,hme1 3</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print statistics for non-local
interfaces, setting speed of &quot;eth0&quot; and
&quot;eth1&quot; to 10mbps/half-duplex and
1000mbps/full-duplex, respectively:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ nicstat -n -S
eth0:10h,eth1:1000 5</p>

Linux Network Monitoring Tool You Did Not Know You
Needed&quot;
-http://blogs.oracle.com/timc/entry/nicstat_the_solaris_and_linux</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOTES <br>
On Linux, the NoCP, Defer, TCP InKB, and TCP OutKB
statistics are always reported as zero.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The way that saturation is
reported is a best effort, as there is no standardized
naming to capture all errors related to an interface&rsquo;s
inability to receive or transmit a <br>
packet. Monitoring %Util and packet rates, along with an
understanding of the specific NICs may be more useful in
judging whether you are nearing saturation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -S option is provided for
the Linux edition as nicstat requires super-user privilege
to obtain speed and duplex mode information for interfaces.
If you are unable to set up <br>
nicstat as setuid-root, a script named enicstat is
available, which uses the ethtool utility then calls nicstat
with an -S value. ethtool itself requires super-user
privilege <br>
for this to work.</p>
