<b>tknewsbiff</b> pops up a window when there is unread news in your favorite
  newsgroups and removes the window after you've read the news. tknewsbiff can
  optionally play a sound, start your newsreader, etc.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SELECTING_NEWSGROUPS"><a class="selflink" href="#SELECTING_NEWSGROUPS">SELECTING
  NEWSGROUPS</a></h1>
By default, the configuration file ~/.tknewsbiff describes how tknewsbiff
  behaves. The syntax observes the usual Tcl rules - however, even if you don't
  know Tcl, all but the most esoteric configurations will be obvious.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Each newsgroup (or set of newsgroups) to be watched is described by using the
  &quot;watch&quot; command. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch dc.dining
watch nist.*
watch comp.unix.wizard  -threshold 3
watch *.sources.*       -threshold 20
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For each newsgroup pattern, any newsgroup that matches it and which you are
  subscribed to (according to your newsrc file) is eligible for reporting. By
  default, tknewsbiff reports on the newsgroup if there is at least one unread
  article. The &quot;-threshold&quot; flag changes the threshold to the
  following number. For example, &quot;-threshold 3&quot; means there must be at
  least three articles unread before tknewsbiff will report the newsgroup.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no watch commands are given (or no configuration file exists), all groups
  which are subscribed to are watched.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To suppress newsgroups that would otherwise be reported, use the
  &quot;ignore&quot; command. For example, the following matches all comp.* and
  nist.* newgroups except for nist.posix or .d (discussion) groups:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch comp.*
watch nist.*
ignore nist.posix.*
ignore *.d
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The flag &quot;-new&quot; describes a command to be executed when the newsgroup
  is first reported as having unread news. For example, the following lines
  invoke the UNIX command &quot;play&quot; to play a sound.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch dc.dining -new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/yumyum.au&quot;
watch rec.auto* -new &quot;exec play /usr/local/sounds/vroom.au&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can cut down on the verbosity of actions by defining procedures. For
  example, if you have many -new flags that all play sound files, you could
  define a sound procedure. This would allow the -new specification to be much
  shorter.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
proc play {sound} {
	exec play /usr/local/sounds/$sound.au
}
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch dc.dining -new &quot;play yumyum&quot;
watch rec.auto* -new &quot;play vroom&quot;
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As an aside, you can put an &quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of an &quot;exec&quot;
  command to get commands to execute asynchronously. However, it's probably not
  a good idea to do this when playing sound files anyway.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
&quot;newsgroup&quot; is a read-only variable which contains the name of the
  newsgroup that is being reported. This is useful when the action is triggered
  by a pattern. For example, the following line could run the newsgroup name
  through a speech synthesizer:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch * -new {
	exec play herald.au
	exec speak &quot;New news has arrived in $newsgroup.&quot;
}
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The flag &quot;-display&quot; describes a command to be executed every time the
  newsgroup is reported as having unread news. The special command
  &quot;display&quot; is the default command. It schedules $newsgroup to be
  written to tknewsbiff's display when it is rewritten. For example, by
  explicitly providing a -display flag that omits the display command, you can
  disable the display of newsgroups that are already reported via -new.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch dc.dining -new {exec play yumyum.au} -display {}
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want to execute an action repeatedly and <i>still</i> display the
  newsgroup in the default manner, explicitly invoke the display command via the
  -display flag. For example:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
watch *security* -display {
	exec play red-alert.au
	display
}
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Actions associated with the -new and -display flags are executed only once for
  each matching newsgroup. The command executed is the one associated with the
  first pattern in the configuration file that matches and observes the given
  threshold.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any command that is simply listed in the configuration file is executed each
  time before the update loop in tknewsbiff. The reserved (but user-defined)
  procedure &quot;user&quot; is run immediately after the newsgroups are
  scheduled to be written to the display and before they are actually written.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
For example, suppose unread articles appear in several rec.auto groups and you
  play the same sound for each one. To prevent playing the sound several times
  in a row, make the -new command simply set a flag. In the user procedure, play
  the sound if the flag is set (and then reset the flag).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The user procedure could also be used to start a newsreader. This would avoid
  the possibility of starting multiple newsreaders just because multiple
  newsgroups contained unread articles. (A check should, of course, be made to
  make sure that a newsreader is not already running.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="MORE_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#MORE_VARIABLES">MORE
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
The following example lines show variables that can affect the behavior of
  tknewsbiff
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
set delay          120
set server         news.nist.gov
set server_timeout 60
set newsrc         ~/.newsrc
set width          40
set height         20
set active_file    /usr/news/lib/active
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
tknewsbiff alternates between checking for unread news and sleeping (kind of
  like many undergraduates). The &quot;delay&quot; variable describes how many
  seconds to sleep.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;server&quot; variable names an NNTP news-server. The default is
  &quot;news&quot;. The &quot;server&quot; variable is only used if the
  &quot;active_file&quot; variable is not set.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;server_timeout&quot; variable describes how how many seconds to wait
  for a response from the server before giving up. -1 means wait forever or
  until the server itself times out. The default is 60 seconds.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;newsrc&quot; variable describes the name of your .newsrc file. By
  default, tknewsbiff looks in your home directory for a newsrc file. A
  server-specific newsrc is used if found. For example, if you have set server
  to &quot;cubit.nist.gov&quot;, then tknewsbiff looks for
  ~/.newsrc-cubit.nist.gov. (This is the Emacs gnus convention - which is very
  convenient when you read news from multiple servers.) If there is no
  server-specific newsrc, tknewsbiff uses ~/.newsrc.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;width&quot; variable describes the width that tknewsbiff will use to
  display information. If any newsgroup names are long enough, they will be
  truncated so that the article counts can still be shown. You can manually
  resize the window to see what was truncated. However, if your configuration
  file sets the width variable, the window will be restored to that size the
  next time that tknewsbiff checks for unread news and updates its display.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;height&quot; variable describes the maximum height that tknewsbiff
  will use to display information. If fewer newsgroups are reported, tknewsbiff
  will shrink the window appropriately. You can manually resize the window but
  if your configuration file sets the height variable, the window will be
  restored to that size the next time that tknewsbiff checks for unread news and
  updates its display.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The &quot;active_file&quot; variable describes the name of the news active file.
  If set, the active file is read directly in preference to using NNTP (even if
  the &quot;server&quot; variable is set). This is particularly useful for
  testing out new configuration files since you can edit a fake active file and
  then click button 2 to immediately see how tknewsbiff responds (see BUTTONS
  below).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the environment variable DOTDIR is set, then its value is used as a directory
  in which to find all dotfiles instead of from the home directory. In
  particular, this affects the tknewsbiff configuration file and the .newsrc
  file (assuming the newsrc variable is not set explicitly).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WATCHING_DIFFERENT_NEWS_SERVERS"><a class="selflink" href="#WATCHING_DIFFERENT_NEWS_SERVERS">WATCHING
  DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS</a></h1>
To watch multiple servers, run tknewsbiff multiple times. (Since you need
  different .newsrc files and the servers have different newsgroups and article
  numbers anyway, there is no point in trying to do this in a single process.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can point tknewsbiff at a different server with an appropriate argument. The
  argument is tried both as a configuration file name and as a suffix to the
  string &quot;~/.tknewsbiff-&quot;. So if you want to watch the server
  &quot;kidney&quot;, store the tknewsbiff configuration information in
  ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney&quot;. The following two commands will both use that
  configuration file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	tknewsbiff kidney
	tknewsbiff ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
In both cases, the actual server to contact is set by the value of the server
  variable in the configuration file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If no configuration file is found, the argument is used as the server to
  contact. This allows tknewsbiff to be run with no preparation whatsoever.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If the argument is the special keyword &quot;active&quot; (or ends in
  &quot;/active&quot;), it is used as the name of an active file. This is in
  turn used to initialize the variable &quot;active_file&quot; so that
  tknewsbiff reads from the active file directly rather than using NNTP.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Creating your own active file is a convenient way of testing your configuration
  file. For example, after running the following command, you can repeatedly
  edit your active file and trigger the update-now command (either by pressing
  button 2 or setting the delay variable very low) to see how tknewsbiff
  responds.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The active file must follow the format of a real active file. The format is one
  newsgroup per line. After the newsgroup name is the number of the highest
  article, the lowest article. Lastly is the letter y or m. m means the
  newsgroup is moderated. y means posting is allowed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="WINDOW"><a class="selflink" href="#WINDOW">WINDOW</a></h1>
When unread news is found, a window is popped up. The window lists the names of
  the newsgroups and the number of unread articles in each (unless suppressed by
  the -display flag). When there is no longer any unread news, the window
  disappears (although the process continues to run).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="BUTTONS"><a class="selflink" href="#BUTTONS">BUTTONS</a></h1>
Button or key bindings may be assigned by bind commands. Feel free to change
  them. The default bind commands are:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
bind .list &lt;1&gt; help
bind .list &lt;2&gt; update-now
bind .list &lt;3&gt; unmapwindow
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default button 1 (left) is bound to &quot;help&quot;. The help command causes
  tknewsbiff to pop up a help window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, button 2 (middle) is bound to &quot;update-now&quot;. The update-now
  command causes tknewsbiff to immediately check for unread news. If your news
  server is slow or maintains a very large number of newsgroups, or you have a
  large number of patterns in your configuration file, tknewsbiff can take
  considerable time before actually updating the window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
By default, button 3 (right) is bound to &quot;unmapwindow&quot;. The
  unmapwindow command causes tknewsbiff to remove the window from the display
  until the next time it finds unread news. (The mapwindow command causes
  tknewsbiff to restore the window.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
As an example, here is a binding to pop up an xterm and run rn when you hold
  down the shift key and press button 1 in the listing window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
	exec xterm -e rn &amp;
}
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Here is a similar binding. However it tells rn to look only at the newsgroup
  that is under the mouse when you pressed it. (The &quot;display_list&quot;
  variable is described later in this man page.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
	exec xterm -e rn [lindex $display_list [.list nearest %y]] &amp;
}
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="OTHER_COMMANDS_AND_VARIABLES"><a class="selflink" href="#OTHER_COMMANDS_AND_VARIABLES">OTHER
  COMMANDS AND VARIABLES</a></h1>
Built-in commands already mentioned are: watch, ignore, display, help,
  update-now, unmapwindow, and mapwindow.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any Tcl and Tk command can also be given. In particular, the list of newsgroups
  is stored in the list widget &quot;.list&quot;, and the scroll bar is stored
  in the scrollbar widget &quot;.scroll&quot;. So for example, if you want to
  change the foreground and background colors of the newsgroup list, you can
  say:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
	.list config -bg honeydew1 -fg orchid2
<div class="Pp"></div>
</pre>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
These can also be controlled by the X resource database as well. However, the
  configuration file allows arbitrarily complex commands to be evaluated rather
  than simple assignments.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Certain Tcl/Tk commands can disrupt proper function of tknewsbiff. These will
  probably be obvious to anyone who knows enough to give these commands in the
  first place. As a simple example, the program assumes the font in the list box
  is of fixed width. The newsgroups will likely not align if you use a
  variable-width font.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following variables are accessible and can be used for esoteric uses. All
  other variables are private. Private variables and commands begin with
  &quot;_&quot; so you don't need to worry about accidental collisions.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The array &quot;db&quot; is a database which maintains information about read
  and unread news. db($newsgroup,hi) is the highest article that exists.
  db($newsgroup,seen) is the highest article that you have read.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
A number of lists maintain interesting information. &quot;active_list&quot; is a
  list of known newsgroups. &quot;seen_list&quot; is a list of newsgroups that
  have been seen so far as the -new and -display flags are being processed.
  &quot;previous_seen_list&quot; is &quot;seen_list&quot; from the previous
  cycle. &quot;ignore_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup patterns to ignore.
  &quot;watch_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup patterns to watch.
  &quot;display_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup will be displayed at the
  next opportunity.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UPDATING_YOUR_FILES"><a class="selflink" href="#UPDATING_YOUR_FILES">UPDATING
  YOUR FILES</a></h1>
tknewsbiff automatically rereads your configuration file each time it wakes up
  to check for unread news. To force tknewsbiff to reread the file immediately
  (such as if you are testing a new configuration or have just modified your
  newsrc file), press button 2 in the display (see BUTTONS above).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="selflink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
tknewsbiff defines the number of unread articles as the highest existing article
  minus the highest article that you've read. So if you've read the last article
  in the newsgroup but no others, tknewsbiff thinks there are no unread
  articles. (It's impossible to do any better by reading the active file and it
  would be very time consuming to do this more accurately via NNTP since servers
  provide no efficient way of reporting their own holes in the newsgroups.)
  Fortunately, this definition is considered a feature by most people. It allows
  you to read articles and then mark them &quot;unread&quot; but not have
  tknewsbiff continue telling you that they are unread.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="UNWARRANTED_CONCERNS"><a class="selflink" href="#UNWARRANTED_CONCERNS">UNWARRANTED
  CONCERNS</a></h1>
Your news administrator may wonder if many people using tknewsbiff severely
  impact an NNTP server. In fact, the impact is negligible even when the delay
  is very low. To gather all the information it needs, tknewsbiff uses a single
  NNTP query - it just asks for the active file. The NNTP server does no
  computation, formatting, etc, it just sends the file. All the interesting
  processing happens locally in the tknewsbiff program itself.
