<p>TKNEWSBIFF(1) General Commands Manual TKNEWSBIFF(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
tknewsbiff - pop up a window when news appears</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
tknewsbiff [ server or config-file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTRODUCTION <br>
tknewsbiff pops up a window when there is unread news in
your favorite newsgroups and removes the window after
you&rsquo;ve read the news. tknewsbiff can optionally play a
sound, <br>
start your newsreader, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SELECTING NEWSGROUPS <br>
By default, the configuration file ~/.tknewsbiff describes
how tknewsbiff behaves. The syntax observes the usual Tcl
rules - however, even if you don&rsquo;t know Tcl, all but
the <br>
most esoteric configurations will be obvious.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each newsgroup (or set of
newsgroups) to be watched is described by using the
&quot;watch&quot; command. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining <br>
watch nist.* <br>
watch comp.unix.wizard -threshold 3 <br>
watch *.sources.* -threshold 20</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each newsgroup pattern, any
newsgroup that matches it and which you are subscribed to
(according to your newsrc file) is eligible for reporting.
By default, tknewsbiff <br>
reports on the newsgroup if there is at least one unread
article. The &quot;-threshold&quot; flag changes the
threshold to the following number. For example,
&quot;-threshold 3&quot; means there <br>
must be at least three articles unread before tknewsbiff
will report the newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no watch commands are given
(or no configuration file exists), all groups which are
subscribed to are watched.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To suppress newsgroups that
would otherwise be reported, use the &quot;ignore&quot;
command. For example, the following matches all comp.* and
nist.* newgroups except for nist.posix or .d <br>
(discussion) groups:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch comp.* <br>
watch nist.* <br>
ignore nist.posix.* <br>
ignore *.d</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag &quot;-new&quot;
describes a command to be executed when the newsgroup is
first reported as having unread news. For example, the
following lines invoke the UNIX command &quot;play&quot; to
<br>
play a sound.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining -new &quot;exec
play /usr/local/sounds/yumyum.au&quot; <br>
watch rec.auto* -new &quot;exec play
/usr/local/sounds/vroom.au&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can cut down on the
verbosity of actions by defining procedures. For example, if
you have many -new flags that all play sound files, you
could define a sound procedure. <br>
This would allow the -new specification to be much
shorter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">proc play {sound} { <br>
exec play /usr/local/sounds/$sound.au <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining -new &quot;play
yumyum&quot; <br>
watch rec.auto* -new &quot;play vroom&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an aside, you can put an
&quot;&amp;&quot; at the end of an &quot;exec&quot; command
to get commands to execute asynchronously. However,
it&rsquo;s probably not a good idea to do this when playing
sound <br>
files anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&quot;newsgroup&quot; is a
read-only variable which contains the name of the newsgroup
that is being reported. This is useful when the action is
triggered by a pattern. For example, the <br>
following line could run the newsgroup name through a speech
synthesizer:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch * -new { <br>
exec play herald.au <br>
exec speak &quot;New news has arrived in $newsgroup.&quot;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The flag &quot;-display&quot;
describes a command to be executed every time the newsgroup
is reported as having unread news. The special command
&quot;display&quot; is the default command. It <br>
schedules $newsgroup to be written to tknewsbiff&rsquo;s
display when it is rewritten. For example, by explicitly
providing a -display flag that omits the display command,
you can <br>
disable the display of newsgroups that are already reported
via -new.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch dc.dining -new {exec play
yumyum.au} -display {}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to execute an action
repeatedly and still display the newsgroup in the default
manner, explicitly invoke the display command via the
-display flag. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">watch *security* -display { <br>
exec play red-alert.au <br>
display <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Actions associated with the -new
and -display flags are executed only once for each matching
newsgroup. The command executed is the one associated with
the first pattern in the <br>
configuration file that matches and observes the given
threshold.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any command that is simply
listed in the configuration file is executed each time
before the update loop in tknewsbiff. The reserved (but
user-defined) procedure &quot;user&quot; is run <br>
immediately after the newsgroups are scheduled to be written
to the display and before they are actually written.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For example, suppose unread
articles appear in several rec.auto groups and you play the
same sound for each one. To prevent playing the sound
several times in a row, make the <br>
-new command simply set a flag. In the user procedure, play
the sound if the flag is set (and then reset the flag).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user procedure could also be
used to start a newsreader. This would avoid the possibility
of starting multiple newsreaders just because multiple
newsgroups contained unread <br>
articles. (A check should, of course, be made to make sure
that a newsreader is not already running.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MORE VARIABLES <br>
The following example lines show variables that can affect
the behavior of tknewsbiff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">set delay 120 <br>
set server news.nist.gov <br>
set server_timeout 60 <br>
set newsrc ~/.newsrc <br>
set width 40 <br>
set height 20 <br>
set active_file /usr/news/lib/active</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tknewsbiff alternates between
checking for unread news and sleeping (kind of like many
undergraduates). The &quot;delay&quot; variable describes
how many seconds to sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;server&quot; variable
names an NNTP news-server. The default is &quot;news&quot;.
The &quot;server&quot; variable is only used if the
&quot;active_file&quot; variable is not set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;server_timeout&quot;
variable describes how how many seconds to wait for a
response from the server before giving up. -1 means wait
forever or until the server itself times out. <br>
The default is 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;newsrc&quot; variable
describes the name of your .newsrc file. By default,
tknewsbiff looks in your home directory for a newsrc file. A
server-specific newsrc is used if found. <br>
For example, if you have set server to
&quot;cubit.nist.gov&quot;, then tknewsbiff looks for
~/.newsrc-cubit.nist.gov. (This is the Emacs gnus convention
- which is very convenient when <br>
you read news from multiple servers.) If there is no
server-specific newsrc, tknewsbiff uses ~/.newsrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;width&quot; variable
describes the width that tknewsbiff will use to display
information. If any newsgroup names are long enough, they
will be truncated so that the article <br>
counts can still be shown. You can manually resize the
window to see what was truncated. However, if your
configuration file sets the width variable, the window will
be <br>
restored to that size the next time that tknewsbiff checks
for unread news and updates its display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;height&quot; variable
describes the maximum height that tknewsbiff will use to
display information. If fewer newsgroups are reported,
tknewsbiff will shrink the window appropri&acirc; <br>
ately. You can manually resize the window but if your
configuration file sets the height variable, the window will
be restored to that size the next time that tknewsbiff
checks <br>
for unread news and updates its display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;active_file&quot;
variable describes the name of the news active file. If set,
the active file is read directly in preference to using NNTP
(even if the &quot;server&quot; variable is <br>
set). This is particularly useful for testing out new
configuration files since you can edit a fake active file
and then click button 2 to immediately see how tknewsbiff
<br>
responds (see BUTTONS below).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the environment variable
DOTDIR is set, then its value is used as a directory in
which to find all dotfiles instead of from the home
directory. In particular, this affects <br>
the tknewsbiff configuration file and the .newsrc file
(assuming the newsrc variable is not set explicitly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WATCHING DIFFERENT NEWS SERVERS
<br>
To watch multiple servers, run tknewsbiff multiple times.
(Since you need different .newsrc files and the servers have
different newsgroups and article numbers anyway, there is
<br>
no point in trying to do this in a single process.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can point tknewsbiff at a
different server with an appropriate argument. The argument
is tried both as a configuration file name and as a suffix
to the string &quot;~/.tknewsb&acirc; <br>
iff-&quot;. So if you want to watch the server
&quot;kidney&quot;, store the tknewsbiff configuration
information in ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney&quot;. The following two
commands will both use that con&acirc; <br>
figuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">tknewsbiff kidney <br>
tknewsbiff ~/.tknewsbiff-kidney</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both cases, the actual server
to contact is set by the value of the server variable in the
configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If no configuration file is
found, the argument is used as the server to contact. This
allows tknewsbiff to be run with no preparation
whatsoever.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the argument is the special
keyword &quot;active&quot; (or ends in &quot;/active&quot;),
it is used as the name of an active file. This is in turn
used to initialize the variable &quot;active_file&quot; <br>
so that tknewsbiff reads from the active file directly
rather than using NNTP.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Creating your own active file is
a convenient way of testing your configuration file. For
example, after running the following command, you can
repeatedly edit your active file <br>
and trigger the update-now command (either by pressing
button 2 or setting the delay variable very low) to see how
tknewsbiff responds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The active file must follow the
format of a real active file. The format is one newsgroup
per line. After the newsgroup name is the number of the
highest article, the lowest <br>
article. Lastly is the letter y or m. m means the newsgroup
is moderated. y means posting is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">WINDOW <br>
When unread news is found, a window is popped up. The window
lists the names of the newsgroups and the number of unread
articles in each (unless suppressed by the -display <br>
flag). When there is no longer any unread news, the window
disappears (although the process continues to run).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUTTONS <br>
Button or key bindings may be assigned by bind commands.
Feel free to change them. The default bind commands are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind .list &lt;1&gt; help <br>
bind .list &lt;2&gt; update-now <br>
bind .list &lt;3&gt; unmapwindow</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default button 1 (left) is
bound to &quot;help&quot;. The help command causes
tknewsbiff to pop up a help window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, button 2 (middle) is
bound to &quot;update-now&quot;. The update-now command
causes tknewsbiff to immediately check for unread news. If
your news server is slow or maintains <br>
a very large number of newsgroups, or you have a large
number of patterns in your configuration file, tknewsbiff
can take considerable time before actually updating the
window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">By default, button 3 (right) is
bound to &quot;unmapwindow&quot;. The unmapwindow command
causes tknewsbiff to remove the window from the display
until the next time it finds unread news. <br>
(The mapwindow command causes tknewsbiff to restore the
window.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">As an example, here is a binding
to pop up an xterm and run rn when you hold down the shift
key and press button 1 in the listing window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
<br>
exec xterm -e rn &amp; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Here is a similar binding.
However it tells rn to look only at the newsgroup that is
under the mouse when you pressed it. (The
&quot;display_list&quot; variable is described later in <br>
this man page.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">bind .list &lt;Shift-1&gt; {
<br>
exec xterm -e rn [lindex $display_list [.list nearest %y]]
&amp; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OTHER COMMANDS AND VARIABLES
<br>
Built-in commands already mentioned are: watch, ignore,
display, help, update-now, unmapwindow, and mapwindow.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any Tcl and Tk command can also
be given. In particular, the list of newsgroups is stored in
the list widget &quot;.list&quot;, and the scroll bar is
stored in the scrollbar widget <br>
&quot;.scroll&quot;. So for example, if you want to change
the foreground and background colors of the newsgroup list,
you can say:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">.list config -bg honeydew1 -fg
orchid2</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These can also be controlled by
the X resource database as well. However, the configuration
file allows arbitrarily complex commands to be evaluated
rather than simple assign&acirc; <br>
ments.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Certain Tcl/Tk commands can
disrupt proper function of tknewsbiff. These will probably
be obvious to anyone who knows enough to give these commands
in the first place. As a <br>
simple example, the program assumes the font in the list box
is of fixed width. The newsgroups will likely not align if
you use a variable-width font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following variables are
accessible and can be used for esoteric uses. All other
variables are private. Private variables and commands begin
with &quot;_&quot; so you don&rsquo;t need to <br>
worry about accidental collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The array &quot;db&quot; is a
database which maintains information about read and unread
news. db($newsgroup,hi) is the highest article that exists.
db($newsgroup,seen) is the highest <br>
article that you have read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A number of lists maintain
interesting information. &quot;active_list&quot; is a list
of known newsgroups. &quot;seen_list&quot; is a list of
newsgroups that have been seen so far as the -new and <br>
-display flags are being processed.
&quot;previous_seen_list&quot; is &quot;seen_list&quot; from
the previous cycle. &quot;ignore_list&quot; is the list of
newsgroup patterns to ignore. &quot;watch_list&quot; is the
<br>
list of newsgroup patterns to watch.
&quot;display_list&quot; is the list of newsgroup will be
displayed at the next opportunity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UPDATING YOUR FILES <br>
tknewsbiff automatically rereads your configuration file
each time it wakes up to check for unread news. To force
tknewsbiff to reread the file immediately (such as if you
are <br>
testing a new configuration or have just modified your
newsrc file), press button 2 in the display (see BUTTONS
above).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CAVEATS <br>
tknewsbiff defines the number of unread articles as the
highest existing article minus the highest article that
you&rsquo;ve read. So if you&rsquo;ve read the last article
in the newsgroup <br>
but no others, tknewsbiff thinks there are no unread
articles. (It&rsquo;s impossible to do any better by reading
the active file and it would be very time consuming to do
this more <br>
accurately via NNTP since servers provide no efficient way
of reporting their own holes in the newsgroups.)
Fortunately, this definition is considered a feature by most
people. <br>
It allows you to read articles and then mark them
&quot;unread&quot; but not have tknewsbiff continue telling
you that they are unread.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">UNWARRANTED CONCERNS <br>
Your news administrator may wonder if many people using
tknewsbiff severely impact an NNTP server. In fact, the
impact is negligible even when the delay is very low. To
gather <br>
all the information it needs, tknewsbiff uses a single NNTP
query - it just asks for the active file. The NNTP server
does no computation, formatting, etc, it just sends the <br>
file. All the interesting processing happens locally in the
tknewsbiff program itself.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
The man page is longer than the program.</p>
