<p>mkbitmap(1) General Commands Manual mkbitmap(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mkbitmap - transform images into bitmaps with scaling and
filtering</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mkbitmap [options] [filename...]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mkbitmap reads an image, and applies one or more of the
following operations to it, in this order: inversion,
highpass filtering, scaling, and thresholding. Each
operation can be <br>
individually controlled and turned on or off.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The principal use of mkbitmap is
to convert color or greyscale images into a format suitable
as input for other programs, particularly the tracing
program potrace(1). It is par&acirc; <br>
ticularly useful for converting scanned line art, such as
cartoons, handwritten text, etc., to high-resolution bilevel
images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Highpass filtering can be used
to ensure that foreground features such as lines and text
are preserved, while at the same time compensating for
uneven background. Optional blur&acirc; <br>
ring can be applied to smooth out the image and remove
visual noise. Scaling is important because a scanned
greyscale image contains more visual detail than a bilevel
image at <br>
the same resolution. By scaling the image to a higher
resolution (using interpolation) before thresholding it,
some of this detail is preserved. Thresholding means
converting a <br>
greyscale image to a bilevel image using only black and
white pixels. Pixels that are darker than a certain
threshold value are converted to black. Optional inversion
is useful <br>
if the input image shows bright features on dark background,
such as a picture of chalk drawings on a blackboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Supported input formats are PNM
(PBM, PGM, PPM) and BMP. The output formats are PBM for
bitmaps, and PGM for greymaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
General options: <br>
-h, --help print help message and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --version print version info
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --license print license info
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Input/output options: <br>
filename If filename arguments are given, then mkbitmap will
by default create one output file for each input filename
given. The name of the output file is obtained from <br>
the input filename by changing its suffix to
&quot;.pbm&quot; or &quot;.pgm&quot;. If the name of the
input file and output file would be identical, then an
additional suffix &quot;-out&quot; <br>
is appended to the output filename. If no filename arguments
are given, then mkbitmap acts as a filter, reading from
standard input and writing to standard output. <br>
A filename of &quot;-&quot; may be given to specify reading
from standard input; the output for this argument will then
be written to standard output. Each input file may <br>
contain one or more images.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o filename, --output filename
<br>
write output to this file. All output is concatenated and
directed to the specified file. This overrides the default
behavior of creating one output file for each <br>
input file. A filename of &quot;-&quot; may be given to
specify writing to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Image processing options: <br>
-x, --nodefaults <br>
Turn off default options. Normally, the following options
are preselected by default: -f 4 -s 2 -3 -t 0.45. The -x
option disables these defaults; thus, mkbitmap <br>
-x does nothing but copy a greyscale image from the input to
the output. Other processing options can then be added one
by one; e.g., mkbitmap -xf10 does only <br>
highpass filtering, mkbitmap -xt0.5 does only thresholding,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-i, --invert Invert the input
image. If this option is chosen, it is applied to the image
before any other operation. It is used to deal with
white-on-black images, such as <br>
photographs of chalk drawings on a blackboard. Note that the
behavior of this option is not in general the same as
inverting the output bitmap, unless the thresh&acirc; <br>
olding value is also inverted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f n, --filter n <br>
Apply a highpass filter to the image. This filter is
approximately Gaussian and non-directional. The effect is to
preserve small detail while compensating for <br>
background gradients. The parameter n is a radius (in
pixels) which corresponds approximately to the size of
details which should be preserved. More precisely, the <br>
filter is implemented by subtracting a blurred version of
the image from the original image. The parameter n is equal
to the standard deviation of the blur. The <br>
output of the filtering step is a normalized image whose
average brightness is exactly 0.5. The default filter radius
is 4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n, --nofilter Turn off highpass
filtering.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b n, --blur n Blur the image.
The effect is to smooth out fine details and to reduce
visual noise in the image. The parameter n is the blurring
radius, and should be chosen <br>
small (1 is a good value to start with). This is implemented
as an approximately Gaussian, non-directional blur with
standard deviation proportional to n. Blurring <br>
is applied after the highpass filter, but before scaling and
thresholding. If this option is not given, the default is
not to apply any blurring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s n, --scale n <br>
Scale the image by an integer factor n&gt;0. Scaling is done
after highpass filtering, but before the thresholding step.
A scaling factor of 1 indicates that no scal&acirc; <br>
ing is to be done. Otherwise, interpolation is used to fill
in the in-between pixels. If the output of mkbitmap is to be
used as input to a tracing program such as <br>
potrace, a scaling factor of 2 is recommended. This
preserved the right amount of detail for the tracing
algorithm to work well. If a scaling factor of 1 is used,
<br>
too much detail is lost. If a scaling factor of 3 or higher
is used, the interpolation tends to &quot;invent&quot;
detail which was not present in the original image, thus
<br>
preventing potrace from doing a good job.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-1, --linear Use linear
interpolation when scaling to a higher resolution. This is
slightly faster, but less nice, than the default cubic
interpolation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-3, --cubic Use cubic
interpolation when scaling to a higher resolution. This is
the default. It is slower than linear interpolation, but
leads to better results.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t n, --threshold n <br>
Set the threshold grey value for bilevel conversion. The
parameter n is a brightness value between 0 for black and 1
for white. Any pixels below this brightness <br>
will be converted to black (thus, smaller values of n will
lead to whiter output).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --grey Disable bilevel
conversion. If this option is given, processing stops after
the scaling step and a greymap is output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXIT STATUS <br>
The exit status is 0 on successful completion, 1 if the
command line was invalid, and 2 on any other error.</p>
