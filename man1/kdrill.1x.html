lookup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Yikes.. this man-page is getting
huge. But I am a great believer in having proper
documentation. Hopefully, this new format will help instead
of hinder.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At some future point in time, I
shall convert this huge beast to HTML. But that point is not
now. [Although actually, you CAN go to
http://www.bolthole.com/kdrill/ for <br>
some help ]</p>

make kdrill move to another kanji if you switch kana to
English or vica versa. <br>
[ default behaviour currently loses 300 kanji, with the
kanjidic file I have currently. All characters with
Frequency ratings have full translations. ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">RESOURCES <br>
Kdrill now saves config options in $HOME/.kdrill, in
X-resource format. The latest configuration will
automatically be saved when you quit kdrill normally. If you
want to <br>
change kdrill&rsquo;s settings, and you dont see a way to do
it in the options popup, you can probably change it in the
global &quot;KDrill&quot; resource file, or in your personal
<br>
&quot;$HOME/.kdrill&quot; file. See the sample
&quot;KDrill&quot; file for more detail, which is often
installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/KDrill, or someplace
similar. Values in $HOME/.kdrill <br>
will override the global settings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Colors <br>
You may change the background of the windows using a
resource file, as mentioned above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
kdrill is a program to drill users on meanings of kanji
characters. Various formats of drills are available:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kanji --&nbsp;/--- kanji <br>
kana --*-- kana <br>
english --/ &minus;- english</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYING <br>
kdrill will present you with a kanji (or kana or english
phrase) and five possible meanings for it. Your goal is to
guess which one matches the kanji at the top. Initially, it
<br>
will choose randomly from the entire dictionary, so you will
probably want to narrow the range, via the OPTIONS section,
below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Any grade level or frequency
rating the current kanji has will be displayed in the top
right hand side of the window, next to the &quot;G:&quot;
and &quot;F:&quot; letters. The kanji index number <br>
will be displayed after the &quot;#:&quot; sign.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Click with your primary mouse
button (usually the left one) on one of the multiple-choice
answered to see how well you know the lone kanji or meaning.
You may also use the num&acirc; <br>
ber keys to make your choice. [1,2,3,4,5]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you guess correctly, you will
move on to another character. If you guess incorrectly, you
will have to guess again. Furthermore, kdrill will make a
note that you didn&rsquo;t know <br>
either the character displayed, or the character for the
incorrect meaning you clicked on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you are playing in random
order, kdrill will randomly repeat the ones you have missed.
You will have to get a missed character right twice for
kdrill to think you know it. If <br>
you miss a character more than once, you will have to repeat
the character two times the number of times you missed it.
If you are playing in order, kdrill will keep to the <br>
order, and not go back. It will still remember ones you have
missed, however, and will go back to them if you later
switch to random order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two ways of
&quot;cheating&quot;, if you are learning new characters,
and don&rsquo;t want to have an incorrect guess recorded.
One way is to press the &quot;cheat&quot; button, and the
correct <br>
answer will be highlighted. The other way is to make a guess
with button 2 on your mouse. The character of the one you
clicked on will appear in the search window. If the search
<br>
window was not already open, it will appear when you do
this.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">PLAYING OPTIONS <br>
If you want to change the way the game works while playing,
you can bring up the options window by pressing the options
button. If you know how you want the game to play before
<br>
starting it, you can most likely do what you want with a
command-line option, described at the top of this man-page.
If you want to permanently change an option, see the <br>
&quot;RESOURCES&quot; header, above.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following options are to
help narrow down the range of kanji you get quizzed on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grades</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may specify which grade
levels you wish to study, by clicking on the buttons
labeled: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,
&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
or &quot;All&quot;, in the &quot;Grade Select&quot; window.
You <br>
may also select/unselect a grade by holding down shift,
followed by &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,
&quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;+&quot;,
or &quot;a&quot;, in the main window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The &quot;All&quot; feature will
select all grades. but it will not unselect them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The default is to have all the
grades enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Frequency</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some kanji have frequency
ratings. That means that, in real life, some kanji are used
more frequently than others. Frequency rating 1 means that
this is the most fre&acirc; <br>
quently used character. The frequency of the true answer you
are guessing will be displayed in the top right of the main
window, next to the &quot;F:&quot; sign, if a frequency <br>
rating exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The frequency range area in the
options window allows you to limit the kanji you see based
on their frequency rating. The frequency range area consists
of two smaller <br>
input areas; &quot;High&quot;, and &quot;Low&quot;. High
means a kanji that is high frequency. That is to say,
something that is used often. According to the definitions
of the dictionary, <br>
&quot;1&quot; means the kanji that is used the most often. A
frequency rating of &quot;2&quot; means that the character
has a lower frequency than &quot;1&quot;. The most
frequently used kanji is the <br>
character for &quot;day&quot;, which is &quot;F:
1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Setting a number in the
&quot;High&quot; window limits high frequency kanji. If
there is a number in the &quot;High&quot; window, that means
that you will see no kanji that is of higher fre&acirc; <br>
quency than that number. Similarly, setting a number in the
&quot;Low&quot; window means that you will see no kanji of
frequency lower than that number. 2000 is a &quot;Low&quot;
frequency <br>
kanji. If you put 2000 in the &quot;Low&quot; area, you
would see nothing of lower frequency than the character
rated at 2000 (which happens to be &quot;hazy&quot;) that
you would see nothing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A blank in the &quot;High&quot;
or &quot;Low&quot; fields indicates no limit in the field.
If you try to set either window to &quot;0&quot;, it will
automatically set itself blank for you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Order</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is possible to be drilled on
kanji in order, without repetition, until &quot;all&quot;
kanji have been covered. Any restrictions on grade level or
frequency will still apply. To <br>
enable or disable ordering, click on the &quot;Showing
randomly&quot; (or &quot;Showing in order&quot;) button in
the options window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note that &quot;in order&quot;
does not mean in order of frequency. It means in the order
represented by the dictionary, denoted by the
&rsquo;#&rsquo; number shown at top right. This happens <br>
to be the JIS-encoding of the Kanji, which we also call the
kanji index.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TIP: A good way to start
learning a range of chars, is to select the <br>
&quot;in order&quot; option, and a particular grade level
and/or frequency range. Press &rsquo;C&rsquo; (Shift-c) for
super-cheat. This will both highlight the correct answer,
AND show the <br>
full kanji+kana+english meanings in the popup search
window!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you have looked at it
enough, click on the correct answer to move on to the next
kanji.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Or rather than use the
super-cheat option repeatedly... Read the next section.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LEARNING NEW CHARS <br>
If you would like a small little window to memorize new
chars in, instead of the bulkier &rsquo;main&rsquo; or
&rsquo;search&rsquo; windows, there is now a
&rsquo;learn&rsquo; window. Pressing the (learn) button <br>
on the main window will bring up the learn window, which
only displays kanji, kana, and english meanings of a char.
Pressing one of the &rsquo;next&rsquo; buttons will select a
new char for <br>
you to look at, using the same rules of choosing that the
main window uses. (grade levels, and an optional
usefile)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">USEFILES <br>
A usefile is a way to tell kdrill &quot;I want to be quizzed
on these kanji, and ONLY these specific kanji&quot;.
Generally speaking, it is easier to just pick a particular
grade level or <br>
frequency range to quiz yourself on. But if you know you
want specific kanji (for example, to study for a class!)
having a usefile is very useful.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Grade and Frequency restrictions
will apply, even if you have a usefile. Thus, if all your
usefile-defined kanji are of grade 4 or higher, and you have
only selected grades 3 and <br>
lower, kdrill will complain that there are not enough kanji
available, and attempt to add viewable grade levels until
there are enough value kanji to quiz on</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To add or remove a kanji from
the &quot;usefile&quot;, pull up the search window, and view
a particular kanji. The &quot;usefile&quot; button at the
far right will be highlighted if it is in the <br>
usefile list. You can toggle the button to set the status as
you wish.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to see all the kanji
in your usefile, click on the &quot;show&quot; button, below
the &quot;usefile&quot; toggle, in the search window. It
will then show you the current list, and press&acirc; <br>
ing on one will display it in the search window. You can
then remove it via the &quot;usefile&quot; toggle if you
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When you quit kdrill, it will
update the usefile, IF you have a minimum number in the list
(currently, 10). If you want to know if you have enough, use
the options window to tog&acirc; <br>
gle &quot;No Usefile&quot; to &quot;Using Usefile&quot;. It
will not let you, if there are not enough characters in the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish kdrill to ignore
your usefile when you start it up, you may use the
-nousefile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Usefile format</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to edit a usefile by
hand, this is the format:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A usefile consists of a list of
hex numbers; one per line, no initial spaces allowed. A
usefile lets the program know you are interested in certain
kanji, from the thou&acirc; <br>
sands listed in the dictionary. It is possible to add
comment lines by having the very first character of a line
be &quot;#&quot;. However, those will be overwritten if you
make <br>
changes from within the program. Hex numbers can be checked
or found by using the &quot;xfd&quot; util on the
&quot;kanji24&quot; font. Alternatively, you could use the
search window or <br>
main kdrill window. In on of the &quot;#&quot; input boxes,
type in &quot;0x&quot;, and then the hex number. It is best
to do this in the search window, since the main window may
have range <br>
restrictions on it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SEARCH <br>
It is now possible to search for a character in kdrill. You
may search for an English phrase, a kana phrase, or a
particular kanji.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdrill will automatically show
the first match. If there is more than one match, it will be
shown in a secondary popup window. That window can be
changed to display the english, <br>
kanji, or kana meaning of each dictionary entry. Click on
one to have it displayed in the main search window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Additionally, if a search turns
up a kanji phrase instead of a single kanji, you may click
on the phrase at the top of the search window, to have the
secondary multi-listing win&acirc; <br>
dow display the individual kanji for you to examine in
further detail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">English search</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">First, bring up the search
window by pressing the search button. Then, enter an English
word (or fragment) in the bottom-most section of the window,
and press return or <br>
enter. The window will then display the first kanji it finds
that has that word in its definition, along with its index
number, grade, and other information available, if <br>
any.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kana search</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to search for a kana
phrase, you now have TWO options!</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For more experienced users, you
can finally type in that tempting kana window. There is no
little ^ cursor, but dont worry about that. DO worry about
the following con&acirc; <br>
ventions:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Type &quot;n &quot; (n,space) to
convert a ending &rsquo;n&rsquo; to kana <br>
Press &quot;&rsquo;&quot; for small-tsu. (type
&quot;chotto&quot; as &quot;cho&rsquo;to&quot;) <br>
Press &quot;-&quot; for kana elongation. (&quot;bi-ru&quot;)
<br>
Press backspace to erase the last char. <br>
Press return to start the search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For a pointy-clicky method of
input, press the &quot;kana search&quot; button. This will
pop up the kana seach window. (Press it again to remove the
window.) Press the kana(s) you <br>
want to search for. The chars you press will be shown next
to the &quot;kana search&quot; button in the main search
window. When you have the phrase ready, press the [Search]
box.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If your kana recognition
isn&rsquo;t all it should be, you can toggle romaji mode in
the options popup (via &quot;options&quot; from the main
window). Additionally, if you don&rsquo;t know <br>
katakana, but want to translate a katakana phrase, use the
&lt;=&gt; button to toggle between hiragana and katakana.
Note that even if you are in katakana input mode, it will
<br>
print out your buttonpresses as hiragana. This is because
the search engine treats hiragana and katakana
identically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you make a mistake, press the
&lt;- button, or backspace, to erase the last char.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The characters you press will
appear at the bottom of the popup, and also on the main
search window next to the kana search button. As noted
above, if you make a mistake <br>
typing, use the &lt;- button on the kana window to erase, or
the backspace key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KANJI SEARCH</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You now have a multiple ways to
look up Kanji.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">4-corner Kanji search</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you want to find a kanji by
shape, press the kanji search button on the search window.
This will bring up the kanji search window. Press it again
to remove the kanji <br>
search window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This window employes the
&quot;4-corner method&quot; of lookup. The 4-corner method
has lots of strange rules to it. I strongly recommend that
you read the description that comes <br>
in the kanjidic document file. It is impossible for me to
cover all details here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In brief, you have to press each
corner of the center box, and select one of the ten elements
from the top row, that best matches that corner of the kanji
you want to look <br>
up. For those already familiar with the 4-corner method, the
&quot;blank&quot; element is an alias for the first element.
There are still only 10 possible positions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Press the paragraph button
(backwards &rsquo;P&rsquo;) when you are ready to
search.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For those NOT already familiar
with the 4-corner method... unfortunately, it sounds easy,
but it is really horribly difficult, and I again refer you
to the documentation <br>
that comes with the kanjidic dictionary file. Look for
&quot;kanjidic.doc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SKIP Kanji search</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Pressing the &quot;Kanji SKIP
search&quot; button, will bring up the SKIP window. This
window has directions on it already. Follow the directions
to define what the kanji looks <br>
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Kanji cut-n-paste lookup</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For ELECTRONIC lookup... if you
view Japanese text online with a program like
&quot;kterm&quot;, you can now select a single kanji in
kterm, and paste it into a special &quot;drop tar&acirc;
<br>
get&quot; in the search window. It is to the far right of
the &quot;kanji&quot; search button.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you highlight multiple
characters, kdrill will now only look for an exact match of
all characters you paste in. (up to 4 chars). Multi-char
matching will NOT WORK, <br>
unless you have downloaded the additional dictionary,
&quot;edict&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note: There is a BUG in some
versions of netscape 4.x. If you are viewing kanji in a
frame, you can seemingly highlight a character, but it will
not cut-n-paste to kdrill, <br>
or anywhere else. If this occurs, use right-click to
&quot;open frame in new window&quot;, where you will be able
to use cut-n-paste. Cut-n-paste from netscape was also
improved in <br>
version 5.9.6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MATCH SIMILAR KANJI</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you have a kanji already
showing in the search window, and you are using the
&rsquo;edict&rsquo; dictionary, you can search the large
dictionary for occurences of the current <br>
kanji. Press the &quot;match&quot; button next to the kanji
display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">What are all those letters?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The top row; &quot;G, F,
#&quot;, all refer to the basic indexes that are shown in
the mail kdrill window. They stand for &quot;Grade,
Frequency, and Index #&quot;, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H denotes the index in the
&quot;Halperin&quot; dictionary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N denotes the index in the
&quot;Nelson&quot; dictionary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ux denotes the
&quot;Unicode&quot; of the kanji. It is Ux to make it stand
out as the only one that expects input in Hexadecimal. This
is because that is the way the dictionary has <br>
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For all windows with the little
^ in them, you can change the values. When you press return
or enter in them, kdrill will attempt to find a match for
what you just <br>
entered. If it can find no match, it will blank out all
fields displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use this jump-to-index
feature in the main window too. However, the main window
will keep any restrictions you might have while doing the
search (limits by use&acirc; <br>
file, grade, or frequency limit).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The search window ignores any
restrictions on the main window, and searches the entire
on-line dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONFIGURATION DETAILS <br>
kdrill checks for a file by the name of .kanjiusefile in the
current directory, although this name can be changed either
with the &rsquo;-usefile&rsquo; option, or in a resource
file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdrill also checks for a
logfile, named kdrill.log by default, in the current
directory. This can be changed with the -logfile option, or
in a resource file. See &quot;LOGFILES AND <br>
MISSED KANJI&quot;, below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kdrill uses a file called
&quot;kanjidic&quot; (which does not come in the source
package) to interpret many of the various 16-bit kanji chars
in the kanji24 font supplied with the X11R5 <br>
distribution. This file should be in a place accessible to
all users. Normally it would be in /usr/local/lib or
somewhere similar.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">kanjidic subdivides its entries
into grade levels, and frequency ratings. Grade levels are
similar to school grade levels, but more compressed. For
kdrill&rsquo;s purposes, grade lev&acirc; <br>
els start at 1, and increase to 6. There are many kanji that
do not have a grade level, due to their infrequency of use,
or other reasons. These are denoted by the &quot;+&quot;
character <br>
in the grade select window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The user can restrict the range
of kanji to drill on in different, yet compatible, ways. The
first way is to make a &quot;.kanjiusefile&quot; with a an
explicit list of desired kanji. <br>
(described above in &quot;USEFILES&quot;),</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Changes you make to the
&quot;Grade Select&quot; window or the &quot;Frequency
Range&quot; section will not do anything until you supply
the correct match to the current drill-question (or press
the <br>
english/kana toggle button).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind that the xfd font
tool and other applications may refer to kanji characters by
a hexadecimal number. You may enter a hexadecimal number by
starting it with &quot;0x&quot;. For <br>
example, &quot;0x315c&quot;. To maintain compatibility with
the dictionary, the kdrill &quot;usefile&quot; expects
hexadecimal input, not decimal input. Similarly, the logfile
also stores kanji in <br>
hexadecimal format. This makes it easy to use a log file of
kanji you have missed as a usefile, for repeated
drilling.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGFILES AND MISSED KANJI <br>
Every time you guess incorrectly, kdrill makes a note. It
later will give you extra practice on ones you missed, if
you are playing in random order. It will only repeat a
missed <br>
character about 25% of the time. The more you miss a
particular character, the more kdrill will repeat showing it
to you.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can store a list of your
incorrect answers by pressing the &quot;Log&quot; button.
kdrill will then write out all the kanji characters it
thinks you do not know into the logfile. This <br>
will erase any information previously in that logfile.
kdrill will also automatically update the logfile when it
quits The next time you start up kdrill, it will
automatically <br>
read in the logfile, if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The logfile is named
&quot;kdrill.log&quot;, by default. You may change the name
of the logfile with the -logfile option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is a good idea to press
&quot;Log&quot; just before quitting kdrill. That way, it
will remember which characters you are weak on, for the next
time you play. It will then go back to <br>
those characters from time to time, if you play in
&quot;random&quot; order. If you do not press
&quot;Log&quot;, kdrill will not save a record of what you
have missed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Alternatively, you can use the
logfile as a usefile. kdrill will then only quiz you on
those kanji you missed. If you choose to do this, it is a
good idea to copy the log file <br>
over to a different file. That way, you can make a logfile
for your new usefile. For example, in UNIX;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">cp kdrill.log kdrill.usefile
kdrill -usefile kdrill.usefile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The total number of missed
entries is shown in the main window. If there are just too
many for your comfort (learning new kanji can be difficult!)
you can ERASE THE COUNT with <br>
your backspace or delete key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">KANJIDIC and EDICT <br>
The dictionary for kdrill, kanjidic, is currently available
where it originated, via ftp from ftp.monash.edu.au, or from
a mirror in the U.S. at ftp.uwtc.washington.edu. Likewise
<br>
for the &quot;edict&quot; dictionary. There are many other
mirror sites mentioned on the kdrill web page. (See
below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the monash site, both the
dictionary and this program can currently be found in
/pub/nihongo</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This program&rsquo;s primary ftp
site is now ftp.bolthole.com.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is also an official kdrill
URL;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">http://www.bolthole.com/kdrill/</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This currently shows you some
screen-shots, and mentions the ftp sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
&quot;kanjidic&quot; isn&rsquo;t perfect. There are
&quot;incomplete&quot; entries, missing either English or
kana translations. There are also entries consisting of
&quot;See Nxxxx&quot;, which isn&rsquo;t really an <br>
improvement. Note that you can now use the search window to
follow those &quot;See Nxxxx&quot; references! [ Just search
for that Nxxx, as if doing a search for English ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Likewise, this man page may be
incomplete!</p>
