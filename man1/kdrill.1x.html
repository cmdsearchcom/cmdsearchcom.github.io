Yikes.. this man-page is getting huge. But I am a great believer in having
  proper documentation. Hopefully, this new format will help instead of hinder.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
At some future point in time, I shall convert this huge beast to HTML. But that
  point is not now. [Although actually, you CAN go to

<br/>
 some help ]

  normally. If you want to change kdrill's settings, and you dont see a way to
  do it in the options popup, you can probably change it in the global
  &quot;KDrill&quot; resource file, or in your personal
  &quot;$HOME/.kdrill&quot; file. See the sample &quot;KDrill&quot; file for
  more detail, which is often installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/KDrill, or

<b>kdrill</b> is a program to drill users on meanings of kanji characters.
  Various formats of drills are available:
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<br/>

<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLAYING"><a class="selflink" href="#PLAYING">PLAYING</a></h1>
kdrill will present you with a kanji (or kana or english phrase) and five
  possible meanings for it. Your goal is to guess which one matches the kanji at
  the top. Initially, it will choose randomly from the <b>entire dictionary</b>,
  so you will probably want to narrow the range, via the OPTIONS section, below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Any grade level or frequency rating the current kanji has will be displayed in
  the top right hand side of the window, next to the &quot;G:&quot; and
  &quot;F:&quot; letters. The kanji index number will be displayed after the
  &quot;#:&quot; sign.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Click with your primary mouse button (usually the left one) on one of the
  multiple-choice answered to see how well you know the lone kanji or meaning.
  You may also use the number keys to make your choice. [1,2,3,4,5]
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you guess correctly, you will move on to another character. If you guess
  incorrectly, you will have to guess again. Furthermore, kdrill will make a
  note that you didn't know either the character displayed, or the character for
  the incorrect meaning you clicked on.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you are playing in random order, kdrill will randomly repeat the ones you
  have missed. You will have to get a missed character right twice for kdrill to
  think you know it. If you miss a character more than once, you will have to
  repeat the character two times the number of times you missed it. If you are
  playing in order, kdrill will keep to the order, and not go back. It will
  still remember ones you have missed, however, and will go back to them if you
  later switch to random order.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
There are two ways of &quot;cheating&quot;, if you are learning new characters,
  and don't want to have an incorrect guess recorded. One way is to press the
  &quot;cheat&quot; button, and the correct answer will be highlighted. The
  other way is to make a guess with button 2 on your mouse. The character of the
  one you clicked on will appear in the search window. If the search window was
  not already open, it will appear when you do this.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="PLAYING_OPTIONS"><a class="selflink" href="#PLAYING_OPTIONS">PLAYING
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
If you want to change the way the game works while playing, you can bring up the
  options window by pressing the options button. If you know how you want the
  game to play before starting it, you can most likely do what you want with a
  command-line option, described at the top of this man-page. If you want to
  permanently change an option, see the &quot;RESOURCES&quot; header, above.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The following options are to help narrow down the range of kanji you get quizzed
  on.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Grades</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You may specify which grade levels you wish to study, by clicking on the
      buttons labeled: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,
      &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, or
      &quot;All&quot;, in the &quot;Grade Select&quot; window. You may also
      select/unselect a grade by holding down shift, followed by &quot;1&quot;,
      &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;,
      &quot;+&quot;, or &quot;a&quot;, in the main window.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The &quot;All&quot; feature will select all grades. but it will not unselect
      them.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The default is to have all the grades enabled.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">
  <br/>
   Frequency</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Some kanji have frequency ratings. That means that, in real life, some kanji
      are used more frequently than others. Frequency rating 1 means that this
      is <b>the</b> most frequently used character. The frequency of the true
      answer you are guessing will be displayed in the top right of the main
      window, next to the &quot;F:&quot; sign, if a frequency rating exists.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The frequency range area in the options window allows you to limit the kanji
      you see based on their frequency rating. The frequency range area consists
      of two smaller input areas; &quot;High&quot;, and &quot;Low&quot;.
      <i>High</i> means a kanji that is high frequency. That is to say,
      something that is used often. According to the definitions of the
      dictionary, &quot;1&quot; means the kanji that is used the <i>most</i>
      often. A frequency rating of &quot;2&quot; means that the character has a
      <i>lower</i> frequency than &quot;1&quot;. The most frequently used kanji
      is the character for &quot;day&quot;, which is &quot;F: 1&quot;.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Setting a number in the &quot;High&quot; window limits high frequency kanji.
      If there is a number in the &quot;High&quot; window, that means that you
      will see no kanji that is of higher frequency than that number. Similarly,
      setting a number in the &quot;Low&quot; window means that you will see no
      kanji of frequency lower than that number. 2000 is a &quot;Low&quot;
      frequency kanji. If you put 2000 in the &quot;Low&quot; area, you would
      see nothing of lower frequency than the character rated at 2000 (which
      happens to be &quot;hazy&quot;) that you would see nothing
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A blank in the &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Low&quot; fields indicates no limit
      in the field. If you try to set either window to &quot;0&quot;, it will
      automatically set itself blank for you.

    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    It is possible to be drilled on kanji in order, without repetition, until
      &quot;all&quot; kanji have been covered. Any restrictions on grade level
      or frequency will still apply. To enable or disable ordering, click on the
      &quot;Showing randomly&quot; (or &quot;Showing in order&quot;) button in
      the options window.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <i>Note that &quot;in order&quot; does not mean in order of frequency.</i>
      It means in the order represented by the dictionary, denoted by the '#'
      number shown at top right. This happens to be the JIS-encoding of the
      Kanji, which we also call the kanji index.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LEARNING_NEW_CHARS"><a class="selflink" href="#LEARNING_NEW_CHARS">LEARNING
  NEW CHARS</a></h1>
If you would like a small little window to memorize new chars in, instead of the
  bulkier 'main' or 'search' windows, there is now a 'learn' window. Pressing
  the (learn) button on the main window will bring up the learn window, which
  only displays kanji, kana, and english meanings of a char. Pressing one of the
  'next' buttons will select a new char for you to look at, using the same rules
  of choosing that the main window uses. (grade levels, and an optional usefile)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="USEFILES"><a class="selflink" href="#USEFILES">USEFILES</a></h1>
A usefile is a way to tell kdrill &quot;I want to be quizzed on these kanji, and
  ONLY these specific kanji&quot;. Generally speaking, it is easier to just pick
  a particular grade level or frequency range to quiz yourself on. But if you
  know you want specific kanji (for example, to study for a class!) having a
  usefile is very useful.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Grade and Frequency restrictions will apply, even if you have a usefile. Thus,
  if all your usefile-defined kanji are of grade 4 or higher, and you have only
  selected grades 3 and lower, kdrill will complain that there are not enough
  kanji available, and attempt to add viewable grade levels until there are
  enough value kanji to quiz on
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
To add or remove a kanji from the &quot;usefile&quot;, pull up the search
  window, and view a particular kanji. The &quot;usefile&quot; button at the far
  right will be highlighted if it is in the usefile list. You can toggle the
  button to set the status as you wish.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you want to see all the kanji in your usefile, click on the &quot;show&quot;
  button, below the &quot;usefile&quot; toggle, in the search window. It will
  then show you the current list, and pressing on one will display it in the
  search window. You can then remove it via the &quot;usefile&quot; toggle if
  you like.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
When you quit kdrill, it will update the usefile, IF you have a minimum number
  in the list (currently, 10). If you want to know if you have enough, use the
  options window to toggle &quot;No Usefile&quot; to &quot;Using Usefile&quot;.
  It will not let you, if there are not enough characters in the list.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
If you wish kdrill to ignore your usefile when you start it up, you may use the
  -nousefile option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">Usefile format</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag">
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you want to edit a usefile by hand, this is the format:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    A usefile consists of a list of hex numbers; one per line, no initial spaces
      allowed. A usefile lets the program know you are interested in certain
      kanji, from the thousands listed in the dictionary. It is possible to add
      comment lines by having the very first character of a line be
      &quot;#&quot;. However, those will be overwritten if you make changes from
      within the program. Hex numbers can be checked or found by using the
      &quot;xfd&quot; util on the &quot;kanji24&quot; font. Alternatively, you
      could use the search window or main kdrill window. In on of the
      &quot;#&quot; input boxes, type in &quot;0x&quot;, and then the hex
      number. It is best to do this in the search window, since the main window
      may have range restrictions on it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>

  </dd>
</dl>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="SEARCH"><a class="selflink" href="#SEARCH">SEARCH</a></h1>
It is now possible to search for a character in kdrill. You may search for an
  English phrase, a kana phrase, or a particular kanji.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
kdrill will automatically show the first match. If there is more than one match,
  it will be shown in a secondary popup window. That window can be changed to
  display the english, kanji, or kana meaning of each dictionary entry. Click on
  one to have it displayed in the main search window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Additionally, if a search turns up a kanji phrase instead of a single kanji, you
  may click on the phrase at the top of the search window, to have the secondary
  multi-listing window display the individual kanji for you to examine in
  further detail.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">English search</dt>

    First, bring up the search window by pressing the search button. Then, enter
      an English word (or fragment) in the bottom-most section of the window,
      and press return or enter. The window will then display the first kanji it
      finds that has that word in its definition, along with its index number,
      grade, and other information available, if any.

    If you want to search for a <b>kana</b> phrase, you now have TWO options!
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For more experienced users, you can finally type in that tempting kana
      window. There is no little ^ cursor, but dont worry about that. <b>DO</b>
      worry about the following conventions:
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    <br/>
     Type &quot;n &quot; (n,space) to convert a ending 'n' to kana
    <br/>
     Press &quot;'&quot; for small-tsu. (type &quot;chotto&quot; as
      &quot;cho'to&quot;)
    <br/>
     Press &quot;-&quot; for kana elongation. (&quot;bi-ru&quot;)
    <br/>
     Press backspace to erase the last char.
    <br/>
     Press return to start the search.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For a pointy-clicky method of input, press the &quot;kana search&quot;
      button. This will pop up the kana seach window. (Press it again to remove
      the window.) Press the kana(s) you want to search for. The chars you press
      will be shown next to the &quot;kana search&quot; button in the main
      search window. When you have the phrase ready, press the [Search] box.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If your kana recognition isn't all it should be, you can toggle romaji mode
      in the options popup (via &quot;options&quot; from the main window).
      Additionally, if you don't know katakana, but want to translate a katakana
      phrase, use the &lt;=&gt; button to toggle between hiragana and katakana.
      Note that even if you are in katakana input mode, it will print out your
      buttonpresses as hiragana. This is because the search engine treats
      hiragana and katakana identically.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you make a mistake, press the &lt;- button, or backspace, to erase the
      last char.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The characters you press will appear at the bottom of the popup, and also on
      the main search window next to the kana search button. As noted above, if

    If you want to find a kanji by shape, press the kanji search button on the
      search window. This will bring up the kanji search window. Press it again
      to remove the kanji search window.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    This window employes the &quot;4-corner method&quot; of lookup. The 4-corner
      method has lots of strange rules to it. I strongly recommend that you read
      the description that comes in the kanjidic document file. It is impossible
      for me to cover all details here.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    In brief, you have to press each corner of the center box, and select one of
      the ten elements from the top row, that best matches that corner of the
      kanji you want to look up. For those already familiar with the 4-corner
      method, the &quot;blank&quot; element is an alias for the first element.
      There are still only 10 possible positions.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Press the paragraph button (backwards 'P') when you are ready to search.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For those NOT already familiar with the 4-corner method... unfortunately, it
      sounds easy, but it is really horribly difficult, and I again refer you to
      the documentation that comes with the kanjidic dictionary file. Look for
      &quot;kanjidic.doc&quot;

    For ELECTRONIC lookup... if you view Japanese text online with a program
      like &quot;kterm&quot;, you can now select a single kanji in kterm, and
      paste it into a special &quot;drop target&quot; in the search window. It
      is to the far right of the &quot;kanji&quot; search button.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    If you highlight multiple characters, kdrill will now only look for an exact
      match of all characters you paste in. (up to 4 chars). Multi-char matching
      will NOT WORK, unless you have downloaded the additional dictionary,
      &quot;edict&quot;
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    Note: There is a BUG in some versions of netscape 4.x. If you are viewing
      kanji in a frame, you can seemingly highlight a character, but it will not
      cut-n-paste to kdrill, or anywhere else. If this occurs, use right-click
      to &quot;open frame in new window&quot;, where you will be able to use
      cut-n-paste. Cut-n-paste from netscape was also improved in version

    The top row; &quot;G, F, #&quot;, all refer to the basic indexes that are
      shown in the mail kdrill window. They stand for &quot;Grade, Frequency,
      and Index #&quot;, respectively.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>H</b> denotes the index in the &quot;Halperin&quot; dictionary
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>N</b> denotes the index in the &quot;Nelson&quot; dictionary
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
     <b>Ux</b> denotes the &quot;Unicode&quot; of the kanji. It is U<b>x</b> to
      make it stand out as the only one that expects input in Hexadecimal. This
      is because that is the way the dictionary has it.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    For all windows with the little ^ in them, you can change the values. When
      you press return or enter in them, kdrill will attempt to find a match for
      what you just entered. If it can find no match, it will blank out all
      fields displayed.
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    You can use this jump-to-index feature in the main window too. However, the
      main window will keep any restrictions you might have while doing the
      search (limits by usefile, grade, or frequency limit).
    <div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
    The search window ignores any restrictions on the main window, and searches
      the entire on-line dictionary.

kdrill checks for a file by the name of <b>.kanjiusefile</b> in the current
  directory, although this name can be changed either with the '-usefile'
  option, or in a resource file.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
kdrill also checks for a logfile, named <b>kdrill.log</b> by default, in the
  current directory. This can be changed with the -logfile option, or in a
  resource file. See &quot;LOGFILES AND MISSED KANJI&quot;, below.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
kdrill uses a file called &quot;kanjidic&quot; (which does not come in the
  source package) to interpret many of the various 16-bit kanji chars in the
  <i>kanji24</i> font supplied with the X11R5 distribution. This file should be
  in a place accessible to all users. Normally it would be in /usr/local/lib or
  somewhere similar.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<i>kanjidic</i> subdivides its entries into grade levels, and frequency ratings.
  Grade levels are similar to school grade levels, but more compressed. For
  kdrill's purposes, grade levels start at 1, and increase to 6. There are many
  kanji that do not have a grade level, due to their infrequency of use, or
  other reasons. These are denoted by the &quot;+&quot; character in the grade
  select window.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The user can restrict the range of kanji to drill on in different, yet
  compatible, ways. The first way is to make a &quot;.kanjiusefile&quot; with a
  an explicit list of desired kanji. (described above in &quot;USEFILES&quot;),
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Changes you make to the &quot;Grade Select&quot; window or the &quot;Frequency
  Range&quot; section will not do anything until you supply the correct match to
  the current drill-question (or press the english/kana toggle button).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Keep in mind that the xfd font tool and other applications may refer to kanji
  characters by a <i>hexadecimal</i> number. You may enter a hexadecimal number
  by starting it with &quot;0x&quot;. For example, &quot;0x315c&quot;. To
  maintain compatibility with the dictionary, the kdrill &quot;usefile&quot;
  expects hexadecimal input, not decimal input. Similarly, the logfile also
  stores kanji in hexadecimal format. This makes it easy to use a log file of
  kanji you have missed as a usefile, for repeated drilling.

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="LOGFILES_AND_MISSED_KANJI"><a class="selflink" href="#LOGFILES_AND_MISSED_KANJI">LOGFILES
  AND MISSED KANJI</a></h1>
Every time you guess incorrectly, kdrill makes a note. It later will give you
  extra practice on ones you missed, if you are playing in random order. It will
  only repeat a missed character about 25% of the time. The more you miss a
  particular character, the more kdrill will repeat showing it to you.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
You can store a list of your incorrect answers by pressing the &quot;Log&quot;
  button. kdrill will then write out all the kanji characters it thinks you do
  not know into the logfile. This will erase any information previously in that
  logfile. kdrill will also automatically update the logfile when it quits The
  next time you start up kdrill, it will automatically read in the logfile, if
  it exists.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The logfile is named &quot;kdrill.log&quot;, by default. You may change the name
  of the logfile with the -logfile option.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
It is a good idea to press &quot;Log&quot; just before quitting kdrill. That
  way, it will remember which characters you are weak on, for the next time you
  play. It will then go back to those characters from time to time, if you play
  in &quot;random&quot; order. If you do not press &quot;Log&quot;, kdrill will
  not save a record of what you have missed.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
Alternatively, you can use the logfile as a usefile. kdrill will then only quiz
  you on those kanji you missed. If you choose to do this, it is a good idea to
  copy the log file over to a different file. That way, you can make a logfile
  for your new usefile. For example, in UNIX;
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
cp kdrill.log kdrill.usefile kdrill -usefile kdrill.usefile
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
The total number of missed entries is shown in the main window. If there are
  just too many for your comfort (learning new kanji can be difficult!) you can
  ERASE THE COUNT with your backspace or delete key.
