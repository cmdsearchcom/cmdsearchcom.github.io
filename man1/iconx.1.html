<p>ICON(1) General Commands Manual ICON(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
icon - interpret or compile Icon programs</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
icont [ option ... ] file ... [ -x arg ... ] <br>
iconc [ option ... ] file ... [ -x arg ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
icont and iconc each convert an Icon source program into
executable form. icont translates quickly and provides
interpretive execution. iconc takes longer to compile but
pro&acirc; <br>
duces programs that execute faster. icont and iconc for the
most part can be used interchangeably.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This manual page describes both
icont and iconc. Where there there are differences in usage
between icont and iconc, these are noted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">File Names: Files whose names
end in .icn are assumed to be Icon source files. The .icn
suffix may be omitted; if it is not present, it is supplied.
The character - can be used <br>
to indicate an Icon source file given in standard input.
Several source files can be given on the same command line;
if so, they are combined to produce a single program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The name of the executable file
is the base name of the first input file, formed by deleting
the suffix, if present. stdin is used for source programs
given in standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing: As noted in the
synopsis above, icont and iconc accept options followed by
file names, optionally followed by -x and arguments. If -x
is given, the program is exe&acirc; <br>
cuted automatically and any following arguments are passed
to it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">icont: The processing performed
by icont consists of two phases: translation and linking.
During translation, each Icon source file is translated into
an intermediate language <br>
called ucode. Two ucode files are produced for each source
file, with base names from the source file and suffixes .u1
and .u2. During linking, the one or more pairs of ucode <br>
files are combined to produce a single icode file. The ucode
files are deleted after the icode file is created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing by icont can be
terminated after translation by the -c option. In this case,
the ucode files are not deleted. The names of .u1 files from
previous translations can be <br>
given on the icont command line. These files and the
corresponding .u2 files are included in the linking phase
after the translation of any source files. The suffix .u can
be <br>
used in place of .u1; in this case the 1 is supplied
automatically. Ucode files that are explicitly named are not
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">iconc: The processing performed
by iconc consists of two phases: code generation and
compilation and linking. The code generation phase produces
C code, consisting of a .c and a <br>
.h file, with the base name of the first source file. These
files are then compiled and linked to produce an executable
binary file. The C files normally are deleted after
com&acirc; <br>
pilation and linking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Processing by iconc can be
terminated after code generation by the -c option. In this
case, the C files are not deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
The following options are recognized by icont and iconc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c Stop after producing
intermediate files and do not delete them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e file <br>
Redirect standard error output to file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f s <br>
Enable full string invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o name <br>
Name the output file name.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s Suppress informative
messages. Normally, both informative messages and error
messages are sent to standard error output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Arrange for &amp;trace to
have an initial value of -1 when the program is executed and
for iconc enable debugging features.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-u Issue warning messages for
undeclared identifiers in the program.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v i <br>
Set verbosity level of informative messages to i</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-E Direct the results of
preprocessing to standard output and inhibit further
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following additional options
are recognized by iconc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f string <br>
Enable features as indicated by the letters in string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a all, equivalent to delns</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d enable debugging features:
display(), name(), variable(), error trace back, and the
effect of -f n (see below)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e enable error conversion</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">l enable large-integer
arithmetic</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">n produce code that keeps track
of line numbers and file names in the source code</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s enable full string
invocation</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n string <br>
Disable specific optimizations. These are indicated by the
letters in string:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a all, equivalent to cest</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c control flow optimizations
other than switch statement optimizations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e expand operations in-line when
reasonable (keywords are always put in-line)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">s optimize switch statements
associated with operation invocations</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t type inference</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p arg <br>
Pass arg on to the C compiler used by iconc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-r path <br>
Use the run-time system at path, which must end with a
slash.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-C prg <br>
Have iconc use the C compiler given by prg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
When an Icon program is executed, several environment
variables are examined to determine certain execution
parameters. Values in parentheses are the default
values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BLKSIZE (500000) <br>
The initial size of the allocated block region, in
bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">COEXPSIZE (2000) <br>
The size, in words, of each co-expression block.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBLIST <br>
The location of data bases for iconc to search before the
standard one. The value of DBLIST should be a
blank-separated string of the form p1 p2 ... pn where the pi
name <br>
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICONCORE <br>
If set, a core dump is produced for error termination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ICONX <br>
The location of iconx, the executor for icode files, is
built into an icode file when it is produced. This location
can be overridden by setting the environment variable <br>
ICONX. If ICONX is set, its value is used in place of the
location built into the icode file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">IPATH <br>
The location of ucode files specified in link declarations
for icont. IPATH is a blank-separated list of directories.
The current directory is always searched first, <br>
regardless of the value of IPATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LPATH <br>
The location of source files specified in preprocessor
$include directives and in link declarations for iconc.
LPATH is otherwise similar to IPATH.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">MSTKSIZE (10000) <br>
The size, in words, of the main interpreter stack for
icont.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NOERRBUF <br>
By default, &amp;errout is buffered. If this variable is
set, &amp;errout is not buffered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">QLSIZE (5000) <br>
The size, in bytes, of the region used for pointers to
strings during garbage collection.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">STRSIZE (500000) <br>
The initial size of the string space, in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">TRACE <br>
The initial value of &amp;trace. If this variable has a
value, it overrides the translation-time -t option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
icont Icon translator <br>
iconc Icon compiler <br>
iconx Icon executor</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS AND BUGS <br>
The icode files for the interpreter do not stand alone; the
Icon run-time system (iconx) must be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Stack overflow is checked using
a heuristic that is not always effective.</p>
