<br/>
 The default action is to write a MIDI file for each abc tune
<br/>
 with the filename &lt;stem&gt;N.mid, where &lt;stem&gt; is the filestem
<br/>
 of the abc file and N is the tune reference number. If the -o
<br/>
 option is used, only one file is written. This is the tune
<br/>
 specified by the reference number or, if no reference number
<br/>
 is given, the first tune in the file.

* Broken rhythms (&gt;, &lt;), chords, n-tuples, slurring, ties, staccatto
  notes, repeats, in-tune tempo/length/time signature changes are all supported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* R:hornpipe or r:hornpipe is recognized and note timings are adjusted to give a
  broken rhythm (ab is converted to a&gt;b).
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Most errors in the abc input will generate a suitable error message in the
  output and the converter keeps going.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Comments and text fields in the abc source are converted to text events in the
  MIDI output
<div class="Pp"></div>
* If guitar chords are present, they are used to generate an accompaniment in
  the MIDI output.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* If there are mis-matched repeat signs in the abc, the program attempts to fix
  them. However, it will not attempt this if a multi-part tune description has
  been used or if multiple voices are in use.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Karaoke MIDI files can be generated by using the w: field to include lyrics.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Nonnumeric voice id's, eg. V: soprano, as proposed for the new abc standard is
  accepted.
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Invisible rests specified by x are treated the same way as normal rests (z).
<div class="Pp"></div>
* Decorations may be indicated using either the deprecated notation (eg.
  !fermata!) or the standard version 2.0 notation (eg. +fermata+).

  SYNTAX EXTENSIONS</a></h1>
* There are some extensions to the abc syntax of the form
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI channel n
<div class="Pp"></div>
These control channel and program selection, transposing and various other
  features of abc2midi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Each of these should appear on a line by itself. All of them are allowed within
  the abc tune body. By using these in combination with the part notation, one
  can, for example, play a part transposed or in a different key.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The idea behind this syntax is that other programs will treat it as a comment
  and ignore it.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI channel n
<div class="Pp"></div>
selects melody channel n (in the range 1-16).
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI program [c] n
<div class="Pp"></div>
selects program n (in the range 1-128) on channel c. If c is not given, the
  program is selected on the current melody channel. Most modern tone generators
  follow the General MIDI standard which defines the instrument type for each
  program number.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI beat a b c n
<div class="Pp"></div>
controls the way note velocities are selected. The first note in a bar has
  velocity a. Other &quot;strong&quot; notes have velocity b and all the rest
  have velocity c. a, b and c must be in the range 0-128. The parameter n
  determines which notes are &quot;strong&quot;. If the time signature is x/y,
  then each note is given a position number k = 0, 1, 2 .. x-1 within each bar.
  Note that the units for n are not the unit note length. If k is a multiple of
  n, then the note is &quot;strong&quot;. The volume specifiers !ppp! to !fff!
  are equivalent to the following :
<div class="Pp"></div>
!ppp! = %%MIDI beat 30 20 10 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!pp! = %%MIDI beat 45 35 20 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!p! = %%MIDI beat 60 50 35 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!mp! = %%MIDI beat 75 65 50 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!mf! = %%MIDI beat 90 80 65 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!f! = %%MIDI beat 105 95 80 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!ff! = %%MIDI beat 120 110 95 1
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
!fff! = %%MIDI beat 127 125 110 1
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI beatmod n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Increments by n (or decrements if n is negative) the velocities a, b and c
  described above. The instructions !crescendo(! and !crescendo)! are equivalent
  to inserting a %%MIDI beatmod 15 wherever they occur. (Alternatively you can
  use !&lt;(! and !&lt;)!.) Similarly the instructions !diminuendo(! and
  !diminuendo)! are equivalent to %%MIDI beatmod -15.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI deltaloudness n
<div class="Pp"></div>
where n is a small positive number. By default the crescendo and diminuendo
  instructions modify the beat variables a, b, and c by 15 velocity units. This
  instruction allows you to set this default to value n.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI nobeataccents
<div class="Pp"></div>
For instruments such as church organ that have no greatly emphasized beat notes,
  using this will force use of the 'b' velocity (see %%MIDI beat) for every note
  irrespective of position in the bar. This allows dynamics (ff, f, etc) to be
  used in the normal way.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI beataccents
<div class="Pp"></div>
Revert to emphasizing notes the the usual way. (default)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI beatstring &lt;string of f, m and p&gt;
<div class="Pp"></div>
This provides an alternative way of specifying where the strong and weak
  stresses fall within a bar. 'f' means velocity a (normally strong), 'm' means
  velocity b (medium velocity) and 'p' means velocity c (soft velocity). For
  example, if the time signature is 7/8 with stresses on the first, fourth and
  sixth notes in the bar, we could use the following
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI beatstring fppmpmp
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI transpose n
<div class="Pp"></div>
transposes the output by the specified number of semitones. n may be positive or
  negative.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI rtranspose n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Relative transpose by the specified number of semitones. i.e. %%MIDI transpose a
  followed by %%MIDI rtranspose b results in a transposition of a+b. %%MIDI
  transpose b will result in a transposition of b semitones, regardless of any
  previous transposition.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI c n
<div class="Pp"></div>
specifies the MIDI pitch which corresponds to c. The default is 60. This number
  should normally be a multiple of 12.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI grace a/b
<div class="Pp"></div>
sets the fraction of the next note that grace notes will take up. a must be
  between 1 and b-1. The grace notes may not sound natural in this approach,
  since the length of the individual grace notes vary with the complexity of the
  grace and the length of the following note. A different approach (which is now
  the default) assumes that the grace notes always have a fixed duration. To use
  the other approach you would specify,
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
%%MIDI gracedivider b
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
where b specifies how many parts to divide the unit length specified by the L:
  field command. For example if b = 4 and L: = 1/8, then every grace note would
  be 1/(8*4) or a 32nd note. Time would be stolen from the note to which the
  grace notes are applied. If that note is not long enough to handle the grace
  then the grace notes would be assigned 0 duration.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI chordname name n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6
<div class="Pp"></div>
Defines how to play a guitar chord called &quot;name&quot;. n1 is usually 0 and
  n2, n3 to n6 give the pitches of the other notes in semitones relative to the
  root note. There may be fewer than 6 notes in the chord, but not more.If
  &quot;name&quot; is already defined, this command re-defines it. Unlike most
  other commands, chordname definitions stay in effect from where they are
  defined to the end of the abc file. The following illustrates how m, 7, m7 and
  maj7 could be set up if they were not already defined.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI chordname m 0 3 7
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
%%MIDI chordname 7 0 4 7 10
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
%%MIDI chordname m7 0 3 7 10
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
%%MIDI chordname maj7 0 4 7 11
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI gchord string
<div class="Pp"></div>
sets up how guitar chords are generated. The string is a sequence made of of
  z's, c's f's and b's for rests, chords, fundamental and fundamental plus chord
  notes respectively. This specifies how each bar is to be played. An optional
  length is allowed to follow the z's, c's f's and b's e.g. czf2zf3. If the abc
  contains guitar chords, then abc2midi automatically adds chords and
  fundamentals after encountering the first guitar chord. It keeps using that
  chord until a new chord is specified in the abc. Whenever the M: field is
  encountered in the abc, an appropriate default string is set :
<div class="Pp"></div>
For 2/4 or 4/4 time default is equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzczfzcz
<div class="Pp"></div>
For 3/4 time default is equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzczcz
<div class="Pp"></div>
For 6/8 time default is equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzcfzc
<div class="Pp"></div>
For 9/8 time default is equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzcfzcfzc
<div class="Pp"></div>
The gchord command has been extended to allow you to play the individual notes
  comprising the guitar chord. This allows you to play broken chords or
  arpeggios. The new codes g,h,i,j, G,H,I,J reference the individual notes
  starting from the lowest note of the chord (not necessarily the root in the
  case of inversions). For example for the C major chord, g refers to C, h
  refers to E and i refers to G. For a gchord command such as,
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI gchord ghih
<div class="Pp"></div>
Abc2midi will arpeggiate the C major guitar chord to CEGE. The upper case
  letters G,H,I, and J refer to the same notes except they are transposed down
  one octave. Note for the first inversion of the C major chord (indicated by
  &quot;C/E&quot;), E would be the lowest note so g would reference the note E.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like other gchord codes, you may append a numeral indicating the duration of the
  note. The same rules apply as before. You can use any combination of the
  gchord codes, (fcbghijGHIJz).
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI chordprog n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sets the MIDI instrument for the chords to be n. If the command includes the
  string octave=n where n is a number between -2 and 2 inclusive, then this will
  shift the pitch of the instrument by n octaves. For example %%MIDI chordprog
  10 octave=1.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI bassprog n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sets the MIDI instrument for the bass notes to be n. If the command includes the
  string octave=n where n is a number between -2 and 2 inclusive, then this will
  shift the pitch of the instrument by n octaves. For example %%MIDI bassprog 10
  octave=-1.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI chordvol n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sets the volume (velocity) of the chord notes at n.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI bassvol n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sets the volume (velocity) of the bass notes at n. There is no corresponding
  melodyvol command since there are 3 velocity values for melody, set using the
  beat command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI gchordon
<div class="Pp"></div>
Turns on guitar chords (they are turned on by default at the start of a tune).
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI gchordoff
<div class="Pp"></div>
Turns off guitar chords.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI droneon
<div class="Pp"></div>
Turns on a continuous drone (used in bagpipe music) consisting of two notes. By
  default the notes are A, and A,, played on a bassoon at a velocity of 80. This
  can be configured by the %%MIDI drone command described below.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI droneoff
<div class="Pp"></div>
Turns off the continuous drone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI drone n1 n2 n3 n4 n5
<div class="Pp"></div>
Sets the drone parameters where n1 is the MIDI program, n2 and n3 specify the
  MIDI pitches of the two notes in the chord, and n4 and n5 specify the MIDI
  velocities of the two notes. If you do not set these parameters they are by
  default 70 45 33 80 80. A value of zero or less indicates that the setting of
  this parameter should be left as it is.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI drum string [drum programs] [drum velocities]
<div class="Pp"></div>
This sets up a drum pattern. The string determines when there is a drum beat and
  the drum program values determine what each drum strike sounds like.
<div class="Pp"></div>
e.g. %%MIDI drum d2zdd 35 38 38 100 50 50
<div class="Pp"></div>
The string may contain 'd' for a drum strike or 'z' for a rest. By default a
  voice starts with no drum pattern and '%%MIDI drumon' is needed to enable the
  drumming. The drum pattern is repeated during each bar until '%%MIDI drumoff'
  is encountered. The %%MIDI drum command may be used within a tune to change
  the drum pattern. This command places the drum sounds on channel 10 and
  assumes your tone generator complies with the General Midi standard - if it
  does not, then you may hear tones instead of drum sounds.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In both the gchord and drum commands, the standard note length of a single note
  f,c,z or d is not set by the L: command. Instead it is adjusted so that the
  entire gchord string or drum string fits exactly into one bar. In other words
  the duration of each note is divided by the total duration of the string. This
  means that, for example, the drum string &quot;dd&quot; is equivalent to drum
  string &quot;d4d4&quot;. You cannot currently specify fractions directly (eg.
  C3/2) as done in the body of the music, but it is still possible to express
  complex rhythms. For example, to indicate a rhythm such as (3ddd d/d/d/d, you
  would write the string &quot;d4d4d4d3d3d3d3&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI drumbars n
<div class="Pp"></div>
The %%MIDI drum line can sound quite monotonous if it is repeated each bar. To
  circumvent this problem a new MIDI command %%MIDI drumbars n where n is a
  small number will spread out the drum string over n consecutive bars. By
  default drumbars is set to 1 maintaining compatibility with existing abc
  files. You should take care that the drumstring is evenly divisible between
  the drumbar bars. Also the time signature should not change between bars in a
  drumbar unit. (Sample abc file in doc/CHANGES June 24 2008.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI gchordbars n
<div class="Pp"></div>
This command spreads the gchord string over n consecutive bars just like
  drumbars (above). (A sample is found in doc/CHANGES March 17 2009.)
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
With version 1.54 Dec 4 2004 of abc2midi, notes in chords (eg. [FAc]) are not
  played in the same instant but offsetted and shortened by 10 MIDI time units.
  Thus the first note in the chord (eg. F) is played for the full indicated
  time, the second note (eg. A) starts 10 MIDI units later and is shortened by
  the same amount and the third note starts another 10 MIDI units later and is
  shortened by another 10 units. This introduces an &quot;expressivo&quot;
  option and avoids the heavy attack. (This does not apply to gchords or
  multivoiced chords.) The amount of the delay and shortening may be configured
  by the MIDI command
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI chordattack n
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
where n is a small number. If n is zero, then abc2midi should behave as in
  earlier versions. The delay n is in MIDI time units where there are 480 units
  in a quarter note beat. The program may not run correctly if n is too large
  and there are short chords.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI randomchordattack n
<div class="Pp"></div>
Like above except that the delay is a random variable uniformly distributed
  between 0 and n-1.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI trim x/y
<div class="Pp"></div>
where x and y are two numbers. This command controls the articulation of notes
  and chords by placing silent gaps between the notes. The length of these gaps
  is determined by x/y and the unit length specified by the L: command. These
  gaps are produced by shortening the notes by the same amount. If the note is
  already shorter than the specified gap, then the gap is set to half the length
  of the note. The fraction x/y indicates a note duration in the same manner as
  specified in the abc file. The actual duration is based on the unit length
  specified by the L: field command. It is recommended that x/y be a fraction
  close to zero. Note trimming is disabled inside slurs as specified by
  parentheses. You can turn off all note trimming by setting x to 0, eg 0/1. By
  default, note trimming is turned off at the beginning of a tune or voice
  command.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI expand x/y
<div class="Pp"></div>
where x and y are two numbers defining a fraction less than 1. This command
  controls the articulation of notes and chords in the reverse manner. The notes
  are lengthened by this fraction so they overlap the start of the next note.
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI drummap note midipitch
<div class="Pp"></div>
Please see abcguide.txt.
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%MIDI ptstress filename
<div class="Pp"></div>
This command loads file filename into abc2midi which contains the Phil Taylor
  stress parameters and puts abc2midi in the mode where it applies these stress
  parameters on every note. This model runs in opposition to the standard beat
  model, so the MIDI beat, beatstring, beatmod commands become ineffectual. This
  also means that the dynamic indications !f! !pp! etc. do not work any more.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two different implementations of the stress model. Model 1 modifies
  the note articulation and takes control of the MIDI trim parameters too. To
  revert back to the standard model, put the command %%MIDI beataccents. Model 2
  modifies both the onset and ending of each note allowing a musical beat to
  expand or contract in time. However, the length of a musical measure should be
  preserved. Note if you using model 2, which the current default, you must
  include -BF as one of the runtime parameters of abc2midi.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The model divides a bar into equal segments. For each segment, a loudness or
  MIDI velocity is specified and a duration multiplier is specified. If a note
  falls into a specific segment, it assumes the velocity of that segment and its
  duration is modified accordingly. If the note overlaps more than one segment,
  then the note assumes the average of those segment values.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The input file specifies the number of segments and the loudness and duration
  multipliers for each segment. The file has the following format. The first
  value is the number of segments and each line specifies the velocity and
  duration multiplier of the specific segment. The velocity is limited to 127
  and the duration is a decimal number. The note durations is modified by
  varying the gap between notes, so it is not possible to extend a note. This
  preserves the regular tempo of the music. The program scales, the note
  duration indications by dividing it by the maximum value which here is 1.4.

The proposed standard introduces a new copyright field using the syntax
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
%%abc-copyright (c) Copyright John Smith 2003
<div style="height: 1.00em;">&#x00A0;</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Abc2midi now inserts this in the MIDI file in the form of a metatext copyright
  tag. Changes were made to the event_specific function in store.c to process
  the copyright information. It is also copied into the Karaoke track (if it is
  created) as as @T field.
