<p>ABC2MIDI(1) General Commands Manual ABC2MIDI(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
abc2midi - converts abc file to MIDI file(s)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
abc2midi infile [refnum] [-c] [-v] [-ver] [-t] [-n limit]
[-CS] [-quiet] [-silent] [-Q tempo] [-NFNP] [-NFER] [-NGRA]
[-STFW] [-OCC] [-NCOM] [-HARP] [-BF] [-TT] [-o outfile] -CSM
<br>
[filename]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
The default action is to write a MIDI file for each abc tune
<br>
with the filename &lt;stem&gt;N.mid, where &lt;stem&gt; is
the filestem <br>
of the abc file and N is the tune reference number. If the
-o <br>
option is used, only one file is written. This is the tune
<br>
specified by the reference number or, if no reference number
<br>
is given, the first tune in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
refnum process the tune with reference number refnum</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-c selects checking only</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v n selects verbose option
where n is the level (optional)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-ver prints version number and
exits</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t selects filenames derived
from tune titles</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CS use 2:1 instead of 3:1 for
broken rhythms</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-quiet Suppresses some common
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-silent <br>
Suppresses other messages.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-n X limits the length of the
file name stem to X characters</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q tempo <br>
sets the default tempo in quarter notes per minute if it was
not specified in the abc header.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-NFNP Ignore any dynamic
indications !f! !ff! etc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-NFER Ignore any fermata
indications (eg H or !fermata!).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-NGRA Ignore any grace
notes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-STFW Place lyric text in
separate MIDI tracks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-NCOM Suppress some comments in
the output MIDI file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-OCC Accept old chord convention
(eg +D2G2+ instead of [DG]2).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-BF BarFly mode: invokes a
stress model if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-HARP Roll ornaments=roll are
generated for the harpist (same pitch)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-TT Changes the tuning from A =
440 Hz.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o outfile <br>
write output to outfile</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-CSM infile <br>
load a set of custom stress modes from a file</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FEATURES <br>
* Broken rhythms (&gt;, &lt;), chords, n-tuples, slurring,
ties, staccatto notes, repeats, in-tune tempo/length/time
signature changes are all supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* R:hornpipe or r:hornpipe is
recognized and note timings are adjusted to give a broken
rhythm (ab is converted to a&gt;b).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Most errors in the abc input
will generate a suitable error message in the output and the
converter keeps going.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Comments and text fields in
the abc source are converted to text events in the MIDI
output</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If guitar chords are present,
they are used to generate an accompaniment in the MIDI
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* If there are mis-matched
repeat signs in the abc, the program attempts to fix them.
However, it will not attempt this if a multi-part tune
description has been used or if mul&acirc; <br>
tiple voices are in use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Karaoke MIDI files can be
generated by using the w: field to include lyrics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Nonnumeric voice id&rsquo;s,
eg. V: soprano, as proposed for the new abc standard is
accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Invisible rests specified by x
are treated the same way as normal rests (z).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Decorations may be indicated
using either the deprecated notation (eg. !fermata!) or the
standard version 2.0 notation (eg. +fermata+).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LIMITATIONS <br>
* No field is inherited from above the X: field of the
tune.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ABC SYNTAX EXTENSIONS <br>
* There are some extensions to the abc syntax of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI channel n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">These control channel and
program selection, transposing and various other features of
abc2midi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Each of these should appear on a
line by itself. All of them are allowed within the abc tune
body. By using these in combination with the part notation,
one can, for example, <br>
play a part transposed or in a different key.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The idea behind this syntax is
that other programs will treat it as a comment and ignore
it.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI channel n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selects melody channel n (in the
range 1-16).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI program [c] n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">selects program n (in the range
1-128) on channel c. If c is not given, the program is
selected on the current melody channel. Most modern tone
generators follow the General MIDI <br>
standard which defines the instrument type for each program
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI beat a b c n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">controls the way note velocities
are selected. The first note in a bar has velocity a. Other
&quot;strong&quot; notes have velocity b and all the rest
have velocity c. a, b and c must be <br>
in the range 0-128. The parameter n determines which notes
are &quot;strong&quot;. If the time signature is x/y, then
each note is given a position number k = 0, 1, 2 .. x-1
within each <br>
bar. Note that the units for n are not the unit note length.
If k is a multiple of n, then the note is
&quot;strong&quot;. The volume specifiers !ppp! to !fff! are
equivalent to the fol&acirc; <br>
lowing :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!ppp! = %%MIDI beat 30 20 10 1
<br>
!pp! = %%MIDI beat 45 35 20 1 <br>
!p! = %%MIDI beat 60 50 35 1 <br>
!mp! = %%MIDI beat 75 65 50 1 <br>
!mf! = %%MIDI beat 90 80 65 1 <br>
!f! = %%MIDI beat 105 95 80 1 <br>
!ff! = %%MIDI beat 120 110 95 1 <br>
!fff! = %%MIDI beat 127 125 110 1</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI beatmod n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Increments by n (or decrements
if n is negative) the velocities a, b and c described above.
The instructions !crescendo(! and !crescendo)! are
equivalent to inserting a %%MIDI <br>
beatmod 15 wherever they occur. (Alternatively you can use
!&lt;(! and !&lt;)!.) Similarly the instructions
!diminuendo(! and !diminuendo)! are equivalent to %%MIDI
beatmod -15.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI deltaloudness n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n is a small positive
number. By default the crescendo and diminuendo instructions
modify the beat variables a, b, and c by 15 velocity units.
This instruction allows you <br>
to set this default to value n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI nobeataccents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For instruments such as church
organ that have no greatly emphasized beat notes, using this
will force use of the &rsquo;b&rsquo; velocity (see %%MIDI
beat) for every note irrespective of <br>
position in the bar. This allows dynamics (ff, f, etc) to be
used in the normal way.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI beataccents</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Revert to emphasizing notes the
the usual way. (default)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI beatstring &lt;string of
f, m and p&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This provides an alternative way
of specifying where the strong and weak stresses fall within
a bar. &rsquo;f&rsquo; means velocity a (normally strong),
&rsquo;m&rsquo; means velocity b (medium veloc&acirc; <br>
ity) and &rsquo;p&rsquo; means velocity c (soft velocity).
For example, if the time signature is 7/8 with stresses on
the first, fourth and sixth notes in the bar, we could use
the follow&acirc; <br>
ing</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI beatstring fppmpmp</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI transpose n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">transposes the output by the
specified number of semitones. n may be positive or
negative.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI rtranspose n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relative transpose by the
specified number of semitones. i.e. %%MIDI transpose a
followed by %%MIDI rtranspose b results in a transposition
of a+b. %%MIDI transpose b will <br>
result in a transposition of b semitones, regardless of any
previous transposition.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI c n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">specifies the MIDI pitch which
corresponds to c. The default is 60. This number should
normally be a multiple of 12.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI grace a/b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sets the fraction of the next
note that grace notes will take up. a must be between 1 and
b-1. The grace notes may not sound natural in this approach,
since the length of the <br>
individual grace notes vary with the complexity of the grace
and the length of the following note. A different approach
(which is now the default) assumes that the grace notes <br>
always have a fixed duration. To use the other approach you
would specify,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI gracedivider b</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where b specifies how many parts
to divide the unit length specified by the L: field command.
For example if b = 4 and L: = 1/8, then every grace note
would be 1/(8*4) or a 32nd <br>
note. Time would be stolen from the note to which the grace
notes are applied. If that note is not long enough to handle
the grace then the grace notes would be assigned 0
dura&acirc; <br>
tion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI chordname name n1 n2 n3
n4 n5 n6</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Defines how to play a guitar
chord called &quot;name&quot;. n1 is usually 0 and n2, n3 to
n6 give the pitches of the other notes in semitones relative
to the root note. There may be fewer <br>
than 6 notes in the chord, but not more.If &quot;name&quot;
is already defined, this command re-defines it. Unlike most
other commands, chordname definitions stay in effect from
where they <br>
are defined to the end of the abc file. The following
illustrates how m, 7, m7 and maj7 could be set up if they
were not already defined.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI chordname m 0 3 7 <br>
%%MIDI chordname 7 0 4 7 10 <br>
%%MIDI chordname m7 0 3 7 10 <br>
%%MIDI chordname maj7 0 4 7 11</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI gchord string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">sets up how guitar chords are
generated. The string is a sequence made of of z&rsquo;s,
c&rsquo;s f&rsquo;s and b&rsquo;s for rests, chords,
fundamental and fundamental plus chord notes respectively.
<br>
This specifies how each bar is to be played. An optional
length is allowed to follow the z&rsquo;s, c&rsquo;s
f&rsquo;s and b&rsquo;s e.g. czf2zf3. If the abc contains
guitar chords, then abc2midi <br>
automatically adds chords and fundamentals after
encountering the first guitar chord. It keeps using that
chord until a new chord is specified in the abc. Whenever
the M: field <br>
is encountered in the abc, an appropriate default string is
set :</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 2/4 or 4/4 time default is
equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzczfzcz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 3/4 time default is
equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzczcz</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 6/8 time default is
equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzcfzc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">For 9/8 time default is
equivalent to : %%MIDI gchord fzcfzcfzc</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The gchord command has been
extended to allow you to play the individual notes
comprising the guitar chord. This allows you to play broken
chords or arpeggios. The new codes <br>
g,h,i,j, G,H,I,J reference the individual notes starting
from the lowest note of the chord (not necessarily the root
in the case of inversions). For example for the C major <br>
chord, g refers to C, h refers to E and i refers to G. For a
gchord command such as,</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI gchord ghih</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Abc2midi will arpeggiate the C
major guitar chord to CEGE. The upper case letters G,H,I,
and J refer to the same notes except they are transposed
down one octave. Note for the <br>
first inversion of the C major chord (indicated by
&quot;C/E&quot;), E would be the lowest note so g would
reference the note E.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like other gchord codes, you may
append a numeral indicating the duration of the note. The
same rules apply as before. You can use any combination of
the gchord codes, (fcbghi&acirc; <br>
jGHIJz).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI chordprog n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the MIDI instrument for the
chords to be n. If the command includes the string octave=n
where n is a number between -2 and 2 inclusive, then this
will shift the pitch of the <br>
instrument by n octaves. For example %%MIDI chordprog 10
octave=1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI bassprog n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the MIDI instrument for the
bass notes to be n. If the command includes the string
octave=n where n is a number between -2 and 2 inclusive,
then this will shift the pitch of <br>
the instrument by n octaves. For example %%MIDI bassprog 10
octave=-1.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI chordvol n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the volume (velocity) of
the chord notes at n.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI bassvol n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the volume (velocity) of
the bass notes at n. There is no corresponding melodyvol
command since there are 3 velocity values for melody, set
using the beat command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI gchordon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns on guitar chords (they are
turned on by default at the start of a tune).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI gchordoff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns off guitar chords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI droneon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns on a continuous drone
(used in bagpipe music) consisting of two notes. By default
the notes are A, and A,, played on a bassoon at a velocity
of 80. This can be configured <br>
by the %%MIDI drone command described below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI droneoff</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Turns off the continuous
drone.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI drone n1 n2 n3 n4 n5</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sets the drone parameters where
n1 is the MIDI program, n2 and n3 specify the MIDI pitches
of the two notes in the chord, and n4 and n5 specify the
MIDI velocities of the two <br>
notes. If you do not set these parameters they are by
default 70 45 33 80 80. A value of zero or less indicates
that the setting of this parameter should be left as it
is.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI drum string [drum
programs] [drum velocities]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This sets up a drum pattern. The
string determines when there is a drum beat and the drum
program values determine what each drum strike sounds
like.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">e.g. %%MIDI drum d2zdd 35 38 38
100 50 50</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The string may contain
&rsquo;d&rsquo; for a drum strike or &rsquo;z&rsquo; for a
rest. By default a voice starts with no drum pattern and
&rsquo;%%MIDI drumon&rsquo; is needed to enable the
drumming. The drum pat&acirc; <br>
tern is repeated during each bar until &rsquo;%%MIDI
drumoff&rsquo; is encountered. The %%MIDI drum command may
be used within a tune to change the drum pattern. This
command places the <br>
drum sounds on channel 10 and assumes your tone generator
complies with the General Midi standard - if it does not,
then you may hear tones instead of drum sounds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In both the gchord and drum
commands, the standard note length of a single note f,c,z or
d is not set by the L: command. Instead it is adjusted so
that the entire gchord string <br>
or drum string fits exactly into one bar. In other words the
duration of each note is divided by the total duration of
the string. This means that, for example, the drum string
<br>
&quot;dd&quot; is equivalent to drum string
&quot;d4d4&quot;. You cannot currently specify fractions
directly (eg. C3/2) as done in the body of the music, but it
is still possible to express com&acirc; <br>
plex rhythms. For example, to indicate a rhythm such as
(3ddd d/d/d/d, you would write the string
&quot;d4d4d4d3d3d3d3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI drumbars n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The %%MIDI drum line can sound
quite monotonous if it is repeated each bar. To circumvent
this problem a new MIDI command %%MIDI drumbars n where n is
a small number will spread <br>
out the drum string over n consecutive bars. By default
drumbars is set to 1 maintaining compatibility with existing
abc files. You should take care that the drumstring is
evenly <br>
divisible between the drumbar bars. Also the time signature
should not change between bars in a drumbar unit. (Sample
abc file in doc/CHANGES June 24 2008.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI gchordbars n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command spreads the gchord
string over n consecutive bars just like drumbars (above).
(A sample is found in doc/CHANGES March 17 2009.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With version 1.54 Dec 4 2004 of
abc2midi, notes in chords (eg. [FAc]) are not played in the
same instant but offsetted and shortened by 10 MIDI time
units. Thus the first note in <br>
the chord (eg. F) is played for the full indicated time, the
second note (eg. A) starts 10 MIDI units later and is
shortened by the same amount and the third note starts
another <br>
10 MIDI units later and is shortened by another 10 units.
This introduces an &quot;expressivo&quot; option and avoids
the heavy attack. (This does not apply to gchords or
multivoiced <br>
chords.) The amount of the delay and shortening may be
configured by the MIDI command</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI chordattack n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n is a small number. If n
is zero, then abc2midi should behave as in earlier versions.
The delay n is in MIDI time units where there are 480 units
in a quarter note beat. <br>
The program may not run correctly if n is too large and
there are short chords.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI randomchordattack n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like above except that the delay
is a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and
n-1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI trim x/y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where x and y are two numbers.
This command controls the articulation of notes and chords
by placing silent gaps between the notes. The length of
these gaps is determined by x/y <br>
and the unit length specified by the L: command. These gaps
are produced by shortening the notes by the same amount. If
the note is already shorter than the specified gap, then
<br>
the gap is set to half the length of the note. The fraction
x/y indicates a note duration in the same manner as
specified in the abc file. The actual duration is based on
the <br>
unit length specified by the L: field command. It is
recommended that x/y be a fraction close to zero. Note
trimming is disabled inside slurs as specified by
parentheses. You can <br>
turn off all note trimming by setting x to 0, eg 0/1. By
default, note trimming is turned off at the beginning of a
tune or voice command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI expand x/y</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where x and y are two numbers
defining a fraction less than 1. This command controls the
articulation of notes and chords in the reverse manner. The
notes are lengthened by this <br>
fraction so they overlap the start of the next note.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI drummap note
midipitch</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Please see abcguide.txt.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI ptstress filename</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command loads file filename
into abc2midi which contains the Phil Taylor stress
parameters and puts abc2midi in the mode where it applies
these stress parameters on every <br>
note. This model runs in opposition to the standard beat
model, so the MIDI beat, beatstring, beatmod commands become
ineffectual. This also means that the dynamic indications
<br>
!f! !pp! etc. do not work any more.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There are two different
implementations of the stress model. Model 1 modifies the
note articulation and takes control of the MIDI trim
parameters too. To revert back to the <br>
standard model, put the command %%MIDI beataccents. Model 2
modifies both the onset and ending of each note allowing a
musical beat to expand or contract in time. However, the
<br>
length of a musical measure should be preserved. Note if you
using model 2, which the current default, you must include
-BF as one of the runtime parameters of abc2midi.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The model divides a bar into
equal segments. For each segment, a loudness or MIDI
velocity is specified and a duration multiplier is
specified. If a note falls into a specific <br>
segment, it assumes the velocity of that segment and its
duration is modified accordingly. If the note overlaps more
than one segment, then the note assumes the average of those
<br>
segment values.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The input file specifies the
number of segments and the loudness and duration multipliers
for each segment. The file has the following format. The
first value is the number of <br>
segments and each line specifies the velocity and duration
multiplier of the specific segment. The velocity is limited
to 127 and the duration is a decimal number. The note
dura&acirc; <br>
tions is modified by varying the gap between notes, so it is
not possible to extend a note. This preserves the regular
tempo of the music. The program scales, the note duration
<br>
indications by dividing it by the maximum value which here
is 1.4.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">%%MIDI stressmodel n</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where n is either 1 or 2,
selects the stress model implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">other %%MIDI commands such as
bendvelocity, bendstring, controlstring have been introduced
recently and are described in the file abcguide.txt.</p>
