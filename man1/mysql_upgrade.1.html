<p>MYSQL_UPGRADE(1) MySQL Database System
MYSQL_UPGRADE(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
mysql_upgrade - check tables for MySQL upgrade</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
mysql_upgrade [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
mysql_upgrade examines all tables in all databases for
incompatibilities with the current version of MySQL Server.
mysql_upgrade also upgrades the system tables so that you
can <br>
take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might
have been added.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysql_upgrade should be executed
each time you upgrade MySQL. It supersedes the older
mysql_fix_privilege_tables script, which should no longer be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a table is found to have a
possible incompatibility, mysql_upgrade performs a table
check. If any problems are found, a table repair is
attempted. If the table cannot be <br>
repaired, see Section 2.4.4, &acirc;Rebuilding or Repairing
Tables or Indexes&acirc; for manual table repair
strategies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Note <br>
On Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, you must run
mysql_upgrade with administrator privileges. You can do this
by running a Command Prompt as Administrator and running
<br>
the command. Failure to do so may result in the upgrade
failing to execute correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Caution <br>
You should always back up your current MySQL installation
before performing an upgrade. See Section 6.2,
&acirc;Database Backup Methods&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Some upgrade incompatibilities
may require special handling before you upgrade your MySQL
installation and run mysql_upgrade. See Section 2.4.1,
&acirc;Upgrading MySQL&acirc;, for <br>
instructions on determining whether any such
incompatibilities apply to your installation and how to
handle them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To use mysql_upgrade, make sure
that the server is running, and then invoke it like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">shell&gt; mysql_upgrade
[options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">After running mysql_upgrade,
stop the server and restart it so that any changes made to
the system tables take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysql_upgrade executes the
following commands to check and repair tables and to upgrade
the system tables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysqlcheck --all-databases
--check-upgrade --auto-repair <br>
mysql &lt; fix_priv_tables <br>
mysqlcheck --all-databases --check-upgrade --fix-db-names
--fix-table-names</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notes about the preceding
commands:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Because
mysql_upgrade invokes mysqlcheck with the --all-databases
option, it processes all tables in all databases, which
might take a long time to complete. Each table is <br>
locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions while it
is being processed. Check and repair operations can be
time-consuming, particularly for large tables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; For details
about what checks the --check-upgrade option entails, see
the description of the FOR UPGRADE option of the CHECK TABLE
statement (see Section 12.4.2.3, &acirc;CHECK <br>
TABLE Syntax&acirc;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; fix_priv_tables
represents a script generated internally by mysql_upgrade
that contains SQL statements to upgrade the tables in the
mysql database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; Prior to MySQL
5.1.31, mysql_upgrade does not run the second mysqlcheck
command, which is necessary to re-encode database or table
names that contain nonalphanumeric <br>
characters. (They still appear after the upgrade with the
#mysql50# prefix described in Section 8.2.3, &acirc;Mapping
of Identifiers to File Names&acirc;.) If you have such
database or <br>
table names, execute the second mysqlcheck command manually
after executing mysql_upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All checked and repaired tables
are marked with the current MySQL version number. This
ensures that next time you run mysql_upgrade with the same
version of the server, it can <br>
tell whether there is any need to check or repair the table
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysql_upgrade also saves the
MySQL version number in a file named mysql_upgrade_info in
the data directory. This is used to quickly check whether
all tables have been checked for <br>
this release so that table-checking can be skipped. To
ignore this file and perform the check regardless, use the
--force option.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you install MySQL from RPM
packages on Linux, you must install the server and client
RPMs. mysql_upgrade is included in the server RPM but
requires the client RPM because the <br>
latter includes mysqlcheck. (See Section 2.6.1,
&acirc;Installing MySQL from RPM Packages on
Linux&acirc;.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In MySQL 5.1.7, mysql_upgrade
was added as a shell script and worked only for Unix
systems. As of MySQL 5.1.10, mysql_upgrade is an executable
binary and is available on all <br>
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mysql_upgrade supports the
following options, which can be specified on the command
line or in the [mysql_upgrade] and [client] option file
groups. Other options are passed to <br>
mysqlcheck. For example, it might be necessary to specify
the --password[=password] option. mysql_upgrade also
supports the options for processing option files described
at <br>
Section 4.2.3.3.1, &acirc;Command-Line Options that Affect
Option-File Handling&acirc;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --help</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Display a short help message and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
--basedir=path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path to the MySQL
installation directory. This option is accepted for backward
compatibility but ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
--datadir=path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path to the data directory.
This option is accepted for backward compatibility but
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
--debug-check</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print some debugging information
when the program exits. This option was added in MySQL
5.1.21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --debug-info,
-T</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Print debugging information and
memory and CPU usage statistics when the program exits. This
option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --force</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Ignore the mysql_upgrade_info
file and force execution of mysqlcheck even if mysql_upgrade
has already been executed for the current version of
MySQL.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --tmpdir=path,
-t path</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The path name of the directory
to use for creating temporary files. This option was added
in MySQL 5.1.25.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
--user=user_name, -u user_name</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The MySQL user name to use when
connecting to the server. The default user name is root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot; --verbose</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Verbose mode. Print more
information about what the program does.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&Acirc;&middot;
--write-binlog</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Cause binary logging to be
enabled while mysql_upgrade runs. This is the default
behavior; to disable binary logging during the upgrade, use
the inverse of this option (that <br>
is, start the program with --skip-write-binlog).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option was introduced in
MySQL 5.1.40.</p>
