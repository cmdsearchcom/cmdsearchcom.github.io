<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
balance 3.54 - A simple TCP proxy with load balancing and
failover mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
balance [ -b addr ] [ -B addr ] [ -t sec ] [ -T sec ] [
-adfpHM6 ] port host1[:port1[:maxc]] [!|%] [ ...
hostn[:portn[:maxc]]]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">balance [ -b addr ] -i [ -d ] [
-M ] port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">balance [ -b addr ] -c cmd [ -d
] [ -M ] port</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Balance is a simple, generic &quot;userland&quot; TCP proxy,
which allows simple round-robin load balancing and graceful
failover between several destination servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Balance supports IPv6 on the
listening side which makes it a very useful tool for IPv6
migration of IPv4 only services and servers.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Balance is available at
http://balance.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Definitions: A possible
destination consisting of a host address and a port is
called a &quot;channel&quot;. A channel is member of a
&quot;channel group&quot;. Channels are numbered in a group
<br>
starting with 0. Groups are numbered starting with 0, which
is the initial default group.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Balance accepts connections on
the given port and forwards them to the supplied channels.
At least one channel (in the default group) must be
specified. If there are two or <br>
more channels specified in a group balance performs a simple
round-robin load balancing between the channels.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Balance allows the definition of
further channel groups. The connection scheme works as
follows: balance tries first to establish a connection to a
channel in the first group <br>
(0), performing the standard round-robin load balancing
scheme. If no channel in this group is available, balance
proceeds with the next higher channel group. Groups are
simply <br>
separated with a &quot;!&quot; at the command line at
startup and can be controlled interactively with the
&quot;group&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;%&quot; instead of a
&quot;!&quot; as a group separator declares the previous
group to be of type &quot;hash&quot;. This means that
instead of a round-robin algorithm, a hash distribution
based on <br>
the client ip address is used to determine the destination
channel. This allows connecting one client always to the
same server (e.g. balancing http sessions to a single
server).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hosts may be specified either by
hostname or by IP address. Ports may be specified either by
name (as listed in /etc/services) or numerically. If no port
is specified in a des&acirc; <br>
tination, the destination port defaults to the source port
that balance controls.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Balance allows the specification
of the maximum number of connections per channel. This
parameter can be optionally added after the port
specification separated by a colon (&quot;:&quot;). <br>
If a maximum number of connections is specified a channel
will only be used for this maximum number of simultaneous
connections. A maxc value of 0 denotes an unlimited number
of <br>
connections. This is the initial default value of a
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The maximum number of groups and
channels balance can handle is specified at compile time and
is initially 16 channels in 16 groups.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Failover to another destination
(a &quot;channel&quot;) occurs if the connection is refused
on the current channel or if the connect timeout is reached
trying to establish a connection. If <br>
all possible destinations (channels) currently fail, the
client connection to balance is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Balance accepts the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">6 Forces to bind on IPv6 socket
by setting hints.ai_family to AF_INET6.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">a Enable autodisable option: A
channel needs to be manually re-enabled after a failure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">b Bindhost: Balance binds to the
specified host (or address) for listen() instead to
INADDR_ANY.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">B Bindhost: Balance binds to the
specified host (or address) for outgoing connections (the
connection will be initiated from this address).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">c Command: allows to send a
command to the balance master process (see interactive
mode)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">d Debug: Balance outputs
debugging and tracing information messages on stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">H Hashfailover: Balance does
failover to next node even if hash is used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">F Foreground: tells balance to
stay in foreground. This might be useful for testing and
debugging since balance can be stopped in that mode using ^C
(or other interrupt <br>
character).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">M Use memory mapping for IPC
instead of shared memory</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">i Interactive Control: Balance
connects to the running instance defined by local port and
bind address via shared memory and allows to control the
behaviour of it using a <br>
command line interface. The access permission using this
interface are determined by the access restrictions of the
shared memory segment in effect. help or ? prints out <br>
a short command overview, assign allows to change the
host_port assignment of a channel (only if disabled), create
allows to establish a new destination definition
(chan&acirc; <br>
nel) consisting of host and port in the current group,
disable disables a channel in the current group, enable
enables a channel again in the current group, group changes
<br>
the current group in interactive mode where all following
commands are targeted, hash changes the current group to be
of type &quot;Hash&quot;, help prints out online help
informa&acirc; <br>
tions, kill shuts down the master process and exits
interactive mode, maxc &lt;channel&gt; &lt;maxc&gt; sets the
maximum number of connection ot the channel (0 means
infinite), mrtg- <br>
bytes &lt;group&gt; &lt;channel&gt; prints out the bytes
received/sent in MRTG compatible format (intended to be
called with -c automatically by MRTG), mrtg-conns
&lt;group&gt; &lt;channel&gt; <br>
prints out the total connections in MRTG compatible format
(intended to be called with -c automatically by MRTG), quit
exits the interactive mode, reset resets the byte <br>
counters of a channel, rr changes the current group to be of
type &quot;Round Robin&quot;, show shows an overview and the
status of all channels including the incoming and outgoing
<br>
transfer volume in bytes. The output is sorted by groups.
Additionally the current connections (c) and the maximum
allowed connections (maxc) are printed, version prints <br>
out the version and MAXGROUPS and MAXCHANNELS constants at
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">p Packetdump: Balance shows all
incoming and outgoing data on stdout using a simple always
readable external representation of data. This might be
useful for debugging and <br>
protocol analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">t Connect Timeout: the default
timeout trying to establish a connection to any destination
can be changed using this option. The default timeout after
which a destination is <br>
regarded to be currently inaccessible is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">T Select Timeout: Timeout for
select(), default = 0 (never). This feature is currently
untested.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
$ balance smtp host1.test.net host2.test.net <br>
Connection to the local SMTP port will be forwarded
alterating to the SMTP port on host1 and host2. Balance runs
automatically in background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance -b 2001:DB8::1 80
10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 <br>
Balance binds on port 80 of the local IPv6 IP address
2001:DB8::1 and distributes connections to the IPv4
addresses 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance -b ::ffff:10.1.1.3 80
10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 <br>
Balance binds on port 80 of the local IPv4 IP address
10.1.1.3 (provided in IPv6 notation) and distributes
connections to the IPv4 addresses 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance -fp imap mailserver
<br>
Connections to the local IMAP port will always be forwarded
to the host &quot;mailserver&quot;. Balance stays in
foreground and all data is printed in readable format on
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance -f 8888 host1
10.1.1.1:8000 <br>
Connections to the local port 8888 are forwarded alternating
to host1, port 8888 and the host 10.1.1.1, port 8000.
Balance stays in foreground connected to the
&quot;control&acirc; <br>
ling tty&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance imap mailserver1::16 !
mailserver2 <br>
Two groups are specified, each containing one channel
member. First up to 16 simultaneous connections are
forwarded to &quot;mailserver1&quot;. As soon as they are
consumed, balance <br>
proceeds with the next group (1) which will consume all
remaining connections forwarding them to the imap ort on
&quot;mailserver2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance pop3 host1 host2 host3
! failover1 <br>
Balance does round robin load balancing for the three hosts
in the default group 0 for pop3 services. If all three hosts
in group 0 fail, all connections are then for&acirc; <br>
warded to the host &quot;failover1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance telnet
target.munich.net::1 <br>
Here balance is used to restrict all connections to exactly
one at a time forwarding the telnet port.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ balance 8888 localhost::12 !
localhost::4 ! localhost::2 localhost::2 ! localhost:25 <br>
This is a simple test, forming 5 groups where balance is
self referencing its own services 20 times. This is simply a
test which definitely can be tried at home.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
In case that balance is not able to forward the connection
to any destination the inital connection to balance is
always first accepted and then closed again immediately.
This is <br>
not in every case the behaviour that would have been seen
directly on the destination host.</p>
