<i>Balance</i> is a simple, generic &quot;userland&quot; TCP proxy, which allows
  simple round-robin load balancing and graceful failover between several
  destination servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Balance</i> supports IPv6 on the listening side which makes it a very useful
  tool for IPv6 migration of IPv4 only services and servers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Balance</i> is available at http://balance.sourceforge.net.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Definitions:</i> A possible destination consisting of a host address and a
  port is called a &quot;channel&quot;. A channel is member of a &quot;channel
  group&quot;. Channels are numbered in a group starting with 0. Groups are
  numbered starting with 0, which is the initial default group.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Balance</i> accepts connections on the given port and forwards them to the
  supplied channels. At least one channel (in the default group) must be
  specified. If there are two or more channels specified in a group
  <i>balance</i> performs a simple round-robin load balancing between the
  channels.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Balance</i> allows the definition of further channel groups. The connection
  scheme works as follows: <i>balance</i> tries first to establish a connection
  to a channel in the first group (0), performing the standard round-robin load
  balancing scheme. If no channel in this group is available, <i>balance</i>
  proceeds with the next higher channel group. Groups are simply separated with
  a &quot;!&quot; at the command line at startup and can be controlled
  interactively with the &quot;group&quot; command.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A &quot;%&quot; instead of a &quot;!&quot; as a group separator declares the
  previous group to be of type &quot;hash&quot;. This means that instead of a
  round-robin algorithm, a hash distribution based on the client ip address is
  used to determine the destination channel. This allows connecting one client
  always to the same server (e.g. balancing http sessions to a single server).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Hosts may be specified either by hostname or by IP address. Ports may be
  specified either by name (as listed in /etc/services) or numerically. If no
  port is specified in a destination, the destination port defaults to the
  source port that <i>balance</i> controls.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<i>Balance</i> allows the specification of the maximum number of connections per
  channel. This parameter can be optionally added after the port specification
  separated by a colon (&quot;:&quot;). If a maximum number of connections is
  specified a channel will only be used for this maximum number of simultaneous
  connections. A maxc value of 0 denotes an unlimited number of connections.
  This is the initial default value of a channel.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The maximum number of groups and channels <i>balance</i> can handle is specified
  at compile time and is initially 16 channels in 16 groups.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Failover to another destination (a &quot;channel&quot;) occurs if the connection
  is refused on the current channel or if the connect timeout is reached trying
  to establish a connection. If all possible destinations (channels) currently
  fail, the client connection to balance is closed.
<div class="Pp"></div>

In case that <i>balance</i> is not able to forward the connection to any
  destination the inital connection to balance is always first accepted and then
  closed again immediately. This is not in every case the behaviour that would
  have been seen directly on the destination host.
