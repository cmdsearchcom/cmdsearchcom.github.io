<p>GPGDIR(1) General Commands Manual GPGDIR(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
gpgdir - recursive directory encryption with GnuPG</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
gpgdir -e|-d &lt;directory&gt; [options]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
gpgdir is a perl script that uses the CPAN GnuPG::Interface
perl module to recursively encrypt and decrypt directories
using gpg. gpgdir recursively descends through a directory
<br>
in order to make sure it encrypts or decrypts every file in
a directory and all of its subdirectories. By default the
mtime and atime values of all files will be preserved upon
<br>
encryption and decryption (this can be disabled with the
--no-preserve-times option). Note that in --encrypt mode,
gpgdir will delete the original files that it successfully
<br>
encrypts (unless the --no-delete option is given). However,
upon startup gpgdir first asks for a the decryption password
to be sure that a dummy file can successfully be <br>
encrypted and decrypted. The initial test can be disabled
with the --skip-test option so that a directory can easily
be encrypted without having to also specify a password (this
<br>
is consistent with gpg behavior). Also, note that gpgdir is
careful not encrypt hidden files and directories. After all,
you probably don&rsquo;t want your ~/.gnupg directory or
<br>
~/.bashrc file to be encrypted. The key gpgdir uses to
encrypt/decrypt a directory is specified in ~/.gpgdirrc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Finally, gpgdir can use the wipe
program with the --Wipe command line option to securely
delete the original unencrypted files after they have been
successfully encrypted. This <br>
elevates the security stance of gpgdir since it is more
difficult to recover the unencrypted data associated with
files from the filesystem after they are encrypted (unlink()
<br>
does not erase data blocks even though a file is
removed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">OPTIONS <br>
-e, --encrypt &lt;directory&gt; <br>
Recursively encrypt all files in the directory specified on
the command line. All original files will be deleted (a
password check is performed first to make sure that <br>
the correct password to unlock the private GnuPG key is
known to the user).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d, --decrypt &lt;directory&gt;
<br>
Recursively decrypt all files in the directory specified on
the command line. The encrypted .gpg version of each file
will be deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--sign &lt;directory&gt; <br>
Recursively sign all files in the directory specified on the
command line. For each file, a detached .asc signature will
be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--verify &lt;directory&gt; <br>
Recursively verify all .asc signatures for files in the
directory specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g, --gnupg-dir
&lt;directory&gt; <br>
Specify which .gnupg directory will be used to find GnuPG
keys. The default is ~/.gnupg if this option is not used.
This option allows gpgdir to be run as one user but <br>
use the keys of another user (assuming permissions are setup
correctly, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p, --pw-file &lt;pw-file&gt;
<br>
Read decryption password from pw-file instead of typing it
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t, --test-mode <br>
Run an encryption and decryption test against a dummy file
and exit. This test is always run by default in both
--encrypt and --decrypt mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-S, --Symmetric <br>
Instruct gpgdir to encrypt to decrypt files using a
symmetric cipher supported by GnuPG (CAST5 is commonly
used). This results in a significant speed up for the
encryp&acirc; <br>
tion/decryption process.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-T, --Trial-run <br>
Show what encrypt/decrypt actions would take place without
actually doing them. The filesystem is not changed in any
way in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-I, --Interactive <br>
Prompt the user before actually encrypting or decrypting
each file. This is useful to have fine-grained control over
gpgdir operations as it recurses through a directory <br>
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-F, --Force <br>
Tell gpgdir to ignore non-fatal error conditions, such as
the inability to encrypt or decrypt individual files because
of permissions errors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Exclude &lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Instruct gpgdir to skip all files that match pattern as a
regex match against each filename. This is similar to the
--exclude option in the standard GNU tar command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Exclude-from &lt;file&gt; <br>
Instruct gpgdir to exclude all files matched by patterns
listed in file. This is similar to the --exclude-from the
GNU tar command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Include &lt;pattern&gt; <br>
Instruct gpgdir to only include files that match pattern as
a regex match against each filename.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--Include-from &lt;file&gt; <br>
Instruct gpgdir to only include files matched by patterns
listed in file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W, --Wipe <br>
Use the wipe program to securely delete files after they
have been successfully encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-O, --Obfuscate-filename <br>
Tell gpgdir to obfuscate the file names of files that it
encrypts (in -e mode). The names of each file are stored
within the file .gpgdir_map_file for every sub-direc&acirc;
<br>
tory, and this file is itself encrypted. In decryption mode
(-d), the -O argument reverses the process so that the
original files are restored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overwrite-encrypted <br>
Overwrite encrypted files even if a previous
&lt;file&gt;.gpg file already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--overwrite-decrypted <br>
Overwrite decrypted files even if the previous unencrypted
file already exists.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-K, --Key-id &lt;id&gt; <br>
Manually specify a GnuPG key ID from the command line.
Because GnuPG supports matching keys with a string, id does
not strictly have to be a key ID; it can be a string <br>
that uniquely matches a key in the GnuPG key ring.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-D, --Default-key <br>
Use the key that GnuPG defines as the default, i.e. the key
that is specified by the default-key variable in
~/.gnupg/options. If the default-key variable is not defined
<br>
within ~/.gnupg/options, then GnuPG tries to use the first
suitable key on its key ring (the initial encrypt/decrypt
test makes sure that the user knows the corresponding <br>
password for the key).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a, --agent <br>
Instruct gpgdir to acquire gpg key password from a running
gpg-agent instance.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-A, --Agent-info &lt;connection
info&gt; <br>
Specify the value of the GPG_AGENT_INFO environment variable
as returned by the gpg-agent --daemon command. If the gpgdir
--agent command line argument is used instead of <br>
--Agent-info, then gpgdir assumes that the GPG_AGENT_INFO
environment variable has already been set in the current
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s, --skip-test <br>
Skip encryption and decryption test. This will allow gpgdir
to be used to encrypt a directory without specifying a
password (which normally gets used in encryption mode <br>
to test to make sure decryption against a dummy file works
properly).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q, --quiet <br>
Print as little as possible to the screen when encrypting or
decrypting a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-recurse <br>
Instruct gpgdir to not recurse through any subdirectories of
the directory that is being encrypted or decrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-password <br>
Instruct gpgdir to not ask the user for a password. This is
only useful when a gpg key literally has no associated
password (this is not common).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-delete <br>
Instruct gpgdir to not delete original files at encrypt
time.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-preservetimes <br>
Instruct gpgdir to not preserve original file mtime and
atime values upon encryption or decryption.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-l, --locale &lt;locale&gt; <br>
Provide a locale setting other than the default
&quot;C&quot; locale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">--no-locale <br>
Do not set the locale at all so that the default system
locale will apply.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v, --verbose <br>
Run in verbose mode.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-V, --Version <br>
Print version number and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h, --help <br>
Print usage information and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
~/.gpgdirrc <br>
Contains the key id of the user gpg key that will be used to
encrypt or decrypt the files within a directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT <br>
HOME Set the default home directory.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUPGBIN Set the gpg binary.
Default: &quot;gpg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">GNUPGHOME Set the default
working directory for gpg. Default:
&quot;~/.gnupg&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">EXAMPLES <br>
The following examples illustrate the command line arguments
that could be supplied to gpgdir in a few situations:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -e /some/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory, and use
the wipe command to securely delete the original unencrypted
files:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -W -e /some/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory with the
default GnuPG key defined in ~/.gnupg/options:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -e /some/dir
--Default-key</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To decrypt a directory with a
key specified in ~/.gpgdirrc:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -d /some/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory but skip
all filenames that contain the string &quot;host&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -e /some/dir --Exclude
host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory but only
encrypt those files that contain the string
&quot;passwd&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -e /some/dir --Include
passwd</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To acquire the GnuPG key
password from a running gpg-agent daemon in order to decrypt
a directory (this requires that gpg-agent has the
password):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -A
/tmp/gpg-H4DBhc/S.gpg-agent:7046:1 -d /some/dir</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory but skip
the encryption/decryption test (so you will not be prompted
for a decryption password):</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -e /some/dir -s</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt a directory and no
subdirectories:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$ gpgdir -e /some/dir
--no-recurse</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To encrypt root&rsquo;s home
directory, but use the GnuPG keys associated with the user
&quot;bob&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># gpgdir -e /root -g
/home/bob/.gnupg</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEPENDENCIES <br>
gpgdir requires that gpg, the Gnu Privacy Guard
(http://www.gnupg.org) is installed. gpgdir also requires
the GnuPG::Interface perl module from CPAN, but it is
bundled with <br>
gpgdir and is installed in /usr/lib/gpgdir at install-time
so it does not pollute the system perl library tree.</p>
