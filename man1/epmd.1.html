<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
epmd - Erlang Port Mapper Daemon</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
epmd [-d|-debug] [DbgExtra...] [-address Addresses] [-port
No] [-daemon] [-relaxed_command_check]: <br>
Starts the port mapper daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">epmd [-d|-debug] [-port No]
[-names|-kill|-stop Name]: <br>
Communicates with a running port mapper daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This daemon acts as a name
server on all hosts involved in distributed Erlang
computations. When an Erlang node starts, the node has a
name and it obtains an address from the <br>
host OS kernel. The name and address are sent to the epmd
daemon running on the local host. In a TCP/IP environment,
the address consists of the IP address and a port number.
The <br>
node name is an atom on the form of Name@Node. The job of
the epmd daemon is to keep track of which node name listens
on which address. Hence, epmd maps symbolic node names to
<br>
machine addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The TCP/IP epmd daemon only
keeps track of the Name (first) part of an Erlang node name.
The Host part (whatever is after the @) is implicit in the
node name where the epmd dae&acirc; <br>
mon was contacted, as is the IP address where the Erlang
node can be reached. Consistent and correct TCP naming
services are therefore required for an Erlang network to
function <br>
correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting the port mapper daemon:
<br>
The daemon is started automatically by command erl(1) if the
node is to be distributed and no running instance is
present. If automatically launched environment variables
<br>
must be used to change the behavior of the daemon; see
section Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If argument -daemon is not
specified, epmd runs as a normal program with the
controlling terminal of the shell in which it is started.
Normally, it is to be run as a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular startup options are
described in section Regular Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The DbgExtra options are
described in section DbgExtra Options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Communicating with a running
port mapper daemon: <br>
Communicating with the running epmd daemon by the epmd
program is done primarily for debugging purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The different queries are
described in section Interactive options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">REGULAR OPTIONS <br>
These options are available when starting the name server.
The name server is normally started automatically by command
erl(1) (if not already available), but it can also be <br>
started at system startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-address List: <br>
Lets this instance of epmd listen only on the
comma-separated list of IP addresses and on the loopback
address (which is implicitly added to the list if it has not
been spec&acirc; <br>
ified). This can also be set using environment variable
ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS; see section Environment Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-port No: <br>
Lets this instance of epmd listen to another TCP port than
default 4369. This can also be set using environment
variable ERL_EPMD_PORT; see section Environment
Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d | -debug: <br>
Enables debug output. The more -d flags specified, the more
debug output you will get (to a certain limit). This option
is most useful when the epmd daemon is not started as <br>
a daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-daemon: <br>
Starts epmd detached from the controlling terminal. Logging
ends up in syslog when available and correctly configured.
If the epmd daemon is started at boot, this option is <br>
definitely to be used. It is also used when command erl
automatically starts epmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-relaxed_command_check: <br>
Starts the epmd program with relaxed command checking
(mostly for backward compatibility). This affects the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* With relaxed command checking,
the epmd daemon can be killed from the local host with, for
example, command epmd -kill even if active nodes are
registered. Normally only <br>
daemons with an empty node database can be killed with epmd
-kill.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Command epmd -stop (and the
corresponding messages to epmd, as can be specified using
erl_interface:ei(3erl)) is normally always ignored. This
because it can cause a <br>
strange situation where two nodes of the same name can be
alive at the same time. A node unregisters itself by only
closing the connection to epmd, which is why command <br>
stop was only intended for use in debugging situations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">With relaxed command checking
enabled, you can forcibly unregister live nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Relaxed command checking can
also be enabled by setting environment variable
ERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK before starting epmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use relaxed command checking
only on systems with very limited interactive usage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DBGEXTRA OPTIONS <br>
Note: <br>
These options are only for debugging and testing epmd
clients. They are not to be used in normal operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-packet_timeout Seconds: <br>
Sets the number of seconds a connection can be inactive
before epmd times out and closes the connection. Defaults to
60.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delay_accept Seconds: <br>
To simulate a busy server, you can insert a delay between
when epmd gets notified that a new connection is requested
and when the connection gets accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-delay_write Seconds: <br>
Also a simulation of a busy server. Inserts a delay before a
reply is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">INTERACTIVE OPTIONS <br>
These options make epmd run as an interactive command,
displaying the results of sending queries to an already
running instance of epmd. The epmd contacted is always on
the local <br>
node, but option -port can be used to select between
instances if several are running using different ports on
the host.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-port No: <br>
Contacts the epmd listening on the specified TCP port number
(default 4369). This can also be set using environment
variable ERL_EPMD_PORT; see section Environment
Variables.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-names: <br>
Lists names registered with the currently running epmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-kill: <br>
Kills the currently running epmd.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Killing the running epmd is only
allowed if epmd -names shows an empty database or if
-relaxed_command_check was specified when the running
instance of epmd was started.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that
-relaxed_command_check is specified when starting the daemon
that is to accept killing when it has live nodes registered.
When running epmd interactively, <br>
-relaxed_command_check has no effect. A daemon that is
started without relaxed command checking must be killed
using, for example, signals or some other OS-specific method
if <br>
it has active clients registered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-stop Name: <br>
Forcibly unregisters a live node from the epmd database.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This command can only be used
when contacting epmd instances started with flag
-relaxed_command_check.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Notice that relaxed command
checking must enabled for the epmd daemon contacted. When
running epmd interactively, -relaxed_command_check has no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES <br>
ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS: <br>
Can be set to a comma-separated list of IP addresses, in
which case the epmd daemon will listen only on the specified
address(es) and on the loopback address (which is <br>
implicitly added to the list if it has not been specified).
The default behavior is to listen on all available IP
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERL_EPMD_PORT: <br>
Can contain the port number epmd will use. The default port
will work fine in most cases. A different port can be
specified to allow several instances of epmd, representing
<br>
independent clusters of nodes, to co-exist on the same host.
All nodes in a cluster must use the same epmd port
number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK:
<br>
If set before start, the epmd daemon behaves as if option
-relaxed_command_check was specified at startup.
Consequently, if this option is set before starting the
Erlang vir&acirc; <br>
tual machine, the automatically started epmd accepts the
-kill and -stop commands without restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LOGGING <br>
On some operating systems syslog will be used for error
reporting when epmd runs as a daemon. To enable the error
logging, you must edit the /etc/syslog.conf file and add an
<br>
entry:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">!epmd <br>
*.*&lt;TABs&gt;/var/log/epmd.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">where &lt;TABs&gt; are at least
one real tab character. Spaces are silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">ACCESS RESTRICTIONS <br>
The epmd daemon accepts messages from both the local host
and remote hosts. However, only the query commands are
answered (and acted upon) if the query comes from a remote
host. <br>
It is always an error to try to register a node name if the
client is not a process on the same host as the epmd
instance is running on. Such requests are considered hostile
and <br>
the connection is closed immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following queries are
accepted from remote nodes:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Port queries, that is, on
which port the node with a specified name listens</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* Name listing, that is, gives a
list of all names registered on the host</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">To restrict access further,
firewall software must be used.</p>
