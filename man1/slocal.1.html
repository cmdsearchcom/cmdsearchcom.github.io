<p>SLOCAL(1) General Commands Manual SLOCAL(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">NAME <br>
slocal - asynchronously filter and deliver new mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">SYNOPSIS <br>
/usr/libexec/nmh/slocal [-addr address] [-info data]
[-sender sender] [-user username] [-mailbox mbox] [-file
file] [-maildelivery deliveryfile] [-verbose | -noverbose]
[-sup&acirc; <br>
pressdup | -nosuppressdup] [-debug] [-version] [-help]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DESCRIPTION <br>
Slocal is a program designed to allow you to have your
inbound mail processed according to a complex set of
selection criteria. You do not normally invoke slocal
yourself, <br>
rather slocal is invoked on your behalf by your
system&rsquo;s Message Transfer Agent (such as sendmail)
when the message arrives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message selection criteria
used by slocal is specified in the file
&acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; in the user&rsquo;s home
directory. You can specify an alternate file with the
-maildelivery <br>
file option. The syntax of this file is specified below.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message delivery address and
message sender are determined from the Message Transfer
Agent envelope information, if possible. Under sendmail, the
sender will obtained from <br>
the UUCP &acirc;From:&acirc; line, if present. The user may
override these values with the -addr and -sender
switches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The message is normally read
from the standard input. The -file switch sets the name of
the file from which the message should be read, instead of
reading stdin. This is useful <br>
when debugging a &acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -user switch tells slocal
the name of the user for whom it is delivering mail. The
-mailbox switch tells slocal the name of the user&rsquo;s
maildrop file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">slocal is able to detect and
suppress duplicate messages. To enable this, use the option
-suppressdup. slocal will keep a database containing the
Message-ID&rsquo;s of incoming mes&acirc; <br>
sages, in order to detect duplicates. Depending on your
configuration, this database will be in either ndbm or
Berkeley db format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -info switch may be used to
pass an arbitrary argument to sub-processes which slocal may
invoke on your behalf.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The -verbose switch causes
slocal to give information on stdout about its progress. The
-debug switch produces more verbose debugging output on
stderr. These flags are useful <br>
when creating and debugging your &acirc;.maildelivery&acirc;
file, as they allow you to see the decisions and actions
that slocal is taking, as well as check for syntax errors in
your <br>
&acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Message Transfer Agents <br>
Most modern MTAs including sendmail, postfix and exim
support a .forward file for directing incoming mail. You
should include the line</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&acirc;| /usr/libexec/nmh/slocal
-user username&acirc;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">in your .forward file in your
home directory. This will cause your MTA to invoke slocal on
your behalf when a message arrives.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Maildelivery File <br>
The &acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file controls how slocal
filters and delivers incoming mail. Each line of this file
consists of five fields, separated by whitespace or comma.
Since double- <br>
quotes are honored, these characters may be included in a
single argument by enclosing the entire argument in
double-quotes. A double-quote can be included by preceding
it with <br>
a backslash. Lines beginning with &lsquo;#&rsquo; and blank
lines are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The format of each line in the
&acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header pattern action result
string</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">header: <br>
The name of a header field (such as To, Cc, or From) that is
to be searched for a pattern. This is any field in the
headers of the message that might be present.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The following special fields are
also defined:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">source the out-of-band sender
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">addr the address that was used
to cause delivery to the recipient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">default this matches only if the
message hasn&rsquo;t been delivered yet</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">* this always matches</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pattern: <br>
The sequence of characters to match in the specified header
field. Matching is case-insensitive, but does not use
regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">action: <br>
The action to take to deliver the message. When a message is
delivered, a &acirc;Delivery-Date: date&acirc; header is
added which indicates the date and time that message was
deliv&acirc; <br>
ered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">destroy <br>
This action always succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">file, mbox, or &gt; <br>
Append the message to the file named by string. The message
is appended to the file in mbox (uucp) format. This is the
format used by most other mail clients (such as <br>
mailx, elm). If the message can be appended to the file,
then this action succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">mmdf <br>
Identical to file, but always appends the message using the
MMDF mailbox format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">pipe or | <br>
Pipe the message as the standard input to the command named
by string, using the Bourne shell sh to interpret the
string. Prior to giving the string to the shell, it is <br>
expanded with the following built-in variables:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(sender) the out-of-band sender
information</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(address) the address that was
used to cause delivery to the recipient</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(size) the size of the message
in bytes</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(reply-to) either the
&acirc;Reply-To:&acirc; or &acirc;From:&acirc; field of the
message</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">$(info) the out-of-band
information specified</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">qpipe or ^ <br>
Similar to pipe, but executes the command directly, after
built-in variable expansion, without assistance from the
shell. This action can be used to avoid quoting spe&acirc;
<br>
cial characters which your shell might interpret.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">folder or + <br>
Store the message in the nmh folder named by string.
Currently this is handled by piping the message to the nmh
program rcvstore, although this may change in the <br>
future.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">result: <br>
Indicates how the action should be performed:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A Perform the action. If the
action succeeds, then the message is considered
delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">R Perform the action. Regardless
of the outcome of the action, the message is not considered
delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">? Perform the action only if the
message has not been delivered. If the action succeeds, then
the message is considered delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">N Perform the action only if the
message has not been delivered and the previous action
succeeded. If this action succeeds, then the message is
considered delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The delivery file is always read
completely, so that several matches can be made and several
actions can be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Security of Delivery Files <br>
In order to prevent security problems, the
&acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file must be owned either by the
user or by root, and must be writable only by the owner. If
this is not the case, the <br>
file is not read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the
&acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file cannot be found, or does
not perform an action which delivers the message, then
slocal will check for a global delivery file at
/etc/nmh/maildelivery. <br>
This file is read according to the same rules. This file
must be owned by root and must be writable only by root.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a global delivery file cannot
be found or does not perform an action which delivers the
message, then standard delivery to the user&rsquo;s maildrop
is performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Example Delivery File <br>
To summarize, here&rsquo;s an example delivery file:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># <br>
# .maildelivery file for nmh&rsquo;s slocal <br>
# <br>
# Blank lines and lines beginning with a &rsquo;#&rsquo; are
ignored <br>
# <br>
# FIELD PATTERN ACTION RESULT STRING <br>
#</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># File mail with foobar in the
&acirc;To:&acirc; line into file foobar.log <br>
To foobar file A foobar.log</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Pipe messages from coleman to
the program message-archive <br>
From coleman pipe A /bin/message-archive</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Anything to the
&acirc;nmh-workers&acirc; mailing list is put in <br>
# its own folder, if not filed already <br>
To nmh-workers folder ? nmh-workers</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Anything with Unix in the
subject is put into <br>
# the file unix-mail <br>
Subject unix file A unix-mail</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># I don&rsquo;t want to read
mail from Steve, so destroy it <br>
From steve destroy A -</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># Put anything not matched yet
into mailbox <br>
default - file ? mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"># always run rcvtty <br>
* - pipe R /usr/libexec/nmh/rcvtty</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Sub-process environment <br>
When a process is invoked, its environment is: the
user/group-ids are set to recipient&rsquo;s ids; the working
directory is the recipient&rsquo;s home directory; the umask
is 0077; the <br>
process has no /dev/tty; the standard input is set to the
message; the standard output and diagnostic output are set
to /dev/null; all other file-descriptors are closed; the
<br>
environment variables $USER, $HOME, $SHELL are set
appropriately, and no other environment variables exist.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The process is given a certain
amount of time to execute. If the process does not exit
within this limit, the process will be terminated with
extreme prejudice. The amount of <br>
time is calculated as ((size / 60) + 300) seconds, where
size is the number of bytes in the message (with 30 minutes
the maximum time allowed).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The exit status of the process
is consulted in determining the success of the action. An
exit status of zero means that the action succeeded. Any
other exit status (or abnormal <br>
termination) means that the action failed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In order to avoid any time
limitations, you might implement a process that began by
fork()-ing. The parent would return the appropriate value
immediately, and the child could <br>
continue on, doing whatever it wanted for as long as it
wanted. This approach is somewhat risky if the parent is
going to return an exit status of zero. If the parent is
going <br>
to return a non-zero exit status, then this approach can
lead to quicker delivery into your maildrop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">FILES <br>
/etc/nmh/mts.conf nmh mts configuration file <br>
$HOME/.maildelivery The file controlling local delivery <br>
/etc/nmh/maildelivery Rather than the standard file <br>
/var/mail/$USER The default maildrop</p>

mh-format(5)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">DEFAULTS <br>
&lsquo;-noverbose&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;-nosuppressdup&rsquo; <br>
&lsquo;-maildelivery&rsquo; defaults to $HOME/.maildelivery
<br>
&lsquo;-mailbox&rsquo; deaults to /var/mail/$USER <br>
&lsquo;-file&rsquo; defaults to stdin <br>
&lsquo;-user&rsquo; defaults to the current user</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">CONTEXT <br>
None</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">HISTORY <br>
Slocal was originally designed to be backward-compatible
with the maildelivery facility provided by MMDF-II. Thus,
the &acirc;.maildelivery&acirc; file syntax is somewhat
limited. But slo&acirc; <br>
cal has been modified and extended, so that is it no longer
compatible with MMDF-II.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In addition to an exit status of
zero, the MMDF values RP_MOK (32) and RP_OK (9) mean that
the message has been fully delivered. Any other non-zero
exit status, including abnor&acirc; <br>
mal termination, is interpreted as the MMDF value RP_MECH
(200), which means &acirc;use an alternate route&acirc;
(deliver the message to the maildrop).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">BUGS <br>
Only two return codes are meaningful, others should be.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Slocal was originally designed
to be backwards-compatible with the maildelivery
functionality provided by MMDF-II.</p>
