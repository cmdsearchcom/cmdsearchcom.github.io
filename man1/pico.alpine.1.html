<p style="margin-top: 1em">Name <br>
pico - simple text editor in the style of the Alpine
Composer</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Syntax <br>
pico [ options ] [ file ]</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Description <br>
Pico is a simple, display-oriented text editor based on the
Alpine message system composer. As with Alpine, commands are
displayed at the bottom of the screen, and
context-sen&acirc; <br>
sitive help is provided. As characters are typed they are
immediately inserted into the text.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Editing commands are entered
using control-key combinations. As a work-around for
communications programs that swallow certain control
characters, you can emulate a control key <br>
by pressing ESCAPE twice, followed by the desired control
character, e.g. &quot;ESC ESC c&quot; would be equivalent to
entering a ctrl-c. The editor has five basic features:
paragraph <br>
justification, searching, block cut/paste, a spelling
checker, and a file browser.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Paragraph justification (or
filling) takes place in the paragraph that contains the
cursor, or, if the cursor is between lines, in the paragraph
immediately below. Paragraphs <br>
are delimited by blank lines, or by lines beginning with a
space or tab. Unjustification can be done immediately after
justification using the control-U key combination.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">String searches are not
sensitive to case. A search begins at the current cursor
position and wraps around the end of the text. The most
recent search string is offered as the <br>
default in subsequent searches.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Blocks of text can be moved,
copied or deleted with creative use of the command for mark
(ctrl-^), delete (ctrl-k) and undelete (ctrl-u). The delete
command will remove text <br>
between the &quot;mark&quot; and the current cursor
position, and place it in the &quot;cut&quot; buffer. The
undelete command effects a &quot;paste&quot; at the current
cursor position.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The spell checker examines all
words in the text. It then offers, in turn, each misspelled
word for correction while highlighting it in the text. Spell
checking can be can&acirc; <br>
celled at any time. Alternatively, pico will substitute for
the default spell checking routine a routine defined by the
SPELL environment variable. The replacement routine <br>
should read standard input and write standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The file browser is offered as
an option in the &quot;Read File&quot; and &quot;Write
Out&quot; command prompts. It is intended to help in
searching for specific files and navigating directory <br>
hierarchies. Filenames with sizes and names of directories
in the current working directory are presented for
selection. The current working directory is displayed on the
top <br>
line of the display while the list of available commands
takes up the bottom two. Several basic file manipulation
functions are supported: file renaming, copying, and
deletion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">More specific help is available
in pico&rsquo;s online help.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Options <br>
+n Causes pico to be started with the cursor located n lines
into the file. (Note: no space between &quot;+&quot; sign
and number)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-a Display all files including
those beginning with a period (.).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-b Enable the option to Replace
text matches found using the &quot;Where is&quot; command.
This now does nothing. Instead, the option is always turned
on (as if the -b flag had been <br>
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-d Rebind the &quot;delete&quot;
key so the character the cursor is on is rubbed out rather
than the character to its left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-e Enable file name
completion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-f Use function keys for
commands. This option supported only in conjunction with UW
Enhanced NCSA telnet.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-h List valid command line
options.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-j Enable &quot;Goto&quot;
command in the file browser. This enables the command to
permit explicitly telling pilot which directory to
visit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-g Enable &quot;Show
Cursor&quot; mode in file browser. Cause cursor to be
positioned before the current selection rather than placed
at the lower left of the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-k Causes &quot;Cut Text&quot;
command to remove characters from the cursor position to the
end of the line rather than remove the entire line.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-m Enable mouse functionality.
This only works when pico is run from within an X Window
System &quot;xterm&quot; window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-nn The -nn option enables new
mail notification. The n argument is optional, and specifies
how often, in seconds, your mailbox is checked for new mail.
For example, -n60 <br>
causes pico to check for new mail once every minute. The
default interval is 180 seconds, while the minimum allowed
is 30. (Note: no space between &quot;n&quot; and the
number)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-o dir Sets operating directory.
Only files within this directory are accessible. Likewise,
the file browser is limited to the specified directory
subtree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-rn Sets column used to limit
the &quot;Justify&quot; command&rsquo;s right margin</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-s speller <br>
Specify an alternate program spell to use when spell
checking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-t Enable &quot;tool&quot; mode.
Intended for when pico is used as the editor within other
tools (e.g., Elm, Pnews). Pico will not prompt for save on
exit, and will not rename the <br>
buffer during the &quot;Write Out&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-v View the file only,
disallowing any editing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-version <br>
Print Pico version and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-w Disable word wrap (thus allow
editing of long lines).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-x Disable keymenu at the bottom
of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-z Enable ^Z suspension of
pico.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-p Preserve the
&quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; characters, typically
Ctrl-Q and Ctrl-S, which are sometimes used in
communications paths to control data flow between devices
that operate <br>
at different speeds.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-Q quotestr <br>
Set the quote string. Especially useful when composing
email, setting this allows the quote string to be checked
for when Justifying paragraphs. A common quote string is
<br>
&quot;&gt; &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-W word_separators <br>
If characters listed here appear in the middle of a word
surrounded by alphanumeric characters that word is split
into two words. This is used by the Forward and Backward
<br>
word commands and by the spell checker.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-q Termcap or terminfo
definition for input escape sequences are used in preference
to sequences defined by default. This option is only
available if pico was compiled with <br>
the TERMCAP_WINS define turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-setlocale_ctype <br>
Do setlocale(LC_CTYPE) if available. Default is to not do
this setlocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">-no_setlocale_collate <br>
Do not do setlocale(LC_COLLATE). Default is to do this
setlocale.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Lastly, when a running pico is
disconnected (i.e., receives a SIGHUP), pico will save the
current work if needed before exiting. Work is saved under
the current filename with <br>
&quot;.save&quot; appended. If the current work is unnamed,
it is saved under the filename &quot;pico.save&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bugs <br>
The manner in which lines longer than the display width are
dealt is not immediately obvious. Lines that continue beyond
the edge of the display are indicated by a &rsquo;$&rsquo;
character <br>
at the end of the line. Long lines are scrolled horizontally
as the cursor moves through them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Files <br>
pico.save Unnamed interrupted work saved here. <br>
*.save Interrupted work on a named file is saved here.</p>
